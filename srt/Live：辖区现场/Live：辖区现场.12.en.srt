EPISODE 12

3
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,689
Dad, what are you doing?

4
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,274
Dad!

5
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:07,942
Dad.

6
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,611
Dad, don't do that.

7
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:10,987
Dad, stop!

8
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,615
Dad, please. You have the wrong idea.

9
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,706
Is this the police?

10
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,458
Please stop my dad.

11
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,293
He's assaulting someone.

12
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:34,594
<i>Hello? How may I help you?</i>

13
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,525
You. Get lost.

14
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:51,820
You. Tell me.

15
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,740
What's the wrong idea?

16
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,410
I asked him out first.

17
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,747
And I broke up with him.

18
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,125
So my boyfriend...

19
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,170
He's a good guy.

20
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,464
"A good guy"?

21
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,260
Just because I hit the good guy,

22
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:17,971
you tried to report me to the police

23
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,306
and are staring at me
with a burning gaze, you brat?

24
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,650
Son of a bitch.

25
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:46,833
<i>Hello? Did you just
call the police with this phone?</i>

26
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,126
I'm sorry, sir.

27
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,086
There was a misunderstanding.

28
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,390
Please give this to Captain An Jang-mi.

29
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:03,349
Yes, sir.

30
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,650
What happened?

31
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,195
What?

32
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,780
Song-yi called me crying.

33
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,116
She said you are hopeless.

34
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,785
Didn't she tell you
that she reported me to the police?

35
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,424
SONG-YI

36
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,514
Come to my office right away.

37
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,071
About today...

38
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,243
You'll never be able to forget
what happened.

39
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,707
Just like how I still remember
what happened...

40
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,218
at 10:48 p.m.

41
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,639
that day 12 years ago,

42
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,060
you'll never...

43
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,231
forget

44
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,733
what happened today.

45
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,000
You were very brave today.

46
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,005
You called the police at the scene

47
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,215
and you protected your little sister.

48
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,055
If I were you, I wouldn't have
been able to do those things.

49
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,268
But that doesn't mean you're okay.

50
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,689
Because you're acting like a mother
to your sister,

51
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:19,110
you can't even
take care of your wounded heart.

52
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,863
I don't get wounded.

53
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,325
If you're here to catch a criminal,
you're mistaken.

54
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,410
We can worry about
catching the criminal later.

55
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:29,871
I...

56
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,875
want you and your sister

57
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,627
to take the emergency contraceptive pills

58
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:41,090
so there won't be collateral damage.

59
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,014
I just want to tell you

60
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,350
that everything is the culprit's fault.

61
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,072
"Of all the paths,

62
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,201
why did I choose the mountain path

63
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,787
to go to the library with my sister?

64
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,667
Why did I not resist harder?

65
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,003
Why am I so weak?

66
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,757
Why aren't I

67
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,801
strong enough to protect

68
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,178
my sister and myself?"

69
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,811
Just like I hated myself,
instead of the culprit,

70
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:40,149
for choosing that route 12 years ago,

71
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,363
for the rest of your life,

72
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,951
you'll find a lot of reasons
to blame yourself for what happened.

73
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,289
But you have to remember this.

74
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,918
None of this

75
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,296
is your fault.

76
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,674
It's the culprit's.

77
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,429
I didn't think I could sleep,
so I patrolled the neighborhood.

78
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,725
How is Kyeong-jin doing?

79
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,143
Is she refusing to talk?

80
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,982
I understand.
She wouldn't want to say anything now.

81
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,948
KYEONG-JIN

82
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,327
Hello?

83
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:19,040
<i>Please get the emergency contraceptive
pills for me and my sister.</i>

84
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:24,921
Earlier, you told me...

85
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:27,924
<i>that the center offers</i>

86
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,218
<i>emergency contraceptive pills.</i>

87
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:34,764
I'll give you

88
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,727
the school uniform I wore
when I went to the mountain right now.

89
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,401
<i>So please...</i>

90
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,739
get the emergency contraceptive pills

91
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,950
for me and my sister.

92
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,163
I heard from Detective Jang
that this is a serial case.

93
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,499
-<i>I took a bath,</i>
-He uses condoms.

94
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,544
-<i>so I didn't do our mouths.</i>
-They should still take it to be safe.

95
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,003
<i>But I did as I was told</i>

96
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,421
You're right.

97
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,382
<i>and used cotton swabs</i>

98
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,551
<i>and got samples from
our genitals and anuses.</i>

99
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,140
I don't want to get pregnant.

100
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,268
Please help us.

101
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,526
Where are you going at this hour?

102
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,821
-I'll be out shortly.
-Are you out of your mind?

103
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,573
-Why are you going out?
-Let go!

104
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,200
You bitch... Get back here.

105
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,953
-I'll teach you a lesson.
-Don't do that to Kyeong-jin.

106
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,206
-Gosh! No...
-Look.

107
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,083
You bitch.

108
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,918
-Hey, how dare you!
-No...

109
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,253
Don't hit Mom!

110
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,716
What are you going to do if I hit her?

111
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,426
Don't be like this.

112
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,470
Don't touch Kyeong-mi.
Please don't touch her!

113
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,555
These women drive me nuts.

114
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,310
-Please...
-Hey.

115
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,270
Come here.

116
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,691
I told you to stop hitting her!

117
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,242
Hey.

118
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,662
Why are you stepping backward?

119
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:22,955
Answer me.

120
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,791
-Why?
-Don't do that, please.

121
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,044
-Stop!
-How dare you scream!

122
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,235
I'll get us a cab to the station.

123
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,619
I'll summarize what you just told me.

124
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,704
He was a handspan taller than you,

125
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,998
which means he should be just under 180cm.

126
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,708
He has fair skin, and he's slim.

127
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,711
He had short hair like a soldier,
and his eyes are quite small.

128
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,964
He was wearing a black baseball hat
and blue hiking clothes.

129
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:15,633
Is that all you know?

130
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,761
When I was trying to fight him off,

131
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,097
<i>I hit his baseball cap, and it fell off.</i>

132
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,934
And I noticed that his ears
were folded in a weird way.

133
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:27,853
They were folded?

134
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,232
Did they...

135
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,068
look like dumplings?

136
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:36,695
Yes.

137
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,617
But I couldn't see his nose and mouth
because he was wearing a yellow buff.

138
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,497
I have to get back now.

139
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,165
That's everything I know.

140
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:52,461
Please get emergency contraceptive pills
for me and Kyeong-mi.

141
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,551
Oh, right.
That bastard also took our name tags.

142
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,512
Jeong-o!

143
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:02,638
I got us a taxi.

144
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,144
He took Kyeong-jin and Kyeong-mi's
name tags too.

145
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:09,687
Son of a bitch.

146
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,092
I heard everything you said,

147
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:43,345
but I still don't know
what your dad did wrong.

148
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,346
Mom.

149
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,265
How can you take his side?

150
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:47,850
Is he a gangster or something?

151
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,643
He didn't even ask me what was going on.

152
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,229
He just started punching him
out of the blue.

153
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,357
Why assume that he was trying to
sexually assault me?

154
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,442
He didn't just assume.

155
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,611
Your dad had a reason.

156
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,155
You were in a closed car with him.

157
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,073
You clearly said no to him,

158
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:07,036
but you said he pushed you down
inside the car and kissed you.

159
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,497
What dad would do nothing
after seeing that?

160
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,664
But he's a cop--

161
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,083
He's your dad before he's a cop, you brat!

162
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,545
He could've at least asked me
what was going on and if I was okay.

163
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,131
It's wrong to just beat up
someone like that.

164
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,591
Try working in this field!

165
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,096
Earlier today, both your dad and I

166
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,224
visited a scene

167
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,768
where two sisters,
14-year-old and 17-year-old girls,

168
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,645
were raped together.

169
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,147
Two days ago and a week ago too.

170
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,692
And even now,
when most people would be asleep,

171
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,110
another brutal...

172
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,951
Your dad and I witness these things
on a daily basis.

173
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,161
How can we just blindly trust
that our daughter

174
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,705
would always be safe?
It's crazy to think that way.

175
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,876
How dare you call the police
to report your own dad.

176
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,129
That was very thoughtless of you.

177
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,050
Call me when you get home.

178
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:04,677
Captain An.

179
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,846
We got evidence
for the Mount Somyeong case.

180
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:24,113
You should be in bed.
Why are you making a kite this late?

181
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,242
Are you trying to make 100 kites

182
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,327
so that you can wear them and fly away?

183
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,181
Dad.

184
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,184
Do you want to have <i>makgeolli</i> with me?

185
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,298
I have something to say.

186
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,425
You should hear it.

187
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:28,802
What is it?

188
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:51,617
Jang-mi...

189
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,663
suggested taking Mom off the ventilator.

190
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,212
There's a thing called death with dignity.

191
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,674
It's legal,
and doctors can carry it out for patients.

192
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,310
Don't do it if you don't want to.

193
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,355
We've been living like this
for a long time anyway.

194
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,649
Don't do it if you're not sure.

195
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,567
You said Mom is suffering.

196
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,577
Drink up.

197
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,385
You see,

198
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,849
I think it's my filial duty
to make sure she stays alive,

199
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,684
but if both you

200
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,978
and Jang-mi, who's wise,

201
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,442
don't agree with me,
then you two are probably right.

202
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,987
I must be wrong.

203
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,451
Just give me a few days.

204
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,953
I need to prepare myself mentally.

205
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:21,790
And...

206
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,585
I'm sorry

207
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,380
about the other day.

208
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,718
For smashing the TV like that.

209
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,431
Song-yi and Dae-gwan don't respect me

210
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,892
because I'm rude to you all the time.

211
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:43,771
I'm sorry.

212
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,869
Why do Song-yi and Dae-gwan

213
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,621
disrespect you?

214
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,956
They probably learned it from me.

215
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,708
Cut the crap.

216
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,169
They should be as thoughtful as you are.

217
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,507
You have resentment toward me

218
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,968
because I used to beat you and your mom
whenever I got drunk back in the days.

219
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,555
Did you beat up
Jang-mi and your kids like I did?

220
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,683
Those spoiled brats.

221
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,579
I just don't understand myself.

222
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,793
How come I'm not affected by
what happened that day?

223
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,008
I've really moved on.

224
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,805
I still remember
the date and time of when it happened,

225
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,684
but most of the time
I laugh and enjoy myself

226
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:04,977
as though nothing happened.

227
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,815
I still want a healthy relationship

228
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,527
and date boys for fun.

229
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,487
Good for you.

230
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,407
So what's the issue?

231
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:20,868
What's wrong with being normal?

232
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:22,911
In books,

233
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,414
it says that

234
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,666
normal people

235
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,336
-are usually traumatized--
-Must you be traumatized?

236
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,883
On top of being assaulted,

237
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,885
do you have to be miserable too?

238
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,182
I think that's just a prejudice.

239
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,393
Just keep it simple.

240
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,564
You only think of it
as something that happened.

241
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,025
An incident happened,

242
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,943
and you're not the one to blame.

243
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,112
Time passed,

244
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,657
and you became a cop.

245
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:05,913
Still,

246
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,042
it gets to me at times.

247
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,712
That's perfectly normal.

248
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,174
Whether you're bothered by it
daily or on occasion.

249
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:20,177
whether you're traumatized or not,

250
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:21,845
don't you think

251
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,431
they're all normal responses?

252
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,643
It would be weirder if everyone

253
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:28,769
responded the same way.

254
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,365
You're right.

255
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,451
I guess I'm perfectly normal then.

256
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,748
When I go to a scene,

257
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,667
I ask myself

258
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,752
if I even have emotions.

259
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,130
Why aren't I afraid

260
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,718
when I come across a case
that's similar to mine?

261
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:06,723
I questioned my state of mind
thinking that

262
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,642
it was abnormal.

263
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,689
I guess I just was able to move on well.

264
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,865
I'm curious though.

265
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,493
Don't you ever have doubts about this job

266
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,830
when you come across these cases often?

267
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,623
Don't you wonder
why this world is like this?

268
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,711
How do you cope with it?

269
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,973
To be honest,

270
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,058
I haven't

271
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,897
been able to rise above it.

272
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,525
It still kills me inside.

273
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,201
Captain An,
I handed over all the evidence.

274
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,705
After hearing Kyeong-jin's
statement on Jeong-o's phone,

275
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:14,041
Detective Jang said
it was enough for a composite sketch.

276
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,167
Good job.

277
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:29,848
Wait for me.

278
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,021
Two years ago,

279
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:37,898
she was raped

280
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,192
near Mount Somyeong
by a condom-wearing assailant.

281
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,945
She didn't report it at the time,
but told her mom about it a year later.

282
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,239
Thanks to her family's support,

283
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,617
she was able to deal with her trauma.

284
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,744
However, on her way home tonight,

285
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,996
she was attacked again near Mount Baekun.

286
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,166
Did the culprit use a mat
and take her name tag back then?

287
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,501
Yes.

288
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,044
Taking their name tags is a warning.

289
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,629
It tells them that he knows them,

290
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,964
so they shouldn't try to report it
to the authorities.

291
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:06,259
It's also his way of saying
that he'll find them again.

292
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,021
Two strikes in one day.
Three victims in total.

293
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:19,815
This is such a mess.

294
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:35,914
The 112 emergency report app was opened
on the victim's phone.

295
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,624
While being raped,

296
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:40,418
she was trying to call it in
using the app and was killed for it.

297
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,963
She was found quickly
because of it though.

298
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,801
Get ready to form a task force.

299
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:50,887
Report it and hold a committee meeting
tomorrow to start an open investigation.

300
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,183
Yes, Detective Cho.

301
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,436
Right. What?

302
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,064
Sure, I'll be right there.

303
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:05,902
Kyeong-jin and Kyeong-mi's mother
was arrested for attempted murder.

304
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:07,445
It was reported by Kyeong-jin.

305
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,365
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

306
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:17,122
Chief, I see you're still up.

307
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,000
You will be notified
by the Public Safety Division tomorrow,

308
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,127
but let's work on
the Mahyeon Rape Case together.

309
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,379
A girl died tonight.

310
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,090
Shit. This is insane.

311
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,300
Where?

312
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,011
-Chief.
-Right.

313
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,680
Did you get Jong-min's emergency text too?

314
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:34,681
What's going on?

315
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,391
I came because I was asked.

316
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,102
-Damn it.
-Okay, Captain An.

317
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:42,814
Take Yang-chon for your task force.

318
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:47,194
-Chief, what's going on?
-Come on.

319
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,122
BABY OF AN SO-MI AND BAN JONG-MIN

320
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,666
Kiddo, it's me.

321
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,876
Open your eyes.

322
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,962
These guys are all here to see you,

323
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,088
so open your eyes.

324
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,215
Go on.

325
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,800
He's cuter with his eyes open.

326
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,177
Peek-a-boo!

327
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,722
-Isn't he adorable?
-You're unbelievable.

328
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:21,019
Yes, sir.
I texted you that it wasn't an emergency.

329
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,730
Jong-min just had his baby,

330
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:26,066
so he just bragged
using our emergency chatroom.

331
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,778
No, nothing bad happened.

332
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:30,862
It's a boy.

333
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,449
Sure. Go back to sleep then.

334
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,118
Captain Eun sends his regards.

335
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,663
Lieutenant Oh called,
so I told him not to come.

336
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,749
What about Nam-il?
Has he even texted back?

337
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:45,418
We already know that he's a prick.

338
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:50,131
-My goodness.
-How are you a human being?

339
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,384
He's a fairy and an angel.

340
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,554
You're right.

341
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,225
His beauty is astonishing.

342
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,561
How's your wife?

343
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,898
She ate right after giving birth

344
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,317
and even farted. She's doing great.

345
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:12,028
By the way, I'm taking this week off.

346
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:15,031
Don't call no matter what the case is.

347
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,077
Okay.

348
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:20,829
Anyway, I'll get going.

349
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,165
Peek-a-boo!

350
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,211
Congratulations.

351
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,840
Still, don't text the emergency chatroom
for no reason.

352
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,300
My heart nearly dropped.

353
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:36,511
It's my first kid in seven years.
Cut me some slack.

354
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,431
I'll get going now.

355
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,933
-Good night, sir.
-You too.

356
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:48,231
You should be glad
that he doesn't look like you.

357
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:56,281
While someone grows old,

358
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,575
someone is born.

359
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:01,161
Someone will get sick,

360
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,872
and someone will die,

361
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,082
but new lives will still be born.

362
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,043
Sam-bo,

363
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:10,295
what is life anyway?

364
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:14,090
Who died and who's sick?

365
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,968
There was another rape case,

366
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,845
but she died this time.

367
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,305
The one who's sick

368
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,057
is me.

369
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:24,893
Sam-bo,

370
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,853
isn't Jong-min's baby adorable?

371
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,480
I feel rejuvenated

372
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,982
just looking at his face.

373
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,278
Chief.

374
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,613
Chief!

375
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,325
How did you persuade Kyeong-jin to talk?

376
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,080
I sympathized with her.

377
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,461
Woman to woman.

378
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:58,468
You seem eager to solve this case.

379
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:02,389
It seems you're more eager about this case
in comparison to others.

380
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,349
What's your reason?

381
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,018
Do I need one?

382
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:11,106
Young girls were assaulted.
Any human would be furious.

383
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:17,028
I finally know why Yang-chon
sticks his neck out for this job.

384
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:21,408
I get why he emphasized
sense of duty at the academy.

385
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,076
I get it now.

386
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:30,291
Aren't you coming?

387
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,545
What is

388
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,005
a sense of duty?

389
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:41,261
Not wanting to see
what happened today ever again.

390
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,265
I may be a rookie who knows nothing,

391
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,642
but I want to contribute to
catching the criminal.

392
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:50,645
So that

393
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,982
no more kids have to get hurt.

394
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:03,283
The order doesn't seem right,
but I'm glad I became a cop.

395
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,534
All of a sudden.

396
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:09,706
Let's go.

397
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:20,300
<i>Are you asleep? Call me if you aren't.</i>

398
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:29,893
Sang-su, let's hold hands.

399
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,526
What's this about?

400
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,278
I just wanted to.

401
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:42,947
It's that kind of a day.

402
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:49,329
Okay.

403
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:52,290
I'll just think of it as
that kind of a day.

404
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,669
I won't wonder if you started to like me.

405
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:00,340
Just don't pull away.

406
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:17,106
KYEONG-JIN

407
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,860
What is it, Kyeong-jin?

408
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:23,238
<i>My dad tried to hit Kyeong-mi.</i>

409
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,365
<i>My mom</i>

410
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,700
<i>had no choice.</i>

411
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,203
<i>Help us, Jeong-o.</i>

412
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,412
What are you saying?

413
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,040
Kyeong-jin. Kyeong-jin.

414
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,240
These were taken by the camera

415
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,325
above the public toilet
close to where the sisters

416
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,368
were raped two days ago.

417
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,372
Sorry I'm late.

418
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:17,083
Introduce yourself later.

419
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,003
After the victim called,

420
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,422
the camera caught 17 possible suspects.

421
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:24,090
Only one wore a blue jacket and

422
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:25,884
yellow buff that matches the statement.

423
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,010
He's our strongest suspect.

424
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,722
The court issued a warrant yesterday
and distributed it to all provinces.

425
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,515
We're checking the local phone towers

426
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,475
for call records during the time,

427
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,727
but it'll take a while.

428
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:39,314
That's strange. I know the area well.

429
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,399
Only one trail connects
the bus stop and toilet.

430
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,235
There's a camera near the bus stop,

431
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,904
but if this is the only footage,

432
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,406
that means the suspect

433
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,866
wasn't caught near the bus stop.

434
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,869
No one found footprints
leading up to the trail.

435
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,205
He can't fly or go underground.

436
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,291
YELLOW BUFF, BLUE JACKET

437
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,627
We're from Criminal Affairs.

438
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:06,215
What's odd is that the footprints
we found at the scenes...

439
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,800
are all different sizes.

440
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,720
In order of occurrence,
when the first case happened,

441
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,722
it rained, so the footprints were erased.

442
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:13,973
For the second case,

443
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,725
the rape of the 14-year-old,

444
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,602
the shoe is a size 295mm.

445
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:20,730
When the sisters were attacked,
the criminal wore 280mm.

446
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:23,441
That night, the rape and murder case.

447
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,985
The shoe was 270mm, yet another size.

448
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,363
We could have many perpetrators.

449
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,156
So, during each the attack,

450
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:33,242
the perp used a condom and a mat,
and took their name tags,

451
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,244
but the footprints
are all different sizes?

452
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,164
What is this?

453
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,249
The gait's the same.

454
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,419
Did Forensics send
the report on the criminal's gait?

455
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,713
The right heel dug deep

456
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,298
in all cases.

457
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,802
We could have
multiple perpetrators or just one.

458
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,596
It's his trick to confuse us.

459
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:55,932
Of course, this is a guess.

460
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:57,475
What proof do you have other than

461
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,727
the footprint analysis to back that up?

462
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,271
The photo taken by the camera.

463
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,275
His backpack.

464
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:10,154
The 14-year-old victim
of the second case said

465
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:11,823
he had a backpack.

466
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,449
Based on the size,

467
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,618
it doesn't just contain a map.

468
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:18,955
It could contain shoes
and a change of clothes.

469
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:20,581
It's quite likely.

470
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,459
Then he wasn't caught by
the bus stop camera because...

471
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:26,045
What if he changed in the public toilet?

472
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,047
It's not that he wasn't caught,

473
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,550
but we may have missed him
because he'd changed.

474
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,178
If you don't have anything
to refute my theory,

475
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:37,932
let's approach this case
assuming it's the same guy.

476
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,810
Did you get anything off the clothes

477
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,020
Officer Han Jeong-o brought?

478
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:44,856
There was something
we suspect to be the suspect's sweat.

479
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,276
We got DNA off it,
but it wasn't in the criminal database.

480
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,154
We only have geographical profiling
to go on.

481
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:54,115
He attacks on Mount Baekun
and Mount Somyeong.

482
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,825
There's a library nearby,

483
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,660
so it's likely he's a local who knows

484
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,328
the roads schoolgirls take.

485
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,456
I have to leave on another case.

486
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,958
Summarize the results of
the meeting for me.

487
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,383
This is the composite we got yesterday.

488
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,093
He's in his early 30s.

489
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:18,139
He's very thin and 175 to 180cm tall.

490
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,516
His ears are folded like dumplings.

491
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,977
Based on his gait and shape of ears,

492
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,188
he likely trained in
a grappling type of sport

493
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,523
like judo, jiu-jitsu or wrestling.

494
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:31,486
Oh Yang-chon was transferred temporarily
to work on the Mahyeon rapes and murder

495
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,530
that happened on
Mounts Baekun and Somyeong.

496
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,948
-Bye.
-Good job.

497
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,158
We're going home.

498
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,117
-Bye.
-Bye.

499
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,496
Until the perpetrator is caught,

500
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,623
he'll report to Mahyeon Police Station.

501
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,249
Until he returns,

502
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,585
Yeom Sang-su will join
Choi Myeong-ho's team.

503
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:48,795
Move as a trio.

504
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,089
-Do you want to swap?
-From now on...

505
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,508
-I don't mind.
-You're all going to

506
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,718
focus on rapes and murders.

507
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,178
Stay alert for rape cases

508
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,764
when you're on duty
but also when you're off.

509
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:03,601
I'd like you to actively volunteer
to work extra shifts, okay?

510
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,436
It's not mandatory.

511
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,438
Let's make it mandatory.

512
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,148
Yes, it should be.

513
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,235
If we make it voluntary,
Nam-il and Seung-jae

514
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,112
will just hand out parking tickets

515
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,114
-and won't volunteer.
-I'm not like that.

516
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,616
How many tickets did you issue last week?

517
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,284
-A lot, right?
-Answer him.

518
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,037
I'll stop doing that.

519
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,914
Do you come to work just for the pay?

520
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,999
I'll focus on cases while I'm on duty,

521
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,626
but I can't when I'm off the clock.

522
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,753
And I can't volunteer for extra shifts.

523
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,297
Do you see how he's
planning to slack off already?

524
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:34,590
Damn you.

525
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,592
I'm sure he has a good reason.

526
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,094
He works hard these days.

527
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:40,429
Why weren't you at the scene
when I got attacked?

528
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:41,973
He was looking for a lost kid.

529
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:43,724
-Voluntarily.
-Leave it.

530
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,686
Yes.

531
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,396
I slack off.

532
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,190
So what?

533
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,318
Did I break a rule or something?

534
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,320
Can't cops have a life?

535
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,614
Why force us to work on our down time?

536
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,700
Voluntary means we do it if we want to!

537
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:03,202
It's illegal to volunteer
more than four times a month!

538
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,621
So did you volunteer four times
this month?

539
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,540
Are you mocking me
because I'm retiring soon?

540
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:10,084
-Why are you bring that up here?
-Listen up, you punk!

541
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,713
Do you think you'll never grow old
and be a cop forever?

542
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,757
You'll grow old and retire too.

543
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,301
Sam-bo.

544
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:19,260
Focus, everyone.

545
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,721
Jong-min sent out an emergency message.

546
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:24,223
Why did you ignore it?
What if it was an emergency?

547
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,683
Why didn't you read it?

548
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:26,851
Will you stop?

549
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:31,898
I told you a murdering rapist is
in our neighborhood.

550
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,649
What the hell are you doing?

551
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,026
All of you!

552
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,945
An evil bastard

553
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,531
is picking on schoolgirls and raping them.

554
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,534
As if that's not enough,
he sexually assaulted two sisters at once.

555
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,495
Two days ago, he raped and killed a girl.

556
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,414
It's not nothing!

557
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:50,917
Just because your families are safe

558
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,627
doesn't make it okay!

559
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,881
If that's how you think,
return your handcuffs

560
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,674
and quit serving in the force!

561
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,137
Kang Nam-il.

562
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,514
As you said, whether you volunteer or not

563
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,225
is up to you.

564
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,810
But your performance rating

565
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,854
is up to me and the chief.

566
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,942
Instead of handing out parking tickets,
patrol once more.

567
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,027
You stop too, Lieutenant Lee.

568
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,697
You're retiring soon,
so we know you're sensitive.

569
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,241
We all understand that,

570
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,743
but enough is enough.

571
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:27,620
Jeez.

572
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,332
I'm going on patrol, sir.

573
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:37,880
Finish up the meeting.

574
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,555
Jeong-o

575
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:50,768
is at a shelter with the sisters
involved in the attempted murder case.

576
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:54,563
Sergeant Kang,
work with Lieutenant Lee as a trio.

577
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,190
Sergeant Ban is on vacation,

578
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,193
-so we need Won-u in the situation room.
-Yes, sir.

579
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,195
We'll focus on cases
in the area until we get

580
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,572
the wanted posters
for the murder-rape suspect. That's it.

581
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:07,743
-Thank you.
-Hey, Nam-il.

582
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:09,161
Nam-il.

583
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,258
Captain Eun.

584
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,219
About the victim
of the attempted murder case...

585
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,138
The mom did it alone, right?

586
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,140
I heard the girls weren't involved.

587
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,935
Considering the timeframe of the incident,

588
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,688
the older sister called it in
after she met Jeong-o,

589
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,273
so she couldn't have been involved.

590
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,110
But her sister might have been.

591
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:44,780
The mom and the older sister

592
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,283
said that she was asleep.

593
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,661
We're going through all evidence now,

594
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,747
so we'll have the results soon.

595
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,624
-Get back to work.
-Yes, sir.

596
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:18,230
What's wrong? You don't want coffee?

597
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:20,900
I want to live a long life.

598
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:23,444
What are you talking about?

599
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,072
What? Are you brimming
with zeal for life because of

600
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,990
your daughter's wedding?

601
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,868
Gyeong-mo.

602
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,496
You should be the chief here.

603
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,459
No, thanks.

604
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,754
I'm going to take the promotion exam
and go back to the agency.

605
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,925
I'm also sick of this crime-ridden area.

606
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:47,718
You know.

607
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,471
My smart parents,
who are retired professors,

608
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,724
and my brothers, who are judges
and diplomats, all look down on me.

609
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,685
I'm going to leave this place.

610
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,730
Then who's going to keep
this place together?

611
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,068
I think I need to leave
as soon as possible

612
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,238
to live even a little longer.

613
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,407
What?

614
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,659
Where will you go if you leave here?

615
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,161
You wanted to be a chief,

616
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,580
and you always told me how important
the patrol division is.

617
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,833
Myeong-ho, I, and other guys
were doing fine

618
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,627
at the agency and Criminal Affairs,
but you brought us here.

619
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,712
And now, you're going to leave alone?

620
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,798
What the hell?

621
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,592
You called me selfish
when I said I didn't want to come.

622
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,344
Why are you being so selfish now?

623
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,596
Grow old and die here.

624
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:50,948
Lieutenant Lee is very sensitive
because he's retiring soon.

625
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:51,991
Try to understand.

626
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,827
Do you want to swap with me?

627
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:56,704
Don't bother.

628
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:00,583
You should've at least called
when you got Jong-min's message.

629
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,586
You got scolded like that
because you didn't even call.

630
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,673
We must respond to all emergency messages.

631
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,550
It's the most important rule.

632
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,137
Hey, Nam-il.

633
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,723
Dude, seriously...

634
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:22,980
What's this sound?

635
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:30,446
-This is Sergeant Kang Nam-il's phone--
<i>-Is this 365 Pizza?</i>

636
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,449
-A pizza place?
-A wrong number, I guess.

637
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:36,494
<i>You called last night
about your broken oven.</i>

638
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,748
Yes.

639
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,501
I called about the broken oven.

640
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,961
Call the same number
but with seven as the last digit.

641
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,546
A woman will answer.

642
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:57,848
What was that about?

643
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,819
This one should go here.

644
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,574
The other cop told me

645
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,119
that the suspect used a condom.

646
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,040
But I'm still worried.

647
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:24,833
What if I'm pregnant?

648
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,462
Both you and your sister took

649
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,464
emergency contraceptive pills.

650
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:31,715
Don't worry.

651
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,594
Didn't we take the pills too late?

652
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,014
It's fine if you take it within 72 hours.

653
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:41,934
Oh, right.

654
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,687
Your dad is fine.

655
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,941
Calling the police about it
was the right thing to do.

656
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:52,027
Both for your mom and your sakes.

657
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:57,533
Kyeong-mi doesn't know anything
because she was asleep.

658
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,327
My dad is lying.

659
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:03,706
He passed out as soon as he got hit.

660
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,335
It doesn't make sense that Kyeong-mi

661
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,629
would try to harm him with my mom.

662
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:20,431
You found another one.

663
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:27,563
Yes, Captain An.

664
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:45,748
<i>Forensics examined the duct tape
the dad was tied with,</i>

665
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,916
<i>and they confirmed
that Kyeong-mi helped her mom</i>

666
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,461
<i>when she was tying him up.</i>

667
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,922
Kyeong-mi's saliva was found on the tape

668
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,674
around his ankle.

669
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:56,717
They found her DNA too.

670
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:00,220
She probably cut the duct tape
with her teeth

671
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,139
<i>when she was tying his ankles with it.</i>

672
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,603
But Kyeong-mi is legally 13,

673
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,481
which means she's protected by the law.

674
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,024
Her dad

675
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,693
abused her mom often,

676
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:16,945
and he even

677
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,989
hit the girls occasionally.

678
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,661
Captain An.

679
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:26,121
Please...

680
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,331
help the girls.

681
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:31,251
Just know that I'm doing my very best
like you.

682
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:34,546
Oh, right.

683
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:37,549
Kyeong-jin told me this morning

684
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,344
that she smelled

685
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,139
an odd fruit scent
from the suspect's mouth.

686
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,267
"A fruit scent"?

687
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:51,146
What?

688
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,731
Why can't I see my daughters?

689
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:55,192
I can't see my wife
because she's locked up now,

690
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,569
but I'm those girls' dad.
Why can't I see my own children?

691
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:00,948
Bring them now, you bitch.

692
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,124
You're not allowed to see
your daughters, sir.

693
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:11,917
Not just for a few days.

694
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:13,877
Maybe for a very long time.

695
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:15,712
What?

696
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,013
I've put in a request
for a temporary measure

697
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,349
and used my authority to get
an emergency temporary measure

698
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,309
issued to keep you away from them.

699
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,354
It means that

700
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,981
you cannot return to your house

701
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,567
where your daughters are
for the time being.

702
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:38,777
You also cannot go anywhere near them,

703
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:41,864
and you're not even allowed to call them.

704
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:45,075
If court accepts my request
for a temporary measure,

705
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,828
you can be detained
in a medical institution

706
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,288
or at a detention center.

707
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:51,081
What? "A detention center"?

708
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:54,793
A detention center?

709
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,420
Why do I have to get locked up there?

710
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,672
Who are you to send me
to a detention center?

711
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:00,215
Hey, who do you think you are?

712
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,009
I know that you're a cop, but so what?

713
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,678
My wife and my daughter tried to kill me.

714
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:06,638
Why do I have to get locked up?

715
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,682
Those two need to be
put behind bars if anything.

716
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,392
Why do I have to end up in jail?

717
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:15,814
It's because

718
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:18,358
physically abusing your family,
your wife and daughters,

719
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:22,070
is as serious of a crime
as attempted murder.

720
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:24,781
Your daughter will be punished too.

721
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:27,534
But if the fact that she's been
witnessing your abuse

722
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,621
toward her mom for years
is considered a mitigating factor,

723
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:33,373
she'll just be put under protection

724
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:36,627
because she's still considered
a young offender.

725
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,170
As for your wife...

726
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,631
She'll probably get probation,

727
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:43,217
but she may receive
a short prison sentence.

728
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,928
I think that's fair.

729
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:49,723
<i>While she couldn't even
protect her young daughters,</i>

730
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:52,100
<i>she also tolerated</i>

731
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,894
<i>and put up with all of your abuse.</i>

732
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,230
<i>To me, that's unforgivable.</i>

733
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:58,899
I get that she's afraid of you,

734
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:01,985
but the girls got raped that day.

735
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:04,321
The police tried to persuade her,

736
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:07,366
but she refused to send the girls
to a safe shelter.

737
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:09,159
Instead, she chose to

738
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:12,788
go home where their abusive father is.

739
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:13,747
Wait.

740
00:47:14,831 --> 00:47:15,791
Hold on.

741
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:18,919
Come again?

742
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,672
What did you say happened to my girls?

743
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:25,217
They were raped.

744
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,428
Both Kyeong-jin and Kyeong-mi.

745
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:33,392
I'm informing you because
even an unworthy parent is still a parent.

746
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:36,979
We're investigating the case.

747
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,272
Take care, sir.

748
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,655
<i>We've distributed the APB.</i>

749
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:48,365
Have you summarized what was discussed?

750
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,325
The local patrol division

751
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:51,994
will focus on

752
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:54,997
distributing the APB
and canvassing the mountain area.

753
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:57,249
Criminal Affairs, Detectives Jang and Cho

754
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:59,126
will question sports associations

755
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,295
that have athletes
who uses a grappling type of sport

756
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:03,213
to look for a suspect
with ears like dumplings.

757
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,757
<i>They will compare the composite sketch</i>

758
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:08,218
<i>to suspects in Mahyeon-gu,
Sanghyeong-gu, and Jangdong-gu</i>

759
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,262
<i>near Mount Baekun and Mount Somyeong.</i>

760
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:12,389
Most associations
keep a profile on athletes.

761
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:15,434
Prioritize those that quit due to
physical reasons in the last 2 to 3 years,

762
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:18,478
which is around the time
of the first assault.

763
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:21,690
Of course. The suspect
targeted vulnerable school girls,

764
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:23,859
and we know that he's pale and skinny.

765
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:26,194
Try focusing on those with

766
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:29,239
<i>diabetes or any other internal diseases.</i>

767
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:31,617
<i>Kyeong-jin told Jeong-o this morning</i>

768
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:33,285
-<i>that his breath was--</i>
-Really?

769
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:35,245
Did it smell like acetone or fruits?

770
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,580
Fruits.

771
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,457
Okay.

772
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:42,252
I'll tell them to consider hospitals while
handing out fliers and investigating.

773
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:45,422
I just got the list of stores that sell
the hiking boots worn by the suspect,

774
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:46,882
<i>so I'll investigate that.</i>

775
00:48:57,517 --> 00:49:01,229
SONG-YI

776
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:04,358
I'm busy.

777
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:18,664
This is to those

778
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,458
distributing fliers of
the rape and murder case suspect.

779
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,669
<i>Post them where there are a lot of people</i>

780
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:26,296
<i>such as internet cafes, malls, and motels.</i>

781
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,006
<i>Remember where you posted them</i>

782
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,634
<i>so we can take them down later</i>

783
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,469
-<i>to protect human rights.</i>
-Hurry up.

784
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:34,554
<i>Just like the task force ordered,</i>

785
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:38,100
<i>we'll open the search to
the schools, hospitals, and pharmacies</i>

786
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:40,811
<i>he's most likely to appear at.
We must not miss a single area.</i>

787
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:43,313
Nam-il, you drive.

788
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,067
Get in the back.

789
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,904
<i>Byeonseong and Ujeong Patrol Divisions</i>

790
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,823
<i>are aiding
the Jaeryang Fitness Center fire.</i>

791
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:55,200
Our patrol division is in charge
of distributing the fliers.

792
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:56,868
Cover as many locations as possible.

793
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:00,539
This is the patrol division.

794
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,501
Are you calling us with a tip?

795
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,420
Where did you see him?

796
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:08,463
This is the patrol division.

797
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:12,884
Calling in a false tip

798
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:15,262
or repeatedly filing a false report

799
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:20,100
can be punished by law
for obstruction of justice--

800
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,602
Now that the fliers have been distributed,

801
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,688
tips are being called in.

802
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:27,399
Don't be disappointed and keep going.

It's 16, Hongil 5-dong.

808
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:38,493
Most of the tips are probably false,
but you never know.

How long will you live at the store?

823
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:05,872
Honey, please.
My mom promised not to nag you.

824
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:08,333
Honey!

825
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:11,253

Hello.

827
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,175
Good day.

828
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:34,359
I'm with the police.

829
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:36,236

I'm sorry.

but I couldn't get back to you.

837
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:25,911
It's okay.

838
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:27,412
We've all been busy.

839
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:33,001
That reminds me.

The Human Rights Lawyers Association

841
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:37,380
has agreed to represent
Kyeong-mi's mother.

842
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:39,549
I heard from Detective Jang.

843
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,427
Do you want some?

844
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:43,720
No, I don't have an appetite.

While Team Two is on patrol,

848
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:55,815
we can take a break or get some sleep.

849
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:58,735
I'll grab the kimchi.

850
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:15,627
I'll get it.

851
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:42,529

Lieutenant Lee,
that man has an out-toed gait.

00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:25,113
He's of normal-build

00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:26,656
and has long hair.

858
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,158
It's not our guy.

859
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,414
I could take over the wheel.

860
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:37,542
You already drove quite a lot today.

861
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,503
We volunteered for another shift today,

862
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:41,588
but he didn't.

863
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,215
I hate his attitude.

-I'm hungry. Can we get a bite to eat?
-Just put up with it.

868
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:57,103
You're not the only one. We're all hungry.

872
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:13,828
You know the big motel
at the Wooma Intersection.

873
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:15,622
Head there.

874
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:19,084
We'll post up a flier there
and then you can go home, or whatever.

875
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:24,798
WIFE

876
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:28,802
"Wife"?

877
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:30,804
Your wife is calling.

878
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:34,224
Take the call.

879
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,277
What are you doing?

880
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:51,574
I texted you
and told you not to open tonight.

881
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:57,038
When do I ever tell you not to open?

882
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,832
Are you the only one worrying
about the kids?

883
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:00,667
I worry too.

884
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,128
But there's a huge rape case in our area,

885
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:05,713
and he's raping and killing like crazy.

886
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:08,758
You're a mom too.

887
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:10,802
How can you nag me

888
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:14,013
to come help you when kids are dying?

889
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:16,266
You didn't know?

890
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:20,353
Well now you do, so stop calling me!

891
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:22,355
Damn it.

892
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:25,442
What's wrong?

893
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:30,071
My wife's pregnant with our third.

894
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:34,826
She opened a pizza shop
with all our savings to earn more.

895
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:39,581
I always helped her after my shift.

896
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:42,709
Today

897
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:45,170
one of the ovens broke down,

898
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:47,881
and the part-timer quit a few days ago.

899
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,092
Sorry.

900
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:55,972
Whose name is the store in?

901
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,517
An officer isn't allowed multiple jobs,

902
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:02,395
so it's in my wife's name.

903
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:06,441
Good.

904
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:12,655
If it's in her name,
it's not against the rules.

905
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:16,159
Tell your colleagues,
so they don't get the wrong idea.

906
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,496
Don't tell anyone else.

907
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:21,873
Someone will complain that a cop

908
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:23,416
is holding down another job.

909
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,420
-You, keep your mouth shut.
-Yes, sir.

910
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:31,758
I'll drive.

911
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:34,260
If you're not belittling me
because I'm old,

912
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:37,096
post some flyers at Samdong Hospital

913
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:40,892
and motels near Wooma Intersection
and head home.

914
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:49,984
Answer me.

915
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:55,698
Okay.

916
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:57,784
I'll do that.

917
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:34,904
You went too far that day.

918
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,323
Apologize.

919
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:44,455
Just in case,
I kept my window and door unlocked--

920
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:45,915
Don't you know that

921
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,667
the driver can control that?

922
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,503
How does that prove you were safe?

923
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,592
112 EMERGENCY REPORT

924
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:58,469
It's the 112 emergency report app.

925
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:01,973
I had my phone in my hand that night.

926
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,641
Just in case.

927
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:07,520
We weren't in the middle of nowhere.

928
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:10,315
We were in the parking lot
that's full of security cameras.

929
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:14,944
Why did you want to break up with him?

930
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,531
Does it involve your bruised wrist?

931
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:20,783
What about that scratch?

932
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:23,244
Like I said before, I got the bruise

933
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:24,704
while fooling around.

934
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:27,624
The scratch was from a cat.

935
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:32,587
I wanted to break up

936
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:38,134
because I liked someone else.

937
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:43,389
He saw me with another guy yesterday.

938
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:49,896
So,

939
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:51,648
he's a nice guy.

940
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:53,650
Most crimes happen

941
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:57,111
not because people are bad
but because they fly into a rage.

942
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:59,113
It happens in a split second.

943
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:01,491
In that car, you clearly said no

944
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:03,201
verbally and physically

945
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:04,994
multiple times that night.

946
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,579
And he kept on...

947
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,378
Whether he's nice or not
isn't the problem.

948
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:16,005
The problem is that
he was too angry to stop.

949
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:17,590
Do you get it?

950
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:20,677
He ignored your verbal
and physical refusal

951
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,220
multiple times already.

952
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:25,431
How can you be sure he'll just let you go?

953
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:26,432
With what proof?

954
01:01:31,562 --> 01:01:32,814
You two-timed him.

955
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,024
That's terrible.

956
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:37,610
But that doesn't justify

957
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,529
touching you without your permission.

958
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:41,906
It can't be accepted.

959
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:44,617
That's a crime. Do you get that?

960
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:52,208
Yes, I punched him.

961
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:55,545
I'm not saying I should've.

962
01:01:56,796 --> 01:02:00,299
But you also need to know
what's right and what's wrong.

963
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:03,094
No one, without your permission,

964
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:05,096
when you say no,

965
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:06,222
is allowed to

966
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:10,351
even lay a finger on your body.

967
01:02:11,018 --> 01:02:12,395
Okay, you brat?

968
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:20,570
I'm sorry for calling the police.

969
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,366
Take the bread I bought.

970
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,095
Don't see him again.

971
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:49,682
And don't two-time anyone again.

972
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:52,518
Answer me.

973
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:56,105
Okay, I won't.

974
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,113
Be careful.

975
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:07,450
You too.

976
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:22,799
Did the suspect use his credit card?

977
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:24,884
No, nothing yet.

978
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:32,517
Detective Lim went to both mountains

979
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,143
and checked footage from the area.

980
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:36,646
He identified two possible suspects
and questioned them.

981
01:03:37,271 --> 01:03:39,190
They both have alibis and were let go.

982
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:42,151
The cameras only record

983
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:44,654
for one or two weeks.

984
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:46,447
We have nothing from before.

985
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:50,660
Will the sports association files
give us something?

986
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:27,905
-Did you get any sleep?
-Two hours?

987
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:29,323
Did you?

988
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:32,451
I did. For two hours.

989
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:40,668
WANTED: SUSPECT IN RAPE CASE

990
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:49,051
Once we arrive, Sang-su will go to
the hospital, and I'll go to the sauna.

991
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:50,970
I'll go to the internet cafe
and join you later.

992
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:52,388
Okay.

993
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:06,068
Hello.

994
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,947
If we checked two, three times

995
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,740
and no one bought those shoes,

996
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,951
then where did he get them?

997
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:58,412
Did they fall from the sky
or rise from underground?

998
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:03,292
He's not a customer, he's a store owner.

999
01:06:12,259 --> 01:06:15,304
I'll check the stores near
Mount Somyeong. You two...

1000
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:16,847
We'll check near Mount Baekun.

1001
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:18,599
What?

1002
01:06:22,186 --> 01:06:23,145
Damn it!

1003
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,356
Who the hell parked his car here?

1004
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:27,566
Whose car is this?

1005
01:06:31,028 --> 01:06:31,862
Anyone?

the area near Mount Somyeong.

01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:06,981
We're now heading to Mount Baekun.

1011
01:07:15,072 --> 01:07:16,365
Patrol 21 finished patrolling

1012
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:18,242
the area near Mount Somyeong.

1013
01:07:18,325 --> 01:07:21,037
We're taking the robbery case
at 80 Mahyeon-dong. Last call.

1014
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,539
Patrol 21 is taking the robbery case

1015
01:07:23,622 --> 01:07:25,249
at 80 Mahyeon-dong. Last call.

1016
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:29,378
Let's not take any more cases
after this one.

1017
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:33,090
I want to help catch the serial rapist.

1018
01:07:33,257 --> 01:07:35,968
An old officer like me
should take these small cases

1019
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:40,014
so that young officers
can focus on the big cases.

1020
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:42,183
Make sure you get
a young mentor next time.

1021
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:45,227
I didn't mean it like that.

Suspect in rape and murder case
is in a white tracksuit.

1035
01:11:18,649 --> 01:11:20,651
He ran from the hospital

01:11:20,901 --> 01:11:22,194
Officers in the area, be advised.

1037
01:11:23,737 --> 01:11:25,948
We're at Chayeong Building.
Requesting backup!

Suspect in rape and murder case
is in a white tracksuit.

1039
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:33,872
He's in front of Chayeong Building.

I repeat, suspect spotted!

You were very brave.

1045
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:17,875
Good job.

1046
01:12:19,293 --> 01:12:21,337
Who are you becoming like?
You're so reckless.

1047
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:22,921
Who do you think I'm becoming like?

1048
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:24,590
<i>-I'm becoming like you--
-Stop acting up.</i>

Let's go for a drink sometime.
