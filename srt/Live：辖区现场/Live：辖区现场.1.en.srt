Platoon One and Two, prepare immediately.

00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,640
Platoon Three, stand by after dinner.

00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,770
<i>This is Platoon One. Roger that.</i>

EPISODE 1

12
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,910
Sir.

13
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,830
Sir.

14
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,750
Aren't you going home?

15
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,920
We're closed, sir.

16
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,380
Hey, yelling at them won't wake them up.

17
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,720
Just shake them harder.

18
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
Sir.

19
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,560
Hey,
you know that I'm taking this week off,

20
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,900
so So-jeong is coming instead, right?

21
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,070
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Why aren't you answering?

22
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,490
These two drank fifteen bottles.
They won't wake up.

23
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,490
Just shake them harder.

24
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,200
Sir.

25
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,750
Is this the police station?

26
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,340
I'm calling from Hyuna Intersection
in Seongbin-dong.

27
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,590
There are drunk people sitting
on the streets where there are cars.

28
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,180
Yes. Hyuna Intersection.

29
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,220
What are you doing?

30
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,980
I'm just rinsing rice. Just go to bed.

31
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,750
Just sleep.

32
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,540
Mom, sorry. I'm so sorry.

33
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,000
Does it hurt a lot?

34
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,840
-Ouch!
-Gosh, seriously.

35
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,200
I NEVER GAVE UP. I DON'T WANT
YOUR SUPPORT. JUST DON'T LAUGH AT ME.

36
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,700
DON'T GIVE UP! NEVER!

37
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,800
Mom, are you up?

38
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,470
You should get more sleep.

39
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,810
Mom, I made soybean paste stew.
Have breakfast.

40
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,270
Mom.

41
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,650
Mom, are you listening to me?

42
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,150
Gosh.

43
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,740
Are you going somewhere?

44
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,910
A client of mine wants to see me
before I go to work.

45
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,450
To buy an insurance plan?

46
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,790
I'll find out when I get there.

47
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,250
Don't get annoyed.

48
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,790
I can't help it.

49
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,080
Did you take your medicine?

50
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,040
Why would I? My panic disorder
will never get better anyways.

51
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,220
Take it.

52
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,320
You should have breakfast.

53
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,070
I have to go whenever my clients
want to see me.

54
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,990
How could an insurance agent
expect to eat on time?

55
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,330
What's this smell?

56
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,710
The stew!

57
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,890
Give me 50,000 won.

58
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,180
I told you I'm going to Seoul
for the job expo.

59
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,310
I'll pay you back when I get paid.

60
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,140
Just give me the money.

61
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,850
Why are you staring at me?
What do you want me to do?

62
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,590
Damn it.

63
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,260
My life is a mess.

64
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,650
Yeong-ji, hurry!

65
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,240
-Hey, where are you going?
-The bathroom!

66
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,750
You idiot, there are bathrooms
at the job fair!

67
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,290
You should've told me!

68
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,090
Sorry! I'm sorry.

2014 SMALL BUSINESS
RECRUITMENT INFORMATION EXPO

70
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,940
RECRUITMENT NOTICE BOARD

71
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,270
BLIND RECRUITMENT

72
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,280
-I studied in Canada...
-Through a wide range of volunteer work,

73
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,830
I learned how to get along with everyone
and how to be a good leader.

74
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,410
Regardless of region and...

75
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,830
I worked on developing my language skills.

76
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,170
-If an opportunity is...
-Through cultural exchanges...

77
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,300
-Working in an international sales team
-My experience as an exchange student

78
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:01,050
-allowed me to build a wide scope of...
-taught me how to communicate with...

79
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,930
Every year, Minhwa Corporation invests

80
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,470
over ten percent of its net profit in R&D.

81
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,720
Petrochemistry... No.

82
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,310
Petrochemistry... No, wake up.

83
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:14,350
In addition to the petrochemical industry,

84
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,480
the continued advancement
in macromolecule science...

85
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,070
-My gosh!
-Oh, no!

86
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,570
Oh, gosh.

87
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,200
Her shirt is completely ruined.

88
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,990
-What is she going to do?
-She has an interview too.

89
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,990
I feel so bad for her.

90
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,290
What should I do?

91
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,090
Why are you asking me?
You need to come up with a solution.

92
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,050
This is obviously your fault.

93
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,550
Why do I have to think up a solution?
Aren't I right?

94
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,800
Take off your shirt.

95
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,100
My interview is in ten minutes.
I'll give it back when I'm done.

96
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,230
I'm sorry.

97
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,940
I'm really sorry.

98
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,730
Hey, take off your undershirt. You too.

99
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,900
Okay.

100
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,370
Everyone, don't walk around
with your coffee.

101
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,030
Get rid of your coffee now.

102
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,580
Let's not ruin each other's life, okay?

103
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,510
-Ms. Lee Jeong-mi?
-Yes.

104
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,180
-Ms. Kim Yeong-ji?
-Yes.

105
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,180
I thought you might be tired.

106
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,060
I cannot accept things like this.

107
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,230
Of course I'll keep working
even after I get married.

108
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,860
That's a sexist remark...

109
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,940
What about you Ms. Han Jeong-o?

110
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:45,200
I don't want to get married. I'd like
to contribute to your macromolecule...

111
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,070
What will you do
if a senior member of your team

112
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,080
asks you to take care of
a personal matter?

113
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,330
Like picking up groceries
or babysitting, for example.

114
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,510
I'll consider even that as interest.

115
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,010
I'll help them with such personal matters

116
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,090
and ask about work-related rules
or know-hows...

117
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,430
I didn't go to an elite school,
but my GPA is high.

118
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,850
I'd love an opportunity to learn
at your company even as an intern...

119
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,480
We don't have an internship program.

120
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,150
-You graduated from Gayeon University.
-Yes, that's correct.

121
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,900
On your website, you advertise

122
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,320
that you accept all applicants
regardless of their academic background,

123
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,120
but during the actual interviews,

124
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,290
-you ask every applicant...
-Did you go to the military?

125
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,460
-Yes, sir.
-Which division?

126
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,960
Getting points for that
violates the constitution...

127
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,800
I was just asking,
out of my personal curiosity.

128
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,760
-I served in Blue Dragon Division.
-"Blue Dragon Division."

129
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,390
Sir, you're not here as yourself.

130
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,810
You're sitting there
as a representative of the company.

131
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:59,230
If this interview was for
your personal questions,

132
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,980
there would be no need for
job seekers like me to be here.

133
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,650
What an obnoxious asshole.

134
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,910
-What the hell?
-Are you blind?

135
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,990
I'll write everything I experienced,

136
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,990
on the Ministry of Employment
and Labor's website.

137
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,040
Yes, that's right.

138
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,000
Yes, let me verify the order with you.

139
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,210
You ordered 20 jugs of 10L spring water.

140
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,550
Yes, the order has been received.
Thank you.

141
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,510
This has been
Yeom Sang-su in Marketing Team One

142
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,180
of Serai Water,
proven safe and effective by the FDA.

143
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,230
-Please review and approve this.
-Okay.

144
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,270
Have a good day.

145
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,990
Yes, I remember. Mr. Lee Jae-min, you said
you are interested in investing, right?

146
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,200
Serai Water has been patented.

147
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,120
We'll revolutionize the water industry,
and we're preparing to go public.

148
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,250
This is Yeom Sang-su in Marketing Team One
of Serai Water, approved by the FDA.

149
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,870
Thank you for calling Serai Water.

150
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,040
Our water was developed by Doctor Yang...

151
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,000
Hello, this is...

152
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,920
Thank you for calling...

153
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,420
This is Yeom Sang-su
in Marketing Team One of Serai Water.

154
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12,340
-Yes, I remember. You wanted to invest...
-Thank you for calling...

155
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,190
How many shares will you buy?

156
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,350
A hundred. What about you?

157
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,150
My mom and my brother are pitching in.

158
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,730
I should buy at least a hundred
if that's the requirement.

159
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,610
It's so hard to become
a full-time employee.

160
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:34,110
We pull an all-nighter every day
and we even have to buy stock shares.

161
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,280
But we'll make 2,000,000 won every month
and become shareholders.

162
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,410
Then we'll be able
to join the successful bunch!

163
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,960
Let's stay positive, okay?

164
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,330
Hey.

165
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,840
-Fuck. My nose is bleeding again.
-Are you okay?

166
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,760
I work so hard, don't I?

167
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:53,880
Do you have tissues?

168
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,640
Stop talking about discrimination.

169
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,310
These days, men are often
put at a disadvantage.

170
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,470
That's right. Due to the policy
on women's employment,

171
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,480
companies must hire a set percentage
of women.

172
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,110
Let's be honest.
Isn't that reverse discrimination?

173
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,110
How is that reverse discrimination?

174
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,320
Korea's rate of female employment
ranked seventh

175
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,780
from the bottom
out of all OECD member countries.

176
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,320
Men earn seven times more than women.

177
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,240
Don't you read the news, you pea-brain?

178
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,080
Just do as you're told.

179
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,580
Just like the military,
society wants you to obey.

180
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,750
-Bullshit.
-Bullshit.

181
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,090
The military and society
are two different things.

182
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,460
Men start with a higher salary

183
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,550
as compensation for the service
men provided for the government.

184
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,760
I agree that our country
used you against your will.

185
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,930
But

186
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,430
the country should pay you back,
not individual companies.

187
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,640
Ask for more pay for the time served

188
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,440
or demand a reunification.

189
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,900
Vote for someone who's willing
to change the national policy.

190
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,360
You didn't vote, did you?

191
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,860
Give me the money
and order as much as you want.

192
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,190
I'll pay the difference.

193
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,570
I won't say no to that.

194
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,570
-What's the occasion?
-The bill, please.

195
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,320
He got job offers from

196
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,990
Winner and Real today.

197
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,830
Really?

198
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,710
Why?

199
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,460
Jeong-o had an interview with Winner too.
But why didn't she get an offer?

200
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,880
Men are easier to order around.

201
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,930
-Congrats.
-Thanks.

202
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:23,220
I don't know why they chose me over you.

203
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,890
You scored higher than me in
TOEIC and Speaking.

204
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,020
I don't know why they didn't choose me,

205
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,980
but I also don't want to know
why they chose you.

206
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,360
So I came up with two reasons.

207
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:36,740
One reason is that I'm strong, since I'm
a man and I learned patience in the army.

208
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,540
Women have more patience.

209
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,080
We deal with bone-crushing
menstrual pain once a month.

210
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,500
Would you like to experience it?

211
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,630
It's just as painful as
guerilla training in the army.

212
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,220
I don't want to talk about gender
discrimination. It's useless anyways.

213
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,550
What really bugs me

214
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,220
is the fact that men who hold

215
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,560
the power in our society

216
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,440
only see the world from a narrow viewpoint

217
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,270
based on their own experience.

218
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,980
They judge women

219
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,360
saying that
we are impatient and opinionated

220
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,950
and have been ruining my future.

221
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,750
I'm too jealous to drink with you.

222
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,960
You see, I'm petty.

223
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,880
Women aren't petty, but I am.

224
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,260
Jeong-o, wait.

225
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,220
Hey, stop sending messages.

226
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,140
HWIGANG R&D EMPLOYMENT ANNOUNCEMENT

227
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:54,190
I want to ace the interview tomorrow.

228
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,610
-How many interviews do you have tomorrow?
-Four, but I'm open to more.

229
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,490
Hi, Mom. Are you home?

230
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,750
A coffee shop?

231
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:11,870
Are you drinking again?

232
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:16,380
Did you sign any new clients today?

233
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,300
No?

234
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,090
What?

235
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,800
You're buying what?

236
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:26,850
Come on in.

237
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,810
The cafe isn't that big,

238
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:35,060
but I've been here for two hours
and it seems like business is going well.

239
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:40,240
Jeong-o,
should we ask your dad for some money?

240
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,740
If we managed one of these...

241
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,990
I don't have a dad.

242
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,580
I don't even know his face.

243
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,120
Sharing DNA doesn't make him one.

244
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,210
Of course I'm annoyed.

245
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,250
When I was in high school,

246
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,880
we asked him to pay my tuition

247
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,050
and that man called you a leech.
I haven't forgotten that.

248
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,720
Don't go to him. Don't you dare.

249
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:09,350
How was the job interview?
Was it successful?

250
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,770
Of course. I'll be getting an offer.

251
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,360
Sorry. I wish I could tell you
good news like that.

252
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,860
What is the matter with you?

253
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,870
<i>What now?</i>

254
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,460
Why did you hang up on me like that?
You're upsetting me.

255
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,830
<i>It's not just you. I'm upset too.</i>

256
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,460
Why can't you get a job
like everyone else?

257
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,880
Fine, I'm a loser.

258
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,760
Your daughter is a loser.

259
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,880
Do you want me to say that
and be discouraged?

260
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,760
I'm trying really hard
not to break down in front of you.

261
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,640
I tell myself hundreds of times a day

262
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,610
that I can do it if I give it my all.

263
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,690
I tell myself I'm not a loser

264
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,650
that I just didn't have
enough opportunities.

265
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,700
That's what I tell myself.

266
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,450
You idiot.

267
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,410
So why won't you let me
talk to your rich father?

268
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,660
With that coffee shop...

269
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,080
I was born out of wedlock!

270
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,540
You don't have to see him.

271
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:21,130
I'm willing to beg for the both of us.

272
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,130
You and I are the same.

273
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:24,420
If you beg, it's like I am too.
What's the difference?

274
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:25,920
Same, my ass.

275
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,970
When were we ever the same?

276
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:31,470
I had a child out of wedlock
while you have a college diploma.

277
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,470
How are we the same?

278
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:37,600
Anyone can tell that
you're far better than I am!

279
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,680
---

280
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,140
Did you wire the money?

281
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,890
How much?

282
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,060
I was only able to send eight million won.

283
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,770
That's all that I have.
What more can I do?

284
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,270
Do you want me to steal?

285
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,770
If you like money so much,
why don't you just sell me?

286
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:23,860
I'm not deliberately holding back.

287
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,570
I don't have any money to give.

288
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,240
Darn it.

289
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
Didn't your brother give you money too?

290
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,580
Why am I angry?

291
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,500
Why don't you cancel
your installment savings account

292
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,630
you opened to buy a new home?

293
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,710
See if it makes you happy.

294
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,050
Goodbye.

295
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,720
Damn it.

296
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,090
Every time I save up

297
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,300
some money he takes it
as if it is rightfully his.

298
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,430
That little brat.

299
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,730
I wired seven million won.

300
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,770
Yes, I canceled my savings bond
and wired it in your name.

301
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:03,320
Are you certain about this though?

302
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,900
Is your intel reliable?

303
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,030
<i>It is. I promise.</i>

304
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,700
-<i>How many times must I say it?
-Sang-jun,</i>

305
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,620
sort out the storage too.

306
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,910
Sure thing.

307
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,990
I better go.

308
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,080
I want to finish early and see Jin-hui.

309
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,330
<i>Are you at the pharmacy again?</i>

310
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,410
Why do they keep asking

311
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,750
a pharmaceutical sales rep
to clean their storage?

312
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,750
It's why you should work for yourself.

313
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,340
Okay, bye.

314
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,100
Jin-hui, I'll be there soon.

315
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:39,770
Just wait a little...

316
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,900
What do you mean you can't meet?

317
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:49,990
A blind date?

318
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,990
Why are you crying?

319
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,200
Didn't you agree to it
because of your parents?

320
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,920
You made the right choice.

321
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,130
Are you doubting me?

322
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,260
You idiot.

323
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,630
Wire me the money and come to the club.

324
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:13,930
Sure.

325
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,940
Sir, is the stock buying
until 10 p.m. tomorrow?

326
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,860
My friend bought some too.

327
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,570
Sure, I'll do my best.

328
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,990
Where are you? I'm on my way.

329
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:36,200
Seo-yeong? I broke up with her ages ago.

330
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,620
What do you think?
We just had nothing in common.

331
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,830
So how are the ladies at the club?
Who's the DJ?

332
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,080
X-Men?

333
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:48,250
No way. Fuck,
I'm going die if it's really him.

334
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,100
X-Men.

335
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,140
-How about this place? They prefer women.
-You in sales with that temper?

336
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,520
It would be a stretch, right?

337
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,860
Indeed.

338
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,260
Looking good.

339
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,380
Where are you going, Sang-su?

340
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,770
Hey. It's the bar across
the street, right?

341
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,110
Yes. See you soon.

342
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,990
-What was that?
-Did you nab them?

343
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,070
-Nice, right?
-Totally.

344
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,200
We're going for round two.

345
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,790
<i>-Sang-su, Sang-su...
-Sang-su, Sang-su...</i>

346
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:05,210
Why a bar and not a roadside snack cart?

347
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,250
This won't be enough.

348
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:09,590
We'll each pitch in 50,000 first
and 30,000 more if that's not enough.

349
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,000
What about you?

350
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,840
I'm on emergency duty tomorrow.

351
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,220
I'm just going to go home.

352
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,180
I can tell they're heavy drinkers
just by looking at them.

353
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,680
You'll just end up wasting money.

354
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,430
He's right. Are you crazy about women?

355
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,310
Must we give up what little cash we have

356
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,310
to fawn over them?

357
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,270
Hey, are we easy prey?

358
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,940
It's been a while since...

359
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,270
Stop lusting after women.

360
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,280
I have to go study. Give me my money.

361
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,820
You can't study while you're drunk.

362
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,070
I have a test tomorrow. I want my money.

363
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,950
They don't want to pitch in. Give it back.

364
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,790
-Give it back.
-We won't stay for long. Just...

365
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:44,790
Just a little...

366
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,710
What's your problem?

367
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,710
You're such a loser.

368
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,050
Let's just go home.

369
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:59,050
Hey.

370
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,390
Yes, I want a woman.

371
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,140
Stop it.

372
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,440
You bastard.

373
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,270
I worked any job I could for three years
and nothing worked out.

374
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,530
And two months ago,
my girlfriend dumped me.

375
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:19,570
-You said you had nothing in common.
-You believed that?

376
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,320
She dumped me because I have nothing.

377
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,740
You jackass.

378
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,460
I worked two months,
mostly overtime without a day off.

379
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,920
Without women...

380
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,340
What would I have to laugh about
without women?

381
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,970
Can't I just hang out with girls

382
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,470
and have a good time?

383
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,550
Can't I? Is that what you think?

384
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,060
You're an intern at least.
I don't even have a job.

385
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,850
I know your situation...

386
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,940
That's why I'm trying to let you have fun.

387
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:53,360
You said you liked the girl
in the red blouse.

388
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,610
Forget it. I don't need your pity.

389
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,990
You have an inferiority complex.

390
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,160
What? "An inferiority complex"?

391
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,620
You asshole.

392
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,120
Hey, hey, stop it.

393
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,870
-He called me inferior.
-Don't.

394
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:07,910
Let go of me.

395
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,330
Nice one.

396
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,000
Don't. Are you crazy?

397
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,170
-That's hilarious.
-My supervisor. Give me a minute.

398
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,430
It's work.

399
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,600
Can we order more drinks?

400
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,640
Sure. Excuse me, can we have two more?

401
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:32,940
Yes, sir.

402
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,150
What great timing.

403
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,400
Good on you. Talk to you later.

404
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,490
Hyeong-uk.

405
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:43,950
Hyeong-uk.

406
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:51,460
What's wrong with you?

407
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:56,290
I don't think I can get
a job this time around.

408
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,630
Say that after you take the test.

409
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,600
The girls drink too much.
I could end up penniless paying for them.

410
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,520
Let's run.

411
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,360
Don't forget about this.

412
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,830
Let's find some nice girls
at a club next time.

413
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,710
They were too outgoing and not our type.

414
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:38,040
I'd love to find a woman
who's willing to pay half the bill.

415
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,640
Hi, Mom.

416
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,520
Your ankle? Call my brother.

417
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,140
He's not picking up?

418
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,150
Hyeong-uk's drunk off his ass.

419
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:58,940
Call a taxi.

420
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:02,650
Mom.

421
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:05,990
I...

422
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,040
Mom.

423
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,420
Hello.

424
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,590
Why are you carrying Hyeong-uk?

425
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:26,720
He's drunk.

426
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,430
You're all so useless.

427
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,520
You're her son?
The pharmaceutical sales rep

428
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,230
or the water vendor?

429
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,690
The water vendor.

430
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:37,770
Oh.

431
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,770
Sang-su, come along.

432
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,320
Hello, son.

433
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,110
Over here.

434
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,320
My colleague. Say hi.

435
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,620
-Hello.
-And her son.

436
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,120
Hello.

437
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,540
My son's a civil servant.
He works at a borough office.

438
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,370
He picks me up every night
saying it's dangerous for me to walk home.

439
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,380
-Take care.
-Bye.

440
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,590
-Let's go.
-Okay.

441
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:04,460
Why did you come? You must be tired.

442
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,510
-Take care.
-Bye.

443
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,350
See you.

444
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:02,190
Why call me when
you could just take the bus?

445
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:05,570
How can I carry my bag
when I'm on crutches?

446
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,190
Are you jealous of that lady?

447
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,780
Are you jealous because her son is
a civil servant? Live with him, then.

448
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,280
What are you looking at?

449
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,540
She is...

450
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,250
going to get her employee card soon.

451
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:29,260
You know, the one you have around
your neck. She's getting a raise too.

452
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,630
By 120,000 won.

453
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,680
They can fire me,

454
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:36,470
but they can't fire her easily now.

455
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,890
Because she's full-time.

456
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,600
Civil servants never get fired either.

457
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:44,060
I won't either.
I'll be made full-time soon.

458
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,740
The moon's so pretty.

459
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:55,950
You're prettier.

460
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:07,500
You scumbag,
how could you just leave me and Hyeong-uk?

461
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:08,920
I have a job too.

462
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,220
I have to go back to work
in just three hours.

463
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,760
What do you mean?

464
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,220
You won't invest?

465
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,770
"An illegal pyramid scheme"?

466
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,810
That's just nonsense.

467
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,980
That's Chang-min's company. Mine isn't...

468
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:30,690
Don't invest, then.

469
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,320
I talked you up to my superiors
to get you a chance

470
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,820
to invest in us first.

471
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,620
My company isn't illegal.

472
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,750
My mom and brother put all their savings
in, so why would our...

473
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,160
What?

474
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,040
Why is our company
an illegal pyramid scheme?

475
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,250
I get paid.

476
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,490
Where's my money?

477
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,540
You jerk. Where's my money?

478
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,410
Where's your boss?

479
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,750
Where's my money?

480
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,540
-I don't know. We're victims too.
-Pay me back!

481
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,710
Where's my money?

482
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:32,210
You're one of them, right?

483
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,340
What is the matter?

484
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,760
What is going on?

485
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,390
I invested 500 million won in it.

486
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:41,390
Those bastards ate up 10 billion won.

487
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,850
No, I'm sure it's actually
way over 20 billion won.

488
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:45,770
-Next.
-For the last two to three months,

489
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,190
even their office...

490
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:49,730
We got paid 1.1 million won a month
for 2 months.

491
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:51,440
I invested 23 million won.

492
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:53,650
That was my rent deposit.

493
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:57,280
Goodness.
You should've done thorough research.

494
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,280
How can you just trust
their words and ads...

495
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,410
Right. From the doctorate certificate
to the patent certificate,

496
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:04,160
they forged everything so meticulously.

497
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,700
What about you?

498
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,830
I invested 35 million won in stocks,

499
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,130
and my friend invested 20 million won.

500
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:13,130
But why did they pay us
if they were going to scam us?

501
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,880
You morons,
didn't you guys say you're interns?

502
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,430
They were trying to copy
what big companies do. Can't you tell?

503
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,340
Then why did you get scammed?

504
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,260
-You little... Shall I teach you a lesson?
-Sit down!

505
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,600
-Gosh, it's so chaotic here.
-All right.

506
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,640
You obnoxious asshole.

507
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,390
Please sit down.

508
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:32,650
May I answer this call?

509
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,320
Sure, just leave your ID with us.

510
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:38,280
-We can't worry about being embarrassed!
-Where were we?

511
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,410
-I said my friend invested 20 million won.
-What?

512
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,200
-I'm speechless.
-Calm down.

513
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,120
Is there any way we can get it back?

514
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,200
Can you catch them?

515
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,500
Hey, where are you now?

516
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,170
Home?
Are you going to work in the afternoon?

517
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,470
Hey.

518
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,760
The thing is, I actually...

519
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,650
What? You're going to Australia? Why?

520
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,360
"A working holiday"?

521
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,490
I applied for it just in case
when I used to look for jobs,

522
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,740
and my application got approved.

523
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:27,910
Those at a wheat farm want me to come.

524
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,620
Sang-su...

525
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:36,840
Jin-hui had a blind date
with a guy who works for a big company,

526
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,210
and I think she likes him.

527
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,010
She wants to break up with me.

528
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,220
I know that I won't let her go
if I stay here.

529
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:49,520
<i>Sang-su, I need to be away
for a little while.</i>

530
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:51,180
Then when will you come back?

531
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,610
Why aren't you answering?
Will you never come back?

532
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,360
<i>Are you abandoning us?</i>

533
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,820
<i>Why would I abandon you?</i>

534
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,870
Leaving like that
is no different from abandoning us.

535
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:09,240
It's the same thing as
throwing us in the garbage can.

536
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,710
<i>Tell Mom for me.</i>

537
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,500
<i>Sang-su, I'm...</i>

538
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,920
sick of this country and Seoul.

539
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,470
Even my job where
I have to work over 20 hours a day.

540
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,220
I'm too exhausted.

541
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,850
<i>I'm not leaving of my own accord.
It feels as if this country wants me gone.</i>

542
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,520
<i>So, I should leave.</i>

543
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,600
Sang-jun.

544
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,350
<i>I'll call you again soon.</i>

545
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:35,850
Sang-jun.

546
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,270
Sang-jun...

547
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,870
<i>The customer you're calling is unavailable
at the moment. Please leave a message</i>

548
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,490
<i>after the tone.</i>

549
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,350
But I must say, he's a big guy.

550
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,860
Don't even get me started.
His arms are huge.

551
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:20,900
I barely managed to cuff him.

552
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:23,610
I wouldn't even have been
able to cuff him. Great work.

553
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:26,150
2015 OPEN RECRUITMENT FOR POLICE OFFICERS

554
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:31,950
-Did you see him? The newbie.
-What about him?

555
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,790
2015 OPEN RECRUITMENT FOR POLICE OFFICERS

556
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:43,380
Don't even think about it.
You'll have to prepare for the exam.

557
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,470
It'll be competitive too.
I'm not going to apply.

558
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:48,890
But civil servants are hired
solely based on their exam scores.

559
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,970
They don't look at other qualifications.

560
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,810
And even women get promotions.

561
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:03,150

564
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,800
Sang-su!

565
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:36,020
Why do you want to join the police force?
Just work at a company.

566
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,690
It'll take years for you to become
a civil servant!

567
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:40,690
Sang-su!

568
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:43,940
Hello?

569
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,440
I'm Han Jeong-o,
Ms. Lee Sun-yeong's daughter.

570
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,650
<i>I don't know who that is.</i>

571
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:06,420
<i>Make sure you eat.
Take your medication too.</i>

CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CODE

573
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:18,950
What do you want?

574
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,660
I guess you do know who I am.
You said you didn't know...

575
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:22,870
What do you want from me?

576
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:26,080
I'm struggling to find a job,

577
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,840
-so I want to...
-Cut to the chase.

578
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,010
I need money to study for the police exam.

579
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,590
Give me 20 million won.

580
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,020
Give me your account number.

581
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:55,160
Mr. Oh, send 20 million to this account.

582
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,550
<i>Send me your account number.
I'll pay you back.</i>

583
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,560
<i>If you waste your time chatting
with friends and dating guys,</i>

584
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:29,310
your life will be doomed.
You must keep that in mind...

585
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,650
I studied the study guide 30 times.

586
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:32,690
STUDY THE GUIDE 30 TIMES

587
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:36,110
I did everything
my professor told me to do.

588
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,660
I obeyed his every order.

589
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,990
IT'S A BATTLE AGAINST YOURSELF!

590
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,660
NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN BECOMING A POLICE OFFICER.

591
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,020
<i>Sang-jun abandoned Mom.</i>

592
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:09,770
<i>Yeom Sang-su, will you abandon Mom too?</i>

593
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:14,070
-One extra-large serving to go, please.
-Sure.

594
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,580
I must focus only on eating now
to focus better when I study later.

595
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:34,960
I must focus only on eating now
to focus better when I study later.

596
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:37,380
Begin the roll call.

597
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:38,800
-One.
-Two.

598
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:40,590
-Eight.
-Nine.

599
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,680
-Ten.
-That's everyone.

600
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,100
Let me know if you need anything
or have any complaints.

601
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,600
We don't have any.

602
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,180
-Keep up the good work. You can do it!
-We can do it!

603
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:49,480
Have a good night.

604
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:54,110

00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,050
I made it!

610
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:10,930
-I made it into the police academy.
-I see.

611
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:13,140
I made it...

612
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,850
I'm sorry, please carry on.

613
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,360
Sang-jun.

614
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:27,320
Call me as soon as

615
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,030
you get my message.

616
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:30,950
Why?

617
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,370
I'm made it into
the fucking police academy.

618
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:38,370
Was I not clear?

619
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:41,460
Your brother became a police officer!

620
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:43,500
A police officer!

621
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:46,380
I'm a police officer!

622
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:49,340
Here and here.

623
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:53,140
You're all done. Thank you.

624
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:55,850
Thank you so much every time.

625
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:57,930
I'll give you a call sometime soon.

626
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,370
Hey!

627
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:20,210
My baby!

628
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:29,630
Mom!

629
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,390

-Three, four.
-Three, four.

640
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:07,920
Instead of going home tonight,

641
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,420
we're all going out for drinks.

642
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:10,420
Are you in?

643
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:13,130
Of course.
I'm going to get wasted tonight.

644
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:15,640
How much longer do we have to run?

645
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,350
I hear that the new martial arts trainer

646
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:19,390
is a hard-ass.

647
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:20,980
How much are we pitching in?

648
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:23,230
Are we only drinking
one bottle each like last time?

649
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:25,900
-Let's drink at least three each.
-You bet.

650
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:28,320
We might cause trouble if we get excited.

651
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,360
-Do you want to get penalty points?
-Who cares?

652
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:32,360
We'll make up for it elsewhere.

653
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,740
Who is this trainer anyway?

654
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,490
Why is he making us run the track?

655
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:41,160
I want to be out in the field already.

656
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,170
I'm applying for the police squad.
What about you?

657
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:45,290
Patrol division.

658
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:47,380
I'll roam the streets with a gun.

659
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,630
-What about you?
-The same. What about you?

660
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:52,090
Patrol division.

661
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:00,600
Finally, we're getting a break.

662
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:02,640
Please let this be the end.

663
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,270
Starting today,

664
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:07,480
he will train you all in martial arts.

665
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:11,150
He is the pride and legend
of the Violent Crime Unit.

666
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,490
This is Captain Oh Yang-chon.

667
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,490
Look at his face.

668
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,790
Someone might think he's a culprit.

669
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:37,050
Steady...

670
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,510
Steady...

671
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:43,060
And rest.

672
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:48,190
Don't think about resting and run!

673
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:52,820
What? "Don't think about resting and run"?

674
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,080
Just because you passed the exam
and made it to the police academy,

675
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:04,120
you might think it's over,
and that you're a civil servant now.

676
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:07,040
You might've relaxed
and let your guards down.

677
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:10,330
As of this moment,
put that thought into the trash can.

678
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:13,340
Each month,
I will kick out at least one person

679
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,260
if they lose their focus.

680
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:17,680
What's he talking about?

681
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:20,220
He's kicking at least one of us out? Why?

682
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,560
I have a bad feeling about this.

683
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,180
What do we do now?

684
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:28,020
No one knows which one of you
will get the boot.

685
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,650
From this day forward,

686
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:32,900
you will learn
the sense of duty of a police officer.

687
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,400
The exam...

688
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,570
Aren't we done since we passed
the police academy exam?

689
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,360
Aren't we civil servants?

690
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:39,320
Civil servants...

691
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:40,410
It's a scare tactic.

692
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:42,580
Who is he to kick us out?

693
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:45,700
I studied like a mad woman
for two years just to get in.

694
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:48,160
We're not leaving just because he said so.

695
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:49,330
Don't be intimidated.

696
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:50,670
I will kick you out.

697
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,500
There's something scary about him though.

698
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,340
Steady!

699
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,760
Keep running in the same spot!

700
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:43,800
Do you think you're a civil servant?

701
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:46,850
Do you think
you're already a police officer?

702
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,810
I didn't say anything.

703
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:52,650
Since you didn't say anything,
does that mean I can't ask?

704
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:54,730
-Is that it?
-No, sir!

705
00:52:57,230 --> 00:52:58,820
You don't seem to have a sense of duty.

706
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,490
You're wrong.

707
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,360
I do, sir.

708
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:04,620
In what way?

709
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:07,620
In what way?

710
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:09,620
I'll do my best!

711
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:13,870
That means you joined

712
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,580
the academy empty-handed.

713
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:17,750
You didn't bring your sense of duty.

714
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:26,720
Run again!

715
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:29,810
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

716
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:31,480
-To your place.
-One, two, three, four.

717
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:33,600
-One, two, three, four.
-One, two, three, four.

718
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:36,980
-One, two, three, four.
-One, two, three, four.

719
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,320
To your place!

720
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,860
No, wait!

721
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:42,450
Please, I'm scared of heights.

722
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:44,490
One penalty point.

723
00:53:44,570 --> 00:53:46,570
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

724
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,870
I...

725
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,200
Get ready!

726
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:53,160
I am a police officer!

727
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:54,870
I have a sense of duty!

728
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,380
-Descend.
-Descend!

729
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,000
No, wait!

730
00:53:58,090 --> 00:53:59,630
Two penalty points.

731
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,300
Three penalty points.

732
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,350
-Four penalty points.
-Next.

733
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:16,690
Take your places.

734
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:24,150
Any complaints?

735
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,030
She studied hard
for three years to get here.

736
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:30,280
I think it's harsh to give her four
penalty points for one rappel exercise.

737
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:31,870
So it's okay to have an acrophobic cop

738
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:33,580
when someone's life is on the line?

739
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:36,250
The citizens we serve would
just love that.

740
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:38,420
One penalty point for being thoughtless.

741
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:42,800
Ready?

742
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,420
I am a police officer.
I have a sense of duty.

743
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:47,470
-Descend.
-Descend!

744
00:54:55,310 --> 00:54:56,440
You with four penalty points.

745
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,600
Come back up.

746
00:54:58,190 --> 00:55:00,150
Come up in 10 seconds,
or you get 5 penalty points.

747
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:06,610
We shall begin the slow fire exercise.

748
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:07,570
Load your guns.

749
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:09,030
-Loading guns.
-Loading guns.

750
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:15,580
We're all tired out from martial arts
training, and they want us to shoot?

751
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:18,620
Shooters, take aim.

752
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:20,380
-Take aim!
-Take aim!

753
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:22,500
For your lack of discipline
in report repeat,

754
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:25,090
you each get one penalty point.

755
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:29,800
Shooters, take aim.

756
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:32,600
-Take aim!
-Take aim!

757
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:33,640
Pull the hammer back.

758
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:35,720
-Pulling hammer back!
-Pulling hammer back!

759
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,780
Begin.

760
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:18,430
Stop.

761
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:21,940
None kept your arm still.

762
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,980
You each get one penalty point.

763
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:26,860
Attention!

764
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:29,740
Raise your shields!

765
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,860
-Shields up!
-Shields up!

766
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:36,490
Just because you passed the exam
and made it to the police academy,

767
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:39,790
you might think it's over,
and that you're a civil servant now.

768
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:43,420
<i>You might've relaxed
and let your guards down.</i>

769
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:46,960
<i>As of this moment,
put that thought into the trash can.</i>

770
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:50,760
<i>Each month,
I will kick out at least one person</i>

771
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,220
<i>if they lose their focus.</i>

772
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:56,310
<i>I desperately want my juniors</i>

773
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:58,520
<i>to become police officers someday.</i>

774
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,770
I desperately want my juniors

775
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:03,850
to become police officers someday.

776
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:07,780
<i>If you waste taxpayers' money,</i>

777
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:10,900
<i>you can't become a police officer.</i>

778
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:14,280
<i>If you waste taxpayers' money,</i>

779
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:16,700
<i>you can't become a police officer.</i>

780
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:18,870
<i>You can't become a police officer.</i>

781
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:23,420
<i>I desperately want my juniors</i>

782
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,420
<i>to become police officers someday.</i>

783
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:28,880
<i>I desperately want my juniors</i>

784
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,170
<i>to become police officers someday.</i>

785
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,100
Withstand the force! Stand your ground!

786
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:49,440
-I am a proud police officer!
-I am a proud police officer!

787
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:54,570
-I am a proud police officer!
-I am a proud police officer!

788
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:56,870
Here.

789
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,830
A bit lower.

790
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,750
-Here?
-Yes.

791
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:08,130
-You do it.
-Massage me.

792
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:09,550
Do you feel better?

793
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:14,970
That's enough.

794
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,410
Let go.

795
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:46,670
Grab onto him.

796
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,050
Damn it. Let go.

797
00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:02,100
Freeze.

798
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:09,230
Stand up.

799
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:15,820
Cuff me.

800
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:37,940
Three penalty points
for doing a crappy job cuffing me.

801
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:40,820
Three penalty points
for allowing a surprise attack.

802
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,820
For not securing your
weapon which could threaten your life,

803
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:51,870
out of pity for you,
I'll be merciful and award seven points.

804
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,250
A total of 13 points.

805
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:57,130
The total penalty of your training
so far is 21 points.

806
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:02,050
Doesn't 30 equal expulsion?

807
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:03,800
You have one month to go.

808
01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:07,180
-What'll happen?
-I'll put my life on the line.

809
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:11,020
You, for playing easy to get
for a female trainee.

810
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:12,430
Five penalty points.

811
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,020
Block-off formation!

812
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:21,030
-Block-off formation!
-Block-off formation!

813
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:32,410
Protesters, charge!

814
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,790
-Defense formation!
-Defense formation!

815
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:48,350
Three steps forward.

816
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:50,760
-Forward!
-Forward!

817
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:54,390
One, two, three. One.
One, two, three. Two.

818
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,520
-One, two, three. Three.
-One, two, three. Three.

819
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,980
-Get out the way.
-Stand your ground!

820
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:02,400
-Move!
-Stay!

821
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,240
-You can't come through.
-I can.

822
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,110
Keep formation!

823
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:18,670
You didn't hold your shield properly.

824
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:20,090
You broke formation.

825
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:22,590
Two penalty points each. Recover!

826
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:24,130
-Recover!
-Jackass.

827
01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:27,510
-Recover.
-Recover.

828
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:33,520
Han Jeong-o.

829
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:36,810
-Han Jeong-o.
-Over here.

830
01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:46,650
You're being moody.

831
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:48,230
Do you want to be penalized?

832
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:50,270
Why aren't you in bed?

833
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:53,900
I don't mind being expelled.

834
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:55,360
Are you crazy?

835
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:58,160
You got this far. Why give up now?

836
01:01:58,820 --> 01:01:59,950
You have to graduate.

837
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:03,910
Go back inside. You'll get
penalty points if you get caught.

838
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:05,830
If I don't cool down now,

839
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:07,960
I'll go mad before
I graduate or get expelled.

840
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:11,290
That, or I'll run up to Oh Yang-chon

841
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:13,260
and take a bite out of his neck.

842
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:16,050
I like your tenacity.

843
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,350
I will graduate for sure.

844
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:23,350
I don't doubt that.

845
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:43,240
CENTRAL POLICE ACADEMY

846
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:33,000
Isn't that Oh Yang-chon's car?

847
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:38,550
Where's he going?

848
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:40,970
Who cares where he's going?

849
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:51,600
You two.

850
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:55,820
Are you dropping out? Goodness.

851
01:03:56,820 --> 01:04:00,030
I've been called out
into the field as of today.

852
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,610
I see you didn't know.

853
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:04,700
Didn't I mention it?

854
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,620
You should've held out a little longer.

855
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:18,420
Why are you leaving
when you have no penalty points?

856
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:21,550
You and this place

857
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:23,970
are both irrational and unfair.

858
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:27,930
CENTRAL POLICE ACADEMY

859
01:04:28,010 --> 01:04:29,180
You're right.

860
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:32,350
This field and I are quite unfair.

861
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,280
You made the right choice.

862
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:44,530
But out in the field as a police officer,

863
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:46,910
you'll encounter situations
that are more unfair.

864
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,490
Those who are guilty

865
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:53,000
get drunk, curse at us, kick us, hit us,

866
01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:54,420
and even stab us.

867
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:57,130
But if we suppress them,
they'll file a civil complaint.

868
01:04:57,630 --> 01:04:59,130
We get shot at too.

869
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:03,340
What part of the world is fair though?

870
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,050
Anyway, good luck!

871
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:40,410
I miss you, I love you,
it's been a while, my dear wife.

872
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:42,370
I'm sorry though.

873
01:05:42,450 --> 01:05:45,660
<i>I'm getting called back to the precinct,
so I can't make it home tonight.</i>

874
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:47,790
When did you ever come home?

875
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,480
Check the video I sent you
and call me back.

876
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:28,000
I'm a husband just dying to see his wife.

877
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:28,040
Why would you send me a video
of a scumbag police officer
I'm a husband just dying to see his wife.

878
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:30,710
Why would you send me a video
of a scumbag police officer

879
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:32,550
harassing the people?

880
01:06:32,630 --> 01:06:34,840
How about hangover soup?

881
01:06:34,930 --> 01:06:37,050
I found the footage
while looking into another case.

882
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:38,930
There wasn't a civil complaint.

883
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:40,520
Loser pays. Rock-paper-scissors!

884
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:44,310
He's an officer on my team
who goes by the name of Dong-kyu.

885
01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:49,270
He'll be transferred to
a cushy job in Human Resources soon.

886
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:53,240
He's a decent cop and a single father
who takes care of

887
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:55,030
his mother along with his child.

888
01:06:56,030 --> 01:06:58,030
My stint at this patrol division
ends in two weeks.

889
01:06:58,990 --> 01:07:00,410
Should I let it slide?

890
01:07:00,890 --> 01:07:02,770
<i>I can if I quietly erase the footage.</i>

891
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:06,320
A complaint wasn't made.

892
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:08,190
Should I let it go?

893
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:10,490
Dong-kyu's a really fine police officer.

894
01:07:10,570 --> 01:07:12,320
That's all the more reason

895
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:13,990
not to let it slide.

896
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:17,450
<i>No matter how good he is,
he shouldn't neglect citizens.</i>

897
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,870
<i>In midwinter too.
What if he froze to death?</i>

898
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:22,170
<i>Report him.</i>

899
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:31,380
How are you always so lucky?

900
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:34,260
Dong-kyu.

901
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:38,520
-Can I get a cup of tea?
-Sure.

902
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:45,190
What will I do without you here?

903
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:47,900
I don't know.

904
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:51,320
I'll miss you too.

905
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:52,900
People are watching.

906
01:07:58,120 --> 01:07:59,620
Crazy bastard.

907
01:08:00,290 --> 01:08:02,750
He sings and dances
after ruining others' lives,

908
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:05,750
What a psycho.

909
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:08,550
He should've told us
that he was going to leave.

910
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:10,630
He just let them quit.

911
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:14,050
Sense of duty, my ass.
He left without completing our training.

912
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:16,600
I'm pretty sure he doesn't know
what sense of duty is, either.

913
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:18,310
Crazy psycho.

914
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:20,930
Anyway, we're doomed.

915
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:22,480
Why is that?

916
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,520
Oh Yang-chon is gone,
and we graduate in two weeks.

917
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,310
We're going out in the field
starting tomorrow.

918
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,860
The trainees who went out
in the field last year

919
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:31,690
dropped out one by one after every class.

920
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:36,530
Oh Yang-chon only left because he knows

921
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:37,870
we'll be quitting anyway.

922
01:08:38,370 --> 01:08:40,660
Why are our lives so complicated?

923
01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:43,460
Are you fucking kidding me?

924
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:47,500
Are you sure about that?
Is field training that tough?

925
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:50,550
It is. I heard it from a reliable source.

926
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:54,930
At protests, the academy students
always form the front line.

927
01:08:55,630 --> 01:08:58,300
Our seniors will only care
for those who survive it.

928
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,350
Fine. Bring it on.

929
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:02,850
I'll show you how feisty I can be.

930
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:06,020
Let's promise not to whine in the field.

931
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:09,900
We have to be tougher than the boys
and stay in formation.

932
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:12,570
-I agree.
-Bring it on.

933
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:15,280
I'll never break formation no matter what!

934
01:09:17,110 --> 01:09:17,990
This smells like ass.

935
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:22,450
You heard the rumors.

936
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:25,370
They say field training at protests
are meant to kill us.

937
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:27,620
-Let's survive it.
-That's right!

938
01:09:27,710 --> 01:09:30,130
Be careful until we make it
to our desired positions.

939
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:32,420
-We can survive this.
-We can survive this.

940
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,710
-Good luck.
-We can survive this.

941
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,630
-We can do this.
-We'll make it.

942
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:38,470
-Let's survive.
-Let's survive.

943
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:40,800
-Let's make it as police officers!
-Let's do this!

944
01:09:40,890 --> 01:09:42,510
-Let's survive.
-Let's do this.

945
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:45,810
-We can survive this.
-We'll become police officers!

946
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:58,490
I heard how it can be, but I'm scared

947
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:01,160
now that I have this on.

948
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:04,370
This isn't the 90s.

949
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:06,660
The police don't have
water cannons or tear gas.

950
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:09,500
Protesters don't throw firebombs either.

951
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:13,090
The building is the base of
a pseudo-religious cult.

952
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:16,510
I hear that there's a corpse.

953
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:18,510
We're going there to scout the place.

954
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:23,220
Hey, aren't you scared at all?

955
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:25,970
My goal is
to make it to the patrol division.

956
01:10:26,850 --> 01:10:28,100
I won't be intimidated.

957
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:29,690
You shouldn't be either.

958
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,190
CENTRAL POLICE ACADEMY

959
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:40,990
POLICE

960
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:23,370
Is everyone seated?

961
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:24,370
-Yes.
-Yes.

962
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:25,280
Let's go.

963
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:07,910
Attention.

964
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:11,250
Pass your batons to the front.

965
01:12:11,330 --> 01:12:13,000
-To the front!
-To the front!

966
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:20,920
Since they are taking our batons
it must not be that bad.

967
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:22,590
It must not be dangerous.

968
01:12:24,050 --> 01:12:27,930
I couldn't sleep thinking that
I had to hit people with it.

969
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,770
Be quiet, or we'll get a penalty point.

970
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:32,600
I'm three points away from expulsion.

971
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:34,230
I want to make it too.

972
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:37,020
Put your helmets on.

973
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:38,480
-Helmets on.
-Helmets on.

974
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:47,660
You will repeat loudly what I say.

975
01:12:48,370 --> 01:12:49,200
Today...

976
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:52,000
-"Today..."
-"Today..."

977
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,040
We won't take action.

978
01:12:56,290 --> 01:12:58,670
-"We won't take action."
-"We won't take action."

979
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:01,340
Again! Be alert and repeat what I say.

980
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:03,840
Today, we won't take action.

981
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:06,760
-"Today, we won't take action."
-"Today, we won't take action."

982
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:08,850
Not taking action means

983
01:13:08,930 --> 01:13:11,140
we won't budge even if we get hit.

984
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,220
-"Not taking action means
-"Not taking action means

985
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:16,190
-we won't budge even if we get hit."
-we won't budge even if we get hit."

986
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:17,730
Get your head straight!

987
01:13:18,230 --> 01:13:19,270
Repeat after me again.

988
01:13:20,190 --> 01:13:21,320
Not taking action means

989
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:24,490
we won't budge even if we get it.

990
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:26,650
-"Not taking action means
-"Not taking action means

991
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:29,870
-we won't budge even if we get hit."
-we won't budge even if we get hit."

992
01:13:29,950 --> 01:13:32,700
We won't be shoved
even if the protesters push hard.

993
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:35,750
"We won't be shoved
even if the protesters push hard."

994
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:38,370
We won't help our comrades
even if they get hit.

995
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:41,380
"We won't help our comrades
even if they get hit."

996
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:44,300
We will only move forward in formation.

997
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,050
"We will only focus on
moving forward in formation."

998
01:13:47,130 --> 01:13:49,300
We will get five penalty points
if we break formation.

999
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:51,510
"We will get five penalty points
if we break formation."

1000
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,390
We will be dismissed immediately
if we lose our shield to the protesters.

1001
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:57,520
"We will be dismissed immediately
if we lose our shield to the protesters."

1002
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,230
We will also be dismissed immediately
if we lose our helmet.

1003
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:02,770
"We will also be dismissed immediately
if we lose our helmet."

1004
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:04,070
Today...

1005
01:14:04,150 --> 01:14:05,030
-"Today..."
-"Today..."

1006
01:14:05,110 --> 01:14:06,400
We won't take action.

1007
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,160
-"We won't take action."
-"We won't take action."

1008
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:12,080
<i>We won't be shoved
even if the protesters push hard.</i>

1009
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:15,330
<i>"We won't be shoved
even if the protesters push hard."</i>

1010
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:17,870
<i>We won't help our comrades
even if they get hit.</i>

1011
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:20,460
"We won't help our comrades
even if they get hit."

1012
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:22,920
Today, we won't take action.

1013
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:26,800
-"Today, we won't take action."
-"Today, we won't take action."

1014
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:04,940
<i>Let's report it to the police.</i>

1015
01:15:05,530 --> 01:15:07,240
<i>Are you saying we should let him die?</i>

1016
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:09,070
I have a job.

1017
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:10,870
<i>I'm not a loser anymore!</i>

1018
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:15,370
-I'm Probationary Officer Yeom Sang-su.
-<i>Probationary Patrol Officers aren't cops.</i>

1019
01:15:15,870 --> 01:15:17,540
Instant noodles should be
regulated by law.

1020
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:19,790
You work for me. Remember that.

1021
01:15:20,630 --> 01:15:22,710
It feels creepy. Take your hand off me.

1022
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,300
<i>-Jang-mi.
-Just get out.</i>

1023
01:15:24,380 --> 01:15:25,800
JANG-MI

1024
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:27,680
Don't talk to me.

1025
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,050
-Idiots!
-Let him get inspected.

1026
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:31,350
Just do as you're told
if you're not going to quit.

1027
01:15:33,310 --> 01:15:34,350
A case like this

1028
01:15:34,430 --> 01:15:36,020
<i>is rare, right?</i>
