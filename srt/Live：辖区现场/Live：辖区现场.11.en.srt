EPISODE 11

3
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,480
Get off.

4
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,110
Take this off.

5
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,740
Take off the mask.

6
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,530
Damn it.

7
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,780
He has a piercing. That's Choi Jin.

8
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,490
You caught me.

9
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:31,870
Hey!

10
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,250
We got caught.

11
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,880
Let's go.

12
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,930
I am so pissed off

13
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,100
I might beat them to a pulp
if I stay here.

14
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,600
But I'm pretty sure you can't arrest us.

15
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,690
We're under 14.

16
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,270
Both of us are under 14.

17
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,860
We're only 13.

18
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,650
-Goodness.
-Jeez, look at that.

19
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,450
I guess you outwitted us cops.

20
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,700
So that means

21
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,950
you're aware that you'll be protected
by the law even if you commit a crime

22
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,790
because you're under 14, you little punk.

23
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,870
Of course I know that.

24
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,540
We can go home now, right?

25
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,460
All minors must be sent home

26
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,460
between midnight and 6 a.m.

27
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,840
Therefore, you can't
question nor arrest us.

28
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,970
If we don't question them,
we can't catch Man-yong today.

29
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,890
Then things will get complicated.
What do we do?

30
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,810
You kids probably think
that you're very smart.

31
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,350
But you're wrong.

32
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,360
I will... I mean,

33
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,360
we cops will show you
how scary this world actually is

34
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,400
-so that you can learn your lesson.
-Me too.

35
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,360
-Us too.
-Me too.

36
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,420
Jeong-o, what is it?

37
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,420
Seul-gi,

38
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,470
why are you here?

39
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,140
It's okay.

40
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,400
You're okay now.

41
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,150
Mom...

42
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,230
It's all right.

43
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,230
-Mom...
-You're okay now.

44
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,920
She said that her dad

45
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,920
touched her all over her body.

46
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,480
It's okay.

47
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,230
It's all right.

48
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,740
This is it.

49
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,120
Just because you're cops
doesn't mean you can do this.

50
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,700
We're minors. Please send us home.

51
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,700
-Or send us to Juvenile Affairs.
-Call my mom, please.

52
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:23,420
It's against the law
to take us in at this hour.

53
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,420
Cops must not violate the law.

54
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,380
-Jeez.
-Look at you, smarty-pants.

55
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,760
-You're so smart.
-You're too smart for your own good.

56
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,260
You must have a lot of experience.

57
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,800
Why? Does your mom get on her knees
and beg the patrol officers

58
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,220
and Juvenile Affairs
every time you caused trouble?

59
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,470
And if you act
apologetic and remorseful...

60
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,940
The judge will put you under protection
because you're under 14.

61
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,400
Then you'll stay home

62
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,360
and play video games
under your parents' protection.

63
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,280
Then you'll get a community service order,

64
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,070
and you'll half-heartedly clean restrooms
at schools or welfare facilities.

65
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,910
I guess that used to resolve everything.

66
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,660
That's right. Why?

67
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,450
Because we're 13.

68
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,870
But that only applies when you have
a fist fight with your friends.

69
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,670
You obviously don't know the law
well enough.

70
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,170
But this time,

71
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,550
you didn't do it alone.
You guys beat up someone together.

72
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,170
So it's considered a special case
of assault causing bodily harm.

73
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,800
You didn't just steal a kid's bag.

74
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,390
You used this pepper spray
on several people

75
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,470
and robbed them,
so it's a special theft case.

76
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,520
You also drove a stolen motorcycle,

77
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,520
and you hit a person with the bag,

78
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,730
so it's robbery as well.

79
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:27,560
In a case like this,
even if you're under 14,

80
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:28,810
the juvenile adjudication

81
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,860
won't be one, two or three,
as it has been in the past.

82
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,820
Rather, you will receive
eight, nine, or ten.

83
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,570
We'll tell you what they are.

84
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,120
Eight is being sent to juvenile detention
for one month.

85
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,540
Nine is being sent to juvenile detention
short term for six months.

86
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,880
Ten is being sent to juvenile detention
long term for up to two years.

87
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,250
In other words,

88
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,420
despite the fact that you're under 14,

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,340
you will be sent to
a juvenile detention center.

90
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,880
You didn't know that, right?

91
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,600
It's your first time committing
special assault, theft, and robbery.

92
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,060
You kids basically ruined your lives

93
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,140
for 100,000 won.

94
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,440
Guys, let's abide by the law
and send them home now.

95
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,190
Guard their homes and bring them in
for investigation first thing tomorrow.

96
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,900
We'll write a petition stating
they're not just kids

97
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,110
but are potential criminals.

98
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,820
As a result, they mustn't be released.

99
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,120
Make sure these kids get locked up
at a juvenile center this time.

100
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,120
Man-yong made us do it.

101
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,490
We got the motorcycle from him too.

102
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,080
We only did it to get paid.

103
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,170
He said that we wouldn't be punished
because we're under 14.

104
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,500
Find Man-yong.

105
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,600
Now, you're going to call Man-yong

106
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,430
and talk to him calmly
as if nothing happened.

107
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,390
Tell him that you'll return the bag to him

108
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,270
and that he can meet you here.

109
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,360
Right now.

110
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,400
Hey, I'm here.

111
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,750
Hey, where are you guys?

112
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,460
You bastards.

113
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,550
This is a trap, isn't it?

114
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,430
<i>No, it's not. Where are you now?</i>

115
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,480
Damn it...

116
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,720
Don't be a crybaby. Get up, you punk!

117
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,700
Captain An.

118
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,410
We sent Seul-gi
to her birth mother's place.

119
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,370
CAPTAIN AN JANG-MI

120
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,120
She said that she'll divorce her husband

121
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,460
and raise Seul-gi alone
if he's against raising her.

122
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,010
Okay.

123
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,300
We're going to start questioning
her adoptive father now.

124
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,680
There aren't any security cameras inside,

125
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,220
<i>but we got footage from a camera
at a building nearby</i>

126
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,180
<i>showing him molesting her
behind the building.</i>

127
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,100
She said that he would take her there

128
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,520
and touch her all over her body often.

129
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,480
She went to Go-eun's place
because she hated it.

130
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:05,990
She's a smart kid.

131
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,490
<i>That's why something worse was prevented.</i>

132
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,450
Are there signs of assault?

133
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,080
<i>Fortunately, there's none.</i>

134
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,830
It's just like the case
from seven years ago.

135
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,090
What a sneaky bastard.

136
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,420
I guess he'll be released
on probation again

137
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,300
because there are no signs of assault.

138
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,090
The law is to blame.

139
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,930
How can someone like him
get out on probation?

140
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,470
Molesting her is assault!

141
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,270
<i>-Good work.
-Thank you.</i>

142
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,330
She's alive.

143
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,500
Where did she hang herself?

144
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,750
In her room.

145
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,300
She's been suffering from depression
since the rape.

146
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,430
Thankfully, her brother found her early,
so she's okay now.

147
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,180
I'm coming from the hospital.

148
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,270
This is the real problem
with sexual assault cases.

149
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,270
There's a high chance for
secondary incidents.

150
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,270
I agree.

151
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,770
The rape case last month happened
on the fifth trail at Mount Baekun.

152
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,940
This girl, who tried to take her own life,
was raped

153
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,820
on the second trail at Mount Baekun.

154
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,650
And a year ago,

155
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,870
there was another case
on Mount Somyeong's 11th trail,

156
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,870
which is connected to Mount Baekun.

157
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:33,450
This

158
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,700
is clearly a serial case.

159
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,950
The higher-ups don't think so.

160
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,250
As for the case
on Mount Somyeong's 11th trail,

161
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,880
the victim reported it to us
two months after it happened.

162
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,760
While both victims were in middle school,
and the perp took their name tags,

163
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,130
whether or not the perp used a condom
and a mat are unknown.

164
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,140
The victim couldn't remember.
They happened in different areas too.

165
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,220
They said we must look at it
as separate cases,

166
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,600
and we can't start a task force.

167
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,600
So in other words, another pretty girl

168
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,440
must be brutally assaulted like this

169
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,900
for the police to
come to their senses, right?

170
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,150
Congressmen are too selfish

171
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,030
to be concerned with
giving us more manpower.

172
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,950
Where's Man-yong?

173
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,250
Officer Min.

174
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,210
Let Man-yong's father
into the interrogation room.

175
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,340
This way, please.

176
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,720
You guys should call it a day.

177
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,890
Yes, good work, guys.

178
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:33,970
You should get some sleep.

179
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,100
You have to come back to work soon,
so get going.

180
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,560
-See you tomorrow.
-Sure.

181
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,890
-Right.
-Good night.

182
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,310
-You too.
-Good night.

183
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,190
-What about you?
-Good night, sir.

184
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,400
I'm going to see how it unfolds.

185
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,780
-Text me when you get word.
-Yes, sir.

186
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,860
-Good job, sir.
-You too.

187
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:50,900
-Good job.
-Thanks.

188
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,280
Good job, you guys.

189
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,780
-Good job, sir.
-You too.

190
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,370
Good job, sir.

191
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,840
I'll wait while you write your report.

192
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,050
Let's grab something to eat.

193
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,550
Let's go home and eat.

194
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,120
Let's grab something to eat.

195
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,840
Let's go home and eat.

196
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,020
You can go home.

197
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:22,860
I won't be long.

198
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,240
I'm taking Lieutenant Lee home,

199
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,790
so you're on your own.

200
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,290
Damn it.

201
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,960
Shouldn't the kid you found
enter the system instead?

202
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,630
If the mom remarried
but kept her husband in the dark,

203
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,130
something like this might happen again.

204
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,260
She can raise her daughter alone.

205
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,390
But that's not an easy thing to do.

206
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,940
Why do you think that?

207
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,520
I was raised by a single mom too.

208
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,360
I'm tired,

209
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,410
so I'd rather head home once I'm done.

210
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,540
I'll take a rain check.

211
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,590
You imbecile!

212
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,720
-You're supposed to be studying--
-Sir, please.

213
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,670
-Let go of me!
-Please.

214
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,180
-Sir, calm down.
-What about your grades?

215
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,800
-Sir, please.
-Why waste your time--

216
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,770
Don't do that here.

217
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,440
Take Man-yong home

218
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,440
and when Juvenile Affairs calls...

219
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,110
The happy slap attack crew

220
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:54,860
is deliberately framing my son for this.

221
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,870
<i>-...juvenile detention this time.
-Man-yong made us do it.</i>

222
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,500
<i>We got the motorcycle from him too.</i>

223
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,590
The one who recorded this video

224
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,550
is Man-yong.

225
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,050
Please don't even think about

226
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:19,510
putting the blame
on those poor underage boys.

227
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,640
I believe that would be best.

228
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:22,980
This is only a sample

229
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,810
of the evidence we have on Man-yong.

230
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,900
Lieutenant, Man-yong is only 17.

231
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,410
The police is supposed to
provide a future for youngsters,

232
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:39,780
so don't go harsh on him.

233
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,870
If the press finds out about
how you got beaten by teenagers,

234
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,290
your reputation will be ruined

235
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,750
as well as the police's dignity--

236
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,000
Our dignity...

237
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,130
is ours to worry about, so stay out of it.

238
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,510
I'll

239
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,180
be retiring soon,

240
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,060
so there's no reputation to worry about.

241
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,100
I'm

242
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,610
seeing this case through.

243
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:12,770
Fine!

244
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,530
We'll see you in court!

245
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,280
Damn it.

246
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,780
Don't you know who I am?

247
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,820
Who do you think you're--

248
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,120
We are very well aware of who you are.

249
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,660
You're in the school violence committee,

250
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,250
the leader of your neighborhood watch,

251
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,710
and you're a CEO of a company
that's worth billions.

252
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,460
You're also...

253
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,720
A council candidate who has
a lot of power and money.

254
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,890
So what? What does that change?

255
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,470
What should we do then?

256
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,930
I'm going to my wife's place.

257
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,560
You're divorced,
Why do you keep going there?

258
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,230
I still love her despite our divorce.

259
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,230
And I need to get my car. Why?

260
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,030
Your phone's ringing.
Why aren't you picking up?

261
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,910
It's my dad, so I'm ignoring it.

262
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,870
Why are you ignoring your dad?

263
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,120
I'll get going.

264
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,800
I like Jeong-o a lot.

265
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,300
I can't let Myeong-ho have her.

266
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,180
What a psycho.

267
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,230
FATHER

268
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,490
What?

269
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,820
<i>What?</i>

270
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,120
<i>You called, so what do you need?</i>

271
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,970
What are you doing?

272
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,220
Why aren't you saying anything?

273
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,720
<i>I'm glad that you're alive.</i>

274
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,470
What?

275
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:13,150
I'm glad nothing happened,
and you're in one piece.

276
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,810
I know how you all feel about this,

277
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,940
but this was act of an immature child.

278
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,780
You keep calling him a child,

279
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,440
but he's no ordinary teenager.

280
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,740
He hired underage boys

281
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,570
to assault a police officer
who was on his way home.

282
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,950
He got an unregistered motorcycle

283
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,870
and led thefts.

284
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,410
He is a criminal suspect.

285
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,290
I understand this is
an emotional case for you,

286
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,960
-but if you think rationally--
-I will

287
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,710
make sure he pays for his crime.

288
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,340
When my wounds are no longer visible,

289
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:29,390
I might regret not disregarding the matter

290
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,930
as an act committed by

291
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,230
a clueless teenager.

292
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,150
However,
that thought hasn't crossed my mind yet.

293
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,650
My colleagues and I will write a petition

294
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,110
asking for Man-yong
to be punished by the law.

295
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,360
Fine!

296
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,120
Bring it on. I'll see you in court!

297
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,660
Getting beaten by teenagers
is nothing to brag about.

298
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,000
Sir, I ask this of you.

299
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,960
For Man-yong,

300
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,000
keep your word

301
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,670
and fight until the end
against the police.

302
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,090
What?

303
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,430
<i>Let me go this once!</i>

304
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,930
My dad will kill me!

305
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,600
<i>When Man-yong was caught smoking,</i>

306
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:15,810
<i>he begged me to not tell him father.</i>

307
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,150
<i>He must've been desperate,</i>

308
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,570
but I didn't listen to him.

309
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:26,780
He has a father

310
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,490
who beats him when he makes a mistake,

311
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,040
and he met a police officer
who disregarded his request.

312
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,950
Why did you coerce them like that?

313
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,960
Damn you!

314
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,210
<i>He probably hates</i>

315
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,790
<i>all adults.</i>

316
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,880
Still,

317
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,130
I'll do everything in my power

318
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,510
to see

319
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,640
that he is punished by law.

320
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,100
He needs to know that actions

321
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,020
have consequences.

322
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,900
However, I want you, as his father,

323
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,240
to think of his future

324
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,400
and plead so that

325
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,070
he gets a lesser sentence.

326
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,580
That way,

327
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,870
while he may not trust anyone
in this world,

328
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,420
even though the police turned their backs
on him when he was desperate,

329
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,050
at least let him know that his father

330
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,340
has his back.

331
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,860
Bring Man-yong in tomorrow.

332
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,070
Leave for now.

333
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,450
Get up.

334
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,580
Let's go.

335
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:15,970
Get going.

336
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,640
Go home.

337
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,980
Kids are never the ones to blame.

338
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,650
Adults ruin them.

339
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,360
Adults ruin the kids,

340
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:31,030
and the kids get in trouble
and get punished.

341
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,530
Those kids grow up

342
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,910
and ruin their kids.

343
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,210
The police arrest them,

344
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,170
but crimes continue to be committed.

345
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,020
Go home, Han-sol.

346
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,230
You don't look too well.

347
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,330
Why bother taking me home?
It's such a hassle.

348
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,960
Just because. I couldn't sleep.

349
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,140
MY LAST ROOKIE

350
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,560
What are you doing?

351
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,770
MY FIRST MENTOR

352
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,490
I'm sorry that you got stuck
with an old man for a mentor.

353
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,540
I know.

354
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,590
What are you doing?

355
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,050
You're like a dad to me.

356
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,300
We can hold hands.

357
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,480
You really seem like my dad.

358
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:32,730
You fool.

359
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,200
-Go to Sujeong-dong.
-Okay.

360
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,030
Why Sujeong-dong?

361
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,160
I'll drop you off.

362
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,080
Mentor.

363
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,550
When do you retire?

364
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,590
I think I have 32 days to go.

365
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,750
He dozes off whenever he tries to study.

366
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:07,540
Holy...

367
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,170
He watches porn?

368
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,420
I should just...

369
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,460
Darn it.

370
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,050
That really scared me.

371
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,700
Don't wake her. She'll just get annoyed.

372
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,450
What's wrong with Song-yi's hand?

373
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,530
It looks like she got scratched.

374
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,540
She said she scratched herself

375
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,660
while fighting her boyfriend.

376
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,460
She fought with him?

377
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,330
Why did they fight?

378
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
How would I know?

379
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,210
She said it's nothing,
that I shouldn't bother.

380
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,130
She said she'll deal with it.

381
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:53,890
Honey.

382
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:00,690
Jang-mi.

383
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,230
Why do you look so sad?

384
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:10,580
I know.

385
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:13,580
I feel down tonight.

386
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:17,580
Shall I sing for you?

387
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,340
You used to sleep well when I sang to you.

388
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,550
Okay.

389
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,530
<i>Sometimes the path home</i>

390
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,530
<i>Is too long</i>

391
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:58,830
<i>Which makes me even wearier</i>

392
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,750
<i>As soon as I open the door</i>

393
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,720
<i>I fall right asleep</i>

394
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,760
<i>When I wake, there's no one there</i>

395
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:17,480
<i>When I laid my body</i>

396
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,600
Oh Yang-chon.

397
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,440
Your mom.

398
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,570
Let's have her die with dignity.

399
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:36,580
<i>Inside a small bathtub</i>

400
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:42,250
<i>A little snail</i>

401
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,630
<i>Came up to me</i>

402
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,840
<i>And in a small voice</i>

403
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,680
<i>It whispered</i>

404
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:01,730
Your dad is right.

405
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,690
<i>One day</i>

406
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:04,980
We did nothing for her

407
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,480
and can do nothing more.

408
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:09,280
<i>In the far future</i>

409
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,780
For our peace of mind,

410
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,530
-she's on a ventilator.
-<i>I'll go to the wide</i>

411
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,540
-Lying in a bed.
-<i>and rough ocean</i>

412
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,620
<i>at the edge of the world</i>

413
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,830
Don't you feel sorry?

414
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,840
<i>Nobody</i>

415
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,550
The doctor recommended it too.

416
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:33,010
-<i>Has seen it, but
-He said she can't breathe on her own,</i>

417
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,470
-so we should take her off.
-<i>I'll follow</i>

418
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,970
<i>the sound of waves</i>

419
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,770
<i>somewhere in my memory</i>

420
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:49,440
<i>I'll go</i>

421
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,360
<i>Forever</i>

422
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,280
Give it some serious thought.

423
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,750
<i>Everybody</i>

424
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:03,920
<i>Is driving somewhere on that road</i>

425
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:09,000
<i>I'm in a cafe on a street corner</i>

426
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,340
<i>I hold a cigarette</i>

427
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,010
<i>And a melting ice cream</i>

428
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:22,980
<i>and I head out into the street</i>

429
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:30,190
<i>The sun is high in the sky</i>

430
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,110
<i>And it's stabbing down at me</i>

431
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,570
Young girls

432
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,030
keep getting raped

433
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:40,830
in the mountains in the area.

434
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,210
-<i>It came to me
-But...</i>

435
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:48,750
-<i>And said hello
-the suspect doesn't leave any traces.</i>

436
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,130
My heart aches.

437
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,220
<i>And started singing</i>

438
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:59,010
<i>One day</i>

439
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,470
I must be getting old.

440
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,520
-In the past, I was determined
-<i>In the far future</i>

441
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,480
to catch the assailant whenever
I encountered a case like this.

442
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:11,690
-<i>I'll go to the wide and rough ocean
-But these days,</i>

443
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:15,650
-<i>at the edge of the world
-I keep getting disheartened.</i>

444
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,030
Should I...

445
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,910
leave the force?

446
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,990
<i>Nobody</i>

447
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,160
You earn money,

448
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,000
so should I just become
a stay-at-home mom?

449
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,250
<i>Has seen it, but</i>

450
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:43,310
<i>But I'll follow the sound of the waves</i>

451
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:47,560
<i>Somewhere in my memories</i>

452
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:53,480
<i>I'll go</i>

453
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,700
<i>Forever</i>

454
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,650
<i>Honey, I'll seriously think about
what you said about my mom.</i>

455
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,440
<i>Make sure you eat breakfast.</i>

456
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:12,060
There are some single mothers
like your mom who raise their kids well.

457
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,190
But?

458
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:15,270
Like Senior Officer Choi said,
sending Seul-gi

459
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,400
to an institution might be
better than her birth mom raising her.

460
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,030
How can it be better?

461
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,870
Sending her to an institution doesn't mean
their relationship ends.

462
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,790
If her mom can visit her once a week,

463
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,290
it'll be much better
both financially and mentally.

464
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:36,420
Her mom is being emotional now
when she can't afford to raise her.

465
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:40,050
-Her husband has no idea.
-I said she's willing to divorce him.

466
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:43,800
Your mom and my mom...

467
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,010
They struggled.

468
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,600
A lot.

469
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,390
That's why I was neglected.

470
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:01,110
I don't know where I'd be now
if I didn't have my brother.

471
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,860
My mom was an alcoholic.

472
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,240
I wanted to go to an orphanage

473
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,000
if I could eat three meals a day.

474
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:22,050
Jeong-o and Sang-su,
why do you guys look so serious now?

475
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,140
Are you two dating?

476
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,680
We are going to.

477
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:31,020
Gosh, stop it.

478
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:33,310
Don't do that.

479
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,940
RED GINSENG DRINK

480
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,190
Drink it all.

481
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,860
It helps you overcome fatigue.

482
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,950
Did you hear our conversation?

483
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:46,450
What conversation?

484
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,870
Go get changed. Let's eat.

485
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:51,040
Okay.

486
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,760
Jeong-o.

487
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:05,380
Please go out with Sang-su, will you?

488
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,760
I'd love to have
a daughter-in-law like you.

489
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,390
Gosh, what a snob.

490
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,770
Ms. Lee.

491
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,100
What about me?

492
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,730
Stop eating food with your fingers.
It's so dirty.

493
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,320
You're lucky she didn't hear it.

494
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,740
If your mom heard that
you wanted to go live at an orphanage,

495
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,910
she'd be so heartbroken.

496
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:40,670
Both Sang-su and Senior Officer Choi
have a point.

497
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,000
Getting a divorce isn't easy.

498
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,800
Send Seul-gi's mom
the informational packets on institutions.

499
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:04,530
Where are you going?

500
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,950
I'm going to call Senior Officer Choi
and apologize.

501
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,160
I'll also send Seul-gi's mom

502
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,820
informational packets on institutions.

503
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,000
You may be right this time.

504
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:19,000
The mom will suffer if she gets a divorce.

505
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:23,420
It'll make things harder for Seul-gi too,
so I'll do it for her sake.

506
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,970
You helped him.

507
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:34,930
With what?

508
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,060
You didn't have to take
Senior Officer Choi's side like that.

509
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:42,810
You should've just agreed with Jeong-o

510
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,360
and pitted them against each other.

511
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,320
I can't lie.

512
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,360
Then you'll be single forever

513
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:54,950
while Jeong-o and Senior Officer Choi
become closer.

514
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,790
Just watch. I know I'm right.

515
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,540
Look at him.

516
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:07,840
Should I speak comfortably now?

517
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,310
I was right, wasn't I?

518
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,810
Those two are getting close,
while you're all alone.

519
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:35,530
YEOM SANG-SU

520
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,240
<i>Are you having fun?</i>

521
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:57,180
Mahyeon 1-dong, 124-7.

522
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:00,140
We received a call about an assault case
involving two neighbors.

523
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,980
Patrol 18 has been dispatched. Last call.

524
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,650
Patrol 18 has been dispatched.

525
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,230
Please move back.

526
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,310
We have to go on patrol,

527
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,350
but I can't wake her
because she's sound asleep.

528
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,480
We still have time,
so I'll let her get more sleep.

529
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,620
I was right, wasn't I?

530
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,200
They keep getting closer,

531
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:04,080
while you're all alone and lonely.

532
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,290
Come in after a minute.

533
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,470
That poor guy.

534
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:23,970
You can drink this.

535
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,230
Seung-jae likes you.

536
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,400
What's he talking about?

537
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,020
It's time to go on patrol, isn't it?

538
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,400
Why are you sitting like that?

539
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:22,200
You'll say that I'm crazy if I tell you
that I want to kiss you now, right?

540
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:24,330
Yes, you already know.

541
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,500
Touch my hair.

542
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,170
-Why?
-Just mess up my hair,

543
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:35,380
and tell me to leave, get my act together,

544
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,170
and go back to work.

545
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:42,590
Leave, get your act together,
and go back to work.

546
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:53,560
You're being too nice to him.

547
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:56,570
It'll be easier if you hate him instead.

548
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,400
I think Sang-su is fun.

549
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:01,160
He's cute and comfortable to be around.

550
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,870
What about Officer Choi?

551
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,290
I just like him.

552
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,170
Then you'll end up with Sang-su.

553
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:16,000
Someone who makes you laugh always wins.

554
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:17,670
At least from my experience.

555
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:21,430
Don't be absurd.

556
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,680
I'm glad you weren't hurt more.

557
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,810
Are you going to ignore me now?

558
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,440
I'm just as glad.

559
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:44,450
I agree with you.

560
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,160
Finally, he speaks.

561
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,680
Did you eat yet?

562
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,180
How's your eye, sir?

563
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:15,310
-Hey!
-Yes, sir?

564
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,860
Help me with these drops.

565
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,480
-Sure.
-Of course.

566
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,280
It looks much better now.

567
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,780
You're right.

568
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:30,830
-That stings!
-Are you kidding me?

569
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:33,080
-Why did you hurt him?
-You should've done better.

570
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,000
I'll help you, sir.

571
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,670
I'll have the father-to-be help me.

572
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:38,380
Did you hear that?

573
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,500
The father-to-be. That's me.

574
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:41,710
Do a good job this time.

575
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:49,430
Have Sang-su do it.

576
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,680
I'm more thorough.

577
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:14,330
Miss, are you all right? Can I help you?

578
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,790
I'm...

579
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:19,250
I'm here to file a report.

580
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,300
I'm too weak right now.

581
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:32,220
My ex-boyfriend

582
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,890
came to my house and murdered my dog.

583
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,600
RESTRICTED AREA

584
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,240
-What is your emergency?
-My sister...

585
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,820
She was raped.

586
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:32,320
We're at Mount Somyeong.

587
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:33,910
Please help us.

588
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:39,460
My sister, please... My sister...

589
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:42,790
Help my sister...

590
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:17,080
<i>My daughters are safe
because I'll protect them.</i>

591
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:31,340
Did you know

592
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:35,350
those sisters are from the family
whose husband beats the wife?

593
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,760
Yes.

594
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:40,430
I remember seeing their bright smiles
in a photo inside the house.

595
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:47,270
Jeong-o.

596
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,440
Ride shotgun. I'll drive.

597
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:50,940
Sang-su, ride with us.

598
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:08,550
I want the perimeter
set up as wide as possible!

599
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:10,590
To canvas the area for footprints,

600
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:12,510
we will set up a wide perimeter!

601
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:15,800
-Sure thing.
-We will set up a wide perimeter!

602
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:18,680
We will set up a wide perimeter!

603
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:25,690
The Forensics Team got called
to a fire in Mapo 1-dong.

604
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,440
It'll be a while before they get to us.

605
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:39,990
Four paramedics,

606
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,750
Nam-il, Jeong-o, and Sang-su escorted
the victims to the Sunflower Center.

607
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,460
The paramedics, who got here first,
cut the rope to free the younger sister.

608
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:49,920
Saving her took priority
than preserving the scene.

609
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,340
The culprit knocked out the sister,
but she woke up and called for help.

610
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:57,930
She doesn't know
when exactly this all happened.

611
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:00,930
The culprit used a clove hitch knot.

612
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:03,180
and secured it with a flat knot.

613
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:05,350
He's a skilled hiker.

614
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:07,900
The rope is brand new.

615
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:12,110
If he shopped beforehand,
then this was premeditated.

616
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:33,710
Do you think it's his footprint?

617
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:37,720
I saw the same footprints
while coming up here,

618
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,550
but they got lost
after reaching the hiking trail.

619
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,980
I estimate 280mm.

620
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:53,020
Thanks to the rain last night,
we have a clean print.

621
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:56,240
We'll be able to pinpoint
the brand and where it was sold.

622
00:47:57,490 --> 00:47:59,200
We'll ID him if he paid via card,

623
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:03,700
and get a face
once we check the surveillance footage.

624
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:05,450
It'll take time though.

625
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,680
Please don't make me live with my dad.

626
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:51,360
KYEONG-JIN

627
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:07,670
CALL HISTORY
KYEONG-JIN

628
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:43,660
If he raped her where the rope is tied,

629
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:45,580
there should be signs of a struggle.

630
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:47,910
Why is the ground undisturbed?

631
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:50,750
We won't know for sure
until Forensics get here,

632
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:52,840
but I think it's a serial.

633
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,340
The criminal

634
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:58,090
spreads something on the ground,
uses a condom,

635
00:49:58,590 --> 00:49:59,800
and doesn't leave evidence.

636
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,140
He did the same thing last month

637
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:04,970
on Mount Baekun near here.

638
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:07,480
He left the mat,

639
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,980
and we found nothing on it.

640
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:11,810
What's strange was

641
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,560
we found his footprints then too,

642
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:15,400
but they're different.

643
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:17,610
It was a size 295mm.

644
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:20,200
They were definitely larger than these.

645
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:34,590
Kyeong-mi.

646
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:37,510
Where are you?

647
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:40,680
Aren't you going to go to the library?

648
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:44,680
Where are you, Kyeong-mi?

649
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,060
Kyeong-mi.

650
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:56,320
Kyeong-mi, where are you?

651
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:19,380
Leave my sister alone!

652
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:25,720
KIM KYEONG-JIN

653
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:44,570
He hit her older sister with a rock

654
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:46,160
and spread the mat here.

655
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:48,740
The paramedics said

656
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,710
the girl called in
her younger sister's rape.

657
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:56,540
It wasn't just her.

658
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:58,920
It's likely the older sister
was raped too.

659
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:02,840
Damn it.

660
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,640
We found tracks of wild dogs

661
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,010
up the trail.

662
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:09,930
He seemed very careful.

663
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,060
I wondered why he left the rope and fled.

664
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:14,890
It must've been the dogs' barking.

665
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,360
Kang Nam-il.

666
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:19,400
How are the sisters?

667
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:22,530
A medical team just took them into a room.

668
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:24,860
In the ambulance,

669
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:26,910
the older girl said they weren't raped.

670
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:29,030
Some guy just hit them,

671
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:32,290
and she wanted to go home
instead of talking about it.

672
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:34,910
So? What happens now?

673
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:38,130
The center's officer
is out on another case,

674
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:41,210
so Han Jeong-o went inside
to help the doctors persuade them.

675
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:44,130
As you know, male officers can't go in,

676
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:45,260
so we're outside.

677
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:49,220
Okay. Call me at regular intervals.

678
00:52:57,810 --> 00:53:00,900
The tracks show a definite out-toed gait.

679
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:02,940
Right?

680
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:09,070
I want to go home.

681
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:12,200
Kyeong-jin.

682
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:15,750
Let's go home.

683
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:18,870
This goes into your vagina

684
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,250
to take evidence,

685
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:21,840
and this goes into your anus.

686
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,670
Send us home.

687
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:27,010
My sister and I, we both want to go home.

688
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:32,010
If you refuse to let us get samples,

689
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:34,890
then we can't help you.

690
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,020
We can't catch the person
who did this to you.

691
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,360
Within a short period,
we need blood, urine,

692
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,030
-vaginal--
-We weren't raped.

693
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:47,820
I told you and the paramedics.

694
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:49,240
And here.

695
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,990
We weren't raped.

696
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,120
Some crazy man just hit us.

697
00:53:56,370 --> 00:53:57,790
And

698
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:00,210
I don't want to catch the man
who did this.

699
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:03,880
Your sister was bleeding from down there.

700
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:07,800
We have a record

701
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:12,220
of you calling to report her rape.

702
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,140
It's devastating,

703
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:18,850
but this could lead to a pregnancy.

704
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:23,060
She must take a morning-after pill
within 72 hours.

705
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:28,440
You can't go home like this.

706
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,820
Let us help you.

707
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:34,160
You were at our house last time.

708
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,910
You didn't help us then.

709
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:40,000
After you left,

710
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:44,210
our dad hit us more than he used to.

711
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:47,760
-Forget it.
-Let's get it right.

712
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:50,930
We didn't refuse to help you.

713
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:53,890
Your mother refused our help.

714
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:57,310
Let's hand them over to
their guardian for now.

715
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:01,690
We administered first aid,

716
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:04,690
and we can't take samples
if the victim refuses.

717
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,020
Let me talk to them.

718
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:08,400
Let's talk outside.

719
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,290
Is your priority

720
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,460
catching the perpetrator

721
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,080
or caring for those girls?

722
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,290
Stick to your manual.

723
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,710
If the victim refuses,

724
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,800
we cannot and should not
proceed any further.

725
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:35,590
The girls were hurt physically
but psychologically too.

726
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,390
Don't you dare...

727
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:38,970
Don't push them.

728
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:44,900
We can't proceed
if they don't give a statement.

729
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:47,060
Even if we catch the man,

730
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,150
we can't prosecute him.

731
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:51,110
This terrible event

732
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,740
will be swept away
as if it never happened.

733
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:57,870
I'm a doctor,

734
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:00,290
and the girls are my priority.

735
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:16,010
Shall we call your mom or your dad?

736
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:17,600
Just let us go.

737
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:22,020
I can't force you to give samples,

738
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:24,890
but if you don't let us
contact your parents,

739
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:27,400
I can't let you go.

740
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:33,440
-Sexual assault--
-It was just assault.

741
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:36,160
Even if it was just assault,

742
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:39,070
you called the police to the scene.

743
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:41,120
The manual says

744
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,200
minors should be
handed over to a guardian.

745
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,330
Give me a number.

746
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:50,790
This is cancer.

747
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:03,560
Damn it.
I had my suspicions, and I was right.

748
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:22,580
Honey.

749
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,500
What, a loan?

750
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,500
Your brother never has
a good business idea,

751
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:34,590
and he always wants a loan.

752
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:38,340
Am I a bank? Do whatever you want!

753
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:42,100
Remortgage the house or mortgage me,

754
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:43,390
I don't care!

755
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:51,020
So...

756
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:57,610
That's cancer.

757
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,490
What's that below it?

758
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:02,660
This?

759
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:09,040
Just tell me!

760
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:12,040
I have to get back to work.

761
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:25,850
If they refused to give a statement,

762
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:28,390
we can't put together
a special task force.

763
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:33,110
We don't know his face,
so we can't make a sketch and go public.

764
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,280
What now?

765
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:38,280
What else?

766
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:41,110
We have to wait for another victim.

767
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:44,280
All we can do is wait
for kids to get hurt.

768
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:51,120
Whether they put together
a task force or not,

769
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:52,960
I'll check camera footage

770
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,960
from Mount Somyeong's Trail 11

771
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,460
to the nearby bus stop

772
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:58,170
closest to the crime scene.

773
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:00,130
Without a warrant?

774
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:01,510
I'll ask for help.

775
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:03,720
I'll run it by my boss.

776
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,100
Get out.

777
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:09,060
I'll get you some clean clothes from home.

778
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:11,350
You'll spend tonight at work anyway.

779
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:14,690
Bye.

780
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:29,200
SONG-YI

781
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:41,090
<i>My ex-boyfriend</i>

782
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:44,300
<i>came to my house and murdered my dog.</i>

783
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:48,510
What happened?

784
00:59:49,770 --> 00:59:51,060
I was goofing off with a friend.

785
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:53,140
<i>She said she scratched herself</i>

786
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:55,150
<i>while fighting her boyfriend.</i>

787
00:59:58,230 --> 01:00:01,030
Why isn't she answering?

788
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:04,570
<i>The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable at this time.</i>

789
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:22,840
Ma'am, one second.

790
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:29,850
I think the girls

791
01:00:30,810 --> 01:00:32,770
are hiding the rape from their mom.

792
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:35,560
Did you inform them in detail

793
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:37,400
of the possibility of pregnancy

794
01:00:37,810 --> 01:00:39,270
or sexually transmitted diseases?

795
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:42,110
She did.

796
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:44,700
The mother will only believe her kids,

797
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:46,820
and the kids won't admit it.

798
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:49,530
They even signed a form
to refuse our help.

799
01:00:53,330 --> 01:00:54,660
I'll take them home then.

800
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:58,330
There's no room in the car,
so get your own ride back.

801
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:34,410
Do you want to take the bus?

802
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:36,500
I'd rather walk.

803
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:39,580
I'm taking the bus.

804
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:42,800
I'm going to the station to figure out
how we can help them.

805
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,510
Hurry. You need to return your firearm
and go home.

806
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:48,340
It's almost 10:50 p.m.

807
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:12,490
<i>Of course I'll be home by 11 p.m.</i>

808
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:15,290
<i>It's only 10:48.</i>

809
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:21,420
I'll be home soon.

810
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:24,460
Jeong Da-yeong.

811
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:26,380
You worry too much.

812
01:02:27,970 --> 01:02:29,220
Fine.

813
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:31,800
I'll call you when I get home.

814
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:33,350
All right.

815
01:02:37,310 --> 01:02:38,770
Take her to the mountain!

816
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,980
<i>This is the younger sister's phone.</i>

817
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:48,070
The victims refused to testify,
so it's not a valid case.

818
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:49,860
Therefore, this isn't evidence.

819
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:51,410
Could you return it?

820
01:03:16,510 --> 01:03:17,970
I was just going to say good night.

821
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:22,190
I'll see you tomorrow.

822
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:35,160
SENIOR OFFICER CHOI MYEONG-HO

823
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:04,600
Has she gone insane?

824
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,730
Jeong-o, what's with this mess?

825
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:10,820
Your bag and clothes
are tossed everywhere.

826
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:13,570
Why is their dirt on your clothes?

827
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:16,570
Jeong-o. Jeong-o?

828
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:18,740
Are you taking a shower?

829
01:04:19,870 --> 01:04:20,990
Jeong-o!

830
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:23,290
Did you fall down?

831
01:04:24,290 --> 01:04:25,290
My goodness.

832
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:28,420
Jeong-o, answer me!

833
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:30,460
Are you sick?

834
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,090
Jeong-o, please open up!

835
01:04:39,470 --> 01:04:40,390
Jeong-o!

836
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:44,520
<i>She can't come to the phone.</i>

837
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:47,060
<i>She is taking a bath with Kyeong-mi.</i>

838
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,080
Ma'am,

839
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:05,410
I found Kyeong-mi's phone

840
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:07,790
at the scene.

841
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,790
I'll swing by to give it to her.

842
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:14,300
I'll call you when I get there,
so please send Kyeong-jin out.

843
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:33,730
Where are the girls?

844
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,420
Where are the girls?

845
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,140
Kyeong-mi,

846
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:07,980
nothing happened to you.

847
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:10,440
You know that, right?

848
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:22,030
Kyeong-mi!

849
01:06:23,490 --> 01:06:25,120
Kyeong-jin!

850
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:29,960
Kyeong-jin...

851
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,540
Kyeong-jin.

852
01:06:33,170 --> 01:06:34,880
Kyeong-jin!

853
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:36,630
Kyeong-mi!

854
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:42,590
I'm fine as long as I have you.

855
01:06:44,810 --> 01:06:46,010
So pull yourself together.

856
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:48,850
You can overcome this.

857
01:07:25,970 --> 01:07:27,720
Have you called your sister?

858
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:28,770
She's not answering.

859
01:07:29,850 --> 01:07:31,230
Lock the doors before going to bed.

860
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,520
Hey!

861
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:37,150
Didn't you hear me just now?

862
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:39,150
I got it!

863
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,440
Living room lights and TV must be on

864
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:45,160
and the upper and lower door latches
must be fastened.

865
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:48,080
I'll keep calling Song-yi
until she gets home.

866
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,160
Satisfied?

867
01:07:58,920 --> 01:07:59,960
You...

868
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,880
If I catch you
watching porn one more time,

869
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,510
I'll beat the crap out of you.

870
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:20,030
<i>The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable at this time.</i>

871
01:08:20,110 --> 01:08:21,150
SONG-YI

872
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:28,330
No, stop it. Get off me!

873
01:08:28,990 --> 01:08:31,080
Get off me. Please don't.

874
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:32,790
I want to go home.

875
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,040
No, don't! I don't want to!

876
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:39,210
Don't!

877
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:41,420
No, I want to go home.

878
01:08:42,090 --> 01:08:43,510
What's wrong with you?

879
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:45,760
No!

880
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,010
No, don't.

881
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:49,800
I want to go home.

882
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:51,930
-Shut up!
-Don't do this!

883
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:53,310
Stop it!

884
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:54,810
What the hell?

885
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,860
Dad, what are you doing?

886
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:01,230
Dad!

887
01:09:02,190 --> 01:09:04,070
Dad, no.

888
01:09:04,150 --> 01:09:05,950
Dad, stop!

889
01:09:06,450 --> 01:09:08,110
Dad, please. You have the wrong idea.

890
01:09:15,710 --> 01:09:16,830
Is this the police?

891
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:18,750
Please stop my dad.

892
01:09:18,830 --> 01:09:20,380
He's assaulting someone.

893
01:09:24,970 --> 01:09:26,220
<i>Hello?</i>

894
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:29,720
<i>Hello? How may I help you?</i>

895
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:17,390
Give me the phone.

896
01:10:17,850 --> 01:10:19,480
My dad is home.
I have to get back quickly.

897
01:10:28,030 --> 01:10:29,030
About today...

898
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:35,290
You'll never be able to forget
what happened.

899
01:10:38,910 --> 01:10:40,920
Just like how I still remember
what happened...

900
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,760
at 10:48 p.m.

901
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:55,890
that day 12 years ago,

902
01:10:59,430 --> 01:11:00,480
you'll never...

903
01:11:03,770 --> 01:11:04,770
forget

904
01:11:05,770 --> 01:11:07,150
what happened today.

905
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:40,350
<i>What is a sense of duty?</i>

906
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:42,730
Not wanting to see
what happened today ever again.

907
01:11:42,810 --> 01:11:43,850
How can you take his side?

908
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:46,400
He's your dad before he's a cop.

909
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,480
A chief of a patrol division means...

910
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:50,490
<i>He can't fly or go underground.</i>

911
01:11:54,070 --> 01:11:57,620
<i>If we checked two, three times
and no one bought those shoes,</i>

912
01:11:57,740 --> 01:11:59,290
<i>then where did he get them?</i>

913
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:02,870
<i>My mom</i>

914
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,420
<i>had no choice.</i>

915
01:12:08,170 --> 01:12:10,420
