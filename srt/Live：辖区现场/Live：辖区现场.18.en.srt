EPISODE 18

3
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,920
<i>Code zero, code zero.</i>

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,290
<i>A drunk man is sitting
on the guardrail of Nammun Bridge.</i>

5
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,250
<i>We're flooded with
calls from passing cars.</i>

6
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,920
<i>Patrol cars in the area, please report.</i>

7
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,880
<i>Code zero, code zero.</i>

8
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,850
<i>A drunk man is sitting
on the guardrail of Nammun Bridge.</i>

9
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,260
<i>We're flooded with
calls from passing cars.</i>

10
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,430
<i>Patrol cars in the area, please report.</i>

11
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,390
<i>A drunk man is sitting on the guardrail.</i>

12
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,400
Patrol 20 responding
to the case. Last call.

13
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,400
Patrol 20 responding
to the case. Last call.

14
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,190
Patrol 22 will aid Patrol 20. Last call.

15
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,280
<i>Code one, code one.</i>

16
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,580
<i>A passing citizen called in an accident.</i>

17
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,660
<i>There has been an accident by
the traffic light at Hongil Intersection.</i>

18
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,460
<i>Patrol cars in the vicinity,
please report.</i>

19
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,170
<i>Code one, code one.</i>

20
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,460
<i>A tip-off from a citizen
at Hongil Intersection.</i>

21
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,750
Please blow into the machine.

22
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,510
You crazy asshole. Hey.

23
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,640
I didn't drink.

24
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,720
I said I didn't drink.

25
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,390
Hang on. Wait.

26
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,940
-Did you just touch me?
-Get up.

27
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,190
Did you touch me?

28
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,780
-Stand up.
-Don't touch me.

29
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,610
How dare you touch me?

30
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,200
The police officer is touching me.

31
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,570
-Ma'am.
-The police...

32
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,820
You need a sobriety test.

33
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,830
You refused to take
a sobriety test three times.

34
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,790
If you refuse it one more time,
you may be arrested in the act.

35
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,290
And you may be charged
with obstruction of justice.

36
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,330
Blow into the machine.

37
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,550
What are you doing?

38
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,180
You're under arrest for violating

39
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,760
Act on Traffic Accident, obstruction
of justice, and refusal of sobriety test.

40
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,850
You have the right to an attorney

41
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,100
and claim review of legality
for confinement.

42
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,270
And you get a chance to explain yourself.

43
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,940
This is an excessive use of force.
Please help me.

44
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,520
The police officers just touched my body.

45
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,650
Please help.

46
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,440
Why are you taking photos?

47
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,160
Six officers are here to suppress
one woman. That's ridiculous.

48
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,990
It's not ridiculous. It seems
she's a drunk driver.

49
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,500
Stop it.

50
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,910
Why would they grab her head?

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,370
If we don't, she might get hurt.

52
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,380
-It's all part of safety regulations.
-Stop it.

53
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,550
Why don't you shoot her with a gun?

54
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,550
Like the cop who shot
a medical student in the news.

55
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,720
What did you just say?

56
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,130
Watch your mouth.

57
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,010
Officer, please ignore him.

58
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,220
Why would you say that?

59
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,390
Am I wrong about that?

60
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,810
He told him not to shoot,
but the cop did anyway.

61
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,520
Don't you watch the news?

62
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,360
Damn pigs.

63
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,530
Just ignore him, officer.

64
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,820
Be strong!

65
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,530
Thank you.

66
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,450
Paramedics on their way
to Hongil Intersection

67
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,790
should go to Hongil Patrol Division
to get the patient.

68
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,870
The tow truck should come to the scene.

69
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,420
I repeat.

70
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,540
Paramedics coming to Hongil Intersection

71
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,460
should go to Hongil Patrol Division,
and the tow truck should come here.

72
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,560
-Hey!
-They'll bring your car.

73
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,980
Hey, look.

74
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,020
-I said they'll bring it.
-Where's my car?

75
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,520
I'm not talking about this car.
Where's my car?

76
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,070
Hey, can't you hear me?

77
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,280
-Are you deaf?
-Please calm down.

78
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,370
<i>Jeong-o, do you know
if you got the scholarship?</i>

79
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,870
-<i>Have they processed your leave request?
-My car.</i>

80
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,750
<i>I hope it gets processed soon
so that you can come home.</i>

81
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,540
I'm not talking about this car. Mister!

82
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:46,040
I asked you where my car is. Hey!

83
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,390
<i>I'm sure you're aware of the incident
that occurred</i>

84
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,940
<i>last Saturday at Mahyeon Park,
where a police officer</i>

85
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,110
<i>mistook a copycat suspect
as a serial killer,</i>

86
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,400
<i>and shot him twice despite
the suspect surrendering.</i>

87
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,530
<i>We just received news that the man,
Kang, who lapsed into unconsciousness</i>

88
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,820
<i>after the incident didn't make it.</i>

89
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,080
<i>He died at the hospital around 7:25 p.m.</i>

90
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,750
<i>This isn't the first tragedy caused</i>

91
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,620
<i>by the police's careless use of firearms.</i>

92
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,870
<i>Early this year,
a high-ranking officer outside Seoul</i>

93
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,880
<i>fired his gun when he was drunk,</i>

94
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,790
<i>which injured an innocent civilian,
but he was</i>

95
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,630
<i>transferred to Seoul after the incident.</i>

96
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,550
I dropped the knife.

97
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,480
<i>This unfortunate incident
also left three passersby injured.</i>

98
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,850
<i>Breaking news. Chief Jo Hui-myeong
of Mahyeon Police Station</i>

99
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,820
<i>will make a formal apology shortly.</i>

100
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,190
<i>We will connect to the site now.</i>

101
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,620
You're here again.

102
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,920
How long have you been here?

103
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,640
He still doesn't want to see anyone.

104
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,850
Since he has an injector in
to help him eat,

105
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,940
he can't even talk.

106
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,820
I guess he doesn't want anyone
to see him like that.

107
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,610
He's weird in that way.

108
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,120
Try to understand
even if he doesn't want to see you.

109
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,380
He probably doesn't know what to say.

110
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,630
You saved his life,

111
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,130
but you may end up with a criminal charge
because of it.

112
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,640
But it'll be fine.

113
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,230
A perp is a perp
whether he's a copycat or a first-timer.

114
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,810
Anyone would understand that
you had to shoot him at that moment.

115
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,860
Okay.

116
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,280
How's his leg?

117
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,910
We'll have to see how it heals.

118
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,430
I probably can't come every day anymore.

119
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,430
They're moving me
to the administration division

120
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,100
at the station as of tomorrow.

121
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,020
And I need to prepare for my hearing.

122
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,980
Why is the disciplinary committee

123
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,200
holding a hearing so soon?

124
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,910
At the hearing,

125
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,080
you'll need a witness
who can testify for you.

126
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,790
But...

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,830
Yang-chon is the only witness you have.

128
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,380
Everyone knows that he can neither
walk nor talk at the moment.

129
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,550
I honestly don't know.

130
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,090
I'll get going, Captain An.

131
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,700
I heard about Sang-su's
disciplinary hearing. What's going on?

132
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,120
They might drop the case,

133
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,500
and it's not like he's been found guilty.

134
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,540
Why are they rushing to hold a hearing
when it's not even part of the procedure?

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,500
-Because of the body cam footage.
<i>-We humbly accept</i>

136
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,090
-The public is enraged.
<i>-the criticism against us, the police...</i>

137
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,260
CHIEF JO FORMALLY APOLOGIZES

138
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,140
<i>In order to clear all suspicions that</i>

139
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,850
<i>we might have tried
to conceal or downplay...</i>

140
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,020
I heard they don't know how the media
obtained the body cam footage.

141
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,520
I think the prosecution leaked it.

142
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,110
Sang-su is caught in the power struggle
between the police and prosecution.

143
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,190
<i>As you know,</i>

144
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,990
<i>the police force lost the public's trust
due to the recent incidents.</i>

145
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,240
Just yesterday, a man, whom
we locked up five years ago for murder,

146
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,370
turned out to be innocent,
which made the country go bonkers.

147
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,080
I think they want to use this case

148
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,830
to bury all the rest.

149
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,270
Internal Affairs

150
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,640
will conduct a survey tomorrow to see
Sang-su's reputation among his peers.

151
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,310
They're pushing ahead with things.

152
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,440
They're holding the disciplinary hearing
just for show.

153
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:04,280
Rumor has it that instead of selecting

154
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,700
committee members who are neutral--

155
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,080
I heard they're trying to pick who would
make a favorable decision for the force.

156
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,040
Internally,
they have already decided to fire him.

157
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,370
Any neutral committee members would know

158
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,840
that it was self-defense.

159
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,710
<i>If Sang-su is fired,</i>

160
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,300
<i>all of us senior officers in the force
will be responsible for it.</i>

161
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,140
We always talk about the manual,

162
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,390
but realistically,
we can't tell the perps repeatedly

163
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,140
to drop their weapons and surrender

164
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,310
in such urgent situations
before resorting to using our guns.

165
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,730
It's a battlefield with people dying.

166
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,570
The victim,

167
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,860
who got stabbed in the stomach,
was on the ground,

168
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,950
and Lieutenant Oh

169
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,160
was bleeding from everywhere

170
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,790
because he got stabbed multiple times.

171
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,120
But all we hear on the news

172
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:01,170
is that his surgery went well
and that the injury won't affect his life.

173
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,050
It's as if he shouldn't have survived.

174
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,050
Does it make sense to you?

175
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,380
The media has no interest

176
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,930
in the fact that the copycat
is a criminal guilty of attempted murder.

177
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,890
They just keep emphasizing that

178
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:18,310
he was handsome and studious to make him
look like an innocent civilian.

179
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,440
A first-timer is a criminal too.

180
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,440
They keep talking
as if first-timers are innocent.

181
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,950
If any of us were there...

182
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,450
Forget the manual.
Anyone in that situation--

183
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,950
Anyone would've shot the guy.

184
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,330
I know I would've.

185
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,330
If an innocent civilian

186
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,710
and my colleague were in danger,

187
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,790
I would've shot the guy

188
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,800
without any hesitation.

189
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,460
Me too.

190
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,550
-Me too.
-Me too.

191
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,140
-I would've done the same.
-We would've shot him too.

192
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,470
I wouldn't

193
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,260
have done that.

194
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,230
If Sang-su

195
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,860
-didn't fire his gun in that situation--
-<i>All of us would</i>

196
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,110
<i>be at the funerals of the victim
and Yang-chon.</i>

197
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,820
But you see,

198
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,490
you're saying that anyone would've

199
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,410
shot the guy in that situation,
but I can't agree with that, Jeong-o.

200
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,290
<i>Yes.</i>

201
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,130
<i>I guess you young, naive rookies</i>

202
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,840
<i>or mentees could do that</i>

203
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,590
<i>if you only think about the victim
and your colleague.</i>

204
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:35,850
<i>But...</i>

205
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:41,480
the organization isn't afraid
to ditch those who are no longer useful.

206
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,020
That is why I wonder

207
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,980
whether we, senior officers,
who are old and jaded,

208
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,940
would've done the same.

209
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:54,530
<i>Like the media says, the perp's life
should've been protected too.</i>

210
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,910
Dirtying our hands with blood
is not necessary.

211
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,000
The victim

212
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,960
is a complete stranger to us.

213
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,540
I wouldn't want to deal

214
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,960
with any headaches,

215
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,420
so I would've reminded myself
of the manual.

216
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,760
Then...

217
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,470
I would've tried to spend

218
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,220
as much time as possible to accurately aim

219
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,560
the moving target in his arm or leg.

220
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:26,480
Then I would've waited for my colleague
not knowing when he'd arrive.

221
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,190
While time goes by like that,

222
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,240
whether the victim or my colleague

223
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,780
dies or not...

224
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,910
My safety is guaranteed.

225
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,240
We would've dealt with it like cowards.

226
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,870
Captain An,

227
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,330
you're right.

228
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,960
We would've done that.

229
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,420
<i>What Sang-su did
isn't what anyone could've done.</i>

230
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,470
<i>He may have done something
no cop would want to do.</i>

231
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,550
<i>He only thought of
his colleague and the victim.</i>

232
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,270
Chief Ki, that's why I'm asking you.

233
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,150
For that young, pure, reckless rookie,

234
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,980
figure out everything
we can do to help him.

235
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,240
Everyone,

236
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,500
-have a seat.
-No, don't.

237
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,660
Go home.

238
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,630
Internal Affairs will question us
about Sang-su tomorrow.

239
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,340
Shouldn't we come up with a strategy?

240
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,220
We don't want to all say
different things about him.

241
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,930
We should agree on things

242
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,100
-that'll help his reputation--
-What for?

243
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,520
Did he do something corrupt

244
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,060
that requires us

245
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,150
to keep quiet?

246
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,520
Or has he taken money

247
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,440
and bribes from construction companies

248
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,940
that we need to cover up?

249
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,990
All he is a probationary officer
who earns 1.4 million won a month.

250
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,580
He takes our orders

251
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,120
and wipes vomit spewed from drunks.

252
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,830
He never learned

253
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,380
how to weasel his way out of duty.

254
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:14,380
He'd run to the scene
not knowing that he may get hurt.

255
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,260
That's how pure-hearted he is.

256
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:22,260
What's there to get
our stories straight about him?

257
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,060
We'll say what we've seen,

258
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,770
just as it is.

259
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,690
They stomp on the weak

260
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,570
and grovel at higher-ups.

261
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,240
I'm embarrassed of this force.

262
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,110
I'm too mortified to

263
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,330
even look at you rookies.

264
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,370
Leave.

265
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,630
The chief is right.

266
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,540
Go home.

267
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,610
How can an officer working the night shift

268
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,780
not carry a gun around?

269
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,450
I'll take the taser gun.

270
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,240
That's only for close range.

271
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,250
How will you stop
a culprit that's running away?

272
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,210
Besides, everyone took a taser gun today,

273
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,630
so we don't have any left.

274
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,000
I'll take the gas pistol.

275
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,380
It's windy tonight.

276
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,050
The powder will fly everywhere,

277
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,260
and you'll breathe it in yourself.

278
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,180
Take the gas pistol.

279
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,430
Only five

280
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,850
out of twenty took their guns today.

281
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,640
After hearing about Sang-su,

282
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,310
they think that saving lives

283
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,770
will only cause trouble.

284
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:57,770
Even with blanks,

285
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,360
it can help subdue a dangerous assailant.

286
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,360
Also, the gun itself
can intimidate a perpetrator.

287
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,240
It's not just our division.

288
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,120
It's become a trend.

289
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,740
At this rate,

290
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,540
we won't be able to catch

291
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,120
any weapon-wielding assailants.

292
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,420
-Either we die or...
-Chief, it's me.

293
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,380
It's Ki Han-sol at Hongil Patrol Division.

294
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:21,760
I was wondering
if we could talk in person.

295
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:23,800
When do you have the time?

296
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,890
Sang-su.

297
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,230
Were you waiting for me?

298
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,600
No, Jeong-o.

299
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,270
What? I'm disappointed, you jerk.

300
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,740
Sang-su, hang in there!

301
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,410
What did you do all day?

302
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,040
I ran and walked like yesterday.

303
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,870
Then I walked and ran.

304
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:58,790
Aren't you tired?

305
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,380
I want to walk a little more.

306
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,090
Do you want to join me?

307
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,380
I can't sleep.

308
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,430
Sure.

309
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:16,850
Sang-su.

310
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:21,190
My application for
the study abroad program was accepted.

311
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,360
That's great.

312
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,740
Thanks.

313
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,320
Make sure you only study.

314
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,740
Don't do other things.

315
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,700
I won't.

316
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,120
Are you happy?

317
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,580
I am.

318
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,630
The look on your face says it all.

319
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:45,670
When do you leave?

320
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,430
In two and a half years.

321
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,650
I'm going to see

322
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,490
what they decide
at your disciplinary hearing.

323
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,790
If this goes to trial,

324
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,250
I'll see it through as well

325
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,250
with my very own eyes.

326
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,760
I'll see you beat these unfair charges.

327
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,930
I'll stay in this
dangerous patrol division,

328
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,640
I'll provide my service

329
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,600
for the maximum duration

330
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,310
which is two and a half years.

331
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,360
Once I've grown stronger,

332
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:44,820
that's when I'll leave.

333
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,580
Sang-su.

334
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,800
You shot a criminal.

335
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,640
Remember what the chief

336
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,510
and our senior officers said.

337
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,270
"The people

338
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,560
at a crime scene

339
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,730
aren't ordinary people.

340
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,780
They're either

341
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,820
victims or suspects."

342
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,830
You shot a criminal

343
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:37,990
and saved

344
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,960
the victim and your colleague.

345
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,770
You know that, right?

346
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,160
You're not alone.

347
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,410
I'm here with you.

348
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,080
Don't you get lonely.

349
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,040
If you do, I'll make you pay.

350
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,350
I'll iron my uniform.

351
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,110
Eat breakfast. I'll iron it.

352
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:24,550
You told me to quit.
Why are you ironing it for me?

353
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,730
I remembered that you saved a life.

354
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,320
A woman I work with upset me yesterday.

355
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,610
She said you shot someone to death.

356
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,740
I was going to pull out her hair

357
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:45,700
but another woman stopped me and said,

358
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,120
"Sang-su didn't kill a person.

359
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,410
He killed a criminal."

360
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,460
She said you saved

361
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,630
the student and the officer.

362
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,260
What she said

363
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:02,550
really hit home.

364
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,770
Sang-su.

365
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:14,650
The disciplinary committee

366
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,610
won't abandon you.

367
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,360
If you go to court, let's just win.

368
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,450
If you quit your job now,

369
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,530
people will think you really did wrong.

370
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,870
I can deal with everything

371
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,330
but that.

372
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,880
Eat a lot, so you can stay strong.

373
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,260
No one cares that I'm a lowly cleaner,

374
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,260
but the world needs me.

375
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,770
No one

376
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,480
may care about what you do,

377
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,730
but the world needs you.

378
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,530
Stay strong.

379
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,930
Write down what happened
on the night of the incident.

380
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,180
Be as detailed as possible.

381
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,100
Yes, sir.

382
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,770
INCIDENT REPORT

383
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:39,730
Once I'm done,

384
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,070
what do I do next?

385
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,030
Write another report and then another.

386
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:52,660
Sorry. We all want to help you,

387
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,620
but we have no power.

388
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,250
Thank you.

389
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,890
Don't move!

390
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:15,870
Hey.

391
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:18,790
Because of your division,
we've been going to

392
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,750
the headquarters and Seoul office.

393
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,580
Neither the chief nor I have time for you.

394
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,750
That's fine. Take care of business.

395
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,380
I'll wait.

396
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,760
You're really something.

397
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,260
PERSONNEL FILE

398
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:17,390
This is our shift report,
patrol car dispatch report,

399
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,060
division status,

400
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,310
firearm report, rookie performance report.

401
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,690
GENERAL COMMENTS

402
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,020
One gun, one taser gun.

403
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,270
That's per team of two.

404
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:30,360
Why were Yeom Sang-su and
Oh Yang-chon both carrying guns?

405
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,030
At the time of dispatch,

406
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,860
there was nothing to indicate
that things would turn violent.

407
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,580
There are many violent crimes
in our district.

408
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,290
I gave them the order.

409
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,370
But a gun for a rookie?

410
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,710
Aren't privates in the army given rifles?

411
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,540
A graduate of the academy is an officer.

412
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,670
That does not break any rules.

413
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,550
If you want to find fault with that,

414
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,010
change the rules.

415
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:59,850
Was Officer Yeom ever hostile

416
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:02,560
towards the general public?

417
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,690
Has he ever assaulted a civilian

418
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,150
or used excessive force in the past?

419
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,150
From what I know,

420
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,530
he did not.

421
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,000
-Let's go on patrol.
-Okay.

422
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,880
Hey. What did they ask you?

423
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,130
They asked me over ten times

424
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,800
if Sang-su was a violent person.

425
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,470
It was so annoying.

426
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,220
Officer Kim Han-pyo.

427
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,560
Come in.

428
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,690
<i>Something's off.</i>

429
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:53,860
Everyone says he had no faults,

430
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,110
but the reports say otherwise.

431
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,950
ROOKIE PERFORMANCE REPORT

432
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,660
This is what Oh Yang-chon wrote.

433
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:02,660
"Habitually late for meetings.
Needs cautioning."

434
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,870
Is that a lie?

435
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,620
Yeom Sang-su was

436
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:09,460
habitually late for our morning meetings.

437
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:15,010
He always came to work before his shift

438
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,220
and cleaned the bathrooms.

439
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,810
If you see the record of when he came in,

440
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:25,680
you'll see I'm telling the truth.

441
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,150
Then

442
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,150
was he on bad terms with
Lieutenant Oh Yang-chon?

443
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:37,110
Your monthly evaluation is perfect
apart from one "fair."

444
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,620
Sang-su got mostly "fair"
and just one "great."

445
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,030
There's even one "poor."

446
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,910
That's Lieutenant Oh's style.

447
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:48,080
He believed that

448
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:52,170
being strict makes
a better officer than praise does.

449
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,340
Officer Yeom

450
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:57,630
had no complaints about that.

451
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,800
I looked into Sang-su's family history.

452
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,720
He lives with a single mother,
and they aren't well-off.

453
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:08,640
Is his private life posing a problem

454
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,730
to make him lash out as an officer?

455
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:13,190
Stick to the police's internal affairs,
not private affairs.

456
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,820
When you apprehended Cho Seol-tae,

457
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,740
the serial rapist and murderer,

458
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,700
you were with Yeom Sang-su.

459
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,700
At the time, he used his taser gun

460
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:28,000
<i>on Cho Seol-tae multiple times.</i>

461
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,620
<i>These are the marks.</i>

462
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,840
Criminals have rights too.

463
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,710
Is this allowed?

464
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:42,260
As much as you care about
the criminals' rights,

465
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:46,060
can you care about the victims
and field officers, like us?

466
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,180
A taser gun

467
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:52,100
only incapacitates someone
for a few seconds.

468
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,650
It was an urgent situation,

469
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,150
and it was used on a safe spot.

470
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,400
These are

471
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:03,030
photos of our wounds.

472
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,450
Cho Seol-tae

473
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:09,750
is a serial child rapist
and a judo master and--

474
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,160
Enough. You may go now.

475
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,870
Sergeant Ban.

476
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,130
Come in.

477
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:17,210
<i>Patrol 24 reporting
to the case in Hongwon 1-dong.</i>

478
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,510
<i>Patrol 24 reporting
to the case in Hongwon 1-dong.</i>

479
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:22,680
<i>Patrol cars in the vicinity,
please report.</i>

480
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:25,140
<i>Patrol 24 reporting

481
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,760
<i>Patrol 24 reporting to the case.</i>

482
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:27,760
Sergeant Kang.

483
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:30,140
<i>Patrol cars in the vicinity,
please report.</i>

484
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,810
We should report, sir.

485
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,730
I don't want to.

486
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,190
It's not like anyone gives us credit

487
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,030
for working hard.

488
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,860
<i>Patrol 24 reporting
to the case in Hongwon 1-dong.</i>

489

<i>Patrol 24 reporting

00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:57,880
<i>Patrol cars in the vicinity,
please report.</i>

494
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,760
The case in Hongwon 1-dong.

495
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,300
Patrol 23 and 24 on the way. Last call.

496
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:10,100
Patrol 23 and 24 on the way. Last call.

497
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:12,850
You made the right choice.

498
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,980
I'm sorry.

499
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,310
I'm just angry over

500
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:19,570
what happened to Sang-su.

501
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,320
About the injector...

502
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,820
The doctor said
that you can't be off it yet.

503
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:31,240
Your throat is all damaged,

504
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:33,750
so you can't swallow anything.

505
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:35,750
Even talking is hard for you.

506
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,800
Even if you're there,

507
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:43,920
nothing will change.

508
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,170
You know that, right?

509
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:51,430
You have to let Sang-su

510
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,480
handle it on his own.

511
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,350
Is that what's bothering you?

512
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,490
You're not a good guy to women.

513
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,620
You know that, right?

514
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,140
All right.

515
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,430
Let's go.

516
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,020
I MADE A LOT OF MISTAKES IN THE FIELD

517
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:40,900
LIEUTENANT OH AND I RESPONDED TO
A CALL IN MAHYEON PARK

518
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,370
It's 6 p.m., so you can call it a day.

519
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,830
Attend the disciplinary hearing
by 10 a.m. tomorrow.

520
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,420
I'll just finish writing this.

521
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,630
You can just go.

522
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:18,100
SEOUL MAHYEON POLICE STATION

523
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,290
Even you, Eun Gyeong-mo?

524
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,460
Jeez.

525
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:47,920
You guys are tenacious.

526
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,050
Come in!

527
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,600
Gyeong-mo.

528
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:00,180
You've never had to struggle financially
since joining the force, right?

529
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,310
I've had a comfortable life.

530
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,110
You'll have no regrets, right?

531
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,990
After what they put us through?

532
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,400
No.

533
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,120
POLICE OFFICERS MUST LEARN A LESSON

534
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,200
Even the prosecution

535
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:21,870
can't indict him for this case
because it was clearly self-defense.

536
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,250
So please postpone
the disciplinary hearing

537
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:26,170
to after his trial--

538
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:28,880
Then how are we going
to calm the public's anger?

539
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,130
Are you the chief here?

540
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:37,350
Lieutenant Oh got stabbed
in his hand, shoulder, and leg.

541
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,350
The perp's knife pierced
through his kidney and spleen

542
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,060
and he was in critical condition.

543
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:43,980
If you let the public know

544
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,150
of how urgent the situation was
through a press conference--

545
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:50,440
Hey, people aren't even interested
in things like that.

546
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,450
Read this.

547
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:55,030
The media is calling us

548
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,990
"crazy guard dogs" that protect

549
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,540
troublemakers like Yeom Sang-su.

550
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,660
You guys and other field officers are
hounding at us not to let Yeom Sang-su go,

551
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:06,420
while the higher-ups are harassing us
to get rid of him

552
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,000
and calm the media and the public
as soon as possible.

553
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,010
Because of your patrol division,

554
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:14,090
the entire force with 150,000 employees
is in a crisis.

555
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,760
Why is it Yeom Sang-su's fault
that 150,000 members

556
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,390
of the police force are in a crisis?

557
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,020
What did you say?

558
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,730
It's because of the corrupt cop,
Lee Ju-yeong,

559
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,100
the high-ranking officer
who was transferred to

560
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:29,610
the Seoul Agency after shooting
a civilian when he was drunk,

561
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:33,360
and the current commissioner
of the Seoul Agency,

562
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,570
his high school junior, Chief Oh,
and other leaders

563
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,530
who colluded with the prosecution

564
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:41,330
to frame an innocent man as a murderer
despite lack of evidence.

565
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:45,210
Why don't you fire them all?

566
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,540
It'll make the media and public

567
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,830
very happy.

568
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:53,710
Have you lost your mind?

569
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,300
Are you in the right state of mind,
Ki Han-sol?

570
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:59,180
If I'm not in the right state of mind,
then who is?

571
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,600
You're saying that

572
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:05,520
acting in self-defense put the force
in jeopardy. Are you in your right mind?

573
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:12,190
You prick. Be respectful, will you?
How dare you say such a thing?

574
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:14,650
Hey, Gyeong-mo. Take him and get out!

575
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,570
Get out immediately
unless you want to get fired!

576
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:28,080
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

577
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:30,080
<i>Even the commissioner
called me to hound at me.</i>

578
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:32,420
<i>You know</i>

579
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,970
<i>that he's close friends
with Congressman Kim.</i>

580
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:39,010
<i>District Attorney Jeong
and the commissioner will be nominated</i>

581
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:43,310
<i>to run for Congressman Kim's party
right after his term is over.</i>

582
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:47,600
<i>Chief Ki, I know that Congressman Kim
got caught for DUI and slapped you,</i>

583
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:51,730
<i>but let's just let it slide, okay? Please?</i>

584
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,230
You should watch this too.

585
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:59,150
<i>What are you going to do,</i>

586
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,280
<i>you prick?</i>

587
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:03,240
<i>We asked you what you'll do, you moron.</i>

588
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:06,870
<i>Has this prick lost his mind or what?</i>

589
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:10,420
<i>You little piece of shit.</i>

590
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,460
Do you have a death wish?

591
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,800
Who taught you guys such sneaky tricks?

592
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,510
We learned it

593
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,390
from you two.

594
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,560
Everyone in our patrol division

595
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,400
has a copy
of the audio file and the video clip.

596
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,480
Please keep that in mind.

597
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:39,190
It's not like we want
to jeopardize this country.

598
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,360
As senior officers,

599
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:44,870
we want to help a junior officer
who carried out his duties correctly.

600
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,330
We're just asking you to hold off

601
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,290
firing him until after his trial.

602
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:52,250
We just think that
the disciplinary committee

603
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:55,790
should give him a chance to explain
himself after his trial is over.

604
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,340
We had no choice

605
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,130
but to be this rude to you

606
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,760
because we just couldn't get
through to you.

607
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,180
But you see,

608
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,890
I have more power now.

609
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,310
You know that there are two types of cops

610
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:19,190
that you really have to watch out for
regardless of their ranks, right?

611
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,530
Those with a strong sense of duty

612
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,410
and cops like us,

613
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:28,870
who are ready to give up their badges
and leave the force anytime.

614
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:35,790
Now, back to Officer Yeom Sang-su.

615
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:38,920
Give us your answer.

616
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,640
We'll probably be good farmers
if we move out to the country.

617
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:56,400
You and I, we won't be able to do anything

618
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,900
because we're both ill-tempered.

619
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,690
Jeez, you're attacking me with facts.

620
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:10,950
Is it you, Yang-chon?

621
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,870
Your gun?

622
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,710
That's not a piece of evidence.

623
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,550
It's at the station, of course.

624
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,640
I see. Okay.

625
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:28,760
Thank you.

626
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,390
All right.

627
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:38,770
Mr. Kim at Forensics
said we can send it right away.

628
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,570
He'll do it for Lieutenant Oh
even without the approval.

629
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:43,530
He can stay up all night to analyze it.

630
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,990
It'll still take
at least two to three days,

631
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:51,080
but the disciplinary hearing is tomorrow.

632
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,120
Get the car ready.

633
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,460
Sure.

634
00:42:56,670 --> 00:43:00,000
Yes, Captain Seong.
I think it was on Thursday two weeks ago.

635
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:01,630
We're heading to Forensics.

636
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,340
That's right.

637
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:06,260
The case was at 64 Hongan 2-dong.

638
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,300
Can I look at the file?

639
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:11,010
Well,

640
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,230
I saved a woman in her 30s
from an unknown assailant.

641
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:18,900
Come to think of it,
her description of him

642
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:22,190
seems to match
the Mahyeon Park perpetrator's.

643
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:24,280
Yes, that's why.

644
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:27,780
Give me the number.

645
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:30,320
MAHYEON POLICE HOSPITAL

646
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,000
You know,

647
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:38,040
your uniform suits you way better
than the hospital gown.

648
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:54,930
If we get back together,

649
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:57,060
will we be happy?

650
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:03,860
I'll place my trust in you.

651
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:27,590
Sang-su's here.

652
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:30,340
I'll be right outside.

653
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:37,560
It's your day off.

654
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,100
Why are you in uniform?

655
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,770
We're all going

656
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,400
to the disciplinary hearing,

657
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:50,900
so we all put it on.

658
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:53,950
How

659
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:56,740
loyal.

660
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:03,000
I'll get going then.

661
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:26,980
My neck hurts,

662
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:28,610
so sit down.

663
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:46,960
We haven't

664
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,300
seen each other since the incident.

665
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:56,510
Where's your greeting?

666
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:09,570
Hi,

667
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:14,450
Mr. Oh Yang Chon.

668
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:20,870
You nutjob.

669
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,750
I know I told you to call me that,

670
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:31,130
but I didn't know it'd stick.

671
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:40,850
Why did

672
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:44,480
you pull the trigger

673
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,400
and put yourself in this mess?

674
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:54,860
Just...

675
00:46:57,570 --> 00:46:58,910
know this.

676
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:02,790
Next time,

677
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:06,210
when you face the same situation,

678
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,130
just run.

679
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:25,520
You're such a dumbass.

680
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,610
Let's go.

681
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:47,890
CONFERENCE ROOM

682
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:49,980
OFFICER IN QUESTION

683
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:53,900
As you all know,

684
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,640
this disciplinary hearing
is of a single trial.

685
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,680
As you all know,

686
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,210
this disciplinary hearing
is of a single trial.

687
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,170
Once the deliberation is over,

688
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:05,210
myself,

689
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,920
Captain Jang Se-jik
of Women & Juvenile Affairs Division,

690
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,090
civilian committee members,
Attorney Kang Se-chan,

691
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:13,010
Professor Lee Dong-jin

692
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,970
of department of police administration
at Daehan University,

693
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:19,980
and retired police officer
Park Yeol will vote.

694
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,600
The vote will be anonymous,

695
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:27,230
and the opinion with the most votes
will be selected.

696
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:30,030
<i>Jang Se-jik is the asshole who had</i>

697
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:31,740
<i>Jang-mi fired.</i>

698
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,740
<i>He's a viper</i>

699
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:37,540
<i>which tells us that the force
desperately wants Sang-su gone.</i>

700
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:40,540
<i>The head of the committee
is against us too.</i>

701
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:41,920
<i>He's the chief's right-hand man.</i>

702
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:45,920
<i>Thankfully, we have
Kang Se-chan on the committee.</i>

703
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:48,590
<i>He graduated the academy
and worked in vice.</i>

704
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:51,130
<i>He grew sick and tired
of corrupt higher-ups,</i>

705
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,680
<i>so he quit to become
an advocate for human rights.</i>

706
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,930
<i>We can count on him.</i>

707
00:49:56,930 --> 00:50:00,270
<i>The other two civilians
are of a neutral stance.</i>

708
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:03,940
<i>Chief Ki and I weren't able
to postpone the hearing,</i>

709
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:07,270
<i>but we made Chief of Police
place civilians</i>

710
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,860
<i>that have a neutral point of view.</i>

711
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,740
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

712
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:13,280
<i>This is the best we were able to do.</i>

713
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:15,570
<i>Don't move!</i>

714
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:17,990
<i>Drop the knife.</i>

715
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:20,790
<i>Save me.</i>

716
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:23,000
<i>I dropped the knife.</i>

717
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:28,920
Officer Yeom.

718
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:33,680
Why did you fire your weapon

719
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:35,220
when the suspect surrendered?

720
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,310
He moved when dropping the knife.

721
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,350
Lieutenant Oh's gun

722
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:48,650
was in his proximity.

723
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:51,650
He could've been reaching for the gun

724
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:53,860
or trying to raise his hands.

725
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:55,320
How could you tell?

726
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:59,240
Act on the Performance of Duties
by Police Officers, Article One.

727
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,330
In order to protect the freedom and rights
of the citizens,

728
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:05,330
the authority of an officer should be kept

729
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:07,830
to a minimum at all times

730
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:10,170
and shouldn't be abused.

731
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:11,960
Have you forgotten that?

732
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:15,590
Officer Yeom.

733
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:20,100
How long does it take to remove the gun

734
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:21,600
from the rubber case

735
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:23,270
that is the safety catch?

736
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,390
About one or two seconds,

737
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:31,110
-sir.
-At times, it can take longer than that.

738
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:34,490
Yes, sir.

739
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,700
You served in the military,

740
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,410
and graduated the police academy.

741
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:43,200
You even have field experience,
but yet it takes you

742
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:45,080
one to two seconds to remove it,

743
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:47,710
and it isn't always easy to remove.

744
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:52,000
Even if the suspect,
who hasn't served in the military took it,

745
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,460
it wouldn't have been easy to use.

746
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:56,260
I suspect that

747
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,840
a civilian with no experience with a gun

748
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:02,010
would need at least four, five seconds
to release the rubber seal.

749
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,850
On top of that,

750
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,770
he couldn't take out

751
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:09,350
the blank bullets
loaded in an officer's gun.

752
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,270
Now let's calculate

753
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:13,940
the time he'd need to shoot a bullet.

754
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:17,070
The time it would take
for the suspect, a civilian,

755
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:20,070
to shoot you with a live bullet would be

756
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:21,580
at least six seconds.

757
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:24,450
Right? However,

758
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:26,410
you shot your gun,

759
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:29,370
and your colleagues reached the scene

760
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,460
in just three seconds.

761
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,960
What I'm saying is that

762
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:39,800
you just had to adhere to the first and
second rule in the officer's handbook

763
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:43,350
that states an officer
on the scene must tell

764
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:45,100
a suspect to discard weapons

765
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,930
or surrender at least three times.

766
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:50,020
If you'd given those orders with

767
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,110
a certain lapse of time in-between,

768
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:54,230
it's plausible to assume that

769
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,280
the suspect, the victim,

770
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,110
and your colleague would all be alive.

771
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:01,620
Why did you cause this mess
by ignoring the manual?

772
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,580
What about the third part
of those instructions?

773
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:05,950
Depending on the urgency

774
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:08,660
and when the other party is attacking,

775
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:12,420
those orders and time lapse
can be ignored.

776
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,750
The suspect

777
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:17,010
showed no clear movement
to attack Officer Yeom.

778
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:22,090
Officer Yeom, at that time,

779
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:24,760
did you not neglect your duty
as an officer

780
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:26,600
to remain calm in any situation?

781
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:29,560
Weren't you too worked up
to think things through,

782
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:32,230
thus causing you to overreact
and use your gun?

783
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:43,030
Tell them the truth.

784
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:55,210
Yes.

785
00:53:58,300 --> 00:53:59,340
At that moment,

786
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:04,010
I was scared,

787
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:09,100
afraid,

788
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:15,060
and flustered.

789
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,280
In that situation,

790
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,200
my mentor, Lieutenant Oh, was hurt,

791
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:31,500
and the victim was bleeding.

792
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,040
All I could think of

793
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:39,960
was that I had to save them both.

794
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:43,340
Then Officer Yeom,
your mind was very clear.

795
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:49,140
You wanted to save the innocent.

796
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:52,350
Next.

797
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,190
-Officer Yeom--
-Officer Jang.

798
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:56,310
Give me a chance to speak.

799
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:00,020
There are many errors

800
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:02,610
in what you said.

801
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,160
Let's go over them, one by one.

802
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:08,830
Number one.

803
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:13,910
The suspect can't use
a gun because he didn't serve in the army.

804
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,540
How is that an error?

805
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:19,090
The suspect did not serve--

806
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:22,130
How can an officer distinguish
whether or not the suspect served

807
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:25,180
when they met at the scene
for the first time?

808
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:28,260
Who is able to

809
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:32,020
tell that in a glance?

810
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:34,980
If you can, give me proof.

811
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:43,110
CIVILIAN MEMBER

812
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:46,860
Number two.

813
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:48,570
Officer Jang.

814
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:53,120
You seemed certain that
the suspect was willing to

815
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,080
surrender.

816
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,210
At the scene,

817
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:58,710
he clearly stated that
when he said "save me."

818
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,380
The evidence was recorded by
Lieutenant Oh's body cam--

819
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:03,130
He could've just said that.

820
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:18,060
<i>He could've just said that.</i>

821
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:24,190
I took a sip of water after I said that.

822
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,490
No one can tell that I did.

823
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:30,070
Just like this situation, the body cam

824
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,330
was facing down on the ground,
so we have no video.

825
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:37,330
The audio from the body cam is not fit
to be admitted as evidence.

826
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:40,290
Number three.

827
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:44,840
What you said sounded like Officer Yeom

828
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:49,010
shouldn't have been afraid,
flustered, or anxious

829
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:50,470
in that situation.

830
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:52,180
Of course he shouldn't have.

831
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,430
In any situation, an officer must--

832
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:56,310
The law on self-defense.

833
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,350
Criminal Code 21-3.

834
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:01,650
"At night or in other
uncertain circumstances,

835
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:04,400
when feeling fear, shock, anxiety,

836
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:06,530
or confusion,

837
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:08,490
one cannot be punished."

838
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:12,200
In other words,

839
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:15,660
when an incident happens at night
and under uncertain circumstances,

840
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,580
when it's a situation
where one feels threatened enough

841
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:20,540
to feel fear, shock, or confusion,

842
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:21,920
in those circumstances,

843
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:26,420
anything the officer does can be viewed as

844
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,170
self-defense.

845
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:30,680
Officer Yeom was in a situation

846
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:32,180
where a victim and his partner

847
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:34,640
had been stabbed many times
by the suspect.

848
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:37,350
Anyone would be afraid,

849
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:39,640
shocked, and perplexed.

850
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:41,310
Why don't people

851
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:44,690
understand the situations
the officers put up with?

852
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,400
<i>When their colleagues and the public</i>

853
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,360
<i>are fighting for their lives,</i>

854
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,280
<i>must they still memorize</i>

855
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:54,280
<i>and stick to the manual every single time?</i>

856
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,370
How many people here

857
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:59,750
do you think would be able to do that?

858
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:03,580
None of us can do that.

859
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,130
So why do we expect and demand

860
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:08,210
an officer stay calm and clear-headed

861
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:11,840
in such unfair circumstances?

862
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:14,470
Do you think that makes sense?

863
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,890
That's what makes an officer of Korea.

864
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:20,020
That's what it means to be an officer
of this country! Do you get that?

865
00:58:21,350 --> 00:58:24,060
Let's all take a break.

866
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:34,610
Finally, Officer Yeom Sang-su.

867
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,200
Lieutenant Oh Yang-chon. You may speak.

868
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,290
OFFICER IN QUESTION, WITNESS

869
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:44,670
I relive the day of the incident

870
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:51,380
dozens of times a day in my head.

871
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:58,350
Some days, I shoot like I did then.

872
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,770
Some days, I put my gun down

873
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:08,480
and run away.

874
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:13,530
Some days,

875
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,280
Lieutenant Oh

876
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,580
and the victim end up dying.

877
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:28,840
On other days,

878
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:33,380
I die...

879
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:40,760
instead of the criminal.

880
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:49,860
I'm a rookie with
very little experience in the field.

881
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:53,940
That night,

882
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:59,530
what was the rational thing to do?

883
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:03,830
I still don't know.

884
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:09,250
But

885
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:12,840
whatever the result of
these proceedings is,

886
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:16,630
one thing is clear.

887
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:23,770
I saved a victim...

888
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:34,150
and a colleague, whom I respect.

889
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:55,300
That's enough for me.

890
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:02,600
Lieutenant Oh, you may speak.

891
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:08,520
On this day,

892
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:13,020
I lost the sense of duty

893
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:16,230
that I valued

894
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:18,690
as much as my life.

895
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:23,700
Until now, I told my junior officers

896
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:29,000
"Protect the lives and safety
of the public at all times.

897
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,460
Have a sense of duty.

898
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:35,250
In any situation,

899
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,550
always put

900
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:43,340
the safety of the civilians first
and protect them.

901
01:01:45,850 --> 01:01:48,560
That is our role
and duty as police officers."

902
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,310
I've been telling them that

903
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:55,650
time and time again.

904
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:01,990
But right now,

905
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:06,530
I regret every moment...

906
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:11,370
I said it.

907
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:19,880
"Leave the victim or colleague and run.

908
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:23,050
Think of your family

909
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:25,640
and don't be a hero.

910
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:29,350
No one,

911
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:33,060
not the nation, the force, nor
your colleagues will take responsibility

912
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,060
when it comes to your life.

913
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:40,940
We aren't those who protect the people.

914
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:44,490
We're the ones people cuss at.

915
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:48,530
We risk our lives out in the field,

916
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:51,620
so try and find easier
and cushier positions."

917
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,590
That's what I should've taught them.

918
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:01,380
I regret not doing so.

919
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:03,470
I deeply regret it.

920
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:17,690
Who made me this way?

921
01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:21,820
Who?

922
01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:25,530
For over 25 years out in the field,

923
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:28,950
I've endured everything

924
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,410
thanks to my sense of duty.

925
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:38,210
But who made me this inconsequential,

926
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:40,670
cowardly,

927
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:44,130
and a miserable man?

928
01:03:47,930 --> 01:03:49,050
Who...

929
01:03:50,810 --> 01:03:53,600
Who dared to take my sense of duty away?

930
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:00,150
Who?

931
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:05,530
Who the hell took it away from me?

932
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:08,450
My sense of duty.

933
01:05:26,070 --> 01:05:27,650
REMAIN

934
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:29,780
DISMISS

935
01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:39,790
MAHYEON POLICE STATION
DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE

936
01:05:47,090 --> 01:05:49,420
Here is the result.

937
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,220
Officer Yeom Sang-su

938
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:55,810
will not face disciplinary action.

939
01:05:55,890 --> 01:05:59,180
DISCIPLINARY ACTION: A METHOD FOR DEALING
WITH A WORKER WHO CAUSES PROBLEMS

940
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,730
<i>The lawyer of the Mahyeon Park assailant,</i>

941
01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:05,190
<i>who was gunned down by an officer,</i>

942
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:08,150
<i>filed charges against Officer Yeom
at Hongil Patrol Division.</i>

943
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:11,530
<i>However, the manslaughter charges
were denied by the prosecutor's office.</i>

944
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:14,910
<i>The testimony of the victim
and Lieutenant Oh,</i>

945
01:06:14,990 --> 01:06:17,700
<i>and the prints found on
Lieutenant Oh's firearm</i>

946
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:20,620
<i>proved that the suspect
was reaching for the gun.</i>

947
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,580
<i>The prosecutor's office officially stated</i>

948
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:26,670
<i>the Officer Yeom's actions
were self-defense.</i>

949
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:30,300
<i>Meanwhile, the suspect, who was thought
to be a first-time offender,</i>

950
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:33,510
<i>was revealed as the assailant
in another attack in Hongan 2-dong.</i>

951
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:36,050
<i>After the news about Lieutenant Oh
and the injuries</i>

952
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:37,930
<i>he suffered in the attack</i>

953
01:06:38,010 --> 01:06:41,140
<i>including a cut ligament in the leg
was made public,</i>

954
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:43,850
<i>people have been taking notice of</i>

955
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:45,730
<i>field officers' hard work.</i>

956
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:49,940
<i>Chief Cho of Mahyeon Police
will now address the public.</i>

957
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,740
<i>Thank you.</i>

958
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:56,200
<i>The support the police
has been receiving lately</i>

959
01:06:56,990 --> 01:06:58,780
<i>wasn't due to anything we did.</i>

960
01:06:58,990 --> 01:07:01,370
<i>All the credit goes to</i>

961
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:05,710
<i>the officers in the field
who put their lives on the line for us.</i>

962
01:07:05,790 --> 01:07:07,290
Stop watching this bastard,

963
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:09,750
and look at my pretty face
while drinking coffee.

964
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:11,840
That's refreshing to hear.

965
01:07:16,550 --> 01:07:18,260
-This is tasty.
-Aren't I pretty?

966
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:22,770
You are.

967
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:38,370
<i>The sky is blue and so is the dream</i>

968
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:41,790
<i>Upon the green hill</i>

969
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:46,620

<i>-Raindrops

972
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:36,670
Move. I'm going to hold Jeong-o's hand.

973
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:37,970
-No, me.
-What do you say?

974
01:08:38,050 --> 01:08:39,050
What's your problem?

975
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:40,800
We look better together.

976
01:08:41,970 --> 01:08:43,060
-Here.
-Over here!

977
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:45,180
-We're here!
-Sergeant!

978
01:08:45,270 --> 01:08:46,230
Over here!

979
01:08:46,770 --> 01:08:49,310
-Sergeant.
-Sergeant, over here.

980
01:08:49,690 --> 01:08:51,400
Hurry up! What time is it?

981
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:52,980
Run!

982
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:05,160
<i>-You will have a good day

01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:18,130
Sang-su, sing a solo!

987
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:20,300
<i>Being young</i>

988
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:24,260
-I think that's enough.
-How is it driving kindergarteners around?

989
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:26,850
It doesn't pay much,

990
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:28,520
but the kids are adorable.

991
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:31,020
I'm popular with them.

992
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,820
What do they call you? Grandpa?

993
01:09:35,230 --> 01:09:36,480
Not just Grandpa

994
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:38,320
but Officer Grandpa.

995
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:48,330
Hey!

996
01:09:57,050 --> 01:09:57,880
Guys!

997
01:10:03,550 --> 01:10:04,890
Guys!

998
01:10:05,550 --> 01:10:07,100
Hey!

999
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:08,970
Guys!

1000
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:17,730
You lot...

1001
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:19,490
Wait for me at the precinct.

1002
01:10:20,070 --> 01:10:22,450
Why are you sending us away
when you asked us here?

1003
01:10:22,530 --> 01:10:25,780
You all brought bad luck
because there's been a violent crime.

1004
01:10:25,870 --> 01:10:27,410
In the countryside?

1005
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:29,040
-Did someone die?
-Was someone mugged?

1006
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,870
No, an old lady in the neighborhood

1007
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:34,290
recently harvested her chilies.

1008
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:38,000
Someone took it all,
and I know who did it.

1009
01:10:38,090 --> 01:10:40,340
An old lady in a neighboring village

1010
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:43,050
who envies this lady's skills
is a repeat offender.

1011
01:10:43,130 --> 01:10:45,090
I'll arrest her come right back.

1012
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:47,100
Cushy is all I can say.

1013
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:48,510
Your job is easy as hell.

1014
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:51,980
Are you happy to be here when
we're slumming it at Hongil Division?

1015
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:55,190
If you're that jealous, get yourself

1016
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,190
a disciplinary action too.

1017
01:10:57,270 --> 01:10:59,690
There's a vacant position
in the neighboring precinct.

1018
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:01,690
This place has fresh air too,

1019
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,860
so get an disciplinary action.

1020
01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:06,700
Anyway, you guys head back.

1021
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:10,830
Yes, I'm on my way.
Hold onto the lady until I get there!

1022
01:11:11,410 --> 01:11:12,330
-See you later.
-Sure.

1023
01:11:12,410 --> 01:11:14,540
Are we supposed to believe that?

1024
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:16,250
-We're hungry.
-We're starving!

1025
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:18,340
All right. I'm on my way.

1026
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:20,300
I'm going. I'm going right now.

1027
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:23,470
Don't let the lady go.
I'm coming right now!

1028
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:36,850

Patrol 23.

-What's the matter, sir?
-This prick punched me in the face.

1055
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:51,050
You piece of shit.
You spat at me as I was walking by.

-It's nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

-Okay.

1069
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:23,660
Lieutenant, you transferred

1070
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:26,120
to Traffic Services to take it easy
after your rehabilitation.

1071
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:29,380
But I heard that you're

1072
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:30,590
swamped all the time.

1073
01:15:31,170 --> 01:15:32,420
I totally am.

1074
01:15:32,510 --> 01:15:35,840
I shouldn't have transferred
to Traffic Services.

1075
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:39,890
What's wrong with this area?
So many hit-and-runs happen here.

1076
01:15:40,470 --> 01:15:43,680
It happens less than once a month
in other areas,

1077
01:15:43,810 --> 01:15:46,900
but a hit-and-run or a DUI accident
happens every three days here.

1078
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:50,230
I also have to put up with fine dust
and exhaust fumes.

1079
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:51,730
This job is so tough.

1080
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:55,610
Have I aged?

1081
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:58,870
Other officers say

1082
01:16:00,490 --> 01:16:02,120
that you're just damn unlucky.

1083
01:16:02,870 --> 01:16:04,830
Why you little...

1084
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:10,460
By the way, what's your new mentor like?

1085
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:13,460
He's a total slacker.
He's easy to work with.

1086
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:16,380
But I'm making his life difficult

1087
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:18,220
by responding to all sorts of cases.

1088
01:16:20,510 --> 01:16:23,310
A mentee is training his mentor?

1089
01:16:23,810 --> 01:16:24,770
You idiot.

1090
01:16:26,270 --> 01:16:27,810
When will you return to the division?

1091
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:29,100
I won't go back.

1092
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:32,190
I only want cushy positions from now on.

1093
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:36,150
Shall I go to the countryside
like Chief Ki did?

1094
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:39,200
I heard there are thieves that steal
chili peppers and potatoes.

1095
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:41,660
Gosh, that's nuts.

1096
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:44,950
Then I'll think that you'll be back
after your six months here is up.

1097
01:16:48,790 --> 01:16:50,000
Shall we go to Violent Crimes?

1098
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:54,300
I mean, we're cops.
We might as well be fearless.

1099
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:57,550
I can go anywhere if it's with you, sir!

1100
01:16:59,050 --> 01:17:00,180
Great!

1101
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,100
Then behave yourself
and don't cause any trouble.

1102
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:04,390
I'll see you there.

1103
01:17:04,510 --> 01:17:05,850
-Yes, sir!
-Now, go.

1104
01:17:06,730 --> 01:17:07,930
Take it easy, sir.

1105
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:31,670
<i>Code Zero.</i>

1106
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:34,250
<i>There's a tussle going on
between merchants at Inseok Market.</i>

1107
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:36,050
<i>Patrol cars in the vicinity,
please report.</i>

1108
01:17:36,130 --> 01:17:37,170
-Don't--
-Patrol 18.

1109
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:38,800
Responding to the case. Last call.

1110
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:41,340
Patrol 18, responding to the case.
Last call.

1111
01:17:42,930 --> 01:17:44,470
I'm sorry, sir. I'm too quick.

1112
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:47,850
I'll try to slow down a little. Salute.

1113
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:48,890
Put on your seat belt.

1114
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:06,620
<i>Code Zero.</i>

1115
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:09,750
<i>There's a tussle going on
between merchants at Inseok Market.</i>

1116
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:12,420
<i>Patrol cars in the vicinity,
please report.</i>

1117
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:13,500
Responding to the case.

1118
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:16,380
Patrol 23 and 18
are on the way. Last call.

1119
