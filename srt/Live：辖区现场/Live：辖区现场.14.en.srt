CHARACTERS AND PLACES ASSOCIATED

2
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,780
Mr. Lee Sam-bo. Fail.

3
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,290
<i>Dad.</i>

4
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,380
<i>Can I study a little longer
before going back to Korea?</i>

5
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,130
<i>I want to get a doctorate,</i>

6
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,550
<i>but I can't do anything
if I go back like this.</i>

7
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,810
What are you doing in the ladies' room?

8
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,060
What?

9
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,980
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,820
Yes!

11
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,380
<i>If only I can run across the dry sky</i>

12
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,670
What's wrong with him?

13
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,590
<i>-And if only I can be in your arms
-You must be out of your mind.</i>

14
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:12,970
<i>-I don't care
-You're getting an award, aren't you?</i>

15
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,930
<i>-If my body breaks apart
-I've gotten one too.</i>

16
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,430
Hey! You should be
more passionate like me.

17
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,390
I'm the best
Probationary Patrol Officer after all.

18
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,850
Why is it you?

19
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,310
It could be me.

20
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,560
It's not that I'm doing nothing.

21
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,190
<i>I'll run into your heart</i>

22
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,440
Hye-ri, you could win a prize. Cheer up.

23
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,540
You're too afraid to drive an excavator.

24
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,660
How did you become a cop to begin with?

25
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,290
Driving an excavator

26
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,420
is nothing like being a cop.

27
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,750
What's the difference?

28
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,800
Both require you to be gutsy.

29
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,630
He and I've done everything

30
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,510
to prepare for retirement in our 50s.
We got the licenses

31
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,260
to be a real estate agent, a cook,
and even an owner-cabdriver.

32
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,470
That's why we can work
even after retirement.

33
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,100
Why are you preparing just before
your retirement? How lazy.

34
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,350
Stop it.

35
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,270
It's not that I'm lazy.

36
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,440
He just focused on his work.

37
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,280
Sam-bo, you're a real cop.

38
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,150
Please stop daunting him.

39
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,410
Let me fill your glass.

40
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,780
All right.

41
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,990
SU-MAN

42
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,000
Is Su-man not here?

43
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,290
Su-man, what are you not coming?

44
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,210
The thing is I'm on a night shift today.

45
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,970
I'm sorry. You guys have fun.

46
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,470
Hang on.

47
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,350
Sir, how may I help you?

48
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,310
The driver from a chauffeur service
pulled my car over here.

49
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,730
Park it.

50
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,150
<i>We miss you, Lieutenant Min.</i>

51
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,610
Lieutenant Min, just come join us.

52
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,660
Lieutenant Min! Lieutenant Min!

53
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,740
<i>We miss you,</i>

54
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,870
<i>-Lieutenant Min!
-I'm sorry. I have to go.</i>

55
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,330
Sir.

56
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,300
I'm afraid I can't drive a foreign car.

57
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,420
I once drove your car and scratched it,

58
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,220
so I had to pay for it.

59
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,640
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,430
God damn it!

61
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,390
I'm drunk. How can I drive?

62
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,020
I don't know. I don't care.

63
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,360
Excuse me.

64
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,320
<i>Don't you feel sorry
for Lieutenant Min though?</i>

65
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,530
<i>I know.</i>

66
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,780
<i>He just punched the criminal
who insisted he's innocent</i>

67
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,410
<i>after hitting a family
and running away in a car accident.</i>

68
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,240
<i>But it led to police brutality,
and he got fired.</i>

69
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,700
<i>He hasn't even paid off</i>

70
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,210
<i>the settlement money
for the criminal and civil cases</i>

71
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,790
<i>of police brutality yet.</i>

72
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,880
<i>His retirement pension was cut in half
because he was fired.</i>

73
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,840
<i>He's still repaying the bank loan
for the settlement money.</i>

74
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,680
Does he stay in touch
with his wife and children?

75
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,890
The media reported
the case as police violence,

76
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,770
so his family was deeply hurt.

77
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,480
That's why he's divorced and lives alone.

78
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,780
That's so frustrating.
Let's stop talking about it.

79
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,900
Let's just drink.

80
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,410
All right. Cheers!

81
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,450
Hey, why are you drinking coke?

82
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,420
Everyone, I recently felt the desire
to live a long life.

83
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,380
Please forgive me.

84
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,250
All right. Cheers for the police!

85
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,000
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

86
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,220
EPISODE 14

87
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,430
This is nice.

88
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:07,910
Someone's inside, right?

89
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,450
Answer me.

90
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,620
Anyone inside?

91
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,750
Sergeant Kang, Sergeant Kang!

92
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,960
Okay, take her to a hospital immediately.

93
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,880
-Open the door.
-I heard you.

94
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,510
I'll be there right after work.

95
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,970
I'm at the scene now.

96
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,310
What's going on?

97
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,690
Jeong-o, what's the matter?

98
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,990
Please wait outside.

99
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,080
Okay.

100
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,660
I'll be right outside.

101
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,420
Call me if you need me.

102
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,970
Hey, why...

103
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,100
Why are you sitting on the floor?

104
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,730
I got

105
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,560
my period out of the blue
and started feeling dizzy.

106
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,900
But I don't have any pads.

107
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,530
I don't have money to buy them.

108
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,820
Could you buy one for me?

109
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,630
Are you...

110
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,140
really okay?

111
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,010
I'm just on my period, that's all.

112
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,900
Officer Han, is everything okay?

113
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:01,730
Yes, sir.

114
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,530
PARK EUN-BI

115
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,740
Thank you.

116
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,760
Just a second.

117
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,020
You have blood on your skirt.

118
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,530
Aren't there menstrual pads you can use
at the infirmary?

119
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,490
I feel bad about using them every month.

120
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,450
I don't think the nurse likes it.

121
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,010
Go back to your classroom now.

122
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,680
You know that there's a situation, right?

123
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,490
It's nothing serious.
Please radio the team.

124
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,000
She's the girl
Captain An was looking for earlier,

125
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,670
Park Eun-bi.

126
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,250
<i>The potential rape case at Mahyeon High.
The situation is over now.</i>

127
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,710
<i>We tracked the IP address</i>

128
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,630
<i>and caught the suspect
at an internet cafe near the school.</i>

129
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,670
<i>The situation is over.</i>

130
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,050
<i>Officers who are at the scene...</i>

131
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,720
The situation is over now, right?

132
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,760
-Yes.
<i>-Officers from Hongil Patrol Division,</i>

133
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,560
<i>the principal would like
to thank you in person.</i>

134
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,390
<i>Please come to the main meeting room
on the second floor.</i>

135
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,060
-We don't have time for that.
-<i>The principal would like to thank you.</i>

136
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,270
-The perp is a weirdo.
<i>-Please come to the second floor.</i>

137
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,030
Why did he post about planning
to rape someone just for fun?

138
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,070
What a psycho.

139
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,200
He'll be charged with intimidation
and obstruction of business.

140
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,030
The culprit in a similar case
got eight months of jail time.

141
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,250
That's great.
He needs to learn what the law can do.

142
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:27,960
THE 25TH PARENTS' MEETING

143
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,780
I'm truly relieved that

144
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,030
the situation got resolved
without anything happening.

145
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,280
We owe it all to the help we received
from the police officers here.

146
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,160
Gosh, this is so annoying.

147
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,790
We have a lot to do. Can't we just leave?

148
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:53,710
-This is part of our job. Be quiet.
-Thank you so much.

149
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,880
Had he not been caught...

150
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,920
My gosh, even just the thought
makes me shudder.

151
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,180
Totally.

152
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,180
It would've brought disgrace
on our great school.

153
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,850
By the way,
what kind of support can we provide

154
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,930
to the school as parents
in order to prevent sexual assault?

155
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,900
Receiving the training
in our sexual assault prevention program,

156
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,440
which is recommended
by the Ministry of Education,

157
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,070
will definitely be helpful.

158
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,740
I heard that some schools
neglect sex education

159
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,820
because they're so focused
on the college entrance exam.

160
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,240
Sex education is necessary
for prevention of--

161
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:28,410
What does that have to do
with preventing sexual assault?

162
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,920
I think we should raise money
to install security cameras

163
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
in and outside of the school.
That will be a lot more effective.

164
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,090
-Definitely.
-I totally agree.

165
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,340
Why bother asking
if they're not even going to listen?

166
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,470
-Great idea.
-It's such a good idea.

167
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,430
In my opinion...

168
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,440
Sexual assault prevention programs

169
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,320
and sex education taught in schools
are the most effective way to prevent it.

170
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,120
Sex crimes don't only occur
outside the school.

171
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,870
They can also happen
inside the school anytime.

172
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,000
-"Inside the school"?
-"Inside the school"?

173
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,800
-That's absurd.
-What's she talking about?

174
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:17,510
Among all middle and high school students,
about 10 percent of boys

175
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,050
and five percent of girls
have sexual experiences.

176
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,470
And a high percentage of them

177
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,390
experience pregnancy and abortion.

178
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,230
Well, we're discussing how we can
prevent sexual assault.

179
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:33,530
Why is she talking about abortion?
Gosh, that's so horrible.

180
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,900
-My goodness.
-What's her problem?

181
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,320
You can't prevent sexual violence

182
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:42,490
by telling girls not to stay out late,
not to wear short skirts,

183
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,330
and not to wear makeup.

184
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,750
You also can't prevent it

185
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:50,500
by just being mindful of rapists,
like the one we caught last week.

186
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,090
I can happen in a relationship,
in families,

187
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,590
and even between classmates.

188
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,680
-Is she saying our children can do that?
-What's she saying now?

189
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,390
Do you think that our children
are criminals or what?

190
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,430
But schools don't provide systematic
sex education programs to their students--

191
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,980
Look.

192
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:09,980
Miss.

193
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,940
We want to ask you police officers

194
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,610
about more practical ways
to prevent sexual crimes.

195
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:19,610
For example, can police officers
be stationed at the school?

196
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,450
Sex education, my foot.

197
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,660
Kids can learn those things
from the Internet.

198
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,990
That's enough, Jeong-o.

199
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,660
Such information isn't organized
systematically, and it's often incorrect.

200
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,540
The school must educate students
on contraception methods,

201
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:36,300
how to use a condom,
and sexual etiquettes.

202
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,630
Students can also have discussions on
whether they agree with abortion or not.

203
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,510
Sex education is necessary.

204
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,760
-She's spewing total nonsense.
-I'm speechless.

205
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,390
And if you'd like to do

206
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,770
something for students,

207
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:54,480
you can think about installing
a machine that gives out pads for free.

208
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,190
for students from low-income families
instead of putting up security cameras--

209
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:02,490
Who can't afford to buy
menstrual pads these days?

210
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,780
-Goodness.
-What a joke.

211
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,660
It's been on the news,

212
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,620
and there are many people like that
around us.

213
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,540
Considering our culture,
it's hard to provide

214
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,380
practical sex education programs

215
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,300
where we can give out free condoms
at school, but--

216
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,220
-"Free condoms"?
-Is she out of her mind?

217
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,680
Look, are you suggesting that
the school should give out condoms?

218
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,640
Are you saying the school
should encourage them to have sex or what?

219
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,640
That's not what she meant.

220
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,520
In other countries, such proactive--

221
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,610
Condoms won't encourage
students to have sex.

222
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,360
In fact, they prevent STDs
and many crimes such as illegal abortion.

223
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,240
I think that

224
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,370
is a lot more practical and effective
than installing security cameras.

225
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,660
-Goodness.
-What the heck is wrong with her?

226
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,580
-What's with her?
-That was way out of line.

227
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,710
How dare she say that our kids
might get an abortion and need condoms?

228
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,670
-They're here to study.
-Teacher.

229
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,500
Why does the school
need to give out condoms?

230
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,800
-Exactly.
<i>-Code Zero.</i>

231
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,800
<i>A robbery case at Hongan 3-dong 167.</i>

232
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,640
-<i>We have the suspect.
-We have to go.</i>

233
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,220
<i>A neighbor called it in.
Officers, please respond.</i>

234
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:13,980
I have colorectal cancer.

235
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,480
According to my CT scan and MRI result,

236
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,820
the doctor thinks stage two or three.

237
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,400
He won't know

238
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,610
until he opens me up for operation.

239
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:30,290
-Did you request a medical leave?
-Yes.

240
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,330
It was accepted today.

241
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,540
I have to prepare
for my surgery starting tomorrow.

242
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,250
I haven't

243
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,380
been able to tell my team yet.

244
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,380
We're always so busy.

245
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,220
I wanted to ask.

246
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,550
Are you in complete remission?

247
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,510
It's

248
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,600
been about seven years.

249
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,440
Well...

250
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,770
Last week, I had a relapse.

251
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,980
It's nothing serious.

252
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,690
It can be treated with medication.

253
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:10,240
My patrol division
is just as busy as yours

254
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,870
which is why

255
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:15,750
I asked to be transferred as
police corporal at Bomun.

256
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,210
I heard you asked
to be transferred there too,

257
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,260
so I came by to ask
if you could let me have the spot.

258
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,630
I guess I can't.

259
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,800
Your situation is just as bad.

260
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,640
Anyway, I'll get going.

261
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:40,810
Sir.

262
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,270
Sir?

263
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,780
Sir.

264
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,030
We'll talk again soon. Bye.

265
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,290
-Good night.
-Take care, sir.

266
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,880
Where's Jeong-o?

267
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,210
She's upstairs with Captain Eun.

268
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,800
-We're back.
-We're back.

269
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,420
No one's here.

270
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,260
Sang-su,

271
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,260
-how are Jeong-o's living conditions?
-Sorry?

272
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,600
Will she be okay if she gets fired?

273
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,020
-Why...
-Ask her

274
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,350
and get back to me on it.

275
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,310
I'm off.

276
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,280
-Good night.
-See you tomorrow.

277
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,690
Good night, sir.

278
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,450
-What was that about?
-Tell me.

279
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,280
Why can't you apologize?

280
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,950
I didn't do anything wrong
that I need to apologize for.

281
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,290
Why mention condoms at a school?

282
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,380
A parent is filing
a complaint against you.

283
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,710
I'm not asking you to apologize for me,
but for you.

284
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:51,880
You're a probationary officer. Do you
think you'll be able to become a cop then?

285
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,970
During my time here,

286
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,810
I have proved myself as a cop.

287
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,730
Why would a complaint ruin my chances?

288
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:01,440
Complaints dictate our careers
because we're powerless.

289
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,110
It's like getting convicted.
It doesn't make sense, right?

290
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,570
It's unfair, but that's our reality.

291
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:10,400
Twelve parents in total
are filing complaints against you.

292
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,070
How could you suggest

293
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,530
such inappropriate things like
giving students condoms

294
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,450
and debating about abortion at a school?

295
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,750
They're saying you insulted the students.

296
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,830
They felt like you were accusing
their children of becoming

297
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,590
potential predators by mentioning
sexual assault between students.

298
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:28,590
You!

299
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,640
I begged the principal

300
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:42,310
and got you the chance to apologize
before they file the complaint,

301
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,480
so apologize.

302
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,810
I never insulted the students.

303
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:50,690
The parents asked how they could
help prevent sexual assaults,

304
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,820
so I told them my opinion

305
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,660
on what the best course of action is.

306
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,620
Let them file the complaint.
I'll gladly be investigated.

307
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,460
Jeong-o, wait. Jeong-o!

308
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,050
How can you just sit there and eat?

309
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,880
If she receives a complaint,

310
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,680
does it hurt the division's performance?

311
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,980
In her case,

312
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,940
if she ends up being investigated
after her incident with the taser gun,

313
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,070
she might

314
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,030
not make it onto the force. Get it?

315
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,070
She studied hard to get here,

316
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,660
but this might ruin all of her chances.
Get it?

317
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,790
Apologize to the parents.

318
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,500
Everyone at the division agrees.

319
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,640
I don't think

320
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,100
that what you said was wrong.

321
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,770
But formal complaints are messy.

322
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,110
You'll be questioned by Internal Affairs
all the time

323
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,900
and it'll hurt your career.

324
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,860
We're only probationary officers.

325
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,200
So apologize.

326
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,000
At least for mentioning
condoms and abortion.

327
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,290
You know how Korean parents are.

328
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,710
-They think they're always right.
-This time,

329
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,880
I'm right though.

330
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,880
Jeong-o, don't be so stubborn.

331
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,840
We're cops, not teachers.

332
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,510
How sex education is taught in schools,

333
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,560
and how parents raise their children

334
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,980
are not a part of our job description.

335
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,850
Why can't you see that?

336
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,820
Those ladies said there's no need for you
to worry about their children.

337
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,190
It happened to me

338
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,700
so who says it won't happen to their kids?

339
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,620
How can they be sure?

340
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,160
When I was in grade 10,

341
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,710
I was raped

342
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:57,130
at a mountain behind my school.

343
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,590
After the assault,

344
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,760
I didn't know what actions to take.

345
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,890
I didn't know about
emergency contraceptive pills,

346
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:13,900
so I ended up

347
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,070
getting an illegal abortion.

348
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,660
Those who assaulted me

349
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,030
were students at my school.

350
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,330
What happened to me

351
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,790
can happen to anyone.

352
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:36,840
I won't apologize

353
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,170
because I'm right this time.

354
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,150
Patrol 21, Patrol 21.

355
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,950
We're at the motorcycle
and car collision site.

356
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,710
Patrol 21, Patrol 21.

357
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,120
We're at the collision site.

358
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,130
Take out the cones and set up a perimeter.

359
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,800
We don't want a secondary accident.

360
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,380
Why are we the only ones here?

361
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,630
Where is the traffic police?

362
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,050
<i>They're wrapping up
a five-car pile-up in Mapo.</i>

363
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,470
<i>They'll be there soon.
Paramedics are on their way.</i>

364
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:14,770
Please step inside the coned area.
It's dangerous.

365
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:18,270
Sir, I think the motorcyclist is dead.

366
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:30,160
I think he smashed his head.

367
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,220
He's not moving.

368
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:50,010
He's dead. He must be dead.

369
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,190
This is the sedan
and motorcycle collision site.

370
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,190
The motorcyclist

371
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:08,990
is dead.

372
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,830
I'm a policeman. Are you awake?

373
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:27,090
Hang in there.
An ambulance will be here soon.

374
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,470
I want to get you out of the car,

375
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,090
but that could do you more harm.

376
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,390
Bear with me.

377
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,430
Officer Song, set out the traffic cones.

378
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,890
More cars could run into us.

379
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,070
Officer Song, what are you doing?

380
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,160
Hey.

381
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,120
What's wrong with you?

382
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,120
Hye-ri.

383
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,290
Hye-ri.

384
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,500
Wake up.

385
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,920
What do you mean the assistant chief
requested a transfer?

386
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:11,260
HEAD OF DIVISION

387
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,890
Tell me everything you know in detail.

388
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,220
From the beginning.

389
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,560
Let go.

390
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,230
Let go!

391
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,650
What is it now? My shift's almost over.

392
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,740
Hello, everyone.

393
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,120
-You had a long shift?
-Yes.

394
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,410
We'll get changed quickly.

395
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:38,870
Okay.

396
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,670
Can you answer questions?

397
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,540
Or will you sleep it off
and talk to us tomorrow?

398
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,090
I'll answer questions.

399
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:51,300
Come here, then.

400
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,970
Sit still, will you?

401
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,060
This is crazy.

402
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,020
We should be home by now.

403
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,940
Why did you two fight?

404
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,280
I was drinking,
and that asshole punched me first!

405
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,580
You slept with my wife!

406
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,080
I'll kill you!

407
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,870
What's wrong with you?

408
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,170
-My goodness.
-Stop it.

409
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,590
-I'll put cuffs on your ankles.
-Get off me!

410
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,510
Are you okay?

411
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,090
Are you okay?

412
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,640
Are you okay?

413
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,150
Damn it.

414
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:53,530
Dial 911! Dial 911!

415
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,280
What's wrong?

416
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,660
Are you okay?

417
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,160
I'm fine.

418
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,410
Can I come in?

419
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,080
I need to go home.

420
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,840
I have nothing to say.

421
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,100
Why are you taking your uniform?

422
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,350
To wash it at home.

423
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,190
Which home?

424
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,950
My Daejeon home.

425
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,610
You work tomorrow.
Why are you going to Daejeon?

426
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,370
I applied for a day off.

427
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,300
Were you very shocked?

428
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,470
I need to change.

429
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:13,610
Okay. Get some rest.

430
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:21,910
But

431
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:24,080
you must come back.

432
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,330
Okay?

433
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,180
CONTACTS

434
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:34,690
HAN JEONG-O

435
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,200
SENIOR CHOI MYEONG-HO

436
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,080
It's Jeong-o.

437
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,920
Go ahead.

438
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:01,260
I'm

439
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,590
near the station.

440
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,720
If I come to where you live,

441
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:10,930
can we meet up?

442
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,520
Right now,

443
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,520
I want to be alone.

444
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,070
Jeong-o.

445
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,490
Yes?

446
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,580
Are you

447
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,540
really okay?

448
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,170
<i>Answer me.</i>

449
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,720
<i>Are you</i>

450
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,510
okay?

451
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:56,730
Sorry.

452
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:00,230
I want to say I'm okay,

453
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,690
but I'm not.

454
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,200
I have to go.

455
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,810
Go away, Sang-su.

456
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:36,310
HAN JEONG-O

457
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:47,780
I said go away.

458
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,370
What do you want?

459
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,970
What are you doing?

460
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,390
We work tomorrow.

461
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,770
You can't drink the night before.
I'm getting rid of it all.

462
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,380
Get out.

463
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:56,270
I said get out.

464
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,360
So you're not going to leave?

465
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,020
Then I will.

466
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,550
I'll do it. You must be exhausted.

467
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,760
Why do more work when you worked all day?

468
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,050
Just let me do it.
You should take a nap, Dad.

469
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:16,970
Let's do it together.

470
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:19,970
Go in, please. I said I'll do it.

471
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,350
Go in and get more sleep.

472
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,860
Then just rinse this and go to bed, okay?

473
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,860
I'll take care of the rest later.

474
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,860
Okay?

475
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,880
Sang-su.

476
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,890
Did you make enough for me?

477
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,930
You can eat if you want.

478
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,190
You're crazy.

479
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:57,740
Do you live here now or what?

480
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:00,120
You sleep here whenever you want.

481
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,740
Nothing happened.

482
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,120
You idiot.

483
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,700
How is that possible?
Jeong-o is so attractive.

484
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,870
Is there something wrong with you?

485
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:10,580
Do you feel a little weak down there
or what?

486
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,840
Stop it, Mom.

487
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:17,130
Hey,
don't seduce him with that smile of yours.

488
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,970
Or just date him.

489
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:21,600
Make up your mind, will you?

490
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,970
Stop spewing nonsense
and just go to work. Go on.

491
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:27,810
Jeong-o, there are pickles inside
that thing. It's good with rice.

492
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,020
Try it. And...

493
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,520
can you just let
Sang-su live here with you?

494
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,940
-Just date him. Please? Jeong-o.
-Gosh, stop.

495
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:37,610
-You don't need to look far. Jeong-o!
-Jeez.

496
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,070
Give me a kiss.

497
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:47,700
Are we good now? Then go.

498
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:51,540
She won't like me if she thinks
that I'm a mama's boy. Leave, please.

499
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,210
Gosh, you're so picky.

500
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,670
Guys, be careful as always, okay?

501
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,930
Be safe! Your safety comes first!
Be safe...

502
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,850
Jeez, seriously.

503
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,600
My mom is really something.

504
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,020
Jeong-o.

505
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,900
Can you please
just let Sang-su move in with you?

506
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:16,070
I'll be good to you. Jeong-o, please!

507
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,200
You idiot.

508
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,130
-Do you want fried eggs?
-Sure.

509
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,190
So?

510
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,060
What happened to those punks?

511
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,820
I don't know.

512
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,160
On the day of,

513
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:15,210
I was too flustered,
so I couldn't report it to the police.

514
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,630
And after that,

515
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,590
I didn't even want to think about it.

516
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,760
I was afraid too.

517
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,600
You said they were guys at your school.

518
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:34,060
It's just my guess.

519
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,020
I heard them say this

520
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,690
as they were abandoning me in the forest.

521
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,360
"She's Han Jeong-o
from class 6 grade 10, right?"

522
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,330
After that incident,

523
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:52,040
I kept missing school
because I was scared.

524
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,120
Then, I transferred schools.

525
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,380
Is that why you broke up with Da-yeong?

526
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,430
Han-pyo said he went to school with you.

527
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:10,760
He was friends with your ex,
Jeong Da-yeong.

528
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:17,150
Da-yeong was such a sweet guy.

529
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:22,070
I really liked him.

530
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:31,240
LIEUTENANT OH YANG-CHON

531
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:34,330
Han Jeong-o speaking.

532
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,330
What are you going to do
about the complaint?

533
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:39,830
Are you going to apologize or not?

534
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,960
I don't want to apologize, sir.

535
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,810
Jeong-o.

536
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:54,850
I won't apologize to the parents.

537
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:58,940
Shall we go for a run?

538
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:00,940
Let's go.

539
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,320
Jeong-o, let's go for a run.

540
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,240
Come on.

541
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,640
<i>Jeong-o, Jeong-o.</i>

542
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,970
Are you taking a shower? Jeong-o!

543
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:35,100
Did you fall down?

544
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:38,440
Hey, what on earth happened?

545
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,360
Jeong-o.

546
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,410
Jeong-o.

547
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:42,170
Yesterday and today,

548
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,250
after hearing my story,

549
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,300
you haven't said anything

550
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,010
or tried to comfort me.

551
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,850
You heard about everything.

552
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,560
How did that make you feel?

553
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:16,570
I'm sad.

554
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:24,920
I'm so sad

555
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,340
that I can't say anything.

556
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:36,680
I want to tell you that I'm proud of you,

557
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:42,020
that it must have been hard,

558
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,360
that I'm proud
of how you handled yourself.

559
00:43:57,490 --> 00:43:59,580
But I'm too sad to say anything.

560
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,970
Sang-su.

561
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,390
I feel so relieved now.

562
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,690
I guess

563
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:34,940
I felt that it was unfair

564
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:37,200
that I had to keep it all inside

565
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:39,030
without telling anyone.

566
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:45,000
I guess I wanted to tell someone

567
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:50,000
and receive consolation.

568
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,090
I'm so glad I told you.

569
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:02,260
A huge weight has been
lifted off my chest.

570
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:07,310
I feel much better.

571
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,690
Dad, look at this.

572
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:56,070
It's used,

573
00:45:57,490 --> 00:45:59,490
but it works fine.

574
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:03,160
Maybe I should've gotten a new one.

575
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:11,460
Are you sick?

576
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:17,090
You didn't eat your porridge.

577
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:20,050
I told you to eat
while I went to buy a TV.

578
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,650
You have a fever.

579
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:36,690
Dad, sit up.

580
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:42,410
Sit up. Let's go to the doctor's.

581
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:50,200
Put this on. We're going to the doctor's.

582
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:54,330
Here.

583
00:46:58,090 --> 00:46:59,760
Here. Put it on. Come on.

584
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:01,510
Goodness.

585
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:07,510
What's wrong?

586
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:10,890
Are you thinking about
going to where Mom is?

587
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:13,350
Huh?

588
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:14,810
Is that it?

589
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,190
Are you a devoted husband?

590
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:25,070
Since when did you care about Mom so much?

591
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,740
She's gone,
but you need to stay here with us.

592
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:33,330
You did nothing for me, are you going to
put me through consecutive funerals?

593
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:38,710
I'm right.

594
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,420
You hit me and Mom,

595
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:43,260
but did nothing for us.

596
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:55,390
That's more like it.

597
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:57,610
Let's eat.

598
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,190
I don't have an appetite.

599
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:11,830
Hold on a second.

600
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:20,500
Have this instead then.

601
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,930
I'm divorced,

602
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:29,300
and my kids are all grown.

603
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,220
All I have left is you.

604
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:33,640
So eat up.

605
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:48,910
You need to regain your vigor.

606
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:55,660
Thank you for eating it.

607
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:14,220
I'm sorry.

608
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:17,850
We never really started anything,

609
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,230
but I'm telling you it's over.

610
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,640
I'm sorry.

611
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,000
We never really started anything,

612
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,400
but I'm telling you it's over.

613
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,250
Even though I was assaulted,

614
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:42,000
I thought I put it behind me.

615
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:44,340
I thought I was okay.

616
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:49,760
I believed that I was ready to love.

617
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:54,470
I believed I was okay
physically and mentally.

618
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:56,270
Jeong-o.

619
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:03,560
We're breaking up
because of one reason only.

620
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,320
I'm not the guy for you.

621
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,450
Other than that, there's nothing

622
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,450
that keeps us apart.

623
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,880
Besides,

624
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,680
the one who's not ready

625
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:37,640
is me, not you.

626
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,390
After I first kissed you,

627
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:46,400
I asked myself dozens of times a day.

628
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:48,860
"Myeong-ho,

629
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:52,280
are you really over Hyeon-su?"

630
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:55,660
"Then why

631
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,080
can't you let go of her pendant?"

632
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:12,760
I...

633
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:16,430
I just

634
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:21,020
couldn't answer any of those questions.

635
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:26,310
That's when I knew.

636
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,480
I still

637
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:33,860
love her.

638
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:39,830
You date for three years,

639
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:41,870
applied to be cops together,

640
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:43,660
and worked in the same division.

641
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:47,250
How can you move on in just two years?

642
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:50,550
That's just isn't possible.

643
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:57,720
You're right.

644
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,850
I guess I rushed into things.

645
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:04,350
Yes.

646
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,480
Jeong-o.

647
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:14,030
I hope you end up with someone
far better than me.

648
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:16,200
All right?

649
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:17,610
Okay.

650
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:21,490
I placed my order earlier.

651
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:24,370
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

652
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:28,750
Seriously.
Can you take your dates elsewhere?

653
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,000
I don't want to see it on my way to work.

654
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:32,750
Who's on a date?

655
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:34,340
We just broke up.

656
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,890
Laying it all out in the open

657
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:42,350
will be easier for us both.

658
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:01,580
How's Da-yeong these days?

659
00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:04,910
I heard from school friends

660
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:08,330
that he's studying law in England.

661
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:11,420
Is he still studying?

662
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:14,250
He joined a law firm last month

663
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:15,710
and started dating recently.

664
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:18,720
That's great news.

665
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:22,470
He'll be happy with whomever he's with,

666
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:24,010
since he's a decent guy.

667
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,860
What's gotten into her?

668
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:41,530
Hey.

669
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,490
Did you know
Jeong-o and Myeong-ho broke up?

670
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:49,000
Hold on. Is she dating you instead?

671
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:20,780
No one's home.

672
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,780
The man who crashed into the car
you were driving

673
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,700
is in hospital,
and his wife's nursing him.

674
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:29,910
I see.

675
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:34,080
Was the man badly hurt? I can't reach him.

676
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:36,800
He fractured a cervical vertebra.

677
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:39,710
I'm so sorry.

678
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:42,130
You'll have a hard time paying

679
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,890
for the repairs and medical bill.

680
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:46,850
<i>What's all this?</i>

681
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:50,020
Even if it was an imported car,

682
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:52,480
it can't cost 47 million won to repair.

683
00:54:57,150 --> 00:55:00,860
Mr. Min,
did the guy from block 308 unit 1403

684
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:03,110
tell you to pay for this too?

685
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:07,830
Don't you have to pay for the repairs to
the other car and his medical bills too?

686
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:12,120
This accident happened because
they refused to fix

687
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:13,500
the warning light in the lot.

688
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,000
Gosh, this is a disaster.

689
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:19,500
Hire a lawyer.

690
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:22,920
I have to go.

691
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,060
So...

692
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:40,780
The Resident Council
decided to let you go.

693
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:46,740
I went down on my knees to beg them
to do anything but that.

694
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:49,910
I'm sorry.

695
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:54,540
You have until the end of the month.

696
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,170
You can go home for today.

697
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:35,870
<i>The man who crashed into the car
you were driving</i>

698
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:38,880
<i>fractured a cervical vertebra.</i>

699
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:41,630
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

700
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,010
<i>You'll have a hard time paying
for everything.</i>

701
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:49,390
<i>The Resident Council
decided to let you go.</i>

702
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:54,100
<i>I went down on my knees to beg them
to do anything but that.</i>

703
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:57,640
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

704
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:15,370
MY DAUGHTER

705
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:32,010
<i>The number you have dialed
is not available at this moment.</i>

706
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,060
MY SON

707
00:57:49,110 --> 00:57:51,870
<i>The number you have dialed...</i>

708
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,120
<i>We'll go straight to our reporter</i>

709
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:40,040
<i>out at Mahyeon Police Station.</i>

710
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:43,120
<i>Captain An, about a year ago,
there was a case</i>

711
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:45,040
<i>on Mount Somyeong's Trail 11
near Mount Baekun</i>

712
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:47,920
<i>that was suspected to be committed by
the same criminal.</i>

713
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,050
<i>The police were notified of the case...</i>

714
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:52,090
A year ago, she worked here.

715
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:53,930
Why was that her responsibility?

716
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:55,300
Aren't they lunatics?

717
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:56,430
<i>At the recent briefing,</i>

718
00:58:56,510 --> 00:58:58,930
<i>the chief announced
he'll punish the officer in charge.</i>

719
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:00,350
<i>What do you say about that?</i>

720
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:02,270
-How annoying.
-<i>The public...</i>

721
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:04,810
Isn't the chief a bastard?

722
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:06,310
How dare he punish her?

723
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:09,360
Captain An asked for a task force team,

724
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,400
but her superior and the chief refused

725
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:16,450
saying they were unrelated because
the cases were in different areas.

726
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:19,080
Every officer in the area knows that.

727
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:21,290
The victim reported it two months later.

728
00:59:21,370 --> 00:59:24,170
How can we investigate with no evidence?

729
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:26,460
They're all talk when they know nothing.

730
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:29,000
This is driving me insane.

731
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:30,300
Damn you all.

732
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,340
Can we please watch the news?

733
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:35,090
Why bothering watching that?

734
00:59:35,550 --> 00:59:37,140
You're leaving anyway.

735
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,430
I'm sick of being a cop.

736
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:43,690
They said nothing about how we caught him.

737
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:48,650
<i>This event has cast serious doubt on...</i>

738
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:02,700
Assistant Chief, what should we do?

739
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:10,250
Han Jeong-o.

740
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,510
What'll you do about
the high school incident?

741
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:15,090
Will you apologize or not?

742
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:20,350
I don't... I don't feel like it yet.

743
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,810
Do you have time and energy to spare?

744
01:00:26,270 --> 01:00:27,520
What's wrong with you?

745
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,570
Do you think we held back
because we don't have guts?

746
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,280
Will you just take it easy?

747
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:34,820
There's a lot to do.

748
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,740
Let's go out.

749
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:39,280
I'm sure there's a reason
she said those things.

750
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:27,330
It's me.

751
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,710
I wanted to know how you felt.

752
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:35,460
Right now? It's pretty simple.

753
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:37,340
I feel like shit.

754
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:48,270
How is she?

755
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,070
Han Jeong-o, come to the gym.

756
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,080
Lieutenant Oh.

757
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,290
Jeong-o's...

758
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,380
You don't feel like apologizing?

759
01:02:19,630 --> 01:02:21,510
Do you only do what you want?

760
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:25,510
I believe I said what had to be said

761
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,720
for the sake of the students.

762
01:02:29,390 --> 01:02:32,690
Condoms and abortions
tie into preventing sexual assault.

763
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,650
Preventing sexual assault
is one of our core duties.

764
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:37,940
That's what I believe.

765
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,070
Who cares what you believe?

766
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:43,410
It's about the public.

767
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:48,330
You may think that
the parents who were there

768
01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:51,960
are just narrow-minded,
old-fashioned snobs.

769
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:53,290
To me,

770
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:56,500
they looked like average parents,

771
01:02:56,670 --> 01:02:59,630
who are agitated and concerned
that their kids

772
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:02,970
had been exposed to a threat all day.

773
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:08,510
Install machines that dispense
free sanitary pads.

774
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:11,680
Hand out free condoms
like they do overseas.

775
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:15,360
Hold debates regarding
the issue of abortion.

776
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:17,150
That wasn't for yesterday.

777
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:19,320
It would've been more efficient

778
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:23,400
if you'd posted your opinion
on the Ministry of Education's website

779
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:27,700
as a local police officer
concerned with such issues.

780
01:03:28,370 --> 01:03:30,080
That is my opinion.

781
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:36,000
Captain An

782
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:40,130
was condemned by the media today
for no reason

783
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:42,010
and is facing disciplinary action.

784
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:45,260
The Captain An I know

785
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:48,430
might be infuriated by
the injustice today,

786
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:50,260
but tomorrow,

787
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:54,560
she will jump head-first into
whatever case comes her way.

788
01:03:57,110 --> 01:03:58,400
Is it because everything's right?

789
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:01,610
Is it because she lacks conviction?

790
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,450
That's not it.

791
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,360
In her case,

792
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:09,870
rather than pushing her beliefs like you,

793
01:04:10,490 --> 01:04:12,410
she will take the issues,

794
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
put in her time and best effort
to improve the conditions.

795
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:21,420
Like always, she'll consider that
to be the most important thing.

796
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:26,720
What will you do now?

797
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:31,100
The problems
with sexual education in schools.

798
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:34,680
Will you put in your time to appeal
to the Ministry of Education?

799
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:36,100
Or

800
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,440
will you consume your energy
quarreling with the parents?

801
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:44,190
Tell me. What's your choice?

802
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:50,280
I'll apologize.

803
01:04:56,370 --> 01:04:57,500
Captain An.

804
01:04:58,420 --> 01:04:59,710
Will she be all right?

805
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:07,510
Will she be met with
a severe disciplinary action?

806
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:12,050
I don't know.

807
01:05:14,270 --> 01:05:15,180
Anyway,

808
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:18,390
I like how you're rough around the edges.

809
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:22,570
It's the perk of a young officer.

810
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:24,530
That's how it should be.

811
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:27,400
Don't be discouraged and keep it up.

812
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:31,570
That's how the world
will change for the better.

813
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:01,560
Is this the teacher's office?

814
01:06:03,110 --> 01:06:06,440
I'm Officer Han Jeong-o
of Hongil Patrol Division.

815
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:12,280
I'm sorry,
but how can I reach the principal?

816
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,580
I didn't make anything up.

817
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:20,000
You'll soon be leaving anyway.

818
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:24,250
You asked to be transferred to Bomun
as a police corporal.

819
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:34,140
Captain Oh
of Myeongu Patrol Division called.

820
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:37,100
His senior's cancer relapsed,

821
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,430
so he needs an easygoing job.

822
01:06:40,270 --> 01:06:42,770
Everyone at his division
is pulling strings,

823
01:06:43,810 --> 01:06:45,610
but he's saying
you're stealing his chances.

824
01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:49,570
He's infuriated.

825
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,870
That's not decent at all.

826
01:06:56,370 --> 01:06:57,330
I know

827
01:06:57,870 --> 01:07:00,200
that this division is busy
every day at every hour.

828
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:04,880
Of course you want to spend
your last years on the job at ease.

829
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:06,790
But behind my back

830
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:09,210
and everyone here,

831
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,670
you asked to be transferred
to just save yourself.

832
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:14,840
How can you be so rude?

833
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:16,350
You...

834
01:07:17,350 --> 01:07:20,640
You have no idea why
I had to handle it this way!

835
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:23,190
Of course I don't. Am I a psychic?
I can't read people's minds.

836
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:25,440
How can I know when you haven't told me?

837
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:31,240
I've been trying very hard to not
let my promotion exam interfere with work,

838
01:07:31,650 --> 01:07:33,240
but kudos to you.

839
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:36,780
You just asked for a transfer
as if we didn't matter at all!

840
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:43,870
That's enough.

841
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:48,290
Fine.

842
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:51,050
You're right.

843
01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:54,590
I...

844
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:00,770
A few days ago...

845
01:08:03,730 --> 01:08:04,690
What am I going to do?

846
01:08:08,610 --> 01:08:11,480
The man I brought in a few days back
hurt himself,

847
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:18,370
but he's blaming it on me.

848
01:08:19,490 --> 01:08:21,370
He filed a complaint
claiming police brutality.

849
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:29,420
What do I do?

850
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:33,300
What if I lose my badge over this?

851
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:38,340
Assistant Chief, you won't believe this.

852
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:41,970
A call came in about
a security guard committing arson,

853
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:43,890
so our division rolled out.

854
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:45,850
I looked into the call,

855
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:48,810
and that security guard is Su-man.

856
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:49,770
What?

857
01:08:59,530 --> 01:09:01,280
You can't stay here.

858
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:03,580
Please evacuate to a safer location!

859
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:09,960
What the hell is going on?

860
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:13,710
Rolling down the hose.

861
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:15,590
Won-u, here comes the paramedics.

862
01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:17,130
Excuse me. Out of the way.

863
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:18,470
Let the ambulance through.

864
01:09:52,590 --> 01:09:54,210
MIN SU-MAN

865
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,010
Damn it.

866
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:03,930
<i>The person you are trying to reach...</i>

867
01:10:04,010 --> 01:10:07,060
MIN SU-MAN

868
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:11,810
Pick up. Pick up, damn it!

869
01:10:23,530 --> 01:10:25,580
Why aren't you saying anything?

870
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:30,750
Shouldn't someone explain to me
what's going on?

871
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:36,920
We're sorry, Captain An.

872
01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:40,670
For the sake of the entire force,

873
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:43,590
the chief couldn't say otherwise.

874
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:46,060
We followed protocol.

875
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:48,140
Unless three or more cases are tied,

876
01:10:48,770 --> 01:10:50,890
we can't classify it as a serial.

877
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:55,150
Forming a task force can
expose the victims' identities,

878
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,480
and the media puts pressure
on the investigation.

879
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:01,150
However, the public doesn't care.

880
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:04,110
They don't care that
we caught the culprit either.

881
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:08,200
The mother of the deceased
has reported me,

882
01:11:08,450 --> 01:11:10,160
the chief, and you
for dereliction of duty.

883
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:14,250
It's impossible to have us prosecuted.

884
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,840
Still, we need to dig ourselves
out of this mess.

885
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:22,630
We all know that you're not to blame.

886
01:11:23,130 --> 01:11:26,550
The prosecutor's office is
in sharp disagreement on this,

887
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:30,680
so whatever we say
will be heard as an excuse.

888
01:11:33,190 --> 01:11:34,520
Captain An,

889
01:11:35,690 --> 01:11:37,690
I know it's not fair,
but don't make this messier.

890
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:39,440
Think of the force and--

891
01:11:39,650 --> 01:11:41,940
I'm a member of that said force too.

892
01:11:44,030 --> 01:11:45,110
You're right.

893
01:11:45,950 --> 01:11:47,530
We're all members of it.

894
01:11:48,450 --> 01:11:50,080
So as a member of the force--

895
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:51,540
That's not what I mean!

896
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:58,170
You, me, and everyone here
are a member of the force.

897
01:11:58,250 --> 01:12:00,130
So why am I the only one

898
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,550
getting disciplinary action?

899
01:12:03,670 --> 01:12:04,590
Tell me.

900
01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:09,220
Why is it that you can't
be the subject instead?

901
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:11,270
Give me a good reason.

902
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:13,140
Why?

903
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:17,230
Are you too high up on the food chain
to receive it?

904
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:20,230
Is that why I'm the scapegoat?

905
01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:50,470
I was diagnosed with cancer.

906
01:12:51,010 --> 01:12:52,260
<i>Su-man!</i>

907
01:12:52,350 --> 01:12:53,270
<i>Go!</i>

908
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:57,190
<i>The job at Bomun Station.</i>

909
01:12:58,650 --> 01:13:00,690
Make sure you're the one
who ends up going. Not him.

910
01:13:02,150 --> 01:13:03,530
<i>If you were my daughter,</i>

911
01:13:03,610 --> 01:13:05,490
I'd have you quit the force.

912
01:13:05,570 --> 01:13:06,780
They want me to get lost.

913
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:08,700
Should we both quit?

914
01:13:11,870 --> 01:13:13,080
Drop your weapon!

915
01:13:14,540 --> 01:13:16,660
