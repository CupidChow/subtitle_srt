EPISODE 3

3
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,420
Why did Song-yi take time off school?

4
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,510
She should graduate and get married.

5
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,880
What's her plan?

6
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,510
Huh?

7
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,850
Let's get a divorce.

8
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,610
Didn't you hear me?

9
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,730
I want a divorce.

10
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,170
What made you upset this time?

11
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,880
What have I done wrong?

12
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,470
Huh?

13
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,890
My mentor just died,

14
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,180
and everyone blames me for that...

15
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,950
I'll send your stuff to your father's--

16
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,790
That's enough!

17
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,710
Pick your moment before nagging me!

18
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,470
I've always treated you like a queen
and let you boss me around.

19
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,230
Now you just don't know when to stop.

20
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,520
Have I ever had an affair

21
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,320
or failed to provide for my family?
Damn it!

22
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,490
Have I ever hit you or our children?

23
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,490
A divorce, my ass.

24
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,210
I hope I don't see you here
when I get back home from work.

25
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,040
Do you believe the rumors too?

26
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,590
I swear I didn't drink
on the day Ho-cheol died.

27
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,380
Ho-cheol's wife also believes the rumors.

28
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,560
I know how you feel.

29
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:11,610
I'm sorry.

30
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,440
When your parents passed away,

31
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,490
-I didn't even--
-They were old

32
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,530
and had been in the hospital
for a long time.

33
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,200
It doesn't upset me that much

34
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,660
because I knew it could happen anytime.

35
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,620
But Ho-cheol was only 60.
He was too young.

36
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,380
He had kids late in life,
so they're still young.

37
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,420
I know you wouldn't drink
during working hours.

38
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,590
Your chief is just an asshole.

39
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,420
You understand me, but--

40
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,140
Even though I understand you,
I can't live with you anymore.

41
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,430
Not even a single moment.

42
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,730
It's Ju-yeong.

43
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,490
Let's talk about this later.

44
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,410
You'd better stay out of my sight too.

45
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,540
Are you really divorcing Dad?

46
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,290
That's between him and me. Keep out of it.

47
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,750
Okay.

48
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,730
There are times
when I put criminals in this car,

49
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,230
so I got this just in case.

50
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,940
I didn't know it'd be this useful.

51
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,870
<i>You fool.</i>

52
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,330
<i>A cop can't drink on duty.</i>

53
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,160
<i>I'm off the clock now.</i>

54
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,750
<i>You said you'd drive.</i>

55
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,330
<i>Let me drink.</i>

56
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,590
<i>Drink this.</i>

57
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,710
<i>-Here.
-You're no fun.</i>

58
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,300
<i>It's black coffee.</i>

59
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,390
<i>Wear your seat belt.</i>

60
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,140
I'll meet with the chief.

61
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,850
Send it to the Police Human Rights Center
and Internal Affairs.

62
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,560
Also, keep a copy of it just in case.

63
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,080
Chief.

64
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,210
It's me, Oh Yang-chon.

65
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,830
How are you doing?
Does where I punched you still hurt?

66
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,130
<i>Code Zero.</i>

67
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,250
<i>Hana Motel at 765 Imhyeon Intersection.</i>

68
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,960
<i>A sexual assault has been reported.</i>

69
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,100
<i>Code Zero. Room 203 at Hana Motel.</i>

70
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,350
<i>A sexual assault has been reported.
Have you left yet?</i>

71
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,730
<i>Are you on your way?</i>

72
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,400
Patrol 24. On the way.

73
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,490
Patrol 21. On the way to Hana Motel
to provide backup.

74
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,320
Patrol 20. On the way.

75
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,950
SEOUL POLICE COORDINATED RESPONSE
DISPATCHED

76
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,330
CAN'T DISTINGUISH
ASSAILANT FROM VICTIM

77
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,750
Patrol units, listen up.

78
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,460
For the motel case, we're not sure
whether it was rape or assault.

79
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,840
We don't even know
who's the victim and who's the assailant.

80
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,170
According to the person who made the call,

81
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,260
both the male and the female, who seem
to be in their 20s, are in Room 203.

82
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,600
What's this?

83
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,020
THEY ARE VOMITING BLOOD

84
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,390
The motel owner reported
that they are both vomiting blood.

85
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,350
<i>At the moment, we do not know
where or how badly they're injured.</i>

86
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,520
Is there any concern for the victim
or the assailant to escape?

87
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,440
We haven't been able to reach
the informant for the last 4 minutes.

88
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,990
<i>Are the paramedics on the way?</i>

89
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,660
Yes, they are.

90
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,870
A fire at Inseok Market. All patrol units
in the vicinity, report to the scene.

91
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,870
A fire at Inseok Market. All patrol units
in the vicinity, provide backup.

92
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,790
<i>The location of the fire
is the second floor of Building A.</i>

93
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,250
<i>There are people inside.</i>

94
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:42,670
<i>Sergeant Ban,
go to the scene to provide backup.</i>

95
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,760
Okay, this is Patrol 20.

96
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,470
Received backup request
for the fire at Inseok Market.

97
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,970
Patrol 20 is on the way to the scene.

98
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,230
Damn it.

99
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,940
Patrol 20.

100
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,280
We had a minor collision

101
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,660
on our way to Inseok Market.

102
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,450
We had a minor collision
on our way to Inseok Market.

103
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,040
Other patrol units in the vicinity,
please report to the scene.

104
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,830
Other patrol units in the vicinity,
please report to the scene.

105
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,550
<i>In order to collect evidence
for a sexual assault case,</i>

106
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:30,050
it's important to transfer the victim
to Sunflower Center within 72 hours.

107
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,640
The victim must not take a shower
or change clothes

108
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,100
to ensure collection
of all physical evidence.

109
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,680
They shouldn't urinate or defecate--

110
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,640
What if the victim is
bleeding from the mouth?

111
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,940
The victim should refrain from eating
or drinking water.

112
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,650
It is important to transfer the victim
to Sunflower Center within 72 hours

113
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,280
to secure all evidence.

114
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,820
It also ensures the efficacy
of emergency contraceptives.

115
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,490
Which units are dispatched
for sexual assault cases?

116
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,240
The Women & Juvenile Affairs Division,
investigators from the forensic team,

117
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,330
and our patrol division.

118
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,290
Who has to get there first?

119
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,080
Our patrol division must get there first.

120
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,880
Yeom Sang-su, stay focused!

121
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,460
Yes, sir!
I'll stay focused and keep running.

122
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,800
Female officers must be dispatched
for sexual assault cases.

123
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,930
Hence, Han Jeong-o will accompany me
to the scene

124
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,970
instead of Han-pyo when we get there.

125
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,470
Stay focused.

126
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,640
Yes, sir.

127
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,730
I suddenly heard a woman's scream
in the morning.

128
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:29,940
I was passing by the room,
so I got startled and opened the door.

129
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,360
Both of them were bleeding
from their mouths.

130
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,740
Goodness.

131
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,410
Were they the only ones who checked in?

132
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,950
Was there anyone else?

133
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,520
Be on guard five steps behind me.

134
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,570
Sir, you're under arrest for sexual--

135
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:18,080
No! I... I didn't do it.

136
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,920
Are you injured?

137
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,630
No, I'm okay.

138
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,220
I... I'm the victim.

139
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,970
Since you're insisting
that you're the victim,

140
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,970
we must take you in
for questioning immediately.

141
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,680
Will that be okay with you?

142
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,770
I'd like you to voluntarily come
with us to the station.

143
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:46,400
You have the right to an attorney,
and you may refuse my request.

144
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,400
-You may leave whenever you wish.
-Yes.

145
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,900
I'll... I'll go with you now.

146
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:57,110
We're not sure if he's the victim
or the assailant.

147
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,950
Officer Min, help me escort him.

148
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,870
Let's go, sir.

149
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,540
-Yeom Sang-su, be on standby.
-Yes, sir.

150
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,750
Han Jeong-o, come here.

151
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,050
I'm right behind you,

152
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,600
so trust me and go in.

153
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,130
How is she?

154
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,800
She's bleeding from her mouth.

155
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:03,930
She's wearing her underwear.

156
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,150
We're the police.

157
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,310
Please don't worry, ma'am.

158
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,580
Her tongue has been cut off.

159
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,850
Please make way.

160
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,140
This is an emergency.

161
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,690
-It'll be okay.
-Please make way.

162
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,610
-We're almost at the hospital.
-Where are you?

163
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,360
-Hang in there.
-Where are you now?

164
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,910
Patrol 24.

165
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,790
Are you guys at the scene yet?

166
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,580
Are you guys there?
This is An Jang-mi from W&J. Answer me.

167
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:18,920
<i>Patrol 24. Senior Patrol Officer
Choi Myeong-ho. Answer me.</i>

168
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,170
<i>Patrol 24, we're at the scene.</i>

169
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,550
<i>The victim is in critical condition.</i>

170
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,140
<i>She's being transferred to a hospital.
Paramedics aren't here yet</i>

171
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,560
<i>because the traffic is bad
due to the fire at Inseok Market.</i>

172
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,020
Lieutenant Lee and two female officers
are escorting her.

173
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,560
We'll communicate with the paramedics
and hand her over to them.

174
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,270
I've taken care of things here,
so take your time.

175
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,360
Sir, I brought an ice pack.

176
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,740
Did you confirm that there's an icebox
on the ambulance?

177
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,870
Yes, sir.

178
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,030
What do you have to do
when I enter the scene?

179
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,910
<i>Set up the police line,
stand at attention,</i>

180
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,540
<i>and restrict access to the scene.</i>

181
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,760
Han Jeong-o.

182
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,730
Whom should you hand this over to?

183
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,020
The paramedics who are on their way.

184
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,080
RESTRICTED AREA

185
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,210
That woman's tongue...

186
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,800
The surgery will go well, right?

187
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,010
By the way, this is a sexual assault case.
Why did her tongue get cut off?

188
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,270
I mean, it's usually a woman

189
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,810
who bites off a man's tongue
in a case like this.

190
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,730
Was the guy a pervert?

191
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,730
Is that why he bit off her tongue?

192
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,780
He might be a pervert,
or maybe she's the assailant.

193
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,910
So, she tried to rape the guy?

194
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,780
Are you excited
since we have a case to work on?

195
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,470
MOTEL

196
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,810
<i>I've already taken notes
on the roads in the area.</i>

197
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,770
<i>Have I checked the security footage?</i>

198
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,020
<i>Yes, I have, sir.</i>

199
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,900
You sure are easy to work with,
Senior Patrol Officer Choi.

200
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,840
The victim could've easily run away.

201
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:14,140
The victim could be charged with
excessive self-defense.

202
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,060
CHIEF KIM HAN-SEOK

203
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,030
<i>The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable at this time.</i>

204
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,500
So, you're avoiding me.

205
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,960
Do you think you can avoid me?

206
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,910
How annoying.
How can they call themselves cops?

207
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,740
Give me the memory card back.

208
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,120
Yang-chon.

209
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,560
Did you get rid of it?

210
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,850
My kid is sick.

211
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,980
I can't risk my job.

212
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,150
It benefits the entire force,

213
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,490
and I can get promoted to the head
of the Criminal Investigation Division.

214
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,820
Is it that wrong for me to try to correct

215
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,950
the articles that claim
I was drinking that day?

216
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,000
The cold case Ho-cheol solved

217
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,790
was originally under the supervision
of the chief and the commissioner.

218
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,380
If the case

219
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,550
makes it to Internal Affairs,

220
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,260
their faulty investigation
will come to light.

221
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,470
If they want us to cover it up,
then we have to.

222
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,430
It's not like we have power.
We have to do as they say.

223
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,600
That's them.

224
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,180
But how dare you... How dare you

225
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:08,400
make me the asshole
who got drunk and killed his colleague!

226
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:16,610
Fine. Just kill me already.

227
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:22,410
I already destroyed the memory card,
so do what you want with me.

228
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,920
I know you.

229
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,710
You wouldn't have just gotten rid of it.

230
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:36,050
I bet you have a copy hidden somewhere.

231
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,680
That's why

232
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,140
I'm offering you a deal.

233
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,390
I'll

234
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,270
offer you a deal.

235
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:49,100
The force may be corrupted,

236
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,190
but being a cop is all I know how to do.

237
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,690
I don't want to resign
and see you all leap for joy.

238
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:58,530
So I'll take the job
at the patrol division.

239
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,410
I'll accept my demotion
from a captain to a lieutenant.

240
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,330
I can accept

241
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,420
the demotion and the reassignment,

242
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,670
but there's one thing I can't stand.

243
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,670
It's Ho-cheol's wife believing

244
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,550
that I killed her husband,
the man who called me his brother.

245
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,310
So make sure
he gets the best possible outcome

246
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,850
in the line of duty investigation.

247
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,070
Even if it'd not make much difference,

248
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,570
make sure his wife and kids
can receive more pension.

249
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,120
Also, that memory card.

250
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,160
At least, show it to her.

251
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:55,420
She has lost her husband,
and she needs someone to rely on.

252
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,300
And that should be me.

253
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,220
Right?

254
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:10,810
At the least, do that.

255
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,150
You bastard.

256
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,220
Sir, have you been drinking?

257
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,930
I wasn't driving.
I was going to, but I didn't.

258
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,430
You saw that the car was still.

259
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,310
The ignition is on.

260
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,430
It's for the heater.

261
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:36,270
You pulled out of the parking spot.

262
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,230
Hand me your license

263
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,860
and blow into this.

264
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,370
OH YANG-CHON
POLICE

265
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:01,490
You're a police officer.

266
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,300
It's 0.05.

267
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,420
I'm right at the limit.

268
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,680
-If you could--
-That's a 100-day suspension.

269
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,140
Please step outside, Captain.

270
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,430
You must come with us.

271
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,900
These are the photos from the scene.

272
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,770
What's missing?

273
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,070
The wall on the left of the doorway.

274
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,240
There aren't any photos of that area
where the TV was.

275
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,780
The same goes for under the bed.

276
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:52,590
Since there's blood under the bed,

277
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:55,710
I guess that's where her tongue was.

278
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:59,720
I don't see anything
that could be it though.

279
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,560
Hye-ri, what else is missing?

280
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,730
I wasn't at the scene--

281
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,310
Make an inference.

282
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,520
I'll try.

283
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,360
There aren't any photos of the bathroom.

284
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,650
There aren't any photos of the entrance.

285
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,450
Something is wrong with one
of the photos of the motel.

286
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:27,410
Who knows what it is?

287
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:32,670
The photo of the south side
of the motel is wrong.

288
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:35,130
It's right. It's next to a six-lane road.

289
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,880
There are a six-lane road and a bank

290
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,800
to the south of the motel.

291
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,050
But I don't see them here.

292
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,890
Wow.

293
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,100
You are quite observant.

294
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,220
You two should try harder,
or you'll get fired.

295
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:51,310
You should work for me.

296
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,480
She's mine.

297
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:54,940
I'm off the clock.

298
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,280
In this case,

299
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,570
a woman lured
a drunk junior colleague to a motel.

300
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,410
The drunk man fell asleep, so she
attempted to rape him in the morning.

301
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,660
Both parties have sued each other.

302
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,330
He sued her for sexual assault.

303
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,460
She sued him for bodily harm.

304
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,460
Let's make an assumption.

305
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:17,130
What could be the possible verdict
for the man who harmed the woman?

306
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,300
I'd say not guilty.

307
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,710
He harmed her to resist
the sexual assault.

308
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,880
His right to defend himself
must be acknowledged.

309
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,550
It's difficult to say that he's
the victim of the sexual assault.

310
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,640
He should be punished
for inflicting bodily harm.

311
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,890
Please put up the photos
of the male and female

312
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,020
taken by the Women
& Juvenile Affairs Division.

313
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:41,400
Neither of them has serious wounds.

314
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,610
I would say the woman
wasn't too overpowering.

315
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,910
Their room was on the second floor.

316
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,870
There were no bars on the windows,

317
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,330
and a truck was parked
beneath their window.

318
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:57,540
If the male felt threatened,

319
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,550
he had ample opportunity to get away.

320
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,380
The bathroom window was also big enough
for someone to get out of.

321
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:08,930
Also, the male entered
the motel willingly.

322
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:12,390
The male did not consider
any other options to defend himself

323
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,980
and inflicted bodily harm.

324
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:17,730
In 1968, there was a US court ruling
on a similar case.

325
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,520
I forgot about it.

326
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:20,650
And the ruling said?

327
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,820
"When the woman attempted to rape him,

328
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,900
the male's two hands were free,
and he could've defended himself.

329
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:28,320
Despite the fact,
instead of defending himself,

330
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,530
the male was more driven
to harm the female.

331
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,250
Therefore, the male's accusation
of sexual assault is void,

332
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,460
and he is guilty
of inflicting bodily harm."

333
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,670
Wrap up and go home.

334
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,670
Clean up and go home.

335
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,720
This is a double standard.

336
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:54,810
If she cut off his tongue,
she'd be let off.

337
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:57,100
There was a similar case
involving a woman.

338
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:59,810
She stabbed the guy, who tried
to sexually assault her, to death.

339
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,030
She could've asked for help,
but she didn't and was found guilty.

340
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,780
It's a 1997 case from Songdo, Busan.

341
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:06,780
Good job.

342
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,290
Someone once got an award during probation

343
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:20,920
and was promoted to an officer right away.

344
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,590
Don't you think she will be the next one?

345
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,710
Don't be silly.

346
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,670
I'll get promoted before you or Jeong-o.

347
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,590
You're quite competitive.

348
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,520
You didn't read your text,
so I'm leaving this voice mail.

349
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,440
I guess you're avoiding me
in case I ask you for more money.

350
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:45,650
This time I called to pay you back.

351
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,320
Dad, send me...

352
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,450
Send me your account number.

353
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,080
You have a dad?

354
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,710
We went to high school together.

355
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,040
Don't you remember?

356
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,710
I'm best friends
with your then-boyfriend, Da-yeong.

357
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,880
You don't remember?

358
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:08,880
I don't remember.

359
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:11,890
Well, we weren't friends then.
You do remember Da-yeong, right?

360
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,720
Of course.

361
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,350
Take care.

362
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,940
Watch where you're going.

363
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,490
Oh, right.

364
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,660
The female victim at the motel.

365
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,660
Her surgery went well.

366
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:58,020
I heard an EMT dispatched
to Inseok Market is in critical condition.

367
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:00,100
I hope they're okay.

368
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,900
I heard what you did today.

369
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,810
You saved an old woman
when no one knew she was there.

370
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,110
Hey. You might get an award.

371
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,780
Respect my rank when talking to me.

372
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,010
Sergeant Ban.

373
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,850
You're not the only one
who wants to stay loyal to Dong-kyu.

374
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:42,890
If we weren't where we are,
I'd have killed you, you traitor.

375
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,110
Traitor is too harsh a word,

376
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,700
Sergeant Ban.

377
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,290
When I became a cop,

378
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,160
I was told to serve the people.

379
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,920
Is reporting a cop to Internal Affairs
for neglecting his duty

380
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,340
considered as a betrayal?

381
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,840
Cops are citizens in uniform,

382
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,590
and our safety is the people's safety.

383
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,890
When Dong-kyu got beaten up,

384
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:19,220
I suggested we report that congressman,
but you told us

385
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,260
to hold back.

386
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,810
Is this what he gets for holding back?

387
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,890
What did he do
to deserve the reassignment?

388
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,230
Anyone would say Dong-kyu's a great cop.

389
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,730
That's why I reported him.

390
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:32,650
I did that so that my dear colleague
could keep his honor.

391
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,860
He'll be free and unblemished
in six months.

392
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,530
Why are you trying to cover it up

393
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:42,160
and make him look like a loser?

394
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,290
Do you call that loyalty?

395
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:47,750
I don't.

396
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,720
Why aren't you all leaving?

397
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,220
Yes, sir.

398
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,560
Move.

399
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:09,230
Gyeong-mo, if you get angry with me,
whom should I vent to?

400
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:12,190
I should be the one venting, not you.

401
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:14,690
Gosh, they're getting mad for no reason.

402
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,070
Go home.

403
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,360
Yes, sir.

404
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:21,950
Why should I hold back?

405
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,910
Be quiet, you fool. Stop yelling.

406
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,080
The rookies are listening.

407
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,870
This place is so disorderly.

408
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,130
It sucks here.

409
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:31,750
Who's Dong-kyu?

410
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,750
How would I know?

411
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,670
I'm dead tired.

412
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,100
Hey.

413
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,100
It's not like I want Yang-chon here.

414
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,940
But our superiors
are reassigning him here.

415
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,610
That's just an excuse.

416
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,110
If the head of the division
and the team leader refuse him,

417
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,610
who would dare force us to take him?

418
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,070
You're right.

419
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,950
Why do you want to take him in?

420
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,790
Why do you dislike Yang-chon
all of a sudden?

421
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,330
You took him around
ever since he was a rookie

422
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,290
and made him what he is now.

423
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,130
I can't explain.

424
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,170
But I don't want him here.

425
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,880
Are you still upset
that Jang-mi married him instead of you?

426
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,260
Stop it.

427
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,300
If that's not it,
take him under your wing!

428
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:26,260
I'm the team leader!

429
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:29,390
What would others think if a senior
with my rank comes beneath me?

430
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,350
Why? Will you make me
give him my position again?

431
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,440
Just like last time?

432
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,110
I said I would transfer elsewhere,

433
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,150
but you made me stay,
saying that you'd promote me.

434
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,360
Why are you doing this to me?

435
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,900
Who said you're the same rank?

436
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:43,070
He got demoted to lieutenant!

437
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,490
What for?

438
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,410
Everyone knows
that he wasn't drunk on duty.

439
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:50,750
He solved a cold case

440
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,540
and saved a drowning man.

441
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,880
Why was he demoted?

442
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,960
That's exactly why I want him here.

443
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:58,920
He got kicked around and hurt elsewhere.

444
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,970
I couldn't say
I didn't want him in my division.

445
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,930
He's beneath you now.

446
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:10,520
Your mentor is now your subordinate.

447
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,560
Let him handle the rookies.

448
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,400
If you still hold a grudge against him,

449
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,020
keep him under you

450
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,400
and crush or trample him
as much as you want.

451
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,360
Just take him in.

452
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,830
Why don't you guys greet me
when you see me?

453
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,340
Hi, Dad.

454
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,360
Would you like a glass of wine?

455
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:45,450
Take that bag by the door
and go stay with your father.

456
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:48,820
We can sort out the paperwork later
when we have time.

457
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,890
I'm sorry about everything.

458
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,480
I'm a total jerk.

459
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,570
I may have lost a mentor,
but you lost your parents.

460
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,530
I'm sorry, honey.

461
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,450
Forgive me. Please?

462
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:45,550
Let's go on a trip, just the two of us.

463
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,840
I'll be

464
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,550
starting at Hongil Patrol Division
in two days.

465
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:55,850
I talked to Han-sol
and got a few days off.

466
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,730
I've wanted to divorce you
for quite some time,

467
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,560
but I couldn't do it
because of our parents and kids.

468
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,320
But now, there's nothing holding me back.

469
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,820
Leave quietly.

470
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,570
Let's not yell at each other
because that's just crude.

471
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,540
It feels creepy. Take your hand off me.

472
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:21,080
What did I do wrong?

473
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,630
What did I do to make you mad?

474
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,590
If I did something wrong,
you should at least tell me what it is.

475
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,510
God damn it.

476
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,350
Then I'd be able to
apologize to you at least.

477
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:36,890
You know my situation

478
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,850
better than anyone else does.

479
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,600
You must know how I feel now

480
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:44,270
because you're a cop yourself!

481
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,020
Am I wrong?

482
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:48,280
Whatever happened to you

483
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,900
is none of my business.

484
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,030
And my parents' death
is none of your business.

485
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,580
I guess you keep forgetting

486
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:59,000
because my parents' death
has nothing to do with you.

487
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:01,370
I feel the same way.

488
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,830
I don't care to know

489
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,420
how you feel now.

490
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,380
I do not care.

491
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:16,510
Honey.

492
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,270
-Jang-mi.
-Just get out.

493
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,640
Who is there?

494
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:46,640
<i>It's Dae-gwan.</i>

495
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:51,520
Your mom is mad at me
because of a mistake I made.

496
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:55,860
<i>I'll stay with your grandpa
for the next few days.</i>

497
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,160
<i>Take good care of your mom.</i>

498
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,490
<i>Aren't you going to answer?</i>

499
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:04,410
-All right.
-Take good care of your sister too.

500
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,160
Okay?

501
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,120
<i>Okay.</i>

502
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,420
Study hard. See you later.

503
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,550
I don't want Mom and Dad to get divorced.

504
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,430
Do you want to end up like Dad?

505
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,760
No, I don't.

506
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:24,640
Do you want me to marry someone like Dad?

507
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,850
Hell no.

508
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:27,480
Then why should Mom stay with Dad?

509
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:29,900
Do you think that's fair?

510
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,110
I don't.

511
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:33,920
Why did you leave the door unlocked?
What if someone breaks in?

512
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:37,170
Have you eaten?

513
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,380
I'm not hungry.

514
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:59,150
He only turns the heat on for the room

515
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:01,150
to save money

516
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:03,780
when it's freezing outside.

517
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:16,380
I told you I'm not hungry!

518
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:36,690
Aren't you going to sleep?

519
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:05,430
It takes 10 minutes to the patrol station
by bus and 20 minutes by bike.

520
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,840
That's pretty close.

521
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:08,220
That house looks nice.

522
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,140
I can't do this anymore.

523
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:12,520
I can't!

524
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,520
How much longer do we have to walk?

525
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,610
It's this house. Come on in.

526
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,440
Let's go in.

527
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:23,400
You go in and take a look.

528
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:24,900
I'm exhausted.

529
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:26,950
This is why I told you
that you don't have to come.

530
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,990
You insisted on coming.

531
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:29,870
You said you took out a loan.

532
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:31,410
I came to get the money.

533
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:35,830
Are you sure you don't want to come in?

534
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:37,580
Then stay here.

535
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,590
You said you took out a loan
to pay your dad back. Give me the money!

536
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,970
Why would you pay your dad back?

537
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:48,180
Just give me that money. Jeong-o, please?

538
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:52,970
I want to open a café. Hey!

539
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:13,370
It's nice. Is this place new?

540
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,960
The rent is 700,000 won
with a deposit of 10 million won.

541
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,710
We get paid 1.4 million. After paying
the rent and all the utilities,

542
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:20,880
we'll have nothing.

543
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,000
We should take the promotion exam
as soon as possible.

544
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:26,050
-Hey, where's your place?
-Downstairs.

545
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:27,880
So, you are the landlord?

546
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:29,800
Then you should give us a discount.

547
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:31,850
We're renting too.
The landlord lives abroad.

548
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:34,180
My mom and I wish
to buy this house one day.

549
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,100
I'll reduce the rent if I end up
buying the house later on.

550
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:39,690
Take a look around the house.
I'll see you back at the station.

551
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:48,070
I'd found him attractive
if he were shorter by this much.

552
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:49,700
He's not bad as he is now.

553
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,290
Is Sang-su

554
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:58,750
your type out of all the guys
at the patrol station?

555
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:00,370
No, Senior Patrol Officer Choi is.

556
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:01,710
Really? Me too.

557
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:05,420
You can have him.

558
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,640
What do you mean, I can have him?

559
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,560
I'm not in a place
to date someone right now.

560
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,690
I have to support my family.

561
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:23,730
My parents are still alive,
but I will take care of my sisters.

562
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,480
They're still in school.

563
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:29,450
Officer Choi is nothing more
than an eye candy.

564
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:31,570
I need to make money too.

565
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:35,660
You heard my mom
asking me for money earlier.

566
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,660
Please come in and sit on a chair.

567
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:39,460
Come on in.

568
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,670
-I can wait outside.
-Sit here.

569
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,590
-It's hot, so be careful.
-Thanks.

570
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:49,170
-I need to go to the supermarket.
-Okay.

571
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,140
Aren't you glad
your daughter became a cop?

572
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:00,600
I'm so proud of my son being one

573
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:02,980
that I break into laughter
during my sleep.

574
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:07,530
My husband died in an accident,

575
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:09,610
but if he were alive,

576
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:12,860
-he'd brag about our son every day--
-I get panic attacks.

577
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:14,780
My heart beats really fast
due to the condition.

578
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:17,790
I'd appreciate some peace and quiet.

579
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:20,660
Of course.

580
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,630
It's cold.

581
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:27,130
I guess you don't live with your dad.

582
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,130
Are your parents divorced?

583
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:31,420
Don't ask.

584
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:33,680
Did you take out a loan?

585
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,010
That's a perk of being a cop.
We can take out loans easily.

586
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:39,850
Why do you need to pay your dad back?

587
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,850
<i>You don't have to pay me back,</i>

588
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:47,940
<i>but you don't seem comfortable with it,</i>

589
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:49,150
<i>so here's my account number.</i>

590
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:50,530
-Your mom's leaving.
-Excuse me!

591
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:52,400
You should go with your daughter.

592
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:53,650
Mom, where are you going?

593
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:58,620
How long do I have to
keep selling insurance

594
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,700
when I suffer from a panic disorder?

595
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:04,170
You don't have it,
so you don't know what it's like.

596
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,970
Your mom must really want to open a café.

597
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,800
Help her open one
with the loan you took out.

598
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:19,930
<i>The person you are trying to reach...</i>

599
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,270
Why are you paying your dad back?

600
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:24,270
I don't have a dad. Give it back.

601
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,940
You might not think of him as your father,

602
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,860
but he gave you the money
because you're his daughter.

603
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:32,860
His daughter? As if.

604
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,030
He wouldn't have given you the money
if he thought otherwise.

605
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:38,240
Would he have given it to me too?

606
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,160
He'd have simply ignored me.

607
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:43,960
If you didn't consider him to be your dad,
why did you ask him for money?

608
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:46,040
You could have asked someone else.

609
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:50,170
You both regard each other as family.

610
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:52,090
That's why you accepted
the money from him.

611
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:54,550
That's the fact.

612
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:58,680
Just so you know, my dad owns a mill,
which is technically mine.

613
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:01,600
Is it because I have no pride? No.

614
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,890
It's because I'm his daughter.

615
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:11,570
<i>Why are you calling me
when you won't even listen to me?</i>

616
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:13,820
<i>Were you worried that I left?</i>

617
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,570
You should've eaten something
before you left.

618
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,240
Hold on.

619
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:36,840
Mom, take it easy.

620
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:49,900
Take slow breaths.

621
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:58,110
Slowly.

622
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:35,400
Why?

623
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,860
Jang-mi, where are my blue socks?

624
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:40,570
In the plastic bag inside your bag.

625
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:41,990
I looked,

626
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:44,120
but I couldn't find my favorite toe socks.

627
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:50,920
You must be questioning someone.

628
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:54,670
I'll just buy a new pair. Bye.

629
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:10,480
JANG-MI

630
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:21,280
Why can't you tell me?

631
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:24,490
Where did you sell the copper you stole?

632
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:26,910
Here and there.

633
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:28,660
So where exactly?

634
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:31,410
We sold it to people on the streets

635
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,790
and to junkyards.

636
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:34,920
Which junkyard?

637
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,290
I don't know. I don't remember.

638
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:37,920
Is it because you're on drugs?

639
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,300
-We're not!
-We're not!

640
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:47,720
It's impossible for you
to sell over 120kg of copper on your own.

641
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:49,890
You're working for someone, right?

642
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,060
You're right.

643
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:55,270
We are, but he bailed on us.

644
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:09,030
A few years ago, girls about your age

645
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:12,200
were caught stealing
in a department store.

646
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:15,250
They were locked up by seniors
at the school,

647
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:17,290
coerced into filming a sex tape,

648
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:19,340
and were forced to steal.

649
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:22,010
-Where is she going with this?
-So what?

650
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:28,850
Other girls in a similar situation
even got pregnant.

651
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:32,730
They had no money for an abortion though.

652
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:45,950
HAPPY TIME PREGNANCY TEST

653
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:53,000
Shall we take a trip to the restroom?

654
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,970
I know you've already written
a statement at the patrol division,

655
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,550
but you will write another one here.

656
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,890
Take it seriously and write the truth.

657
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:13,970
You'll also write
where you put the stolen copper.

658
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:26,990
Lucky you. I heard you rookies
are getting a new mentor today.

659
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,450
I guess you didn't know.

660
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:33,290
He's a legend, so serve him well.

661
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:37,040
Every rookie would want him as a mentor.

662
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,380
He's the legend of the Violent Crime Unit.

663
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:44,000
-I'm off then.
-See you tomorrow, sir.

664
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,560
You idiot!

665
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,230
Are you guys here?

666
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:04,440
Hey, rookies!

667
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:07,610
Jeong-o, Hye-ri?

668
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:08,990
What?

669
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,120
Did you hear about our new mentor?

670
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,370
I hear he's a total legend.

671
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:15,950
I'm going to work hard
to be his right-hand man.

672
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,960
Won-u, Seung-jae, Han-pyo

673
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,500
can kiss my ass.

674
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:22,290
Sir...

675
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:29,380
"Sir"?

676
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:31,220
You just said we can kiss your ass.

677
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:37,890
I may be younger than you, but I still
outrank you. Don't forget that.

678
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,600
-We'll be right in, sir.
-We'll be right in, sir.

679
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:46,530
I understand since we're all close in age.

680
00:53:47,110 --> 00:53:50,110
I don't care what you say behind my back
as long as you behave when I'm around.

681
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:53,200
I'm sorry.

682
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:58,620
-Do you smoke?
-Sometimes.

683
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,250
Did he really save
Assistant Chief Ki's life?

684
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:03,920
He did.

685
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:06,460
A call came in regarding gangs at a club.

686
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:10,010
When Assistant Chief Ki
blocked the boss's exit,

687
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:13,760
he took out his knife
and sliced Assistant Chief Ki's stomach.

688
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:16,180
And?

689
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:19,180
What do you think had happened?

690
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:21,980
His intestines gushed out.

691
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:25,860
Small and large intestines,
and duodenum... All of them fell out.

692
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:28,440
Your soon-to-be mentor

693
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:30,860
picked all of them up.

694
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:34,950
He picked them up with his bare hands
and shoved them back in.

695
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:38,370
He then carried Assistant Chief Ki
on his back

696
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:41,580
and ran to a nearby hospital
that was about two kilometers away.

697
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:45,080
He's the best.

698
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:50,050
That's awesome.

699
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:51,970
What's his name?

700
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:53,260
Oh Yang-chon.

701
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:01,600
Damn it.

702
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:06,650
Are you kidding me?

703
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:11,900
-Aren't you going in?
-I need to wire the money first.

704
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:14,030
We still have 20 minutes
before the roll call.

705
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:16,450
Are you really going to pay your dad back?

706
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:18,280
I really don't get you.

WANT TO, HERE'S MY ACCOUNT NUMBER

SHORT-TERM CREDIT CARD LOAN

00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,520
<i>It's me.</i>

712
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:44,690
I was going to pay you back,

713
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:46,230
but I can't.

714
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:49,940
You're just like your mother.

715
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:51,440
You're irresponsible.

716
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:55,400
I don't think I did anything

717
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:01,200
to deserve to hear such a thing from you.

718
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,290
<i>What did I do wrong?</i>

719
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,710
I never intended to make you pay me back.

720
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:10,710
However, you insisted on paying me back.

721
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,340
<i>Now you're saying you won't.</i>

722
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:16,260
<i>Your mom had done the same before.</i>

723
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:17,720
<i>Both of you are irresponsible.</i>

724
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,350
I'm not paying you back

725
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:24,180
in order to do my duty
as a daughter to my mom.

726
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,230
My mom didn't pay you back

727
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,810
not because she's irresponsible.

728
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:33,360
It was because

729
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:36,110
she had to raise me on her own.

730
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,200
Can you seriously say
that you've been a responsible father?

731
00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:42,530
<i>When she had you,
I told her I'd raise you--</i>

732
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:44,540
You didn't in the end.

733
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:51,710
I don't feel sorry.

734
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:55,050
I'm not ashamed of myself
for not paying you back.

735
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,470
Mom, sign the lease for the café.

736
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:05,720
I sent the money.

737
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:10,270
We've received a report

738
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:12,810
that Rago Supermarket at 89-61,
Sinseo-dong gets robbed often.

739
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:14,780
Lieutenant Lee, check it out.

740
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,820
There was a robbery

741
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,360
at 14, Yeongjin-dong last week.

742
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:20,660
The victim keeps calling
because she's scared.

743
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:23,410
Drop by whenever you're in the area
and comfort her.

744
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:26,500
The suspect in a theft and homicide case
in Cheonan

745
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:28,540
was apprehended
by Myeongu Patrol Division...

746
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:31,830
in our jurisdiction.

747
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:34,840
Does this make sense?

748
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,460
They caught a suspect in our jurisdiction.

749
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:40,050
Do your job, everyone, okay?

750
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:41,470
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

751
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:44,850
The suspect of the Incheon
mother-daughter homicide case

752
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:46,770
was found to have used
his credit card in Seoul.

753
00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:48,850
His wanted poster's out,
so take a close look at it.

754
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:52,650
We got a complaint from Internal Affairs.

755
00:57:53,310 --> 00:57:55,520
They don't want us
to issue too many parking tickets.

756
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,820
We'll ignore that complaint

757
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:01,070
and go on issuing tickets
to illegally parked cars.

758
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:07,160
Are we ticket-sellers?
Why focus on issuing them?

759
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,080
Sergeant Ban and Sergeant Kim,
take your teams

760
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:16,040
and join the Traffic Safety Division
to crack down on drunk drivers

761
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:18,010
-then patrol the clubs in Hongdae.
-Yes, sir.

762
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:19,590
-Okay.
-Yes, sir.

763
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:23,300
Give a round of applause to Team 3 and 4
for coming to support our Team 1.

764
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:26,720
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

765
00:58:28,350 --> 00:58:31,180
Officer Yang will be
transferred to Suncheon today.

766
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:32,480
-You did well here.
-No.

767
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,900
-Goodbye.
-Don't go.

768
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:39,480
Next up is Captain Oh Yang-chon.

769
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:40,440
Lieutenant.

770
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:42,860
Oh, right. Lieutenant.

771
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:45,700
It's Lieutenant Oh's first day.

772
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:47,410
Please give us a short speech.

773
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:04,220
Lieutenant Oh.

774
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,430
Say something
now that you're in charge of the rookies.

775
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:08,600
Don't back out.

776
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:10,430
Applause.

777
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:15,350
I'm Oh Yang-chon. That's it.

778
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:22,440
Don't be like that.

779
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:24,150
Give us a grand speech.

780
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,620
What attitude should
our probationary officers have?

781
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,450
Lecture our subordinates.

782
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:30,740
-Come on, clap.
-Cut it out.

783
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:39,710
That's it.

784
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:41,710
Our motto.

785
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:43,340
Today!

786
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:47,470
-Today, none of us will get hurt!
-Today, none of us will get hurt!

787
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:50,220
The police's safety
is the people's safety!

788
00:59:50,350 --> 00:59:52,930
If you want to go fast, go alone!

789
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:55,520
If you want to go far, go together!

790
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,810
-We are a team!
-We are a team!

791
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:02,360
Goodness.

792
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:11,490
Lieutenant Oh.

793
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:14,370
Some bastards who call themselves officers

794
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:16,370
think the patrol division is a place

795
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:19,710
you get demoted to and that any fool
can come and go as they please.

796
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:20,750
Do you agree with them?

797
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:23,840
Try to be nice
when you're in my territory.

798
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:29,760
Is this your territory?

799
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:32,010
Is this your turf?

800
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:35,980
Gosh, you talk like my chief now.
You've changed a lot.

801
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:47,360
Since he was in Criminal Investigation
and Violent Crimes Unit,

802
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:49,780
he must think that the patrol division
and you are nothing.

803
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:55,540
You know I'm right.

804
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:58,870
Does he seem like a cop
who has a sense of duty?

805
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,140
AN JANG-MI

806
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:27,690
It has to be a complete lie.
Assistant Chief Ki's huge.

807
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:29,490
No one can run 2km while carrying him.

808
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:32,200
Let's say it is true.

809
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:33,740
Let's say it is.

810
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:35,040
His stomach was wide open.

811
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:38,870
Wouldn't his intestines fall out
as he was taken to the hospital?

812
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:40,710
I like Oh Yang-chon.

813
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:43,920
There's nothing to like or dislike.

814
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:45,840
You like Oh Yang-chon?

815
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:49,930
Thanks to him,
I learned how to cuff a suspect.

816
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:52,050
He's better than a useless mentor.

817
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,560
Stop making your hatred for him obvious.
You'll get fired.

818
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:57,970
Why would I show it?

819
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:00,690
From now on,

820
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:03,980
I'll be crafty and submissive to him,
so he doesn't catch on.

821
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:06,690
And I'll survive

822
01:02:07,610 --> 01:02:09,190
until the very end.

823
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:10,790
I like your tenacity.

824
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:17,670
That knucklehead doesn't seem to realize
that he taught us.

825
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:21,510
Oh, right. Why is he a lieutenant though?

826
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:23,050
He was a captain back then.

827
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:41,990
You three have a long day ahead of you.

828
01:02:42,070 --> 01:02:44,650
<i>Looks like you'll die, you'll all die</i>

829
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:46,870
You'll be dead by the end of the day.

830
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:48,990
Do your best.

831
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:50,540
Yes, sir.

832
01:02:56,670 --> 01:02:59,290
I heard that you rookies complain

833
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:02,960
that you don't do much in the field
but stand and watch.

834
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:06,590
Today, I plan to leave you in charge of
whatever happens out there.

835
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:09,510
Anyone who's too scared to do so
can ride with Senior Patrol Officer Choi.

836
01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:12,970
-What'll you do?
-We'd like to go into the field.

837
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:14,640
I want to work in the field.

838
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:16,520
-Let's follow them in another car.
-Yes, sir.

839
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:24,360
-Stay out if you want.
-So that you can get ahead of me?

840
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,450
Work is work. Don't be stupid.

841
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:34,700
Lieutenant, let's head
to Beat 24 where the cases--

842
01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:35,870
Don't call me that.

843
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,960
-Captain, I'll go--
-I'm not a captain.

844
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:48,470
Then should I call you "sir"?

845
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:49,590
No.

846
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:56,640
Then I'll consider you my brother.

847
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:59,060
I don't have a brother like you.

848
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,450
-How shall I address you then?
-Just...

849
01:04:08,490 --> 01:04:09,700
Mr. Oh Yang-chon.

850
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:14,620
From now on,
you'll call me Mr. Oh Yang-chon.

851
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:17,370
You two can call me sir.

852
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:19,420
-Yes.
-Yes, sir.

853
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:21,710
So what will you call me?

854
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:28,590
Mr. Oh Yang-chon.

855
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:35,930
There's an assault in Beat 26.

856
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:38,230
Patrol 18 will report to the scene.

857
01:04:39,390 --> 01:04:41,350
-<i>Noted.
-Han Jeong-o will take the lead.</i>

858
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:43,900
Myeong-ho has your back, so don't worry.

859
01:04:44,770 --> 01:04:47,690
It looks like a dating violence case.
The male is beating up the female.

860
01:04:48,490 --> 01:04:49,360
Can you handle it?

861
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:50,660
Yes, sir.

862
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:52,450
-If not, you'll get the boot.
-Yes, sir.

863
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,410
Yeom Sang-su,
take us safely to the scene in one minute.

864
01:04:56,490 --> 01:04:58,960
You'll answer by saying,
"Yes, Mr. Oh Yang-chon."

865
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:03,170
Yes, Mr. Oh Yang-chon.

866
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:24,440
Stop it already!

867
01:05:32,070 --> 01:05:33,240
What are you doing, sir?

868
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:34,950
Why are you hitting her?

869
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:37,120
You can be charged with assault.

870
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:39,500
Sir, please.

871
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:43,120
What now? Who do you think you are?

872
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:51,380
You assaulted this lady

873
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:53,550
obstructed justice
and molested a police officer.

874
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:56,350
You're under arrest for molestation
and obstruction of--

875
01:05:56,970 --> 01:05:58,850
-Let go.
-Get over here.

876
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:00,850
-What? Why?
-Let go of me!

877
01:06:00,930 --> 01:06:02,810
Why are you interfering?

878
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:07,020
You... You get over here!

879
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:08,270
Where are you going?

880
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:11,110
Break it up!

881
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:12,700
Let go of each other.

882
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:15,030
Please let go of each other!

883
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:16,240
Let go of her.

884
01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:18,240
Hye-ri, let go.

885
01:06:18,330 --> 01:06:19,660
Let go.

886
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:22,000
It's my life, you dick.

887
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:25,080
I can do whatever I want.

888
01:06:25,170 --> 01:06:26,920
This is a democratic country.

889
01:06:27,710 --> 01:06:29,090
I can do as I please.

890
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,880
You stupid pig.

891
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:39,180
Sir, you shouldn't do this here.

892
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:40,470
Please calm down.

893
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:42,180
Calm down, my ass!

894
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:44,140
Hey.

895
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,600
Damn it.

896
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:49,070
I got you now, you idiot.

897
01:06:49,650 --> 01:06:50,570
Do you want to die?

898
01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:58,700
You're under arrest
for obstruction of justice.

899
01:06:59,030 --> 01:07:00,620
You have the right to an attorney

900
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:02,620
and can appeal
to the terms of your arrest.

901
01:07:02,830 --> 01:07:04,160
You'll get your chance to explain.

902
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:08,420
Go get the car.

903
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:09,960
Yes, sir.

904
01:07:41,870 --> 01:07:43,080
Get in here. All of you!

905
01:07:51,790 --> 01:07:53,170
Starting now,

906
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:55,840
you will think hard
about what you did wrong today

907
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:58,760
without participating in
any of the patrols.

908
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:00,090
Thanks to you dimwits,

909
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:03,890
your fellow officers
must do twice the work today.

910
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:07,100
Be sorry about that. You're dismissed.

911
01:08:07,890 --> 01:08:09,270
Go think.

912
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:34,000
What exactly did I do wrong?

913
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:38,260
What did I do wrong?

914
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,720
You two made mistakes today,

915
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,430
but I can't think of a single mistake
I made.

916
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:50,100
He could have just told me
what I did wrong if there was any.

917
01:08:50,190 --> 01:08:51,350
Why use violence?

918
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:53,440
Right?

919
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,230
He's a cop. He shouldn't use violence!

920
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:59,610
I'd like nothing more than to report him.

921
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:01,070
Just let him be.

922
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:03,450
Talk shit about him,
or it'll you eat you up inside.

923
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:05,030
He's a bastard.

924
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,410
I'm not speaking ill of him

925
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,910
for what he had done to me
at the academy or today.

926
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:12,420
I looked him up.

927
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:17,260
-He killed a colleague--
-No, the news got it wrong.

928
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:19,220
His superiors hung him out to dry.

929
01:09:19,470 --> 01:09:22,220
Other officers claim his innocence.

930
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:23,930
Innocent, my ass.

931
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:27,930
Is that why he got his license suspended
for drunk driving?

932
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,100
Really? He doesn't have a license?

933
01:09:30,180 --> 01:09:32,480
A cop has a DUI record?

934
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:35,940
I checked him out thoroughly.

935
01:09:37,150 --> 01:09:38,440
Legend, my ass.

936
01:09:39,490 --> 01:09:41,780
Oh Yang-chon is a crazy son of a bitch.

937
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:43,160
That's what he is.

938
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:45,120
Can I borrow your lighter?

939
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:00,170
Why don't you light this cigarette

940
01:10:01,050 --> 01:10:02,260
for me, the son of a bitch?

941
01:10:55,650 --> 01:10:58,400
I honestly don't know what I did wrong.

942
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,270
You don't know your ass from your elbow.

943
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:04,150
<i>-Are you here to serve coffee?
-Do you have to talk like that?</i>

944
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:06,160
<i>Times have changed.
You can't beat them up!</i>

945
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:07,570
Gosh, I dug my own grave.

946
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:09,120
<i>How long</i>

947
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:10,790
will I feel this way?

948
01:11:10,870 --> 01:11:13,410
<i>You lost to Myeong-ho.</i>

949
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:14,460
Do you like Myeong-ho?

950
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,870
-You petty bastard.
-Shit.

951
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:18,880
-Let's just go.
-Fine, you asshole!

952
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:22,840
<i>He could've died
if we preserved the scene!</i>

953
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:29,930
