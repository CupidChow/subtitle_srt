EPISODE 17

3
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,440
Help me. Help!

4
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:06,983
Somebody help...

5
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,436
Ma'am, I'm not trying to arrest you.

6
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,565
Just stop right there, ma'am.

7
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,668
We'll take turns
until the ambulance comes.

8
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,921
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine...

9
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:15,718
The baby has cyanosis.

10
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,721
-One, two...
-Not so hard.

11
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,057
Babies are fragile.

12
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,393
-Be careful.
-Nine, ten.

13
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:31,943
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

14
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:35,196
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

15
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:48,751
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

16
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:52,046
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

17
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,351
One, two, three, four...

18
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,527
You're going to scare the baby.

19
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,541
You're alive. You're alive now.

20
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,336
The baby's crying telling us it's alive.

21
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,212
Isn't the baby adorable?

22
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:34,881
It is.

23
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,639
So adorable.

24
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,599
It really is.

25
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,187
Hey, where have you been?

26
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,773
I went to buy a baby bottle.

27
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,025
Give me that.

28
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,155
Let me take the baby.

29
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,375
Where were you? You're all sweaty.

30
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,795
I ran after the mother, but I missed her.

31
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:18,091
I'm just glad that we saved a baby's life

32
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,386
on the last day of my 40-year career.

33
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,721
You sweet darling.

34
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,057
So adorable.

35
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:35,066
Since the Act on Special Cases
concerning Adoption was revised in 2012,

36
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:39,862
the process of birth registration
and adoption has been complicated.

37
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:43,116
And it has led to increases
in abandonment of a baby.

38
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,577
The law is too harsh for single mothers.
It should be changed.

39
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:48,579
Hi, sweetheart.

40
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,291
You sweetie.

41
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,875
The baby is alive.

42
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:54,877
You're eating so well.

43
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,921
That's so sweet.

44
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,598
Here.

45
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,352
Thank you so much.

46
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,898
If you didn't scare him off
with a whistle,

47
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,109
I would've been badly hurt.

48
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,945
You did a good job screaming out loud.

49
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:25,199
When things like that happen,
you must scream out loud.

50
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,076
Go home and get some rest.

51
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,996
Please visit the police station
and give a statement tomorrow.

52
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:31,914
You can go home now.

53
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,958
Thank you. Thank you so much.

54
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,335
You're welcome. Goodbye.

55
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:55,730
Is this the call center?

56
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,941
Yes, I'm near 64 Hongil 2-dong right now,

57
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,444
and one of the streetlights is out.

58
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,029
Please change the bulb.

59
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,782
Thank you. Bye.

60
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,286
This is Mahyeon Police Station, right?

61
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,039
This is Captain Eun
from Hongil Patrol Division.

62
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:17,210
About the random attacks
in Jangnam and Jangdong...

63
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:19,879
I think that our precinct

64
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,758
should also be on the alert for it
just in case.

65
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,384
<i>All drivers on the road,</i>

66
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,513
<i>we're taking a baby in critical condition
to a hospital now.</i>

67
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:32,225
Please make way for us
so that we can get to the hospital safely.

68
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,186
<i>Thank you.</i>

69
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,979
<i>Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

70
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,903
I hope we can save lives every day
because it makes me so happy.

71
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:46,823
I know, right?

72
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,284
Try to be a good person.

73
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,246
Who knows? Then things like this
may happen every day.

74
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,582
What? How come you get to do things
like this when you aren't a good person?

75
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,793
Why you little...

76
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,963
Do you think we're friends or what?

77
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,256
I thought we were.

78
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,469
The only thing you've learned
is how to become a smooth talker.

79
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,887
What should I do with you?

80
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,224
Oh, boy.

81
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,769
Anyhow,
I want to celebrate our achievements today

82
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,771
with some music.

83
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,822
Look at the moon and the stars.

84
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:29,782
They're shining brightly,

85
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,827
so we can transport the baby safely.

86
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,633
You must be tired, Lieutenant Lee.
You should just call it a day.

87
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,427
Hye-ri and I will be fine by ourselves.

88
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,430
I'll have plenty of time to rest
from now on.

89
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,057
I'm tagging along because I'm happy.

90
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,478
I want to spend more time
with the baby too.

91
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,522
Wasn't that one grand retirement present?

92
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:05,234
You're right.
It's a gift for my retirement indeed.

93
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:09,780
We saved a life,
which is a lot more valuable

94
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,032
than gold.

95
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,079
<i>I can't believe
what's been happening every day.</i>

96
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,081
<i>Just 100 hours ago,</i>

97
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,209
<i>I witnessed an officer</i>

98
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:25,296
<i>with a strong sense of duty
getting suspended unfairly.</i>

99
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,215
<i>It made me question if justice</i>

100
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,967
<i>and loyalty actually exist,</i>

101
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,094
<i>and I was in despair.</i>

102
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,556
<i>Then about 80 hours ago,</i>

103
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,059
<i>an officer got shot and lost his life</i>

104
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,062
<i>on the job after 30 years of service.</i>

105
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,024
<i>And 10 hours ago,</i>

106
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,694
-<i>a person whose life we could've saved</i>
-At the end, over there!

107
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,404
<i>ended up passing away.</i>

108
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,281
Move your vehicles!

109
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,034
Cars with plate number 9895 and 6781...

110
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,997
-<i>And now, like a miracle...</i>
-Isn't the baby adorable?

111
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,792
<i>We saved a life,
which is worth more than anything</i>

112
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:04,877
<i>in the whole wide world.</i>

113
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,456
Attention.

114
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,001
Salute.

115
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,224
At ease.

116
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,075
Attention.

117
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,369
Salute.

118
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,188
<i>All junior officers,</i>

119
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:48,939
I know that it's not easy,

120
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,525
but please always do your best

121
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,695
to protect the safety
of the citizens and their property

122
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:58,449
like the senior officers
that are here today.

123
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,369
I kindly ask you once again
to always keep it in mind.

124
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,332
Salute! Mahyeon.

125
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,504
RETIREMENT CEREMONY
OF FIRST HALF OF 2018

126
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:28,479
-Don't cry!
-Don't cry!

127
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,314
-Don't cry!
-Don't cry!

128
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,778
-Don't cry!
-Don't cry!

129
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,155
-Don't cry!
-Don't cry!

130
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,075
I'm...

131
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,036
not an eloquent speaker.

132
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:48,374
-It's okay!
-It's okay!

133
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,377
I'd like to say just one thing

134
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,630
to the junior officers here
before I step down

135
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,757
from the podium.

136
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,556
The safety of the police equals

137
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,058
the safety of the citizens.

138
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,727
So all of you should

139
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,439
put safety first!

140
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,524
Safety comes first.

141
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,402
Safety comes first.

142
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,124
Attention.

143
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,209
Salute.

144
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,628
-Thank you for your service!
-Thank you!

145
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,096
At ease.

146
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,525
Attention.

147
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:58,819
Salute.

148
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,334
<i>But even</i>

149
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,878
<i>at this honorable moment,</i>

150
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:20,132
<i>I don't think I can say yes
when I'm asked if I have a sense of duty</i>

151
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,635
<i>as a cop.</i>

152
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,638
<i>I don't think I can confidently say
that I'm a cop</i>

153
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,724
<i>with a strong sense of duty.</i>

154
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:31,435
<i>I have...</i>

155
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,063
<i>decided to leave the patrol division.</i>

156
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,129
Hurry up already. Everyone is waiting.

157
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,631
Come to the karaoke bar.

158
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,300
Okay, we heard you. We're coming.

159
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,474
Are you and Jeong-o not talking?

160
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,600
We are.

161
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,937
Then I'm relieved.

162
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,439
It didn't seem like you two were talking

163
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,483
at the ceremony, so I was worried.

164
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:21,735
Let's go.

165
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,258
Sang-su.

166
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:47,678
What's up?

167
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:53,350
I'm sorry.

168
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,605
For what?

169
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:00,691
Study abroad.

170
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,860
Why are you sorry about that?

171
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,864
Our relationship shouldn't come
in the way of your dreams.

172
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,286
Our relationship wasn't
really a big deal, you know.

173
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,289
It wasn't that serious.

174
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:20,961
But still...

175
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,716
Did you apply for the scholarship?

176
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,260
Yes.

177
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,139
Then I guess you'll apply
for a leave soon as well.

178
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,726
I'm going to request a leave

179
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,478
if I get accepted.

180
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,401
Thanks for helping out
on your team's day off.

181
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,488
It seems like you all
have a long night planned.

182
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,907
-Just don't drink too much.
-We won't.

183
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,075
Good day, sir.

184
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,829
Let's go. We'll be the last ones there.

185
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,006
All right, listen up.

186
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,009
Everything's on me today,

187
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,387
so let's party all night long!

188
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,554
Having other plans

189
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,432
or being asked home by your family

190
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,142
won't be allowed--

191
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,687
Whoever tries to leave by making excuses

192
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,480
will pay this time.

193
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,274
Until the sun greets us tomorrow,

194
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:28,654
we will party with Sam-bo all night long.

195
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:32,032
We'll all go home after
having hangover soup for breakfast.

196
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,492
-Yes!
-Yes, sir!

197
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,370
All right then. Cheers!

198
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,788
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

199
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,420
-Nice!
-Cheers!

200
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,051
That's good.

201
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,262
-Good job.
-<i>With no hope</i>

202
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,972
<i>And no dreams</i>

203
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:59,351
<i>Deceived by love and crying over money</i>

204
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:03,647
<i>I look back on this uncanny world</i>

205
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:07,735
<i>The unfairness of it makes me cry</i>

206
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,737
<i>-Don't say
-Don't say</i>

207
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,905
<i>-I'm a coward
-I'm a coward</i>

208
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:16,035
<i>-Even though I roam dirty back-alleys
-Even though I roam dirty back-alleys</i>

209
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:20,372
<i>-You caress my wounds with your embrace
-You caress my wounds with your embrace</i>

210
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,292
Sam-bo, you're drinking too much too fast.

211
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,877
Slow down.

212
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,337
Here. Have some water.

213
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,799
Today's my day!

214
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:35,971
It's the day I'm finally done
with this tiresome job.

215
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,724
I couldn't be happier,

216
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,726
so don't try to stop me.

217
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,312
Wait. Hold up!

218
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,815
Next up on stage is Lieutenant Lee.

219
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,109
I mean, my friend, Sam-bo!

220
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,445
-Give it up!
-Yes!

221
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:57,618
-Sam-bo, Sam-bo!
-Sam-bo, Sam-bo!

222
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,536
-Sam-bo, Sam-bo!
-Let's go!

223
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,247
-Sam-bo, Sam-bo!
-Sam-bo, Sam-bo!

224
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:08,587
<i>-There's one thing you can't know
-There's one thing you can't know</i>

225
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:12,299
I'm glad to see
him laughing on his last day.

226
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:13,550
I know.

227
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,678
I was worried that he'd cry.

228
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:21,767
Actually, he's quite a good singer.

229
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,561
Let's go!

230
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,480
-Go!
-Come on!

231
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,232
Let's sing!

232
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:32,027
<i>If you live alone
without experiencing love</i>

233
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,489
<i>-You'll regret it even more
-You'll regret it even more</i>

234
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,825
<i>-Even though I'm in love
-Even though I'm in love</i>

235
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,536
<i>-And still regret my life
-And still regret my life</i>

236
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,956
<i>-I'll still be with your forever
-I'll still be with your forever</i>

237
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,208
<i>-Life is about attachment
-Life is about attachment</i>

238
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,919
<i>-And though it is hard
-And though it is hard</i>

239
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:52,548
<i>-I'll still only love you
-I'll still only love you</i>

240
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,469
Sam-bo, Sam-bo!

241
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,055
-Sam-bo, Sam-bo!
-Sam-bo, Sam-bo!

242
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,057
-Sam-bo, Sam-bo!
-Sam-bo, Sam-bo.

243
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,309
-Sam-bo, Sam-bo!
-Sam-bo, Sam-bo.

244
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,103
-Sam-bo, Sam-bo!
-Sam-bo, Sam-bo.

245
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,855
-Sam-bo, Sam-bo!
-Sam-bo, Sam-bo.

246
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:12,776
<i>-What is marriage? What is life?
-What is marriage? What is life?</i>

247
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,657
Are you leaving?

248
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,492
I just have a headache.

249
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,994
Okay, get some fresh air.

250
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,871
Sir.

251
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,416
I have something to tell you.

252
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,223
What is it?

253
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,935
I applied for training abroad.

254
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,563
If I get accepted,

255
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,524
I'm going to take a leave of absence.

256
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,528
You're

257
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,656
in charge of my evaluations,

258
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,201
so I thought you should know.

259
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,873
The division is too much for me.

260
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,587
For someone like you,

261
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,840
my lack of sense of duty

262
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,885
might seem baffling.

263
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,848
However,
I don't think I can continue working here.

264
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,685
Another division seems scary too.

265
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,150
After I go abroad,

266
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,237
-I'm considering a safer position--
-Okay.

267
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:41,949
Do it.

268
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,576
Just do as you planned.
What's the problem?

269
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,722
<i>-When I repeated your name
-When I repeated your name</i>

270
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:10,560
<i>-Your burning voice ringing in my ears

271
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,689
<i>-That was my salvation

272
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:18,402
<i>-If I can run through the dry sky

273
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:21,822
<i>-Straight to your embrace
-Straight to your embrace</i>

274
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:28,662
<i>-I wouldn't mind breaking any bones

275
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:33,917

276
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:39,131
<i>-Even if both my legs melt
-Even if both my legs melt</i>

277
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,567
I was proud of my mentor today.

278
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:01,445
He didn't cry and had a lot of fun.

279
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,280
Why would I cry?

280
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,660
I'm not just saying this, you know.

281
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,624
I'm happy that

282
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,336
I'm finally off the job.

283
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,338
I really am.

284
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:23,759
I feel bad for you.

285
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,178
You and

286
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,138
Yang-chon both.

287
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,640
I fell bad that

288
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,976
you guys are still cops.

289
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,481
Thanks for your heartfelt words.

290
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,528
Lieutenant, don't forget to keep in touch.

291
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:45,781
I'm not going to.

292
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:50,577
I'm sick and tired of
everything related to the job.

293
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,747
You should quit too.

294
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,041
Starting today,

295
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,628
I won't even pee
in the direction of our division.

296
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:00,921
I really won't.

297
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,010
Before,

298
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:12,140
you asked how my dad injured his hand.

299
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,686
It was my fault.

300
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:23,026
My dad was cleaning
the machine at the mill.

301
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,989
I accidentally turned it on.

302
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,412
It's the first time I've told
anyone outside my family.

303
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,916
Sir...

304
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,710
Lieutenant.

305
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,797
It's because

306
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,133
you're my first partner and mentor.

307
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,727
I, Song Hye-ri, will head home then.

308
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:05,610
Go.

309
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:07,904
Get home safely.

310
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,616
I'll keep in touch.

311
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:23,503
Yang-chon,

312
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:25,839
you should go too.

313
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,507
I'll see you head inside.

314
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,058
Your hands are rough.

315
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:47,647
Go back home.
I think Jang-mi will take you back now.

316
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,817
I know you live here because of me.

317
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,360
I'm not that great a son.

318
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,156
I like the countryside.

319
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:00,410
Do you know it's the first time
I held your hand?

320
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,205
We held hands many times
when you were a kid.

321
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,749
That's a lie.

322
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,835
You were always drunk.
When did we hold hands?

323
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:13,006
Did it never happen if
you don't remember it, you weirdo?

324
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,346
Do you have soup? I want bean sprout soup.

325
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,973
I made some already.

326
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,769
We agreed on something
for the first time in 40 years.

327
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,354
That's weird.

328
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,326
You should do something about your leg.

329
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,329
Get it looked at and treated, okay?

330
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,456
Why don't you ever listen?

331
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,007
JEONG-O

332
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,220
Hey, it's me.

333
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:01,763
<i>Did you sleep?</i>

334
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,848
Yes. It's dark already.

335
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,350
It must've been the alcohol.

336
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,476
<i>Shall we meet?</i>

337
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,813
Sure. Do you want a beer? I'll bring some.

338
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,086
Sorry.

339
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,464
Why are you always sorry?

340
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,177
Before I made the decision,

341
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,015
I should've at least talked to you first.

342
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,145
I shouldn't have let you
hear it from Hye-ri.

343
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,359
Like you said,

344
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,115
although we weren't very serious,

345
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:05,910
I...

346
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,706
really like you a lot.

347
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:16,546
I feel like I'm running away
to save my own skin.

348
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,010
I feel bad about

349
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:27,390
what I'm doing to not only you,
but to everyone in our division.

350
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,398
The people here

351
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,359
stayed because they like something.

352
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,655
They prefer the field and
have more fun than they would

353
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,450
sitting behind a desk all day.

354
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,370
They weren't forced by
their sense of duty.

355
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,959
A lot of bad things happen,

356
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,379
but like two days ago,
we also get to save lives.

357
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,926
It's wrong for you to feel bad.

358
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:05,595
But

359
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,598
I am angry.

360
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,563
How come you're not asking me

361
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,861
to wait for you?

362
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,158
That's what upsets and angers me.

363
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,791
Can I wait for you to come back?

364
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:40,380
Some women wait while
their boyfriends serve in the army.

365
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,259
I can wait.

366
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:48,972
Jeong-o.

367
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:53,101
How would you feel if I failed to wait

368
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,979
until you come back

369
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,065
and dated someone else?

370
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,028
Well...

371
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,033
I probably won't be able to do anything

372
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,538
but I think I'd get upset.

373
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,049
Really?

374
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,595
Really.

375
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:36,644
Then...

376
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,110
tell me to wait for you.

377
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,379
Wait for me.

378
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:22,148
I like you too.

379
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,444
It's the job that exhausts me.

380
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,280
I don't dislike you.

381
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,743
I'll wait for you.

382
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,164
That's nice.

383
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,210
To tell the truth,

384
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:48,257
I was really afraid
you'd say you wouldn't wait.

385
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,606
I was afraid you'd tell me
not to wait for you, you dummy.

386
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,665
Let's have one more bottle.
Do you have alcohol?

387
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,709
-No.
-I'll buy some.

388
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,252
I'll come too.

389
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:35,388
Is it easier to walk with your long legs?

390
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,265
Is it hard for you?

391
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,392
No, it's just hard to keep up with you.

392
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,144
Let's walk in sync.

393
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,063
Stand still.

394
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,607
-Left foot forward.
-Left foot forward.

395
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,528
You're losing it.

396
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,238
You put your right foot forward.

397
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,365
Just do whatever I do.

398
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,076
Try again.

399
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,536
Left foot forward.

400
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:02,457
-One, two, one, two.
-One, two, one, two.

401
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,167
One, two.

402
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,919
One, two, one, two.

403
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:45,333
Hey, have some water.

404
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,888
Someone's house in the area
got robbed last night.

405
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,474
Cops camped out in the area all night.

406
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:04,227
There are side dishes in the fridge.

407
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,561
Make sure you eat them.

408
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,494
I'm going to Jeong-do's place.

409
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:30,586
You haven't gone outside at all
since you retired.

410
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,879
You just watch TV all day.

411
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,841
Aren't you going to start
looking for a job?

412
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,511
No, I won't.

413
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:41,597
All right, take it easy.

414
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:44,684
You're not a machine.
You've worked all your life.

415
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,894
Get some rest.

416
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,195
MY LAST ROOKIE

417
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,665
Go. Next.

418
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:10,293
Hey, Yang-chon.

419
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:11,836
Come to my office after.

420
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,796
-Yes, sir.
-One blank, three live. All good.

421
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,464
It's probably about Jeong-o.

422
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,175
She just asked to meet with Chief Ki.

423
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,390
One blank, three live. All good.

424
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:25,600
Next.

425
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:30,938
Hey.

426
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,524
Probationary officers
can't request a leave.

427
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,735
The workload here can be overwhelming,

428
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,695
so I understand how hard it must be.

429
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:44,744
Hey, Han Jeong-o.

430
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:48,497
Are you sick?

431
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,250
No, sir.

432
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,920
Then what is it? Is your mother ill?

433
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,172
No, sir.

434
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:59,842
You're not even ill.
What rookie requests a leave

435
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,762
in less than a year
after joining the force?

436
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,890
But it's not against the rules.

437
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,476
Unbelievable.

438
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,480
It's not against the rules,
but it's disrespectful.

439
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:16,817
Do you think that you can do
whatever you want to do

440
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:17,944
once you join the force?

441
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,280
Just let her do it.

442
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,616
What the hell are you talking about?

443
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,828
Our precinct is
so short-staffed at the moment.

444
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,582
You know how big
Lieutenant Lee's absence is.

445
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:37,255
Hana, Myeongu, and Mapo Divisions
all have about five to six young officers

446
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,548
who requested

447
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,760
transfers to easier precincts

448
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,888
after Captain Kang's incident.

449
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,724
They're scared to work
in this crime-ridden area.

450
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,227
It's affecting
Team Two, Three, and Four as well.

451
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,354
Jeong-o,

452
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,357
this division needs

453
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,234
competent officers like you.

454
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,618
Chief Ki, I'd like to talk to you about--

455
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,120
About what?

456
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,459
Never mind. We can talk another time.

457
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:27,471
Did you tell him that you want
to transfer to the countryside?

458
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:28,931
No, I couldn't.

459
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:32,393
Gosh, come on. Just stay here with me.

460
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,645
-Let's go on patrol.
-Yes, sir.

461
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,567
Hey, is he requesting a transfer?

462
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:42,945
No, I'm not sure, sir.

463
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,038
Jeong-o.

464
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:53,831
I'm fully aware

465
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:57,668
of how challenging
working at this division can be.

466
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,295
But if you wish

467
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,882
to move up the ladder
and become a higher-up

468
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:05,801
in this organization down the road,

469
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,637
you must know
what happens out in the field

470
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,475
in order to become a really good cop.

471
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,435
The police force can't exist

472
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,978
without patrol divisions.

473
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:20,649
Chief Ki, stop trying
to meddle in someone else's life.

474
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,653
The work at our division
is exceptionally hard,

475
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:28,157
so only those who want to work here
should stay.

476
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:32,661
And go home already.

477
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:36,415
You said you'd only stay late on the days
when you're on night duty.

478
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:49,637
Hey, Jeong-o.

479
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,726
If all competent cops like you run away
because they don't want to work here,

480
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,939
what will happen to this precinct?

481
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:09,949
I'm sorry, sir.

482
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,160
I can't put the safety of the citizens

483
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,123
before my own sake like you
and Chief Ki do

484
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,252
because I don't have a sense of duty.

485
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,547
You don't need

486
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,173
such a sense of duty.

487
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,678
Put others before yourself?

488
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,764
No one can force anyone to do that.

489
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:41,897
Frankly, I don't quite

490
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,941
understand the sense of duty either.

491
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,860
Hence, I've arrived at

492
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:49,113
a simple conclusion that
I should at least do what I get paid for.

493
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,825
Even though I don't understand
the sense of duty,

494
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,870
I should at least have a conscience
as a human being.

495
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,457
You have that too.

496
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,586
If someone is dying,

497
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,754
you'll do your best
to save that person's life.

498
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,132
You'll get angry when you see a perp,

499
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,009
and you'll catch them if you can.

500
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,011
You won't commit corrupt deeds,

501
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,763
and you'll obey the laws.
You won't take kickbacks,

502
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,224
and you'll help others when you can.

503
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,727
You'll do those things wherever you go,

504
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:23,731
just like what you've been doing here.
Wherever you go.

505
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,066
Am I wrong?

506
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,487
No, I will.

507
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,617
Then what's the problem?

508
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:40,706
Just

509
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,250
make sure you study as hard as you can,

510
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,753
so you can become a high-ranking officer

511
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,173
and change the world.

512
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,760
I can't do it because I'm not smart,

513
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:54,845
but I think you'll be able to.

514
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,811
Oh, what did Sang-su say about it?

515
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:06,148
He said he'll wait for me.

516
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:08,901
He's cute.

517
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,153
Don't believe anything guys tell you.

518
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,989
He's not just any guy. He's Sang-su.

519
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,742
<i>Code One. At Mahyeon Intersection,</i>

520
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:19,203
-Let's go on patrol.
<i>-a drunk man is running on the road.</i>

521
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:23,040
<i>Patrol cars in the vicinity,
please report.</i>

522
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:27,211
<i>Code One. A drunk man is running
on the road at Mahyeon Intersection.</i>

523
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:30,756
<i>Patrol cars in the vicinity,
please report.</i>

524
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,095
Hey, you'd better stop!

525
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:39,807
Come at me if you want. Hey.

526
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,268
You stay right there.

527
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,937
Stay right there, okay?

528
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:48,107
Hey, come here. Get out of the car.

529
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,860
-You can't do this, sir.
-Let go of me!

530
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,571
-Please come with us.
-I said, let go!

531
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:57,116
Let go of me!

532
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,871
Sir, you should
pull up your pants at least.

533
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,373
Gosh.

534
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,878
What? You bastard.

535
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,171
Hey!

536
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,048
Get me a glass of water.

537
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:16,260
The customer service here
at the station sucks.

538
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:17,970
I paid my taxes.

539
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:20,639
You guys get paid by our taxes!

540
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:22,933
Ma'am.

541
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,854
You went through a customer's jacket
at the restaurant

542
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,315
-and stole the phone.
-I did not!

543
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,734
I just saw a cell phone on the floor

544
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:34,278
and picked it up, you stupid cops!

545
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:37,197
Ma'am, that's a blatant lie.

546
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:40,909
The whole thing is caught
on the security camera footage.

547
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,882
Jeez, seriously...

548
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,925
For two nights in a row since Thursday...

549
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,303
I can't take this anymore.

550
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,766
-We'll pay for the damage.
-What's the problem?

551
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:04,725
Why did you cuff me?

552
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:07,144
-I just need to call Yong-pal--
-Just have a seat for now.

553
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:09,229
-Have a seat. Sit here.
-What the hell...

554
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,066
How dare you vandalize the restaurant
after a dine-and-dash?

555
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:14,526
Why are you looking for Yong-pal
at the precinct?

556
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,830
Sang-su, bring a rag.

557
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,207
-Let's wash the car.
-Yes, sir.

558
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,960
-Please come with us. Won-u, escort her.
-Yes, sir.

559
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,004
Please get up now.

560
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:38,634
-I'm going to transfer her to the station.
-Okay

561
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:41,136
Take a seat. Over here, please.

562
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,429
Can someone get him some water?

563
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,311
Could we use the men's room?

564
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:50,938
Of course.

565
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:54,316
Officer Ko, show them where it is.

566
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:56,402
Yes, sir. Come with me.

Patrol 23, Patrol 23--

575
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:35,524
It's only a code two,
so you don't have to come.

576
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,276
Take another case. Let's go.

577
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,485
-Sure.
-Be safe out there.

578
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:49,538
So he was wearing
a black tracksuit and cap.

579
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,290
-Yes.
-He was in a black tracksuit

580
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,125
and a black cap.

581
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,377
What about a mask or sunglasses?

582
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:57,379
I only saw him from behind.

583
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,423
I saw him attack the lady,

584
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:01,800
so I shouted out to him.

585
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,051
He then ran away.

586
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:06,138
If it weren't for you,
she could've been hurt.

587
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:08,140
-We thank you too.
-He went that way.

588
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:09,975
Could I get your contact information?

589
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:11,226
Okay.

590
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,312
Please get in. We'll take you home--

591
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:15,063
Someone's picking me up.

592
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:16,899
There he is. I'll get going.

593
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,150
Take care, miss.

594
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:20,194
Thank you so much.

595
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,948
-I'll get going then.
-Thank you again.

596
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,241
Thanks.

597
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,829
The woman saw him head into the park.

598
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:32,080

This is mine.

705
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:43,931
I shot a blank in the direction of
the possible suspect

706
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:47,935
of the Mahyeon Park incident.

707
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:54,275
-Of three bullets--
-You can put

708
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,277
the details in your report.

709
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:59,155
The lieutenant was hurt,

710
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,407
but you caught the culprit. Well done.

711
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,202
It's a huge case.

712
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:07,580
Just know that Internal Affairs
will be involved.

713
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:13,127
Get changed and write your firearm report

714
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:14,837
in the break room.

715
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:18,299
Put it down.

716
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:36,317
FIREARM USAGE REPORT

717
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:39,946
Sang-su.

718
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:42,865
You did well today.

719
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:48,037
I would have gotten flustered

720
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,332
and wouldn't have been able to

721
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:53,710
save Lieutenant Oh.

722
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:56,462
-I'm proud of--
-Let me

723
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:00,466
write my report.

724
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:05,138
Okay.

725
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:20,403
I SPLIT UP WITH MY PARTNER,
LIEUTENANT OH, TO SEARCH MAHYEON PARK

726
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:30,621
Chief.

727
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,919
You have one minute.

728
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:40,339
It was a Friday and
we had ten times more cases--

729
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:41,466
Just the facts.

730
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:45,344
Lieutenant Oh radioed in that
he'd found a possible victim

731
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:49,640
of the recent random stabbings
in the men's toilet

732
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:53,019
by Mahyeon Park's east gate
at about 5:23 a.m.

733
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:55,021
Yeom Sang-su was by west gate

734
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:57,398
and ran over at full speed in a minute,

735
01:02:58,399 --> 01:03:00,359
but by then the criminal had already

736
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:03,029
stabbed Yang-chon
in the shoulder and hand with a scalpel.

737
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:05,531
He cut a ligament behind one knee.

738
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:09,535
He'd also stabbed him in the side
aiming for the spleen and kidney.

739
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:13,247
The possible suspect had his ID on him.

740
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:16,417
After running background,
we found out he went to medical school.

741
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:20,171
He knew exactly where
the spleen and kidney are.

742
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:22,298
He expected the victim to go into shock

743
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:23,883
once he got those organs.

744
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:27,386
The perp was hurt after being shot
by Sang-su

745
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:30,264
and was sent to Inseok Hospital.
He's in surgery but he's unconscious.

746
01:03:30,681 --> 01:03:32,642
The teenage victim
was sent to Dongyang Hospital

747
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,436
and has regained consciousness
before going into surgery.

748
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:41,067
What about Yang-chon?

749
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:43,653
He was unconscious

750
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:46,405
when he was taken into surgery.

751
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,700
It's been over two hours, sir.

752
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:54,121
Team One of Violent Crime Unit
at Mahyeon Police Station took the case.

753
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:03,047
You need to hand in
your gear and firearm, so head back.

754
01:04:05,049 --> 01:04:07,677
I'll call you if there's an emergency.

755
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:18,938
OPERATION ROOM

756
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:44,547
I'm better now.

757
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:49,719
I almost lost my mind earlier,

758
01:04:51,512 --> 01:04:52,513
but I've calmed down.

759
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:27,048
You should go.

760
01:05:27,548 --> 01:05:29,091
The surgery will take long.

761
01:05:30,217 --> 01:05:33,638
You guys being here won't guarantee
that the surgery will go well.

762
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:37,642
Besides, it's not good for your health.

763
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:40,519
You should go.

764
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:46,442
Chief.

765
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,617
Yes, this is he.

766
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:01,540
Yes, thank you. Sure.

767
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:08,172
It was Captain Jang at
the Women & Juvenile Affairs Division.

768
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:09,674
He said we did good work.

769
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:12,468
<i>Last week, the public was outraged
to hear a corrupt detective</i>

770
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:15,388
<i>only receiving a fine
on illegal prostitution charges</i>

771
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:17,223
<i>due to insufficient evidence.</i>

772
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:21,519
<i>Today, yet another case
has caught the public's attention.</i>

773
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:25,690
<i>Three months ago,
a high-ranking officer, while intoxicated,</i>

774
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:30,194
<i>gravely injured a restaurant waiter
with his firearm for trying to stop him.</i>

775
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:32,571
<i>Though he was dismissed,
the public is still--</i>

776
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:34,615
Don't pay it any attention.

777
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:37,201
Those bastards only want to bring us down.

778
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:38,703
<i>It is still being investigated.</i>

779
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:39,996
Did you meet the doctor?

780
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:43,207
<i>It has been confirmed that
he has been sent to the Police Agency.</i>

781
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:46,252
He came out during surgery to brief us.

782
01:06:47,586 --> 01:06:48,838
What did he say?

783
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:53,551
What is it?

784
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,303
Well...

785
01:06:57,388 --> 01:06:58,431
First,

786
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:03,227
surgery was successful
on his spleen and kidney.

787
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:05,604
But?

788
01:07:10,234 --> 01:07:12,236
He still has to gain consciousness,

789
01:07:13,237 --> 01:07:14,488
so we'll have to see.

790
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:17,575
Also,

791
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:21,537
the assailant cut

792
01:07:22,496 --> 01:07:25,583
Yang-chon's ligament behind his right knee
with the knife.

793
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:29,712
The doctor will do his best but...

794
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,761
Are you saying he might not

795
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,306
be able to run anymore?

796
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:04,413
Sang-su.

797
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,374
Don't wash your uniform.

798
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:09,668
Sang-su.

799
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:11,837
Open this door!

800
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:13,422
Sang-su!

801
01:08:14,298 --> 01:08:15,758
Open this door.

802
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:18,511
Sang-su!

803
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:19,804
Open up.

804
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:23,808
Do you think I can't open it myself?

805
01:08:41,325 --> 01:08:42,326
Mom.

806
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:46,372
I don't care
if you weren't the one who was stabbed.

807
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:48,374
You'll quit immediately.

808
01:08:48,749 --> 01:08:51,877
We don't need this job to get by.

809
01:08:52,753 --> 01:08:54,839
There are other jobs you can get.

810
01:08:55,047 --> 01:08:56,340
Mom.

811
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:58,717
This doesn't happen all the time.

812
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:00,845
Also,

813
01:09:03,055 --> 01:09:04,390
I caught the assailant.

814
01:09:04,723 --> 01:09:07,393
Who cares if you did?

815
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:10,563
Your mentor, who's brighter
and more skilled, got injured.

816
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:13,149
It could happen to you too!

817
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:16,235
Catching one bad guy
won't stop others from committing crimes.

818
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:18,320
As of today,

819
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:20,156
you're quitting this job.

820
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:24,535
Every day when you head to work,

821
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:26,537
my heart shrivels out of worry.

822
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:30,499
You'll stay home from this day on.

823
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:35,337
I'm putting my foot down.

824
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:38,048
Quit your job as a cop.

825
01:10:38,442 --> 01:10:39,735
I'm going to bed early.

826
01:10:42,863 --> 01:10:44,490
I'm here to join you.

827
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:55,918
Lie down.

828
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:22,987
Lieutenant Oh's surgery

829
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:26,240
went well.

830
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:28,659
I saw it in our chat room.

831
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:34,081
Is he conscious?

832
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:37,418
Close your eyes.

The internal investigation
is just a formality.

836
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:39,998
Judging from the situation,

837
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:42,292
we're convinced
that he's the prime suspect,

838
01:13:42,876 --> 01:13:44,878
so you don't need to worry too much.

839
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:46,922
Okay.

840
01:13:47,714 --> 01:13:48,715
Thank you.

841
01:13:57,641 --> 01:13:59,309
Hey, we have a problem.

842
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:02,271
Yeom Sang-su shot the wrong guy.

843
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:04,022

<i>that they had the serial killer in custody</i>

<i>the gloves used

<i>were cotton, not leather.</i>

861
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:57,951

01:16:18,323 --> 01:16:20,617
Anyone would've shot the guy.
I know I would've.

882
01:16:21,201 --> 01:16:22,953
<i>You're saying that anyone would've</i>

883
01:16:23,036 --> 01:16:25,956
shot the guy in that situation,
but I can't agree with that, Jeong-o.

884
01:16:26,039 --> 01:16:28,709
The victim is
a complete stranger to us, but...

885
01:16:28,792 --> 01:16:32,212
<i>What Sang-su did
isn't what anyone would've done.</i>

886
01:16:33,046 --> 01:16:34,631
<i>Why didn't he follow the manual</i>

887
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:36,216
<i>and cause this mess?</i>

888
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:37,968
No.

889
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:41,346
Mr. Oh Yang-chon.
