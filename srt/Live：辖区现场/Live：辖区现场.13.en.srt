00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,770
This is cancer.

3
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,410
My girl, you look so beautiful.

4
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,710
-Whose daughter is this?
-Yours.

5
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,710
You look so pretty.

6
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,170
You look beautiful.

7
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,260
I'm going to work.

8
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,180
See you.

9
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,480
<i>Hey.</i>

10
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,860
His businesses failed

11
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,190
10 years ago, and 3 years ago.

12
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,900
How can you be so sure
he'll succeed this time?

13
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,860
You used all our savings
for our daughter's wedding.

14
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,780
Now you want to mortgage our house
for your brother's business?

15
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,500
What would we do after retirement?

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,870
Do you want to be
forced out onto the streets?

17
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,880
What are you going to do?

18
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,300
You'll work for another
7 to 8 years as a cop.

19
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,960
We can always make more.

20
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,440
How would you know
if I'd work for another 7 or 8 years

21
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,190
or just quit in a couple of days?

22
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,070
What if I get sick and die tomorrow?

23
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,320
Are you a god or something?

24
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,190
You silly woman.

25
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,030
Goodness.

26
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,030
Why would you get sick?C

KIM KYEONG-JIN, BAE SU-JEONG,
MOON JIN-YEONG, LEE JI-MIN

29
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,250
Well...

30
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,380
I'd like to know the names

31
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,180
of victims of the rape cases

32
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,680
near Mount Baekun and Mount Somyeong.

33
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,440
<i>It turns out you were right about that.</i>

34
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,690
Why? Did you find anything?

35
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,350
<i>We just verified the identity</i>

36
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,690
<i>of the suspect</i>

37
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,900
<i>of the rape cases
from the judo association.</i>

38
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,570
His name is Cho Seol-tae.
He's 35 years old.

39
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,110
He was a member of the national team.

40
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,280
He ran a judo gym until a few months ago.

41
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,410
<i>The time frame of
when he shut down his gym,</i>

42
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,000
<i>and when the first case took place
are similar.</i>

43
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,120
<i>It was about 1 year and 2 months ago.</i>

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,380
He shut down his gym

45
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,380
because of diabetic complications.

46
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,050
<i>Kyeong-jin testified
that he had bad breath.</i>

47
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,300
We compared his montage
with a photo from the list.

48
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,640
There are many similarities.

49
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,010
<i>And</i>

50
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,220
a woman just called the police

51
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,220
saying her husband might be the suspect.

52
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,140
<i>His name is Cho Seol-tae.</i>

53
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,600
<i>He's the same man
Lieutenant Oh was talking about.</i>

54
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,560
She found some name tags
in his possession.

55
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,610
The name tags are from
the victims of the murder and rape cases.

56
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,530
You said I was right.

57
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,280
Does that mean he is a store owner?

58
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,120
Yes. It's 112 Somyeong-gil,

59
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,580
Happy Outdoor.

60
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,250
I'm going there now.

61
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,410
I'll see you guys there.

62
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,870
Drive safely.

63
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,590
Suspect in rape and murder case
is in a white tracksuit.

64
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,430
Suspect headed to Jeongbal Intersection
near Chayeong Building.

65
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,220
I spotted the suspect!

66
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,700
Stop right there!

67
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,070
The suspect stole a scooter and fled!

68
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,160
It's a red scooter!

69
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,080
License plate number...

70
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,000
I can't see the number.

71
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,420
Suspect in rape and murder case
is in a white tracksuit.

72
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,520
Han-pyo, there's a trail between Mount
Baekun and Mount Somyeong around here.

73
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,860
-Report it.
-Got it.

74
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,280
Patrol 24, Patrol 24.

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,110
Chasing suspect in rape and murder case.

<i>Suspect is heading to the trail between</i>

77
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:11,700
<i>Mount Baekun and Somyeong.</i>

78

Patrol 24, Patrol 24.
Heading to Mount Baekun.

79
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,240
Patrol 24, Patrol 24.
Heading to Mount Baekun.

80
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,620
Requesting backup from patrol cars

81
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,790
in the vicinity.

82
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,590
It's the one turning right.

83
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,340
-How are you sure?
-The tracksuit is different.

84
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,550
And his shoes look different,
but I'm not sure.

85
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,260
Han-pyo, prepare for the worst.

86
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,770
Patrol 24, Patrol 24.

87
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,180
Chasing suspect in rape and murder case.

88
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,270
Another suspected bike spotted.

89
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,650
<i>A red bike with a man

92

Are you all right?

93
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,150
My gosh.

94
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,360
What did you just do to a cop?

95
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,370
Show me your IDs.

96
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,340
You may go.

97
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,510
What happened? Isn't he the suspect?

98
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,680
No, he's not.

99
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,640
We ran his ID. He's an ordinary citizen.

100
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,810
<i>Code Zero. Code Zero.</i>

101
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,270
<i>We have tracked and located the position</i>

<i>He's headed toward the entrance

111
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:48,210
That's right. This is him.
That's the perp.

112
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,420
We're tracking his phone.

113
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,770
Yeom Sang-su.

114
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,070
-Take care of it and request backup.
-Okay.

115
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,410

suspect in rape and murder case.

117
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,290
He is headed up the mountain using
the access road

118
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,960
<i>between Mount Baekun and Mount Somyeong
at Hongil 2-dong, 16.</i>

<i>Requesting backup from patrol cars.</i>

120
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,130
Choi Myeong-ho,
what do you think you should do now?

121
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,880
We should assemble

122
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,260
all personnel around Mount Baekun
and Mount Somyeong.

123
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,590
While it's a residential area
with one entrance point,

124
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,220
but we can't exclude the possibility
of him going into a restricted area.

125
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:43,810
So, the more people the better.

126
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,520
The suspect ditched
the phone and the scooter he stole.

127
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,610
He went this way.

128
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,320
I have the suspect's phone.

129
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,690
Track its location.

130
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,360
I'm following Sang-su for backup.

131
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,030
-Until the other personnel arrive--
-We may not be able to wait.

132
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,370
You must wait. He's an athlete,

133
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,580
and we can't be certain that he's unarmed.

134
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,250
Do not arrest him alone.

135
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,460
<i>Officers are gathering at the foot
of the mountain</i>

136
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,130
<i>and blocking off all escape routes.</i>

137
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,670
Sang-su and you will just drive him
down the mountain.

138
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,590
I'll say this again.
Don't arrest him without backup.

139
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,340
<i>Wait until you know for sure
that we can overpower him--</i>

140
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,510
But what if he runs away?

141
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,800
<i>Just let him run away!</i>

142
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,180
I've made myself clear.
Don't catch him without backup.

143
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,180
<i>We've already confirmed his address,</i>

144
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,850
<i>and backup is on the way.</i>

145
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,650
What if he commits another crime?
I'm hanging up.

146
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,310
<i>Hey, Myeong-ho!</i>

147
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,480
Damn it.

148
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,390
Officers and patrol cars in the vicinity,

149
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,220
this is Lieutenant Oh
from the serial rape task force.

150
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,430
Officer Yeom and Senior Officer Choi
are chasing the suspect.

151
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,890
All detectives in the team,
except for Detective Jang and Cho,

152
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,100
will head towards
Mount Baekun and Mount Somyeong.

153
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,440
They'll lead the team,
so you stay out of it.

154
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,690
Patrol cars in the vicinity,

155
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,740
keep monitoring the GPS tracking updates
provided by the situation room.

156
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,780
Also, block all possible
escape routes near the mountains

157
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,080
and support Senior Officer Choi
and Officer Yeom.

158

Senior Officer Choi and Officer Yeom
are chasing the suspect at the moment.

159
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,790
This is Captain An from the task force.
I repeat.

160
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,420
Patrol cars in the vicinity,

161
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,550
block all possible escape routes
near Mount Baekun and Mount Somyeong

162
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,680
and support Senior Officer Choi Myeong-ho
and Officer Yeom Sang-su. That's it.

163
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,100
I'm sure you want to be at the scene,

164
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,930

175
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,960
<i>This is Patrol 43, Patrol 43.
We're at Trail 11 of Mount Baekun.</i>

176
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,330
-You should surrender.
-Listen to him.

177
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,330
Surrender.

178
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,480
My daughters are safe
because I'll protect them.

179
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,450
<i>My dad tried to hit Kyeong-mi.</i>

180
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,910
<i>My mom</i>

181
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,990
<i>had no choice.</i>

182
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,210
That's enough.

183
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:23,020
He might try to hurt himself.

184
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,340
PRESCRIPTION

185
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,840
He is Cho Seol-tae.

186
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:53,760
This prick needs to hear you
reciting his Miranda rights.

187
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,140
Too bad he passed out.

188
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,230
The Miranda rights aren't important.

189
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,280
You have to get a life sentence
no matter what, you psycho.

190
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,790
I hear a lot of footsteps.
Backup must be here.

191
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,890
The suspect is... I mean,

192
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,810
we caught the wanted criminal!

193
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,180
We caught Cho Seol-tae!

194
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,440
The wanted criminal has been caught!

195
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,150
Code Zero!

196
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,190
The situation is over!

197
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,240
The suspect has been caught!

198
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,990
Great work!

199
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,200
-Good job, guys.
-Great job!

200
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,540
The suspect, Cho Seol-tae,
has been caught!

201
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,920
-Senior Officer Choi and Officer Yeom
-It's over.

202
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,960
arrested Cho Seol-tae.

203
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,460
Cho Seol-tae has been arrested

204
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,260
-Cho Seol-tae has been caught!
-near Trail Seven of Mount Baekun.

205
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,510
Code Zero.

206
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,840
The situation is over now.

207
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,550
I repeat. Senior Officer Choi

208
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,640
and Officer Yeom of Hongil Patrol Division
caught Cho Seol-tae

209
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,180
near Trail Seven of Mount Baekun...

210
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,080
<i>The rape and murder suspect,
Cho Seol-tae, has been arrested</i>

211
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,250
<i>in the restricted area
near Trail Seven of Mount Baekun.</i>

212
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:49,790
<i>The rape and murder suspect,
Cho Seol-tae, has been arrested.</i>

213
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,840
<i>The search is over.</i>

214
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:54,090
<i>The rape and murder suspect,
Cho Seol-tae, has been arrested.</i>

215
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,970
<i>The rape and murder suspect,
Cho Seol-tae, has been arrested.</i>

216
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,390
<i>The search is over.</i>

217
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,720
<i>All officers who are searching
the areas near the mountains,</i>

218
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,470
<i>please return to your positions.</i>

219
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:06,480
<i>All officers who are searching
the areas near the mountains,</i>

220
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,100
<i>please return to your positions.</i>

221
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,830
Senior Officer Choi and Officer Yeom,
great work.

222
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:26,790
Thank you, sir.

223
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:29,120
-Let's all go out for drinks soon.
-Sure.

224
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,880
Hey, we'll see the ambulance go
and head back after.

225
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,210
-See you guys at the station.
-Yes, sir.

226
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,880
See you.

227
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,470
Hey.

228
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,430
Good work.

229
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,860
You too, sir.

230
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,160
-Hello, how can we help...
-Where's everyone?

231
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,370
At the cafeteria upstairs.

232
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,910
No one has left for the day.
Everyone is so excited.

233
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,620
Isn't it so good?

234
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,250
-Yes, it is.
-It's delicious.

235
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,960
Are we just getting fried chicken
for catching a serial rapist?

236
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,220
This is wrong.

237
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,050
Then give it to me!

238
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,140
We got you sandwiches and fried chicken.

239
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,310
-What more do you want?
-Hey, then what should we do?

240
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,890
-Should we sell the pillars to
-Should we sell the pillars to

241
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,190
-buy you ribs
-buy you ribs

242
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,190
-or a steak?
-or a steak? You punk.

243
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,320
-My gosh, you're an adorable kid,
-You're an adorable kid,

244
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,030
-a good kid, and a lanky kid.
-a good kid, and a lanky kid.

245
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,160
You guys did a great job,

246
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,330
but that was very dangerous.

247
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,660
You should've just shot him.
Why did you fight unarmed?

248
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,710
What if you got hit in the eye
with the baton?

249
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,420
Then you would've gone blind on the spot.
Just like Senior Officer Song at Mapo.

250
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,250
-But we should refrain from using guns.
-Yes, I agree.

251
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,340
When a cop uses a gun,
it's not the suspect who dies,

252
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,590
we'll die from the penalty.

253
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,590
"Why did you shoot him
when he was unarmed?"

254
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,010
Have we ever gotten away
with shooting a suspect?

255
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,350
The citizens always

256
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:09,430
expect cops to fight without weapons.

257
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,270
The children of the people
who say such things

258
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,560
should all become cops.

259
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:17,400
-Why are you cursing them?
-You know it's a curse.

260
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,400
Just congratulate them on a job well done.

261
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,200
Why say anything more?

262
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,950
Sam-bo, were you there today?

263
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,240
Yes.

264
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,030
My words exactly.

265
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,950
They're jealous that I caught the bastard.

266
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,250
Besides, it's me who got hurt.

267
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,080
Hey, that's not true.

268
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,460
I see your confidence is through the roof.

269
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,260
Yeom Sang-su, what was that again?

270
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,880
Well?

271
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,560
Yeom Sang-su, what was that again?

272
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,240
Well?

273
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,580
I knew you'd get an earful.

274
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,210
Yang-chon, go on and lecture him.

275
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,880
You should consider yourself lucky
that you weren't badly injured.

276
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,090
The suspect was skilled in judo.

277
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,630
Is your life just your own?

278
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,430
In Seoul alone,

279
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,800
a single field officer,
not including those on desk duty,

280
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,600
is responsible for 1000 civilians.

281
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,350
If you factor in breaks,
vacation, and shifts,

282
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:18,440
that number goes up
to about 4,000 civilians.

283
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,770
Even so, you fought against him

284
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,360
just so that you could cuff him!

285
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,610
Good job. Congratulations!

286
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:30,450
-Nice!
-You too, Myeong-ho.

287
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,620
Well done, you two.

288
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:50,030
Lucky him.

289
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,780
I'm green with envy.

290
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:55,240
You'll be on big cases started next month.

291
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,290
As if I'd get the chance.

292
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,540
Once I retire,

293
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,670
you'll be teamed up with a younger,
more sprightly mentor.

294
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,460
But sir...

295
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:16,680
I didn't mean it like that.

296
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,400
Why aren't you heading home?

297
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:25,900
After I retire,

298
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,770
I'm going to operate an excavator.

299
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,280
Leave. I need to study.

300
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,410
What about something else?
Operating an excavator is hard.

301
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:37,530
"You shift gears

302
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,750
using oil pressure."

303
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,720
You

304
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,970
were very brave. Good job.

305
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,470
Your description of the suspect

306
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,930
was crucial.

307
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,020
What you told us about the strange scent
coming from his breath...

308
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,150
That gave us a clue

309
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,690
and helped us figure out he was ill.

310
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,990
That's how we spotted him at a hospital.

311
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,530
You're the one who caught him.

312
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,040
Your mom is being let out.

313
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,120
Tomorrow morning,

314
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,670
she'll come to the center.

315
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,010
Your dad won't forgive your mom,

316
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,930
but he apologized to you two.

317
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,230
Until you forgive him,

318
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:52,190
he'll let you have some space.

319
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,740
The hard part is all over now.

320
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:00,780
It's all over.

321
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,010
Are you heading home?

322
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,310
We should go for a drink.

323
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,520
Should we?

324
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,940
Myeong-ho, why the long face?

325
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,610
It's still depressing, that's all.

326
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,070
We may have caught the bastard,

327
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:42,070
but that doesn't erase
what happened to the victims.

328
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,080
Take a page out of his book and grow up,
Sang-su.

329
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,290
Unlike him, you were lighting up
with glee over catching the perp.

330
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:53,500
We can be happy about catching the perp.
What more is there to it?

331
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,670
So what if I'm in high spirits today?

332
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,130
We should drink at my place.

333
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,720
The rule of our division is that

334
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:07,180
we drink one round
to guarantee the safety of the people.

335
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:10,690
Unfortunately,
one round won't cut it today.

336
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:12,980
Let's go to my place.

337
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,900
Hye-ri and Jeong-o can join us.

338
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,360
-Okay?
-I can't today.

339
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,780
You two go ahead.

340
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,240
Actually,

341
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,120
I'd rather drink alone at home.

342
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,540
See you tomorrow.

343
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,040
Didn't you just agree to drinks?

344
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:34,000
-Is it because I mentioned Jeong-o?
-Yes.

345
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,880
I'd rather spend time with her alone.

346
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:38,380
Not in a group but alone.

347
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:40,970
I'll get going then.

348
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,600
It seems like

349
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,220
Myeong-ho just sucker punched you.

350
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,140
It's not like she's his girlfriend.

351
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,480
Let's go and get a drink.

352
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,650
I'm sending off my mother tomorrow.

353
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,110
Where?

354
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,070
Are you changing hospitals?

355
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,700
That's just it.

356
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,160
You're right.

357
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,000
She's changing hospitals.

358
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,920
It's easier to think of it that way.

359
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,840
Be careful next time though.

360
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,010
You could die.

361
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,270
Who are you becoming like?
You're so reckless.

362
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,850
Who do you think I'm becoming like?
I'm becoming like you.

363
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,900
Me?

364
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:37,690
Me? Is that so?

365
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:39,820
Am I your friend?

366
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,690
Because it sounded like
you were addressing me as one.

367
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,950
Don't be such an ass!

368
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,670
God, I want a drink.

369
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:02,710
Hey.
Can't you see that we're sleeping here?

370
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,880
I'm sorry.

371
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,390
An overseas resident officer?

372
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,600
It's what I'm leaning towards.

373
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,150
Rather than working domestically,

374
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,070
I want to work overseas.

375
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,240
What about you? Violent Crime Unit?

376
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,700
I don't know. I'll think about it later.

377
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,200
Right now,

378
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:32,740
I want to celebrate catching
that son of bitch, Cho Seol-tae.

379
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,720
Do you also think
that my spirits are too high?

380
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,220
Yes.

381
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,140
I caught the bastard, so who cares

382
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,100
-if I enjoy the moment?
-Who said you can't?

383
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,730
Yang-chon and Myeong-ho.

384
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:04,860
They said that catching the suspect
doesn't change the world.

385
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,280
The victims were still attacked,

386
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,700
and they have to live with it forever.

387
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,500
That's right too.

388
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,210
But

389
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,460
there's something more important.

390
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,010
"Something more important"?

391
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:30,970
What's that?

392
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:36,270
The fact that I caught the perpetrator.

393
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,440
Therefore,

394
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,030
he won't be able to abuse
any more victims.

395
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,820
5th, 6th,

396
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:51,200
7th possible victims.

397
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,330
We.

398
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,080
I.

399
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:58,330
You.

400
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:01,920
We stopped that. We saved them.

401
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,170
That's why I...

402
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,800
You, me, us...

403
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:12,050
We have to celebrate this moment.

404
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:16,220
So, we must stay strong
and catch more bad guys.

405
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,480
Am I wrong?

406
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,070
You're right.

407
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,080
I caught the criminal!

408
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:39,500
I caught the lunatic
who's worse than an animal.

409
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,210
I caught the fucking bastard myself!

410
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:52,220
Kyeong-jin said...

411
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,430
Kyeong-jin and her mom said that

412
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,100
they're grateful to us.

413
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,360
What?

414
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,280
Kyeong-jin said...

415
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,530
Kyeong-jin and her mom said that

416
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:13,910
they're grateful to us.

417
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,710
What?

418
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,380
They're grateful.

419
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,470
What?

420
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,600
I'm grateful too.

421
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:44,900
That you caught him.

422
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,730
This will go on my sense of duty list.

423
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,280
Look at this.

424
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,120
JU-YEON

425
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:02,660
The internet cafe kid I saved.

426
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:06,250
He's at a shelter,
and his mom visits sometimes.

427
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,840
And this.

428
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,050
POLICE ADMINISTRATION

429
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,130
The kid who cut the side of my face

430
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:15,380
sent me this saying
he wants to be a cop like me.

431
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,930
And...

432
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,010
RECORDING 001

433
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,310
<i>I'm grateful too. That you caught him.</i>

434
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,390
Now I have this too.

435
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:27,900
I'll save it in my sense of duty folder.

436
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:36,280
<i>As life goes on,</i>

437
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,120

<i>We're fortunate</i>

444
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,560

<i>To be young</i>

446
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,730
That's just stupid. What's wrong with you?

SENIOR CHOI MYEONG-HO

452
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,520
Lift your chin. Look up.

453
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,520
I can do it.

454
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,600
You don't do it properly.

455
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,940
You always miss a bit.

456
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,730
That's only because my eyes are dim.

457
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,360
If your eyes are dim, be more thorough.

458
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,450
Use your hands

459
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:02,450
to feel your chin and cheeks as you go.

460
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:13,500
-Dad.
-What?

461
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,550
Let's think that Mom

462
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:23,100
is moving from the nursing home to heaven.

463
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,140
Think of it that way.

464
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,790
I think it's done.

465
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,100
Your suit's so old.

466
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,390
We should've bought one.

467
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,430
Your mom bought me that.

468
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,690
A new suit would feel strange.

469
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,320
Would it?

470
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,610
Would a new suit feel strange?

471
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:45,720
You wear this. It would make her happy.

472
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:52,310
Okay.

473
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,230
You becoming a cop

474
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,770
was the best thing you did for your mom.

475
00:34:58,570 --> 00:34:59,690
Think about it that way.

476
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:19,380
Don't just look into the fridge.
Drink if you want to.

477
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,550
Your team caught a serial criminal.

478
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,550
Go to bed.

479
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,180
Drink or don't drink,
just go to bed early.

480
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:30,600
You don't want to look puffy
at your daughter's wedding.

481

TEAM LEADER KIM

483
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,370
Hi.

484
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,540
Yes, I got the text.

485
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,500
Really?

486
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:43,550
There's an opening for police corporal
at Bomun in Chungcheong Province?

487
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,880
That's great.

488
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:50,890
Everyone knows

489
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,600
that's a cushy title.

490
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,640
Yes.

491
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:59,600
A senior of mine worked there.

492
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,610
Is it true that it'll open up soon?

493
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:09,860
No, there are no problems at Hongil.

494
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:13,370
I have some personal issues.

495
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:23,500
I know that this is all you can do.

496
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:26,210
I can't ask for favors.

497
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,470
Yes, I know that. I know.

498
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,520
-Hi, Sam-bo.
-Hi. Is everyone here?

499
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,230
-Not yet.
-Okay.

500
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,440
When we worked in Gangnam,

501
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,570
he was Han-sol's and my senior.

502
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,150
I should go inside first.

503
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,860
Sure, go ahead.

504
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,700
He walks with a limp.

505
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,580
That's Min Su-man.

506
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
He was a traffic cop,
and a drunk driver hit him.

507
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:06,540
He visited our division once.

508
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:07,710
Didn't you see him?

509
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:11,420
He works as a security guard in our area.

510
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,930
I don't know.

511
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:16,100
But doesn't he receive a pension?
Why does he work as a security guard?

512
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,600
Seven years ago,

513
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:21,270
when he was interrogating
a hit-and-run driver who killed a family,

514
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,350
he lost his temper and punched the guy

515
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,480
because he was so shameless.

516
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:27,520
But unfortunately, he fell

517
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:29,280
and ended up injuring his spine.

518
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:33,740
So Su-man got fired for excessive force,

519
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:37,530
and he's still paying back the loan
he took out to pay for the damages.

520
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:39,910
Goodness.

521
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:44,750
You still have a few days before
you retire. You should be careful too.

522
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,710
Yes, I should. See you later.

523
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:53,970

00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,520
Hey, are you going to come?

526
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,610
You shouldn't.

527
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:10,280
People will understand.

528
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:13,280
I should be there.
Chief Ki's only child is getting married.

529
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,660
How's Yang-chon? Is he okay?

530
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:22,910
Ask me directly from now on, will you?

531
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:26,920
Come out. I'm going to drink some water.

532
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,710
Yang-chon always talks like that,
you know.

533
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:35,090
I have a blind date, so I can't go
to the hospital this afternoon.

534
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:38,050
You know how stubborn my mother is.

535
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,760
I heard that she's a divorcée,
who used to be a doctor.

536
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:43,060
<i>She has no kids.</i>

537
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:46,640
You should meet her.
Who knows? You might like her.

538
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,400
Don't you worry. I'm going to meet her.

539
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:51,400
You said you don't like me,

540
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:53,740
and it's not like
I want to be single forever.

541
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,530
<i>But what I'm saying is,
why does it have to be today?</i>

542
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,990
Well, I guess I'll see you here anyway,

543
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:06,000
but explain my situation
to Yang-chon for me.

544
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:07,830
Yes.

545
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,500
All right.

546
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,790
-Gyeong-mo.
-Han-sol.

547
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,800
Gosh, please wear your uniform properly.

548
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,010
The guests will see this. Goodness.

549
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,840
Hey, I heard Yang-chon
decided not to have a funeral.

550
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:22,640
Yes, it was his father's decision.

551
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:25,180
His sister, who lives on an island,
visited last week,

552
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:26,520
and she's too ill to come.

553
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,770
They want to keep it quiet.

554
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,560
Right.

555
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,690
She lived like a dead person
for a long time,

556
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:34,530
so a funeral might be unnecessary.

557
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,660
By the way, why are you sweating so much?

558
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,200
Are you nervous about this wedding?

559
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:45,750
This is so unlike you.

560
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:47,120
Well, I am a little nervous.

561
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,170
You look dashing.

562
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,250
Let's go.

563
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:55,920
Gyeong-mo.

564
00:40:58,970 --> 00:40:59,970
I'm sorry

565
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,260
I made you come

566
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,430
to our patrol division.

567
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:08,270
At least you know.

568
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:39,720
Will you be able to smile
at the wedding today?

569
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,930
I have to smile.

570
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,140
I can't ruin someone else's wedding.

571
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:54,730
Let's go.

572
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,030
<i>Come in, guys.</i>

573
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,620
My, you look stunning.

574
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,080
Gosh, who's this beautiful lady?

575
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,330
-How gorgeous.
-My gosh.

576
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,210
-She looks so beautiful.
-My, is she an angel or what?

577
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,880
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

578
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:21,300
Are you okay, sir?

579
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,180
Yes, of course.

580
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,720
-How beautiful.
-She's stunning!

581
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:25,890
She's beautiful.

582
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,890
Of course!
She obviously got her looks from us.

583
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:32,980
My wife and I worked very hard
to have our beautiful daughter.

584
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,810
My daughter is very popular,

585
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,650
so she won't have time
to take photos later.

586
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:40,070
Everyone, gather around and sit.

587
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:41,440
Honey, let's sit down.

588
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,400
All right. Let's sit, everyone.

589
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:46,370
Let's take a photo, everyone.
Mentors, stand behind the bride.

590
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:47,910
Mentees, sit in front of her.

591
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:49,620
Everyone, gather!

592
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,120
She looks so beautiful.

593
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:55,210
Sit here.

594
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:58,750
Congratulations on arresting the suspect.

595
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,090
We should go out for drinks soon.

596
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:02,380
Okay.

597
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:04,510
Sit down.

598
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:05,890
My gosh, hey.

599
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:07,220
-Be quiet!
-They want us to sit.

600
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,350
Yes, please be quiet.

601
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:11,930
-The tall gentleman, more to your right.
-Me?

602
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,020
-That looks great.
-Move over.

603
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:19,320
Hey, can you...

604
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,400
My daughter.

605
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,530
You have to live well, okay?

606
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:24,900
Be happy.

607
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:28,320
You've said that over a hundred times
this week alone.

608
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:30,830
Did I?

609
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:34,290
All right, I'll take your picture now.
Everyone, look at the camera.

610
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:39,380
Guys, let's shout our slogan together.
Everyone, one, two, three!

611
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,710
-Go Hongil!
-Go Hongil!

612
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:46,130
I'll take another shot.
Everyone, look at the camera.

613
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,180
One, two, three!

614
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,220
-Go Hongil!
-Go Hongil!

615
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,900
Just leave it if you can't do it.

616
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:10,700
You said you wanted to wear a tie
for the first time in your life.

617
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:13,410
You should wear it.

618
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,750
I'll figure it out.

619
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,170
I'll do it.

620
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,140
Father, I guess you want to look good

621
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:37,020
when you say your last goodbye to Mother.

622
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:40,730
I can see that you even
took a bath and shaved.

623
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:47,860
She'll be able to leave this world happily

624
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:50,320
after seeing how handsome you are.

625
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:02,750
The team members are here.

626
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:14,220
Out of all the mentees,
Captain Eun only told me.

627
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:15,640
He said I should know.

628
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:20,060
I should know, don't you think?

629
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,980
I should because I'm your partner.

630
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:27,440
I'll go in first.

631
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:37,250
It's done. You look very nice.

632
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,790
Thanks for everything you've done.

633
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:43,710
I didn't even do much.

634
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:00,850
All right. If you're ready,

635
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,520
please say your last goodbye to her.

636
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:21,540
Father.

637
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:23,500
Say goodbye to Mother.

638
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,880
I don't even deserve
to say anything to her.

639
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,860
I'm sorry.

640
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:09,550
See you soon on the other side.

641
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,180
You should say goodbye to her too.

642
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:23,230
Yang-chon, say goodbye.

643
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:35,910
Mother.

644
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,580
Mom.

645
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:45,410
I know that

646
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:48,170
you went through a lot

647
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:53,920
to raise a bad son like me.

648
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:01,430
Rest in peace.

649
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:16,990
You guys should wish her well too.

650
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:19,990
-Grandma.
-Grandma.

651
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,580
-Rest in peace.
-Rest in peace.

652
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:32,040
Mother.

653
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:35,880
Thank you for everything.

654
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,510
You can rest in peace now.

655
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,730
Then,

656
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:53,480
we'll now take Ms. Geum Mi-ja
off the ventilator.

657
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:40,030
Ms. Geum Mi-ja

658
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:42,320
has passed away.

659
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,120
Time of death, April 21, 2:33 p.m.

660
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,170
Boys, let's all salute her.

661
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:10,230
As you were.

662
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:44,130
Thank you.

663
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:45,470
Sure.

664
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:52,520
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you all for coming.

665
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,940
-Please don't mention it.
-We're doing what we must.

666
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,800
Why did you come
on such a good day for you?

667
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:48,450
Jeez.

668
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:51,240
Old age has made you soft.

669
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:54,500
Please don't cry.

670
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,080
It's your daughter's wedding day.

671
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:00,790
Don't cry.

672
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,530
Once he takes the test next month,

673
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:10,280
he'll be promoted.

674
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:12,870
We don't expect you to bring anything.

675
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:15,830
Once you pass the test,
will you be joining

676
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:17,830
the National Police Agency

677
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:21,630
-and leave the patrol division?
-Yes, of course!

678
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:25,960
One of his brothers is a judge,
and the other is a diplomat.

679
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:30,630
He didn't join the patrol division
because that's all he's cut out to do.

680
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:34,390
He just wanted to serve
the entire police community.

681
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:36,930
Just so you know, he's ambitious.

682
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,560
Yes, I can see that.

683
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:42,600
I think there's a misunderstanding,

684
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:46,400
but it's all police work
no matter where you're stationed.

685
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,860
I just love being an officer.

686
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:51,530
Will you excuse me?

687
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,580
Didn't you say you were 40?

688
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:01,370
You do not look your age.

689
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,770
<i>Mom, I have to leave. Something came up.</i>

690
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:31,490
THE LATE GEUM MI-JA

691
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:03,850
I was jealous to see you cry

692
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,770
if I'm being honest.

693
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:10,190
These days,

694
00:57:10,850 --> 00:57:12,690
I worry that

695
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:14,650
I won't be sad when my parents die.

696
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,030
What if I don't shed a tear?

697
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,700
That's what I've been thinking.

698
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:23,200
Do your parents and your brothers

699
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:26,250
still hate that you became a cop?

700
00:57:26,330 --> 00:57:27,790
It's not that per se.

701
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:29,830
They hate I'm at a patrol division.

702
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,500
It's not worth bragging about.

703
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:34,750
You're taking the promotion exam.

704
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:36,050
Work at the agency.

705
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:39,590
Working the field is more
my style than yours.

706
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,800
The problem is...

707
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:44,760
Annoyingly enough,
being in the field is growing on me.

708
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,770
Regardless, I'm going to go to the agency.

709
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:16,590
Did Sang-su and the rest leave?

710
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:18,130
Yes, they called a taxi.

711
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,760
Song-yi works part-time,
and Sang-su should go home too.

712
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:25,890
What's with the alcohol?

713
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:27,390
Let's have a drink.

714
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,200
The kids nag me.

715
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:26,910
They want us to reconcile.

716
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:29,660
They're worried about their grandpa

717
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,950
and about you too.

718
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:35,540
Dad likes it here.

719
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:37,250
And

720
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:40,130
wanting us to reconcile
is just the kids talking.

721
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:41,920
Don't mind them.

722
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:46,760
To be honest, I like what we have now.

723
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:48,300
Separate but together.

724
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:52,060
But if it's what you and the kids want...

725
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:56,230
No, let's stay apart.

726
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,280
No, let's stay apart.

727
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,310
I need to be punished a little more.

728
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:16,190
While I was crying
because of my mom today,

729
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,240
I thought about

730
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,820
how your parents passed away
at the same time.

731
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,580
I wondered, "What did I do then?"

732
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,620
When you had a miscarriage at 26

733
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:32,670
for being overworked...

734
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,000
You were at a crime scene.

735
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:38,670
I could've come to you.

736
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,300
But I couldn't face you.

737
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:47,060
I didn't know what to do if you cried.

738
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,060
Then and even now.

739
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,600
Even still, I should've gone.

740
01:00:56,770 --> 01:00:59,150
As always, I ran away.

741
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:02,030
To the field, into a crime scene.

742
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,200
When I saw the kids when I came home,

743
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:12,370
I thought,

744
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,710
"When did they get so big?"

745
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:21,760
Then when I think about it,

746
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:24,300
the answer is clear.

747
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:29,010
You raised them yourself.

748
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:36,730
I don't deserve to be with you.

749
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:45,570
When I got violent over Ju-hyeong's case,

750
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:48,280
and when I dealt with Song-yi's boyfriend,

751
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,580
I saw myself clearly.

752
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:57,250
I'm still emotional, violent,

753
01:01:57,830 --> 01:01:59,000
and dangerous.

754
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:03,800
You must've had a hard time facing me.

755
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:06,680
You must've been uneasy.

756
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:10,350
I wasn't reliable.

757
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:17,650
Oh Yang-chon.

758
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:25,070
Do me a favor.

759
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,110
Don't go too far.

760
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,790
Having you in my life

761
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:36,960
is a huge support.

762
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:41,750
If I were to lose you too,

763
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,880
I think I'd be really sad.

764
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:48,760
I mean that.

765
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:09,910
I am

766
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:12,870
always

767
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:15,000
near you.

768
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,580
Whether I'm here in Paju or a crime scene,

769
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:24,130
I'm close enough
that I can come running whenever you call.

770
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,340
Did you know?

771
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:30,510
You're the only woman in my life.

772
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:34,350
It's true.

773
01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:36,930
Now my mom's gone.

774
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:15,930
I love you.

775
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:21,480
Me too.

776
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:33,870
Where are the security cameras?

777
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:35,910
There, there and...

778
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,410
<i>Code Zero, Code Zero.</i>

779
01:04:38,410 --> 01:04:41,790
<i>Someone posted a notice of a future
sexual assault on social media.</i>

780
01:04:45,710 --> 01:04:48,340
It says a schoolgirl
leaving Mahyeon High School

781
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:51,300
will be kidnapped and sexually assaulted.

782
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:54,970
We're off on patrol.

783
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,010
Those patrolling the area...

784
01:04:58,930 --> 01:05:01,480
Take a break. You said you feel sick.
You don't look well.

785
01:05:04,310 --> 01:05:08,320
Those patrolling the area,
convene at Mahyeon High School.

786
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:09,780
Code Zero, Code Zero.

787
01:05:10,070 --> 01:05:12,280
Someone posted of a future
sexual assault on social media.

788
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:15,530
It says a schoolgirl
leaving Mahyeon High School

789
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:18,950
will be kidnapped and sexually assaulted.

790
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:22,000
Those patrolling the area,
convene at Mahyeon High School.

791
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:23,370
Code Zero, Code Zero.

792
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:24,750
Patrol 20, Patrol 20.

793
01:05:24,830 --> 01:05:27,460
We'll respond to the Mahyeon High
sexual assault.

794
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:28,920
Heading over right now.

795
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:31,260
<i>Patrol 24, Patrol 24.</i>

796
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:33,510
We'll respond to the Mahyeon High
sexual assault.

797
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:35,300
Heading to Mahyeon High. Last call.

798
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:36,510
Patrol 23, Patrol 23.

799
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,760
We'll respond to the Mahyeon High
sexual assault.

800
01:05:38,850 --> 01:05:40,020
Heading over right now.

801
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,440
A school is the one place I hate to go to.

802
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:47,520
It happened a long time ago,

803
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:49,020
but once...

804
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:52,030
In the trash of a girls'
high school toilet,

805
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,780
we found a newborn
a student had given birth to.

806
01:05:57,530 --> 01:05:59,200
That traumatized me.

807
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:03,460
I shudder when I think of schools.

808
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:14,380
We have nothing better to do.

809
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:16,890
This is newsworthy.

810
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:18,180
That's enough.

811
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:20,260
We have so much to do.

812
01:06:21,470 --> 01:06:23,520
There's a sexual assault case
at Mahyeon High.

813
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:26,020
There's not a case. There was a warning.

814
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:27,270
It's the same thing.

815
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:29,060
Don't we have guts?

816
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:32,320
Why should we protect the family

817
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,190
of a rapist and murderer?

818
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:38,410
They're being harassed by their neighbors?
Then tell them to move.

819
01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:40,080
They got wearable devices.

820
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:42,950
Why should we waste

821
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:45,290
taxpayers' money to patrol their house?

822
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:48,290
-We even filled our tanks--
-Gosh, you don't stop, do you?

823
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,380
Damn it.

824
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:00,010
I'd do that if I lived here.

825
01:07:01,010 --> 01:07:03,680
What's wrong with throwing trash
and spray-painting?

826
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:07,060
A girl died,
and six other girls were raped.

827
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:10,770
-Raping them because he was frustrated--
- Sexual assault.

828
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,360
Murder. Did his kids do it?

829
01:07:20,530 --> 01:07:23,540
They put their house and store
on the market, so they can move.

830
01:07:26,290 --> 01:07:27,750
The wife's mother

831
01:07:27,830 --> 01:07:30,630
won't take them in
because the kids are of his blood.

832
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:35,090
The wife's not eating
and won't leave the store.

833
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:37,630
Those poor kids.

834
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:42,010
See the scratches on their faces?
It must be from the neighborhood kids.

835
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:44,930
Why don't you tell them

836
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:46,520
what you just said to me?

837
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:54,820
Fine, we'll go by the book.

838
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:01,110
We'll patrol the area

839
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,700
and then head to Mahyeon High.

840
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,710
MURDERER! LEAVE
OR YOU'LL SUFFER THE SAME FATE

841
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,710
Kids, that's dirty.

842
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:15,710
Don't touch it. Stop.

843
01:08:18,590 --> 01:08:19,800
What are you looking for?

844
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:23,640
Mom threw away the doll
my dad bought for me.

845
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,560
My robot too.

846
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:28,560
A doll and a robot?

847
01:08:35,610 --> 01:08:38,400
MURDERER! LEAVE
OR YOU'LL SUFFER THE SAME FATE

848
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:42,530
-Their dad's a murderer.
-Their dad's a murderer.

849
01:08:42,610 --> 01:08:44,160
-He's a bad man.
-He's a bad man.

850
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:49,870
Do it again and I'll arrest you.

851
01:08:57,250 --> 01:08:59,590
Tell me what the doll looks like.

852
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:00,840
Is it a girl?

853
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:07,890
Are you looking for this?

854
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:09,180
Yes.

855
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:22,280
I'll help you look.

856
01:09:28,370 --> 01:09:30,370
Where could the doll be?

857
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:42,720
-My God.
-Thank you for your help.

858
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,590
Are you kidding me?

859
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:46,390
Parents, please.

860
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,560
Why did this have to happen on a day

861
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:52,810
of a PTA meeting?

862
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:54,810
Captain, what should we do?

863
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:57,440
Are all the students accounted for?

864
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,070
Yes, the teachers are checking.

865
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:00,650
Now, we wait.

866
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:04,450
Teachers without classes
will gather at the teachers' room

867
01:10:04,530 --> 01:10:06,240
and make sure no one leaves the school.

868
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:07,570
Yes, ma'am.

869
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:14,580
Detective Jang,

870
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:17,130
did we get the warrant
to track the IP address?

871
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:21,250
Put Prosecutor Kim on the phone.

872
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:23,630
Where's my warrant?

873
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:27,300
What do you mean it's not enough?

874
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:29,430
What more do you need?

875
01:10:29,970 --> 01:10:32,350
Do you need definitive proof
that a girl was raped or killed?

876
01:10:32,430 --> 01:10:33,520
Is that what you need?

877
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:39,270
This is why I can't accept the fact that
only the prosecution can issue warrants.

878
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:40,730
Mr. Kim.

879
01:10:41,190 --> 01:10:43,820
You're new on the job,
so you don't know better.

880
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:47,320
Meanwhile, I do, so you listen to me.

881
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:49,870
Give me my warrant!

882
01:10:55,330 --> 01:10:57,670
Potential Rape Case at Mahyeon High.

883
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:59,500
Aiding officers, be advised.

884
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:02,550
<i>I have asked to track
the culprit's IP address.</i>

885
01:11:02,670 --> 01:11:05,880
<i>We will provide protection
until the threat is eliminated.</i>

886
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:09,470
