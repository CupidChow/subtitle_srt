1
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,870
Let's go out to eat.

2
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,340
I'll buy you your favorite food, pizza.

3
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,840
I'm not hungry.

4
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,800
Ju-yeon.

5
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,350
If you don't come, I'll go by myself.

6
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,010
Honey.

7
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,390
Honey, honey!

8
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,230
Honey.

9
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,270
Honey, wake up! Honey!

10
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,270
What did you just do?

11
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,860
My wife is pregnant!

12
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,190
Honey, wake up.

13
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,070
Our poor baby...

14
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:12,540
Honey, wake up! Honey!

15
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,580
Excuse me, sir.

16
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,380
Honey...

17
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,420
Calling in from a restaurant
at Yeonhui-ro 178.

18
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,010
A pregnant woman in her 40s has collapsed

19
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,930
after being shot
by an officer's taser gun.

20
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,100
She's bleeding from her head.

21
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,020
And she's unconscious.

22
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,560
Send paramedics.
Send paramedics to the site.

23
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,600
A restaurant on the underground level
at Yeonhui-ro 178.

24
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,520
A pregnant woman in her 40s has collapsed

25
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,400
after being shot
by an officer's taser gun.

26
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:55,200
EPISODE 6

27
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,840
Honey, please open your eyes.

28
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,510
Honey... Wake up, please.

29
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,050
I'm sorry about everything.

30
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,380
Open your eyes, honey.

31
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,640
Honey, please wake up.

32
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,270
I'm sorry.

33
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,310
Honey, I'm sorry.

34
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,970
What is going on?

35
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,270
The mom insisted on raising the kid
no matter what.

36
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,640
Why does she want to send him
to a facility suddenly?

37
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,560
She said

38
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,060
that she wants to see her son
smiling like he did

39
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,570
in the video you sent.

40
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,440
That's how all moms are.

41
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,410
This is all thanks to you.

42
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,120
Anyway, thanks.

43
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,660
The place where the illegal prostitution
took place is under his name.

44
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,420
He's a homeless man
who's been in and out of prison

45
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,210
for dine and dash, drunken rampage,

46
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,460
and stealing things
from convenience stores.

47
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,340
They're just using his name.

48
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,380
The boss is someone else.

49
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,630
Last month in Jang-dong,
where Lieutenant Oh used to work,

50
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,510
they found another place that seems to
have been used for illegal prostitution.

51
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,560
It's also registered as a corporate office
under a homeless man's name.

52
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,520
The station in that precinct
is trying to track him down.

53
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,270
Lieutenant Lee Ju-yeong,
who was under Lieutenant Oh, is in charge.

54
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,440
Ju-yeong is in charge of it?

55
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,570
-Work with that team.
-Yes, ma'am.

56
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,870
She's from Cambodia.

57
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,950
I got it from the Immigration Office.

58
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,130
It's the same person.

59
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,310
Jeez, that son of a bitch.

60
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,600
How can he be that calm

61
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,190
after doing something like that
to a woman?

62
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,280
We must track down that bastard.

63
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,180
<i>Ju-yeon! Take it from them!</i>

64
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,600
<i>Run!</i>

65
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,350
<i>Ju-yeon,
look into the opposite team's eyes.</i>

66
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,770
<i>Ju-yeon, tackle! Tackle him!</i>

67
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,610
So? Where's Jeong-o now?

68
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,500
All right, then. I'll be in soon.

69
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,340
-Is there a new case?
-Let's go back to the station.

70
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,850
Jeong-o shot a pregnant woman
with a taser gun.

71
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,020
The woman is at a hospital,
but she's unconscious.

72
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,820
Honey.

73
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
Honey...

74
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,200
Please open your eyes.

75
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,830
Honey!

76
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,420
-Please...
-You cannot go in, sir.

77
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,500
OPERATING ROOM

78
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,220
Hey.

79
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,140
What were you doing when she shot her?

80
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,350
She shouldn't have done anything.

81
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,600
She was overstepping her boundaries.

82
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,790
Taxi!

83
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,220
Check firearm.

84
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,270
Check firearm.

85
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,230
-One blank, three live. All good.
-Check firearm.

86
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,270
Checking firearm.
One blank, three live. All good.

87
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,320
One blank, three live. All good.

88
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,780
Hey, let's be honest here.

89
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,740
Did I shoot that woman?

90
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,580
You stupid pigs shot her.

91
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,830
Who shot her with a gun?

92
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,670
It was a taser gun.

93
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,210
Besides, am I investigating
who shot the taser gun?

94
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,170
I'm investigating your assault case.

95
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,510
-At the bar, who first...
-Officer.

96
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,310
I don't know about the second time,
but that old douchebag

97
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,520
punched my boyfriend first.

98
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,230
Watch the security footage.

99
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,810
I'll sue him as well as you cops.

100
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,530
All of you guys, including that jerk
and his wife, come from nothing.

101
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,490
Is that why you guys are ganging up on me?

102
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,660
Know your place.

103
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,700
Do you even know who my father is? Do you?

104
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,710
<i>The wife, who was shot by the taser gun,</i>

105
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,380
<i>got a 7cm-long cut
on the back of her head when she fell</i>

106
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,540
<i>because her head hit a cup on the floor.</i>

107
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,090
<i>The surgery just finished.</i>

108
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,560
Dress the wounds
on Jeong-o's hand and face.

109
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,930
<i>She's pregnant.
She can't go under anesthesia.</i>

110
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:08,090
<i>That's why they did it
without anesthetics.</i>

111
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,970
<i>She woke up,
but her heart rate is unstable.</i>

112
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:15,810
<i>And I heard her husband is flipping out
about us shooting a pregnant woman</i>

113
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,940
<i>and saying he'll sue Jeong-o
for excessive use of force.</i>

114
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,860
<i>At the moment, we don't know
whether the baby is okay or not.</i>

115
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,490
Why did Jeong-o shoot that woman
with her taser gun?

116
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:29,110
-Didn't she know the protocol?
-You can't tell that she's pregnant

117
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,490
unless the husband tells you.

118
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,870
I heard that a pregnancy test
was found at the scene.

119
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,910
That means they don't know
if she's pregnant.

120
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,380
They said she took a test
and bought another just to make sure.

121
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,710
It's their third child.

122
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,670
Her ob-gyn had left the clinic
for the day but is on the way

123
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,800
to the hospital now,
so we'll find out soon.

124
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,390
I hope she has at least passed
her first trimester.

125
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,810
If not,
the electric shock can be dangerous.

126
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,430
I checked the security footage at the bar,

127
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:01,650
and Jeong-o hit the pregnant lady
on the shoulder.

128
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,110
I think she was aiming for her shoulder,
following protocol, but missed.

129
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,660
The lady falling on her head
was an accident.

130
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,080
-The police isn't responsible for that.
-Ho-cheol dying was an accident,

131
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,500
but Internal Affairs
still held me responsible.

132
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,830
Once a complaint is made
and they investigate,

133
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,080
they won't take our side.

134
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,300
When Jeong-o fired the taser,
she didn't warn the lady,

135
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,260
although it's not protocol.

136
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,600
Still,
it's only right that she give a warning.

137
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,430
Haven't I told you enough?

138
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,770
When something happens,
no one will be on our side.

139
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,150
Shit.

140
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,110
What are we supposed to do then?

141
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,650
How can we do that in an emergency?

142
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,150
What if someone ends up dying
because of that?

143
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,530
The warning wasn't protocol,

144
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,530
but shooting her shoulder,

145
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,200
will become an issue.

146
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,620
People don't stand still.

147
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,870
How can we hit a moving target perfectly?

148
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,870
Even we can't do that.

149
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,630
If Jeong-o

150
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,460
hadn't used her taser,

151
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,210
it could've been murder
or attempted murder.

152
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,760
If the police is responsible

153
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,050
for someone falling

154
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,640
and for not recognizing
a barely pregnant woman,

155
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,560
who would want to become an officer?

156
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,680
The problem is this.

157
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,770
Internal Affairs only care about

158
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,940
prior warnings and good aim.

159
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,530
It's not just Jeong-o on the line here.

160
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,070
The whole division is at stake.

161
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,610
If the husband sues--

162
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,570
We'll counter with OJ
and assault of an officer.

163
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,620
We'll tackle it head-on.

164
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
This means...

165
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,590
a complaint has already been made.

166
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,800
In this case,
Jeong-o will be investigated.

167
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,800
Yang-chon, check if
Jeong-o knew the protocol

168
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,470
even though she didn't say a warning.

169
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:00,020
Gyeong-mo, try and calm the husband down

170
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,850
even if that means picking a fight.

171
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,520
God damn it.

172
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:05,850
Yes, Captain Kim.

173
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,270
What?

174
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,820
How did I train my officers?

175
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:14,240
Would you rather she
let the lady kill the man?

176
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,280
She did well by using her taser!

177
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,580
How dare you say such a thing?

178
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,950
Where the hell are you?

179
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,870
Yang-chon, I'll head to the hospital too.

180
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,840
I just hope that the baby's all right.

181
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,680
How's the lady doing?

182
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,980
What about her baby?

183
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,270
We don't know yet.

184
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,280
Could they both die? The mom and the baby?

185
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,870
You did nothing wrong.

186
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,000
You followed protocol.

187
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,960
You only hit the shoulder with your taser
while aiming for her arm.

188
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,340
No, that's not true.

189
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,800
Protocol didn't come to mind
at that moment.

190
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,300
My mind went blank.

191
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,640
It was just reflex.

192
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,980
I just pulled the trigger.

193
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,650
Don't say that when
Internal Affairs questions you.

194
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,450
They'll take away your badge.

195
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,330
What shouldn't she say
to Internal Affairs?

196
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,630
Tomorrow morning, when Internal Affairs
contacts you and you get questioned,

197
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,090
don't say that you forgot protocol.

198
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,970
You weren't confused.

199
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,140
You had a sense of duty
and followed protocol

200
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:09,140
by aiming at the lady's arm.

201
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,940
It just hit her shoulder instead.

202
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,230
You did nothing wrong.

203
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,400
That

204
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,360
is a lie.

205
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,240
It doesn't have to be.

206
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,570
Sometimes,
the facts matter more than the truth.

207
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,080
So I should forget about the process,

208
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,420
and be relieved that
the outcome wasn't bad?

209
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,130
How's that worse than

210
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,050
you blaming yourself?

211
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,090
Are you willing to give up your badge?

212
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:49,770
Well, that might not be so bad.

213
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,860
If you do,

214
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,730
other less talented
and less experienced rookies,

215
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:00,240
who forget protocol in an emergency,
will take your place.

216
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,370
I don't think

217
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,370
I'm qualified to be a good cop.

218
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,340
What is a good cop anyway?

219
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,880
To be honest,

220
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,010
I still don't know what it means
to be a good cop.

221
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,140
However,

222
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,850
I want you,

223
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:32,190
who actually questions herself about

224
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,060
what a good cop is,

225
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,320
to grow a bit more
while you're stationed here.

226
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,410
Yeom Sang-su.

227
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,120
Take Jeong-o home.

228
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:50,160
Jeong-o's worried about the baby,
so she wants to go to the hospital.

229
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,160
Don't go.

230
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,320
So you're at the hospital. How's the baby?

231
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,070
What did the ob-gyn say?

232
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:51,430
Sang-su told me to stay by your side.

233
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,070
Do you want to trade places?

234
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,120
I'm kidding.

235
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,350
-Where are you going?
-The hospital.

236
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,980
Yang-chon told you not to go.

237
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,100
If you do, the husband...

238
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,110
He'll eat me alive.

239
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,650
I'm going to let him do whatever he wants.

240
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,110
-What did you do wrong?
- What I need

241
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,280
isn't your worries or consolations.

242
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,120
I need to know how
the baby and mother are.

243
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,830
Let's go together.

244
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,090
Where are you guys going?

245
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,430
Hey!

246
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,700
That fucking bitch!

247
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:32,620
How dare you show yourself. How dare you!

248
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,160
How dare you come here?

249
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,660
-Sir, calm down!
-Let go!

250
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,000
That bitch! I'll kill her!

251
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,330
Let go!

252
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,460
-Let go of me!
-Sir, please.

253
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,880
-Please calm down.
-Let go!

254
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,170
Your wife and baby are fine.

255
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,050
You'll end up collapsing too.

256
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,220
You! It's your fault!

257
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,760
Because of you,
my wife and baby almost died.

258
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,010
-It's your fault!
-Sir, please.

259
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,260
Let go!

260
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,310
Let go of me. Let go!

261
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,270
Let go, you bastards!

262
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,200
Jeong-o, did you hear that?

263
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,410
You heard what they all said, right?

264
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,670
The mother and baby are fine.

265
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,590
You heard them, right?

266
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,460
Okay.

267
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,760
I'm on my way now.

268
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,010
I'm coming to deliver it.

269
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,600
<i>Nam-il has no loyalty whatsoever.</i>

270
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,730
How could he just go home?

271
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,230
He's acting like it isn't his problem.

272
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:30,070
What a shrewd bastard.

273
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,320
Where's Myeong-ho?

274
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,820
I think he likes Jeong-o.

275
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,200
Is he over Hyeon-su, then?

276
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,580
It's a good thing if he is.

277
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,200
Seriously?

278
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:41,330
If not,

279
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:44,540
why would he offer to take Jeong-o home
when she lives near Sang-su?

280
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,040
What's wrong with him liking Jeong-o?

281
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,250
The bigger issue here
is that you're after my wife.

282
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,550
You should've made her happy.

283
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:56,970
Guys, guys.

284
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,970
Deal with your love triangle in private.

285
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:03,480
Why do they keep volunteering information

286
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,060
when we're not interested, right?

287
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,770
Why is my poop always bloody?

288
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,320
-Don't drink so much.
-See a doctor.

289
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,030
Or get hemorrhoid surgery.

290
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,110
You jerks.

291
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,660
The married couple from today.

292
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,530
They seemed really poor.

293
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,620
What'll they do when the young couple

294
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,160
they fought with sues them?

295
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,790
The man could be charged for assault

296
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,580
and the pregnant wife could be fined for

297
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,460
criminal attempt at bodily harm.

298
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,840
I know.

299
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:35,220
They couldn't even pay
for the cost of the emergency room.

300
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,050
Yang-chon, me, Gyeong-mo, Myeong-ho,
and a few others

301
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,510
paid for the cost.

302
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,260
Jong-min, go ahead.

303
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,260
Yes, sir.

304
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,440
Let's see.

305
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,110
Ta-da.

306
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,530
This security footage shows

307
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,780
the young couple leaving the restaurant

308
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,830
after the first incident,

309
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,660
getting into their luxury car

310
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,290
and driving drunk for about 100m.

311
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:12,090
Then the man realizes
he left his phone behind.

312
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:14,800
He gets out of the car
and goes back inside.

313
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,220
That was his mistake.

314
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,640
Won-u and Seung-jae found this footage.

315
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,890
Gosh, that scumbag.

316
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,140
As soon as he saw this,

317
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,810
the jerk who had been screaming,

318
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:30,810
suddenly changed his tune saying
his dad would kill him.

319
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,400
He started to beg profusely.

320
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,030
His dad said

321
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,530
if he drove drunk,

322
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,320
he'd take his son's luxury car.

323
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,530
So I told Jong-min to offer him a deal.

324
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,740
We'll turn a blind eye on
the drunk-driving incidence

325
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,870
if he won't sue the man for assault.

326
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,210
Furthermore, the first assault
led to the second assault

327
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,710
where the wife got tasered

328
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,420
and hurt her head.

329
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,380
I asked him to show some mercy.

330
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,260
He donated five million won.

331
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:00,090
To the poor husband.

332
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,050
He also said that

333
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:04,300
the wife's grievous bodily harm charge
was his fault.

334
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,760
So he wrote a plea.

335
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,440
Great job!

336
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,820
The superior and his subordinates
are just the same.

337
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,900
Do cops offer deals? We follow the law.

338
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,530
-You be the good cop.
-You do that.

339
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,200
-You follow the law.
-You do that if you want.

340
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,620
Eat your food.

341
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:30,000
Han-sol, will Jeong-o and Nam-il
be okay at Internal Affairs tomorrow?

342
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,420
The fact that she hit her shoulder
worries me.

343
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,630
It could've hit her face or neck.

344
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:38,250
She'll lose her job
if that becomes a problem.

345
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,550
Why would that be a problem?

346
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:42,300
Jeong-o knew the manual and stuck to it.

347
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,840
Right, Yang-chon?

348
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,510
I need to pee.

349
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,430
-Not while we're eating.
-That's gross.

350
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,310
He's so disgusting.

351
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:57,520
I just pooped. This is killing me.

352
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,940
-Will you stop drinking?
-Han-sol.

353
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:02,820
You stunk up the place,
and we're trying to eat.

354
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:15,380
It's great that the mom and baby are okay.

355
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,540
Now I can finally relax.

356
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,720
Smile.

357
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,060
-Have some coffee before you go.
-Thanks.

358
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:45,450
It's nice here.

359
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,490
Hey, aren't you going home?

360
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,960
It's perfect. Not too sweet.

361
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,840
I'll sleep here tonight. My mom's asleep.

362
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,680
I'll wake her up if I go in.

363
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,350
Is it okay if I sleep in the living room?
I should wash my face.

364
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,730
You'll leave soon, right?

365
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:16,480
I'm tired and want to sleep.

366
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:17,810
Goodbye.

367
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:31,870
I'm sorry.

368
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:35,160
No one becomes a cop
without getting into trouble.

369
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:40,250
I somehow ended up becoming a cop,

370
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,920
but since I am one now,

371
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:47,380
I wanted to become a capable one.

372
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,770
Get some sleep.

373
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,940
What you need right now

374
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,980
is sleep.

375
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,770
You just touched her.

376
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,940
She's a female subordinate.
You shouldn't do that.

377
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,570
Good luck at Internal Affairs.

378
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,620
Okay.

379
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,030
Hey, do you like Jeong-o?

380
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:57,250
You lost to Myeong-ho.

381
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:24,810
Dad.

382
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,980
Dad.

383
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:34,530
Why are you flying a kite?

384
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:44,500
I go to court today.

385
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,920
Jang-mi wants a divorce.

386
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,970
I don't want one,

387
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,760
but she does.

388
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,810
Shall I say no?

389
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,770
I could win in court.

390
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,610
Tell me.

391
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:07,690
Shall we go to court?

392
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,450
What did you ever do for her

393
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,820
that you wouldn't divorce her
when she asked?

394
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,040
Oh, shit.

395
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,500
Too bad.

396
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,380
It got away.

397
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,590
You and I are both like a kite
with its string cut off.

398
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,530
Did you even like Mom?

399
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,040
You used to always beat her up.

400
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,620
You...

401
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:10,090
You still have a shot. It's not over yet.

402
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,100
Is it over for you?

403
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,100
Whether Mom can hear or not,

404
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,020
say you're sorry every day.

405
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,690
I'll watch and see if you repent.

406
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,790
I had to make a detour
due to the illegally parked cars...

407
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:53,630
I'll do the briefing.
Explain clearly when they question you.

408
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:01,640
Don't change your words.
No matter what the investigator asks you,

409
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,180
just keep saying
that you followed the manual.

410
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,350
Why did you...

411
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:14,650
I told you not to do anything on your own
and just stand guard.

412
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:17,200
Why did you have to act up like that
and get us in this mess?

413
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,120
Because you're a woman...

414
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:27,870
It's true. You are.

415
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,420
If you quit the force,

416
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:32,290
you just lose your job.

417
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,750
But I have a wife and a kid.

418
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:37,300
I have a family to support, okay?

419
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,720
Come in.

420
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:48,180
<i>The situation when Officer Han Jeong-o
used her taser gun</i>

421
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,890
was clearly an emergency situation.

422
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,560
The statement made by the restaurant owner
who was at the scene,

423
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:55,270
and the security camera footage
confirm it.

424
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:04,830
I'm asking you a question.

425
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:08,790
Did you remember the details
of the crime scene response guidelines?

426
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,330
If you remembered it,

427
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,290
why didn't you shoot her
in the arm or leg muscles?

428
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,380
Had you not been careful,
she could've been shot

429
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,420
in a fatal spot
like the neck, heart, or face.

430
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,180
Why did you shoot her
right on her shoulder?

431
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:24,800
Officer Han.

432
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:27,930
Just come clean.
You didn't know the protocol, right?

433
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,400
Answer the question.

434
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,110
<i>Sometimes,
the facts matter more than the truth.</i>

435
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:42,610
<i>Are you willing to give up your badge?</i>

436
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,240
Answer the question.

437
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,370
Did you know the protocol or not?

438
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,550
DROP OFF APPLICATIONS
FOR DIVORCE BY AGREEMENT

439
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,930
I tried to tie it myself, but I couldn't.

440
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,520
I'm so used to wearing ties
that were already tied.

441
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,940
We're here to get a divorce.
Why are you even wearing a tie?

442
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,190
Don't you want your ex-husband
to be presentable?

443
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,450
You look good.

444
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:27,370
I'm going to...

445
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,120
make you regret leaving me
for the rest of your life.

446
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:35,330
"Please come back to me."
I'm going to make you beg me.

447
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,750
You just watch.
I'll be sure to make it happen.

448
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,590
This is why I liked you.

449
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:47,090
I'm going to visit whenever I want

450
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,970
to see the kids.

451
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,470
Why didn't you do that
when we were together?

452
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:54,060
I'll send you 70 percent of my pay
every month.

453
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:55,310
Thank you.

454
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,360
Can't we rethink this?

455
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:01,650
This is what you hate, isn't it? Okay.

456
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:07,820
You're really mean.

457
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,660
I lived with you for over 20 years,

458
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:13,250
and we even have two kids.

459
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:16,210
You should've at least...

460
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,670
Before you threw the bomb at me,

461
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:21,250
you should've at least warned me
to be careful

462
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,840
if I didn't want a divorce.

463
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,220
Even we cops warn criminals
before we shoot them.

464
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,260
"Freeze, or I'll shoot you.

465
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,680
You'll be shot if you act up."
We give three warnings.

466
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:32,390
That's protocol.

467
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:45,030
We're that considerate to criminals,

468
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,490
but we've been sleeping in the same bed,

469
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,660
and we have kids together.
Don't you think I deserve

470
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,160
at least three warnings?

471
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,580
"I'm having a hard time looking after
our kids and parents. Help me.

472
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,460
I'll divorce you if you keep that up.

473
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,130
I'm lonely and stressed."
Don't you think I should've been warned?

474
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,130
How can you surprise me like this?

475
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,180
I still love you so much,

476
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:13,060
but you were like, "Let's get divorced.
I hate you. I can't stand you."

477
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,310
And we're at court now.

478
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,180
Do you think it's fair?

479
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:21,060
-It's time now.
-Okay!

480
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,820
Are you going to keep annoying me?

481
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,400
We just

482
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,610
won't sleep together from now on.

483
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:32,070
We'll keep seeing each other,

484
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,490
but not every day, that's all.

485
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:37,370
I'll try my best

486
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,420
to make you love me again.

487
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,170
Let's go in.

488
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:01,020
We're in agreement,

489
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,270
and I'll give my wife
everything she wants.

490
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,780
Our son is a minor,
but he understands the situation.

491
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,650
Can we shorten
the consideration period to a month?

492
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,700
If you have kids,
it has to be three months.

493
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,070
Just wait three months.

494
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,200
Then, what's next?

495
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:43,060
Let's take a break.

496
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,400
Hey, let's take a quick break.

497
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:55,530
Take a break. Don't your arms hurt?

498
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,490
Right now, I need a skill.

499
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,540
A skill that will help me
to remember protocol in any situation

500
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:03,000
and shoot a moving target
in the arm or leg

501
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,750
whether it's a taser gun or a real gun.

502
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,260
I lied to Internal Affairs.

503
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:14,260
I had completely

504
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,680
forgotten the guidelines in the manual,

505
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,390
but I told them that I did what I did,

506
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:23,270
knowing every line in the manual.

507
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,400
I don't want to have to lie like that
ever again.

508
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,120
Do you still think
I suck at driving and parking?

509
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,540
Look at the parking line.

510
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:39,140
Check the space in between.

511
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:48,310
You drive too roughly.

512
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,480
That driver won't
even be able to open the door.

513
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,570
Do you call this parking?

514
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,570
You said you've been
driving for three years.

515
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,360
Get out!

516
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:05,500
This isn't bad for driving at that speed.

517
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:34,570
This is called parking.

518
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,610
What does this have to do
with our duties as police officers?

519
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:43,280
Why is this so important?

520
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:46,660
Why do I have to be here before my shift
and drive around our district?

521
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:48,540
Then what's important to you?

522
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,790
Cleaning up drunk people's vomit?

523
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:53,380
Cleaning up a disabled man's piss?

524
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,960
If driving and parking isn't important,
what is?

525
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,800
Homicides.

526
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,010
Do homicides only have perpetrators?

527
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:02,390
What about the victims?

528
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:04,970
How can a cop wish for victims?

529
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,470
You immature fool.

530
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,770
I'm just saying I want to catch criminals.

531
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,730
I don't want to be like you

532
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:14,820
and spend the rest of my life
at a patrol division where it's safe.

533
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,400
I want to be like Myeong-ho and Yang-chon.

534
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,570
I want to go to the Violent Crime Unit,
catch criminals,

535
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:22,410
and get a lot of awards.

536
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,080
I know you don't like me

537
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:28,910
because I'm old.

538
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:42,630
But

539
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,260
the others don't like you
because you're a woman.

540
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:47,430
I know that.

541
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:49,850
Everyone dislikes you and me.

542
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:53,100
That's why we ended up with
each other as partners.

543
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,280
<i>That old lady quit work this morning.</i>

544
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,950
She quit this morning?

545
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,460
Her daughter has
myasthenia gravis or something.

546
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,750
Since a few years ago,
she can only move her mouth and hands,

547
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,500
so she quit to care for her.

548
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,760
Her daughter was sick?

549
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,880
She was fine as a kid.

550
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:26,850
Something terrible
happened to the kid 20 years ago--

551
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:28,510
Why would you mention that?

552
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,680
It has nothing to do with her illness.

553
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,060
The old woman has a bit of dementia.

554
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:38,860
I think that's harder on her
than taking care of her daughter.

555
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,650
Who are you?

556
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,950
That's why she didn't recognize me.

557
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,790
She's really strange.

558
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,630
She shouldn't have bought us those drinks

559
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,920
or taken the cleaning supplies.

560
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,590
Cresol, hydrochloric acid, bleach.

561
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:04,800
She took all sorts of things.

562
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,140
She's so stingy.

563
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:09,640
I know. Why did she take all that?

564
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:12,220
She should've taken her daughter's photo.

565
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:14,140
You're right.

566
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:27,110
Enjoy your meal and use this.

567
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,530
Sure, thanks.

568
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:29,490
Thank you.

569
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:32,830
Try this.

570
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:45,050
Hey, Cheol-min! Get down from there!

571
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:51,600
Cheol-min.

572
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,850
It's dangerous. Come down.

573
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:55,390
-Cheol-min.
-Come down.

574
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,060
-Come down.
-Let's talk down here.

575
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,060
Cheol-min.

576
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,320
-Isn't that dangerous?
-Everyone quiet.

577
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:07,950
Come down, seriously.

578
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:09,110
They're quiet now.

579
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,820
Well done, ma'am.

580
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:13,580
The suicide attempter
is an agitated state.

581
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:16,040
<i>We can't irritate him, so you stay outside</i>

582
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,040
and send everyone away.

583
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,000
Okay.

584
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,630
Kids, go inside.

585
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:22,960
Can you take everyone inside?

586
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:24,760
<i>I did as you said.</i>

587
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,010
You need to open the school gates wide

588
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:28,800
so we can drive inside.

589
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,470
<i>Okay, I'll do that.</i>

590
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,850
<i>Lieutenant Oh, we'll divide duties.</i>

591
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:37,940
<i>You and Officer Yeom
will go up on the roof.</i>

592
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:40,810
<i>Seung-jae and I
will help the paramedics with the mat.</i>

593
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:41,730
Roger that.

594
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,690
We're almost there.

595
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:45,780
Sirens off.

596
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:49,820
<i>The student has a panic disorder.</i>

597
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:52,620
<i>Keep that in mind,
and as soon as you arrive at the scene,</i>

598
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:55,410
<i>Lieutenant Oh and Officer Yeom
will run up onto the roof.</i>

599
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:57,960
Roger that. Oh
Yang-chon and Yeom Sang-su will go up.

600
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:17,600
SPECIAL RESCUE UNIT

601
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:21,600
YANGYOUNG HIGH SCHOOL

602
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:29,650
<i>We have arrived on scene.</i>

603
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,180
Who is it? Who's trying to jump?

604
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,130
Once we're on the roof,

605
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:32,300
we'll tie this
to the left and right of the door.

606
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:34,800
I'll go left, you go right.

607
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:37,180
Okay, you go left, I'll go right.

608
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:39,720
Tie the rope and wait for my instructions.

609
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:41,600
Try not to irritate the boy.

610
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,190
Move as quickly as possible.

611
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:45,440
Isn't it safe once the air mat
is in place?

612
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,810
Who says
he'll fall safely onto the ground?

613
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:50,230
I saw someone crack his skull

614
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,190
on the wall on the way down.

615
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:55,910
Stay alert.

616
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:57,870
Yes, sir.

617
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:30,980
I'm playing it just in case.

618
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,860
Let's all hope that

619
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,780
this music buys us some time.

620
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,760
At the count of five,
we both run towards him.

621
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:55,840
Do as I told you. Do you remember?

622
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:00,260
One, two...

623
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:02,680
He's moving.

624
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:07,020
-What's he doing?
-Oh, no.

625
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,810
Run.

626
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,850
Is someone home?

627
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,860
Is anybody home?

628
00:48:56,990 --> 00:48:58,320
It's the police.

629
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,450
Excuse me.

630
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,950
Is anyone home?

631
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:04,990
Please open the door.

632
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,080
I didn't call the police.

633
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,660
<i>We got a report.</i>

634
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,920
Did you hear fighting or a scream
about ten minutes ago?

635
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,340
I'm not sure.

636
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:23,470
Do you think
this was another false report?

637
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,970
You said it was a text message.

638
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:28,140
-I have no idea.
-Damn it.

639
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:32,440
I knocked on seven doors,

640
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,480
and no one opened them.

641
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:38,280
Assistant Chief, we searched the area.

642
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:40,860
<i>It's densely populated,
so it's hard to locate the caller.</i>

643
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:44,160
<i>Assistant Chief,
could it be a false report or a mistake?</i>

644
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:46,580
<i>Since they put emergency call buttons
on apps,</i>

645
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:48,700
false reports went up by 20 percent.

646
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:50,710
I heard that a lot of people

647
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:54,460
misdial their phones
when it's in their pockets.

648
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:56,250
It wasn't a call, it was a text.

649
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:59,420
"Please save my mom."
That's what the text said.

650
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:01,800
We called the number

651
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,430
<i>and the phone was off.</i>

652
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:05,680
That's what's so strange.
It was about someone else.

653
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,510
They asked us to help their mother,

654
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,680
and didn't leave an address
or floor number.

655
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:12,980
That's why they need to let us
be able to identify callers.

656
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:15,150
Not just pinpoint an approximate location.

657
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:17,110
What if someone dies?

658
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:18,610
That's what I'm saying.

659
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:21,190
Whenever we call a service provider,

660
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,160
we should be able to
get information without a warrant.

661
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,410
They're against it because of privacy
and personal information issues,

662
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:28,990
but that happens rarely.

663
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,250
This is about people's lives.

664
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:33,080
"Protecting private details"? What a joke.

665
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:34,960
Damn it.

666
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,380
-Myeong-ho.
<i>-Yes?</i>

667
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:39,460
Whether it's a false report or a mistake,

668
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:41,920
we got a call,
so check the area once more.

669
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:43,260
In case...

670
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:44,930
SSANGHWATANG

671
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:51,430
Sam-bo!

672
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,190
<i>You're at Hongan 3-dong
near Mom's Hand Pharmacy, right?</i>

673
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,940
Yes.

674
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:58,190
Lee Han-soon.

675
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:01,610
Look up a Lee Han-soon in this are for me.

676
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:04,070
She was born in 1981 or 1982.

677
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:06,110
On March 5. Look her up.

678
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,320
LEE HAN-SOON

679
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:10,540
-How do you remember that?
-I'm foggy on the year,

680
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,540
<i>but it's the same day as my daughter.</i>

681
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:15,210
<i>Sam-bo,
didn't you say that Han-soon's mother</i>

682
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:17,130
<i>wasn't at the shelter yesterday?</i>

683
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:19,340
<i>Cresol, hydrochloric acid, bleach.</i>

684
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:21,500
<i>She took all sorts of things.</i>

685
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:24,590
Cleaning products.

686
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:27,810
Years ago,

687
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:30,980
she and her daughter
drank cleaning products.

688
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,140
I found the address.

689
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:34,350
<i>119-1, Hongan 3-dong.</i>

690
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,150
<i>Hongil Villa, basement level one,
unit 102.</i>

691
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:38,270
-She drank cleaning products again!
-Let's go.

692
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:41,740
Hongil Villa, basement level one.

693
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:45,990
Hongil Villa, basement level one!

694
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:47,410
Go to unit 102!

695
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:57,000
There isn't another entry.

696
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:01,880
In 1, 2, 3.

697
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:12,390
Ma'am!

698
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:15,640
Ma'am!

699
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,800
Milk...

700
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,390
I need milk.

701
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:23,880
Lieutenant Lee.

702
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:25,550
Stand back!

703
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,720
Han-soon.

704
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:30,260
Wake up.

705
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:36,730
Milk can't dilute hydrochloric acid.

706
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:39,400
Also,

707
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:41,860
she's already dead.

708
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:01,210
119-1, Hongan 3-dong.

709
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:03,000
Hongil Villa, basement level one,
unit 102.

710
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:06,460
Reporting a possible
mother and daughter suicide.

711
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:10,300
We need detectives and Forensics
at the scene.

712
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:30,240
<i>Please</i>

713
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:34,200
<i>save my mom.</i>

714
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:47,880
Damn it.

715
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:29,940
It wasn't Yang-chon, but me,

716
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,320
<i>who cuffed the student's ankle.</i>

717
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:37,490
<i>At the same moment,
Yang-chon pulled the kid back.</i>

718
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:40,070
<i>I fell back holding the student's ankle,</i>

719
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,660
<i>Yang-chon placed his foot under the head</i>

720
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:45,200
<i>and prevented the student
from breaking his skull,</i>

721
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,640
Sang-su,

722
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:03,350
you saved this kid.

723
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:14,860
That's teamwork for you.

724
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:16,730
It was legendary.

725
00:56:17,530 --> 00:56:20,910
You're right. That was legendary.

726
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:24,450
Why did he try to commit suicide?

727
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,490
He has a severe panic disorder.

728
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:28,960
That's absurd.

729
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,870
You can't die from a panic disorder.
Why would he try to commit suicide?

730
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,460
Maybe he's nuts.

731
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:35,250
-How--
-Don't you say that.

732
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,760
Having seniority doesn't mean
you can say crap like that.

733
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:41,510
Do you know how tough that illness is?

734
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:42,800
Have you suffered from it?

735
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:46,510
You know nothing. People
feel as if they will die out of fear.

736
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,720
It's a really hard disorder.

737
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:50,480
I was just...

738
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,190
Hey. Even if I said something wrong,

739
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:55,570
how can you talk to me like that?

740
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,320
You guys have no respect for your seniors.

741
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:03,160
Respect is only for those who deserve it.

742
00:57:04,490 --> 00:57:06,660
-Don't you agree?
-You were cool.

743
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,370
Be nicer to your mom.

744
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,410
Panic disorders are really scary.

745
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:15,380
I saved someone today.

746
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:17,800
It felt great.

747
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:19,760
Nice!

748
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:22,880
How cute.

749
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,320
Mom, are you still mad?

750
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,320
You wouldn't pick up yesterday.

751
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,860
Please enjoy.

752
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:47,330
You little brat.

753
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:51,830
I didn't pick up because
I was upset, not mad.

754
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,710
You came by for the first time
in ten days,

755
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:55,460
but all you did was throw a tantrum.

756
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:57,590
<i>If you're going to be like that
don't come.</i>

757
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:00,340
I was only saying I was exhausted,

758
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:02,470
but you told me to quit the job.

759
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:05,510
What kind of a mother
would let her daughter

760
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:06,680
keep working for money

761
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,720
<i>when she admitted that it's scary?</i>

762
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,720
<i>I can tell you to endure it
if it's exhausting,</i>

763
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:13,770
<i>but not when it's terrifying.</i>

764
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:17,360
I guess

765
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:19,610
my mom hates that

766
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:22,440
her daughter has a scary job.

767
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:26,910
You and I are both perfectly healthy,

768
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:28,780
so we can make a living doing anything.

769
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:31,240
So if it's too scary--

770
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:32,370
Forget it.

771
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:34,660
I was only whining.

772
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:38,540
Let's go out on patrol.

773
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,460
Mom, I have to go. Bye, I love you.

774
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:47,010
"Love"? As if.

775
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:48,930
Just don't throw tantrums at me.

776
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:00,440
I talked to the lady you tasered.

777
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:02,360
She thanked us.

778
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:05,650
I heard that Captain Eun received a call.

779
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:09,910
She almost hurt someone,

780
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:13,450
so the baby could've been
an offspring of a criminal.

781
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:15,290
Thanks to us...

782
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:19,420
No, thanks to you,
she was able to avoid it.

783
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:21,090
Even the husband's grateful.

784
00:59:27,090 --> 00:59:29,930
She was thinking about an abortion
because it's their third child,

785
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:33,640
but she grew attached
because of this incident.

786
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:37,440
She decided to keep the baby,

787
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:40,270
so she's grateful.

788
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:50,570
Are you still mad that I said something
about you being a woman?

789
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:52,450
I'm sorry about that.

790
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:55,790
It's not about the sexist comment.
I was mad because you said that

791
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:59,500
if I quit the force, I just lose my job.

792
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:02,040
Whereas, you have a wife and a kid

793
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:05,920
and a family to support.

794
01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:12,970
I have a family to take care of too.

795
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:15,180
It's not just me.

796
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:19,440
I'm responsible for my mother,
who suffers from a panic disorder.

797
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:28,780
Do you want this?

798
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:32,110
<i>Parking dispute at
123 Yeonje-gil, Yeonseung Villa.</i>

799
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,990
<i>Patrol car in the vicinity, please report.</i>

800
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:38,830
Patrol 23 reporting.
This is our last call.

801
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:41,120
Chew the gum yourself,

802
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:44,590
and never make another sexist comment
like that again.

803
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:12,570
Assistant Chief Ki said
you should go home.

804
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:21,870
Sam-bo, Assistant Chief Ki
wants to grab drinks with you.

805
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,040
Let's go on our last patrol.

806
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,090
Sam-bo,

807
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:35,220
come on out.

808
01:01:36,350 --> 01:01:38,060
-Hye-ri, you should head home too.
-Yes, sir.

809
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:39,310
Team Two is coming in early.

810
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:50,190
I'll get going then.

811
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:53,900
I'll wait for you downstairs.

812
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:02,180
See?

813
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,560
You could've sorted this out peacefully,

814
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,140
so why make us come down here?

815
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:09,020
Why park in front of my car?

816
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:20,120
Please get in. I'll see you two off.

817
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:24,540
Sergeant, I need to run an errand.
I'm sorry. I'll be right back.

818
01:03:25,330 --> 01:03:27,080
Hey. Jeong-o, wait!

819
01:03:51,310 --> 01:03:53,270
Why should you get out?

820
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:54,940
You idiot.

821
01:03:57,570 --> 01:03:58,740
Help me!

822
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:01,490
Help me!

823
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:07,750
The thing is...

824
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:09,000
We were playing pool

825
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,750
-when he picked a fight.
-Where's the cut?

826
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:12,380
He's not our friend, he's a dick.

827
01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:17,010
I'm just saying that
he used to be our friend.

828
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:19,550
-He isn't now, but--
-He's a dropout.

829
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:21,680
-He's nothing but a thug.
-Shut your mouth.

830
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:23,390
You guys are so noisy.

831
01:04:27,350 --> 01:04:29,020
Two of your teeth are wobbly.

832
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:32,480
Spit on the ground.

833
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:37,780
-Your teeth fell out.
-My legs hurt too.

834
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:40,860
Stand up for me.

835
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:42,110
I told you it hurts!

836
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:43,820
That's him!

837
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:52,040
-Don't bother!
-Let's go and watch.

838
01:04:58,050 --> 01:04:59,510
Damn it.

839
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,510
Why did you fight in the first place?

840
01:05:02,590 --> 01:05:03,680
Here. Get up.

841
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:06,430
Stop whining and stand up.

842
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:07,810
There you go.

843
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:00,730
<i>I won't make a mistake like last time.</i>

844
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:06,910
-<i>Without evidence, we can't arrest anyone.
-It was fun</i>

845
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:09,330
<i>to be on the same team as you.</i>

846
01:06:09,870 --> 01:06:12,160
<i>You should listen to our club's music.</i>

847
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:13,500
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

848
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:15,620
<i>Congratulations on divorcing Yang-chon.</i>

849
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:18,210
<i>Do you think he and Jang-mi
would've been happy together?</i>

850
01:06:18,290 --> 01:06:19,960
<i>He was stabbed by the suspect.</i>

851
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:22,300
<i>Requesting paramedics!</i>

852
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:24,380
<i>Requesting back up from patrol cars
in the vicinity!</i>

853
01:06:27,970 --> 01:06:30,010
