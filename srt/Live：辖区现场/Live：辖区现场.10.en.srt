EPISODE 10

3
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,317
What the hell? Hey!

4
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,736
Hey! Stop right there.

5
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,529
Hey!

6
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,574
Give me back my bag!

7
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,869
Hey! Stop there.

8
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,246
-Hey!
-Why can't she grab it?

9
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,999
Give me back my bag!

10
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,921
Hey, give her purse back.

11
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,423
Song Hye-ri.

12
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,927
You look sexy in plain clothes.

13
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:35,804
Who are you?

14
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,263
Who do you think?

15
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,063
You're Man-yong, aren't you?

16
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:46,898
No.

17
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,744
OLD MENTOR

18
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,260
MY LAST ROOKIE

19
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,057
Hey, take this.

20
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,651
You told my dad, right?

21
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,863
It hurts to get beat up,
doesn't it, old man?

22
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:17,906
Let's go.

23
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:16,881
What?

24
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:18,883
<i>Are you all right?</i>

25
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,427
I was walking on the street,

26
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,388
<i>and I almost got robbed.</i>

27
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,473
<i>But I think it was Man-yong.</i>

28
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,268
Are you okay?

29
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,727
<i>Of course I am.</i>

30
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,690
Did they attack you?

31
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:35,984
No.

32
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,570
-I'm hanging up.
<i>-Lieutenant Lee.</i>

33
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,820
Where's Lee Ju-yeong?

34
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,228
You're here.

35
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,149
Detective Cho, go back to the station.

36
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,359
Yes, sir.

37
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,819
Yes, sir.

38
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,372
Captain An ordered us

39
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,415
to watch the detective in charge

40
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,876
of the prostitution case,
which was Lieutenant Lee Ju-yeong.

41
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,089
Then we found out Lieutenant Lee
and the other gamblers,

42
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,758
who just got arrested,
often gathered here.

43
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,302
What's the evidence to support
that Lee Ju-yeong was here today?

44
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,971
At around eight in the evening,

45
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,515
seven men including Ju-yeong
were seen coming in here

46
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,558
during a stakeout.

47
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,934
Who witnessed it?

48
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:18,104
Me, Captain Eun,
Senior Patrol Officer Choi,

49
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,440
Detective Jang, and Detective Cho.
All five of us saw him.

50
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,150
Yet, you lost Lee Ju-yeong?

51
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,083
There was a surgeon who lost
hundreds of millions of won today.

52
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,336
He made a scene saying
he'd report them to the police.

53
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,838
So, they assaulted and confined him.

54
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,849
I think he ran way through the window.

55
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,020
Stay here.

56
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,951
There aren't any footprints going out.

57
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,581
Nor are there marks
of someone climbing the wall.

58
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,959
There's dust on the window too.

59
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,420
Are you saying he ran away

60
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,756
without touching the dust on the window?

61
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,133
Is he a ghost?

62
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,519
What are you doing?

63
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,479
I'm checking if Ju-yeong is in here.

64
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,399
If it was someone else, I'd have doubts,
but someone as keen as you

65
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:46,651
and Myeong-ho

66
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,403
both saw Ju-yeong coming in here.

67
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,906
But there's no trace of him getting out.

68
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,700
So, unless

69
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,371
he got buried underground

70
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,416
or flew into the sky,

71
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,087
it's impossible that he's not here.

72
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:18,140
There's only one entrance
and no trace of him getting out.

73
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,435
Stop making assumptions
and search the building!

74
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,572
Over here.

75
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,558
Detective Lee.

76
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,399
-No one's in there?
-No, nobody.

77
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,628
Mr. Oh Yang-chon.

78
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:15,591
Lieutenant Oh Yang-chon.

79
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,148
Yang-chon.

80
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,241
Yang-chon, please.

81
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,283
Yang-chon.

82
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,496
Yang-chon!

83
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,331
-Yang-chon!
-Lieutenant Oh, stop!

84
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,291
Lieutenant Oh!

85
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:51,836
-Stop!
-Lieutenant!

86
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,170
Enough!

87
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,388
Yang-chon...

88
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,523
Yang-chon.

89
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:22,032
Yang-chon! Stop!
What the fuck are you doing?

90
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,576
Do you want to get me fired or what?

91
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,286
My kid is sick.

92
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,705
You dirty son of a bitch, let him go.

93
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:28,873
Can't you see my wings?

94
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,918
<i>As I promised you,</i>

95
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:36,255
<i>I visit Ho-cheol's wife
whenever I get the chance to.</i>

96
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,633
Yang-chon...

97
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,179
Come to your senses, you moron.

98
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,973
Pull yourself together.

99
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,058
Do you want to ruin everything?

100
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,436
If you're arrested for assault,

101
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,980
if the whole division is punished,

102
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,774
what will you do then?
Get your shit together!

103
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,404
-Lieutenant Oh!
-Hey!

104
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,781
-Yang-chon...
-Stop him!

105
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,116
-Lieutenant Oh!
-Lieutenant Oh!

106
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:05,868
-Yang-chon.
-Stop!

107
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,078
Get him.

108
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,581
Yang-chon! That's enough!

109
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:14,168
-Please calm down, sir.
-Calm down, Yang-chon.

110
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,380
I'm off, sir.

111
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,136
One of the gamblers
is a higher-up in a prostitution ring.

112
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,933
I heard they found
a handwritten ledger on him.

113
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,520
Did anybody get injured?

114
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,730
Is the situation taken care of?

115
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,732
Yes.

116
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,652
What's Ju-yeong's role in this?

117
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:27,945
He's the head of the operation.

118
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,905
When they were planning

119
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,240
-the prostitution scheme--
-Go.

120
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:50,217
Captain wants you to come
to the interrogation room.

121
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,513
Lieutenant Oh.

122
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:01,645
Sir.

123
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,190
Go.

124
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,694
-I'll drive you home--
-I told you to just go.

125
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:20,873
Go home.

126
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,546
Lee Ju-yeong is not your only subordinate.

127
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,758
I'm your subordinate too.

128
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,054
I'll see you on my next shift.

129
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,161
Wipe that blood off, you moron.

130
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,788
Shut up, you moron.

131
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,918
Do you think that you're a legendary cop?

132
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:09,088
Hey, don't be delusional, okay?

133
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:16,762
Listen up, you prick.

134
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:18,680
You're a nobody.

135
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,684
You're not someone whom
I or our co-workers can rely on.

136
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,230
You weren't even a dependable husband
to Jang-mi.

137
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,439
You're just

138
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,443
a big kid with a nasty temper,
who does nothing

139
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,655
but make his co-workers and wife worry.
Do you even know that?

140
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,745
We've been in the force for over 20 years,

141
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:46,458
and we've seen
sly, corrupt cops like Ju-yeong

142
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,626
doing ridiculous things.

143
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,837
We've seen it a number of times.

144
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,673
Even if we risk our lives
and get beaten up on duty,

145
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,508
the entire force
has to put up with criticism

146
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,469
because of a few rotten apples.

147
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:02,683
That's why people call us rude names,
which we've all heard many times.

148
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,893
Isn't it about time
you tried to be mature?

149
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,024
You risked getting fired

150
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,986
and beat up your co-workers
because of that prick, Ju-yeong.

151
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,821
What the hell are you doing?

152
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,075
Answer me, you idiot.
What the hell are you doing?

153
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:25,998
Yes, it's all right.
It's fine since no one got hurt badly.

154
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,127
If Ju-yeong presses charges
against Yang-chon for police brutality

155
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,046
because he got beat up,
I'll beat him up myself and get arrested.

156
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,798
POLICE BRUTALITY
ABUSE OF AUTHORITY BY POLICE MEMBERS

157
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,425
Okay, Myeong-ho.

158
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,178
Don't worry about it and call it a day.

159
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,387
Okay.

160
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,558
Honey, what do you think about this suit?

161
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,727
I don't know either.

162
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:50,230
Who cares what I wear to meet the in-laws?

163
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,648
Don't yell at me.

164
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,609
I have a headache as it is.

165
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,944
What's so important
about our daughter's marriage?

166
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,905
Something happened at work,
but I couldn't go

167
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,657
because you were dragging me
here and there all night!

168
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,619
Why does my stomach hurt so much?

169
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,122
You could at least close the door.

170
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,095
WIFEY

171
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,017
It's me.

172
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,105
What?

173
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,358
Thankfully,

174
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,904
her heart monitor was linked
to the hospital's emergency bell,

175
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,697
so nothing bad happened.

176
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,825
While giving her CPR though,

177
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,328
the nurse broke a couple of her ribs.

178
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,288
Don't say anything to your dad.

179
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,249
I'm on my way to see him now.

180
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,920
I'll stay here tonight.

181
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,881
What's wrong with your hand?

182
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,008
It's nothing.

183
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,719
If your mom had a say in it,

184
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,014
she would've asked you
to just let her die.

185
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,059
She has lived a selfless life,

186
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,935
so she won't have any regrets.

187
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,815
I only made her life miserable,

188
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,485
but I can't hold onto her now

189
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:42,986
just for our sake.

190
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,122
Don't ever

191
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:57,000
visit her at the hospital again.

192
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,304
One.

193
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,598
You're good. Kick him!

194
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,309
You're fast.

195
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,144
-Die, die!
-Kill him!

196
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,563
Lay him out flat. Come on!

197
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,315
-How's that?
-Die!

198
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,900
-Oh, no.
-Nice!

199
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,401
-Watch it.
-Knock him out.

200
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:48,862
-Just lay him out flat!
-No, no!

201
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,823
-Please.
-Finish him!

202
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,450
-Okay!
-Take that and that!

203
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,368
Okay!

204
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,661
Okay!

205
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,206
Good play. Good play!

206
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,832
Good play!

207
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,668
Let's go. Get him!

208
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,879
-Avoid the punches!
-It's not moving like I want it to.

209
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,255
-Avoid the punches!
-No. Wait.

210
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,466
-That's it.
-Oh, no you don't.

211
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,843
-Get him. One, two!
-One, two!

212
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,553
-One, two!
-No!

213
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:14,888
One, two. Let's go!

214
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,765
I won!

215
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,188
Good job. I'll get my car, so come out.

216
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,739
-What was that?
-That got quite physical.

217
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,824
He must be a player.

218
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,285
So what? I liked it.

219
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,662
She's a player too.

220
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:39,871
Bingo.

221
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,708
I'm going to be late today.

222
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,126
Where are you going?

223
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,127
It's a secret.

224
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,383
You're a loser, right?

225
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:53,885
We should've just played together.

226
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:57,347
Why join them and see something
that will piss you off, you loser?

227
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,224
Stop saying "we".

228
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:02,018
-We might end up--
-Dating. So what?

229
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,270
I don't like you that way.

230
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,105
What way is that?

231
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,315
You're nuts.

232
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:21,079
The old man hasn't been
picking up for two days now.

233
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:27,043
MY LAST ROOKIE

234
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:30,046
Honey, I'm off to Jeong-do's house.

235
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,632
Don't forget to see a doctor today.

236
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:36,052
I can't believe you hurt yourself
after drinking too much.

237
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,598
Old man, consider yourself dead.

238
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,532
I didn't realize that was still there.

239
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,410
Judging by that tone,

240
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,788
I'm guessing she was more than a friend.

241
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,123
You guys must have dated.

242
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,126
We did.

243
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,714
Why did you guys break up?

244
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:58,885
There was an accident.

245
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:01,471
"An accident"?

246
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,351
On her way to see me,

247
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:09,312
she came across a car that was on fire.

248
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:13,191
She tried to help a mother and her child,

249
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,110
but the car exploded.

250
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:19,906
She died on the spot.

251
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:31,376
Let's pull over for a bit.

252
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:55,525
I thought

253
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,611
I should tell you about Hyeon-su.

254
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,573
I just wasn't sure how.

255
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,159
I guess this is how.

256
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,256
You don't have to do that.

257
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:32,520
Let's watch a movie. A comedy.

258
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,148
Okay.

259
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,513
<i>If your mom had a say in it,</i>

260
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,432
<i>she would've asked you
to just let her die.</i>

261
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,851
She has lived a selfless life,

262
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,895
so she won't have any regrets.

263
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:17,148
<i>I only made her life miserable,</i>

264
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,026
<i>but I can't hold onto her now</i>

265
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,110
<i>just for our sake.</i>

266
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,044
Why are you rooting for me and Jeong-o

267
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:40,338
instead of Myeong-ho and her?

268
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,424
Jeong-o dated my friend Da-yeong

269
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,635
and then dumped him out of nowhere.

270
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:53,560
I'm not interested.

271
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,358
Keep going.

272
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,194
Jeong-o's cold-hearted.

273
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,822
My friend never got over the breakup

274
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,740
and went abroad to study.

275
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,243
He wanted to study Korean literature,

276
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:11,953
but he even changed his major.

277
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:14,998
There must've been a reason.

278
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,250
Then she should've told him.

279
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,294
My friend said

280
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:22,463
she showed up one day and said,
"I don't like you. Let's break up."

281
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,841
Then she ignored his calls
and transferred schools.

282
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:28,219
My friend's still in the UK.

283
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,974
I couldn't tell him I work with Jeong-o.

284
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,935
He's doing fine now,
and I don't want to ruin that.

285
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,981
My mentor, Myeong-ho,

286
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:42,150
needs someone sweeter and warmer.

287
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,194
You must make Jeong-o yours.

288
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,709
Do you think Jeong-o's cold-hearted?

289
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,544
I don't think so.

290
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,129
I don't care.

291
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,214
You should care.

292
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,300
I'm no stranger. I'm your mentee.

293
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,563
Lieutenant, what happened to you?

294
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,693
What's wrong?

295
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,196
What happened?

296
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:33,493
Hey! Men are changing in here!

297
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:34,744
Respect our privacy, will you?

298
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,371
Please, Hye-ri.

299
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,247
Stop talking and put on your uniforms.

300
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:40,375
What happened to you?

301
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,751
Let's see your eye.

302
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,128
How dare you?

303
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,049
I got drunk and fell.

304
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:49,842
You don't drink much.

305
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,844
After our day shift,

306
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,346
something happened to you, right?

307
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,808
Why else would you not take my calls--

308
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,184
You're making things up.

309
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,686
The night we got off work together,

310
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:02,230
when I called, you asked if I was okay.

311
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,815
What did you mean by that?

312
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,650
Why did you ask if I was okay?

313
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,778
-Did Man-yong--
-You're such a bother.

314
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,659
Where did you get drunk

315
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:17,245
and where did you fall
that you bruised your eye?

316
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,211
Something happened, right?

317
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,171
He said no. Believe him.

318
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,589
Don't cause trouble.

319
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,426
You can't get hurt that badly while drunk.

320
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,679
I don't think he just fell.

321
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,349
Hi, I'm late. Sorry, guys.

322
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:40,268
-Hello.
-Hello.

323
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,811
-Sam-bo.
-Good morning.

324
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:45,231
Sam-bo, what happened to your face?

325
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:46,899
Tell me.

326
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,818
We're going on patrol.

327
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:51,237
Hey, what happened to Sam-bo?

328
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,281
He said he got drunk and fell.

329
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:55,950
That's just insane.

330
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,660
You should've stopped him from leaving.

331
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:00,246
He can't go on patrol looking like that.

332
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,665
We have a reputation to keep as cops.

333
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,876
Sam-bo never listens to us.

334
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,253
Mr. Intolerable.

335
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,338
Keep your mouth shut.

336
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,299
Mr. Intolerable is your nickname now.

337
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,051
You're just intolerable, that's why!

338
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:14,594
Are you a thug?

339
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:16,262
Even if you're angry,

340
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:18,014
you can't beat up a colleague.

341
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:19,891
Okay.

342
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,393
I'll try to be more tolerable now.

343
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:23,895
-You moron.
-Sang-su, let's go.

344
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:24,896
Yes, sir.

345
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,397
Salute first.

346
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:27,899
Stand still and salute.

347
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,695
You're all nutjobs.

348
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,573
<i>Code Zero, Code Zero.</i>

349
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,533
<i>We have a missing child.</i>

350
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,952
<i>Hyeonji-dong Flower Apartment
Complex 3, block 8, unit 502.</i>

351
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,580
<i>We have a missing child.
40 minutes have lapsed.</i>

352
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,833
<i>Patrol car in the vicinity, please report.</i>

353
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,630
Seul-gi, where are you?

354
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,258
What should I do?

355
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,551
Calm down, ma'am.

356
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:57,845
You could faint yourself.

357
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,472
Seul-gi!

358
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,600
Get up.

359
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,736
Where's my Seul-gi?

360
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,614
-Hey.
-Ma'am.

361
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,407
Did you take her?

362
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,409
-Calm down.
-You didn't want her.

363
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,537
You said she was a bother,
so you left her with me.

364
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,330
Bring her back.

365
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,499
Calm down, ma'am. You must relax.

366
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,876
-You can't do this.
-Bring Seul-gi back.

367
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,963
What now?

368
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,510
I got this

369
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,471
from the intercom's camera.

370
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,392
<i>The school bus arrived at 1:15 p.m.</i>

371
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:47,395
<i>There was the driver and five other kids.</i>

372
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:50,398
<i>All of them testified
they saw Seul-gi get off the bus</i>

373
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,483
<i>and ring the doorbell.</i>

374
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,778
<i>They saw the girl ring the bell
and talk to her mom,</i>

375
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,947
<i>then they drove off.</i>

376
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,824
The doors opened, then closed.

377
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,534
This means the mother let her in.

378
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,286
Oh, there's more.

379
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:04,996
Here.

380
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:07,331
It's the footage from the hallway.

381
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:10,376
<i>When the girl didn't come home
for five minutes</i>

382
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:14,046
<i>after her mom had buzzed her in,
her mom came out to look for her.</i>

383
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,299
<i>She searched the block on her own</i>

384
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,925
for about 40 minutes.

385
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,386
When she couldn't find her,
she called the police.

386
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,849
What about the other cameras
within the block?

387
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:27,059
There is a total of 12.

388
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,103
Two are broken and can't record.

389
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,606
We checked the others
and didn't find the kid.

390
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,902
The camera filming the road
leading out of the complex

391
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:38,029
is being monitored by the security room.

392
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:43,409
About an hour has lapsed
since the child went missing.

393
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,288
Is Han Jeong-o working on the profile?

394
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:48,706
Yes.

395
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,586
CASE INVESTIGATION REPORT

396
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:03,638
Was your child close to any of the kids

397
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,097
in the neighborhood?

398
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,226
I don't know.

399
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,811
She never talked about her friends.

400
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,109
Talk.

401
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,862
The missing girl has
a separate birth mother.

402
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,950
The girl was being raised by
her adoptive parents.

403
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,370
<i>The birth mother and adoptive mother
were neighbors for five, six years</i>

404
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:28,579
<i>and were almost like sisters.</i>

405
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:32,208
<i>The birth mother told them she wanted to
get married but couldn't with a child,</i>

406
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:34,752
<i>the infertile adoptive couple
asked to adopt her.</i>

407
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,546
<i>They took her in three months ago</i>

408
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,465
and the adoptive parents

409
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:43,261
asked the birth mother
to move away after getting married.

410
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,054
<i>Her new husband knows nothing of the girl.</i>

411
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,806
Who's her current legal custodian?

412
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,392
Family Court is working on
the case right now.

413
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,395
The birth mother still has legal custody.

414
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,105
What's odd is,

415
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,149
I tried to compile the child's profile.

416
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:01,654
The adoptive parents
could only guess her height,

417
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,864
weight and what she was wearing.

418
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,199
They weren't sure.

419
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,743
They don't have any photos of her
on their phones.

420
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,914
<i>The mother has anxiety</i>

421
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,457
<i>and anger management issues.</i>

422
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,626
She was undergoing treatment

423
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,587
which she recently stopped.

424
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:22,300
<i>The security guard we talked to said</i>

425
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:26,429
<i>the mom was always sick
and left the child to herself.</i>

426
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,097
This is a case that clearly shows

427
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:32,184
the issues with private adoptions
where an organization isn't involved.

428
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:36,897
<i>A woman with anxiety and anger management
issues was able to adopt a child.</i>

429
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:41,610
Jeong-o, you shouldn't be biased
against the adoptive parents though.

430
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:46,115
Statistically, 71 percent
of child abuse cases is committed

431
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,075
by birth parents, not adoptive parents.

432
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,121
Yes, ma'am.

433
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:53,706
<i>Have you found anything on them?</i>

434
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,333
I looked through all records

435
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,627
but haven't found anything unusual
on any of them in the last five years.

436
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,838
We can't look up criminal records though.

437
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:03,382
Hold on.

438
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,556
THE ROAD TO MAKING OUR KIDS LEADERS

439
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:17,480
INSTRUCTOR KIM YEONG-GYUN

440
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,065
That's the girl's dad.

441
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:23,027
Jeong-o, call Detective Jang and ask him

442
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,946
to pull up the adoptive parents'
criminal records.

443
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,114
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

444
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,579
Hyeonji-dong Flower Apartment
Complex 3, block 8, unit 502.

445
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:37,291
All rapid response units
and regional teams listen up.

446
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:40,669
The girl is shorter
than the average height for her age...

447
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:44,423
She would've been caught on the intercom
camera had she been over 110cm tall.

448
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:48,803
<i>She's a six-year-old girl
whose height is under 110cm.</i>

449
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,721
<i>All rapid response units
and regional teams,</i>

450
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:54,600
<i>please go over the guidelines
for searching for the girl once again.</i>

451
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,311
-<i>I'll repeat.</i>
-Search thoroughly!

452
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,480
<i>Check every deserted or empty house,
construction site,</i>

453
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,857
<i>Internet cafe, hideout in the area,</i>

454
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,985
<i>closet, basement room, attic,</i>

455
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:08,239
<i>pile of laundry or fridge
you see on the streets.</i>

456
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,449
<i>Also be sure to check
washing machines and dryers.</i>

457
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:13,536
<i>Don't forget to check every well,
kennel, bushes</i>

458
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:18,165
<i>car, space in between buildings,
rooftop, and couch.</i>

459
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,167
<i>Also check every large luggage</i>

460
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,838
<i>and pile of garbage you come across.
Don't leave anything out.</i>

461
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:28,926
<i>In most kidnapping cases,</i>

462
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:31,303
<i>if the suspect doesn't ask for money
within three hours...</i>

463
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:37,059
<i>It's highly likely that the victim
will be found dead.</i>

464
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:40,062
<i>Keep that in mind
and search as thoroughly as you can.</i>

465
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,532
If she was kidnapped,
the suspect will ask for money.

466
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:54,160
If not, the rapid response unit
will find her in some state.

467
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,287
Let's wait.

468
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,714
Do you think the child will be here?

469
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,341
Keep looking.

470
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:14,680
But Man-yong is getting worse.

471
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:17,683
He got other guys to beat up the cop
and made us get rid of all evidence.

472
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,937
My mom will kill me if she finds out
what I've been up to.

473
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:24,315
Hey, it's not like we beat up the cop.

474
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:26,108
We didn't happy-slap them either.

475
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,068
Who cares? We made money off it.

476
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,069
Hi, guys.

477
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,113
Aren't you the ones who smoked?

478
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:32,615
What are you doing here?

479
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,325
Hey.

480
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:38,913
Go tell Man-yong

481
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:42,750
that I'll be sure to find
evidence for what he did that night.

482
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,669
He won't be able to get out of it.

483
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:52,259
-What are you talking about?
-We weren't there that day.

484
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,763
-"There that day"?
-We don't know anything.

485
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,807
Right, the two of you
weren't there that day.

486
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:01,060
You're Man-yong's friends.

487
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:04,897
The guys who were with him that day
were younger than him.

488
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,195
Then who was with him that day?

489
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,655
Stop talking total nonsense.

490
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,574
What a joke. Let's go.

491
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,077
Hey, answer me.

492
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:20,204
Who was with Man-yong that day?

493
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,122
They came from that way, right?

494
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,249
Yes.

495
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:26,335
Those punks beat you up that day, right?

496
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:27,920
Lieutenant Lee.

497
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:30,965
Come on.

498
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,331
Take this to the patrol car.

499
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,416
Yes, sir.

500
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:11,171
Your eye is like that
because of this pepper spray, right?

501
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,424
You have to tell everyone at the station.

502
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:15,217
It's not a simple assault case.

503
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,847
I mean, just looking at this alone...

504
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:24,852
It's a personal problem.
Just keep looking for the missing girl.

505
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:31,984
Seo-jin?

506
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:33,402
PARK SEO-JIN

507
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,196
<i>Hello?</i>

508
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,616
I heard you just ran into the bully girl.

509
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:42,870
<i>I bragged to her about becoming friends
with a female cop a while ago.</i>

510
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,247
<i>She asked me if it was you,
and I said yes.</i>

511
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,707
Then what did she say?

512
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,167
<i>Check your phone.</i>

513
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,248
<i>I heard that Man-yong sent the clip</i>

514
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:31,418
<i>to all of his minions who got caught
smoking with him to boast about it,</i>

515
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:35,130
<i>with a warning that they'll also get
beaten up like that if they betray him.</i>

516
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,882
<i>He's a total nutjob.</i>

517
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:40,010
<i>That bully girl showed me the clip
and told me not to tell anyone.</i>

518
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,478
Hye-ri.

519
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:51,563
Did you check over there?

520
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:53,357
No.

521
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,569
Seul-gi,
I really hope that I don't find you here.

526
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:09,057
<i>Rapid response units
and regional teams, wrap up.</i>

527
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:11,185
<i>End the search.</i>

528
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:14,605
<i>Rapid response units
and regional teams, wrap up the search.</i>

529
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:16,482
We're wrapping up already?

530
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:19,860
-What about the girl?
-Even if the search ends,

531
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:21,195
the investigation will continue.

532
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,197
Let's see what happens.

533
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,668
Yes, Doctor Han.

534
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:39,838
I'll be fine, right?

535
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,884
Of course. It's not like I'm invincible.

536
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:46,970
Bloody stool scares me too.

537
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:50,724
All right, then.

538
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,895
I'll see you at your clinic
in a couple of days. Okay.

539
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:57,231
Thanks. All right.

540
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:43,110
<i>I'm suspicious of the adoptive parents.</i>

541
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:48,782
They're canceling the adoption
even though we haven't found the kid.

542
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,035
Shouldn't they wait until she's found?

543
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:58,041
The mentors have been summoned.

544
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,753
What's going on?

545
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:19,396
Captain An,
what about an open investigation?

546
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:21,523
That's only possible

547
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:24,651
when we have definitive proof

548
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,487
of kidnapping within the first three hours

549
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:29,323
or a dead body.

550
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,408
Neither applies to this case.

551
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,745
We don't have grounds for one.

552
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:39,166
I'll try and keep it an active case
for 24 hours though.

553
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:43,670
After that,
it's up to the committee to decide

554
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:45,922
whether we move on

555
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:47,215
or make it an open case.

556
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:50,969
This is the criminal record of the parents
that dates back to 20 years.

557
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:53,889
Seven years before he started an academy,

558
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,516
he used to teach in a middle school.

559
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,477
He molested one of his students,

560
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,687
<i> and he got two years' probation.</i>

561
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:03,774
<i>Did you hear what he said?</i>

562
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:05,150
Yes.

563
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,362
Officer Han,
all subordinates to the cafeteria.

564
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,948
I'll tell Assistant Chief Ki,

565
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:14,368
so I want you focused on this case
for 24 hours.

566
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:17,329
Yes, ma'am.
I'll write up a request to be on the case.

567
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,086
Where's Hye-ri?

568
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:26,254
She'll come.

569
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:28,382
What about the mentors?

570
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,843
They're in a meeting,
unbeknownst to Team Two, of course.

571
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:33,720
What's going on?

572
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:44,314
Is this where it happened?

573
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,900
You're looking for a camera, right?

574
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,528
There aren't any in this area.

575
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:51,988
Let's take another look around.

576
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,119
Let's go back to the division.

577
00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:01,123
Everyone probably knows
about the attack by now.

578
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:03,875
I told them,

579
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,252
so hate me if you want to.

580
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:07,087
I know it's embarrassing,

581
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:10,173
but you can't take care of this alone.

582
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:12,926
Let's head back.

583
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:39,411
-Damn it.
-Fucking hell.

584
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:55,969
Yu Man-yong,
who was arrested for buying cigarettes,

585
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:57,471
sent this to his friends to brag.

586
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:00,056
And Hye-ri's informant relayed it to her.

587
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:02,559
Judging by what they're saying,

588
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,561
they must be younger than Man-yong.

589
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,981
Who got arrested with him at the time?

590
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,108
They were a few who were younger than him.

591
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:14,446
Instead of his name though,
they called him <i>"sunbae,"</i>

592
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:16,740
so it can't be them.

593
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:21,328
Chief, it can get messy if
we take point on this one.

594
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,706
-We should request--
-Yes, that's protocol.

595
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:28,418
But if we hand this over to detectives,

596
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,670
it'll just get lost

597
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,507
under all their other pressing cases.

598
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:36,426
A kid beat up an old cop.

599
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:40,222
In the US, it's a felony worth
decades of prison time.

600
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:41,598
What about Korea though?

601
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:43,517
We'll be asked to suck it up.

602
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:46,895
Let's handle this ourselves.

603
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:48,438
Okay?

604
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:52,943
It's not just anyone.
Sam-bo got the shit beat out of him.

605
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:56,363
Let's take point on it.

606
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:01,201
-Chief--
-Let's handle this ourselves.

607
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,286
We're all on the same page here,

608
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:06,039
but do you really want us
to follow protocol?

609
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:13,380
I was saying

610
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:16,466
that it's protocol to hand this

611
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,385
over to detectives.

612
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:26,643
This time though, we'll take care of it.

613
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:30,856
What I'm worried about

614
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:33,817
-are our mentees and rookies.
-Let's leave the rookies out.

615
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,528
If this backfires,
it'll ruin their careers and lives.

616
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:37,612
-The mentees too.
-Hey.

617
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:39,948
We can't work the case without them.

618
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:42,409
Without them, it'll be the same as
not taking the case at all.

619
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:44,786
You should go home.

620
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:47,956
Your wife is about to have the baby.
Go home.

621
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:49,249
I'm fine.

622
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,501
-The rookies--
-Leave it to me.

623
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:16,693
Are you having fun?

624
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:22,157
Is it fun to embarrass me

625
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:23,783
in front of everyone?

626
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:25,285
No.

627
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:29,247
You should step outside.

628
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,334
Lieutenant Lee.

629
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:34,252
No, Sam-bo.

630
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:37,297
This isn't just payback.

631
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,757
They're questioning our authority.

632
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:41,426
We know how you feel, sir.

633
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,386
How could you possibly know?

634
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,723
How could you possibly know how I feel?

635
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:50,769
Have you ever been
beaten by a bunch of kids before?

636
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:54,648
At my age,

637
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:57,734
if I may add.

638
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:00,862
Because I'm weak.

639
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,991
Have you ever been beaten by kids
just because you're too old?

640
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:17,003
Min-seok.

641
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,757
Tell Hye-ri to accompany
Sam-bo to the gym,

642
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:24,094
round up all the subordinates,
and bring them here.

643
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:25,762
Yes, sir.

644
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:39,359
<i>Let's go.</i>

645
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:44,823
What did I tell you to say

646
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:48,493
if our division was put
under investigation

647
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:50,745
for working this case?

648
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:54,416
"I didn't want to participate,

649
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:57,043
but I couldn't disobey a direct order,

650
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,254
and I had no choice but to participate."

651
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:01,339
Who gave you the order?

652
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:03,383
My mentor.

653
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,344
Who ordered you all?

654
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,013
We'll say we were ordered by our mentors!

655
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:10,098
You're all dismissed.

656
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,575
What about their mentors?

657
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:29,826
We can take care of ourselves.

658
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:32,078
I don't want to make a fuss out of this.

659
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,122
It's better if Assistant Chief Ki
takes the fall.

660
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:36,624
You'll all say that he ordered you.

661
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:40,462
If anyone wants to head home, do so.

662
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:42,881
Take a nap or something.

663
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:44,883
We'll regroup at 11.

664
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:47,135
Don't overdo it.

665
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,643
If the motorcycle isn't registered,

666
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:57,896
it could possibly be stolen.

667
00:55:57,979 --> 00:55:59,022
Jong-min's team and mine

668
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:00,690
will look for any cases

669
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,567
of minors engaged in stolen property.

670
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:04,360
Jeong-o and I

671
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,946
have volunteered to
work the missing child case.

672
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:09,491
While we're out on patrol,
we'll keep our eyes out

673
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:12,660
for the bike
and the boy with a nose piercing.

674
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:15,955
Detective Kim, it's been a while.

675
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,791
I'm busy, so let's cut right to the chase.

676
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:20,752
-Are there any recent cases...
-Hye-ri and I will seek out her informant

677
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:21,920
or the female bully.

678
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:22,837
Sure.

679
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:26,007
I'll take my car to check out the scene.

680
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:27,759
Yes.

681
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:30,720
That's right.

682
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:33,306
Right.

683
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,183
Exactly.

684
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:38,645
I volunteered us for an extra shift.

685
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:40,980
An unregistered motorcycle,
happy slap attack,

686
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,358
and pepper spray are part of their M.O.

687
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:44,984
Check the cases involving teens.

688
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,821
The search should include young offenders.

689
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:49,155
They were younger than Man-yong.

690
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,533
YOUNG OFFENDERS: TEENS OVER 10
AND UNDER 14 WHO COMMITTED A CRIME

691
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:53,868
You know the severe crime rate
involving kids under 15.

692
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:56,329
Hye-ri's informant
is in middle school too.

693
00:56:57,413 --> 00:56:58,748
You heard my rookie, right?

694
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:02,001
I want the list to include
minors from 10 to 14.

695
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:13,346
Tell her I'll be late.

696
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:16,641
HOME

697
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:18,435
Hello?

698
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:25,942
RECENT CALL LIST

699
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:35,994
MY LAST ROOKIE

700
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:47,005
OLD MENTOR

701
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:09,027
Sam-bo.

702
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,613
Did you take photos of your wounds?

703
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:18,119
Sam-bo.

704
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:22,040
Even guys like Yang-chon and Myeong-ho

705
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,167
don't stand a chance

706
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,377
if they get pepper-sprayed
right in the face.

707
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:29,589
Don't try to comfort me.

708
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:35,762
You and I are both old.
I can't comfort you.

709
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:38,056
Sam-bo.

710
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:42,894
We don't stand a chance
against hot-blooded kids.

711
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:46,481
We can't take them,
but when we're with our colleagues

712
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:48,942
that changes things.

713
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,028
Sam-bo.

714
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:55,323
We're not alone. We have colleagues.

715
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:57,575
Leave this to them.

716
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:00,745
You stay out of it.

717
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:02,956
If you disobey my order,

718
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:06,251
I'll make you quit

719
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:08,795
a month before your retirement ceremony.

720
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:12,257
The boys and I are prepared to be...

721
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,803
We're prepared to be penalized.

722
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,597
Don't let your emotions

723
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:21,849
ruin everything.

724
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:29,023
Go somewhere and get some sleep.

725
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:06,811
Do you know her?

726
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:08,521
I don't know her.

727
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:12,483
What about him?

728
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:16,195
No, I don't.

729
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:18,239
What about him?

730
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:23,536
You know him.

731
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:28,499
Do you still sell stolen goods?

732
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:32,962
No, I don't do that anymore.

733
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:41,763
Are you allowed to drive now?

734
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:44,057
Since when?

735
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:46,225
Since a week ago.

736
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:48,645
Great.

737
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:02,784
It's so cool.

738
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:04,494
Give me a ride.

739
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:05,703
Let me take a look too.

740
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,306
Kang Nam-il, Han Jeong-o.

741
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:27,558
You two focus on the missing kid.

742
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:30,520
Sam-bo's case is not your priority.

743
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,398
<i>The missing girl comes first, okay?</i>

744
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:35,400
Yes, don't worry.

745
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:38,194
First priority is the missing girl,
second is Sam-bo.

746
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:40,029
We'll prioritize it like that
on our patrol.

747
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:43,408
We're close to where Sam-bo was attacked.

748
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:47,328
How far is it from where
they busted the smoking kids?

749
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:48,413
About 500m.

750
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,046
That bike doesn't have a plate.

751
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:03,511
Sergeant.

752
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:06,973
Isn't that the missing girl's birth mom?

753
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,811
I think we should follow her.

754
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:15,398
The missing girl is my priority.

755
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,191
I want to go.

756
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:31,330
We saw a motorcycle with no plate.

757
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:33,875
It went to Gwanmok Intersection.

758
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:36,586
<i>A motorcycle with no plate
went to Gwanmok Intersection.</i>

759
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:39,213
<i>Kang Nam-il and Han Jeong-o
are looking for the missing kid </i>

760
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:40,339
<i>and can't help.</i>

761
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:42,091
<i>A motorcycle with no--</i>

762
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,384
Choi Myeong-ho, roger that.

763
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:45,136
We're on the move.

764
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:48,514
<i>Be careful, everyone.
Make sure the kids don't get hurt.</i>

765
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:51,184
<i>If they get hurt, it's over for us too.</i>

766
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:53,227
<i>I'm heading to Gwanmok Intersection.</i>

767
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:02,361
<i>Detective Kim, I got your message.</i>

768
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:04,864
<i>Thank you.</i>

769
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:09,827
Sam-bo's attack.

770
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:12,455
We identified an accomplice
with a nose piercing.

771
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:15,374
Choi Jin, has prior records,
aged 13, 7th grade.

772
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,752
A unique physical trait
is that he's tall for his age.

773
01:03:17,835 --> 01:03:19,670
He was reported for pepper-spraying

774
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:21,631
a student in his year 3 months ago.

775
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:24,091
Confirmed by Detective Kim
from Jangdong's Juvenile Affairs.

776
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:26,677
Hye-ri's informant
is a girl called Seo-jin.

777
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:28,930
She logged into a website for bullies

778
01:03:29,013 --> 01:03:31,641
and found proof that
Man-yong planned the attack.

779
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:34,560
<i>The article written in Man-yong's nickname</i>

780
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:38,231
was a recruitment notice
for boys aged 10 to 14,

781
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:40,566
who can't be charged,
offering 100,000 won a day.

782
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:44,987
We checked the nickname of the boy
who responded to the notice.

783
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:48,950
It belonged to the 13-year-old boy that
Yeom Sang-su just briefed us on.

784
01:03:49,742 --> 01:03:52,245
Choi Jin attends Hanil Middle School.

785
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:53,830
They're definitely connected.

786
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:55,706
<i>Are you headed to the intersection?</i>

787
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:06,027
Get off.

788
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:09,405
Come on.

789
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:15,244
When you got home from work,

790
01:05:16,203 --> 01:05:18,623
Seul-gi would be here waiting for you.

791
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:20,791
What a good girl.

792
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:23,336
What

793
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,838
could have happened?

794
01:05:35,222 --> 01:05:37,642
Ma'am, can you take a look at this?

795
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:43,564
Oh, my.

796
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:48,486
I bought this for her.

797
01:05:50,154 --> 01:05:51,280
Oh, no.

798
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:55,076
What now?

799
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:57,828
Seul-gi...

800
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:02,500
Seul-gi, where are you?

801
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:10,341
Go-eun.

802
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:12,301
That's right.

803
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:15,846
There's a kid named Go-eun,
who lives with her grandmother

804
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,892
after her parents got divorced.
They live near here.

805
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:30,569
It's the basement room on the right.

806
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:31,904
Hold on.

807
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:34,490
You should stay here.

808
01:06:35,282 --> 01:06:36,575
That would be best.

809
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:55,970
Ma'am, are you home?

810
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:58,055
Go-eun.

811
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:10,443
Wait here for a second.

812
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:31,380
Are you Go-eun?

813
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:38,137
Do you know Seul-gi?

814
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:06,415
You can stay here with me.

815
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,918
Seul-gi said she hates her dad!

816
01:08:09,668 --> 01:08:12,046
She's my friend.

817
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:13,923
Seul-gi!

818
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:17,134
Seul-gi!

819
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:18,928
Seul-gi...

820
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:51,710
Jeong-o, what is it?

821
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:23,701
<i>We have to wait for another victim.</i>

822
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:27,163
<i>All we can do is wait
for kids to get hurt.</i>

823
01:09:28,455 --> 01:09:30,499
Both of us are under 14.

824
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,459
We're only 13.

825
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:34,795
I guess you outwitted us cops.

826
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:37,923
I'm sorry that you got stuck
with an old man for a mentor.

827
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:41,135
<i>I like Jeong-o a lot.</i>

828
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:43,888
<i>I can't let Myeong-ho have her.</i>

829
01:09:44,388 --> 01:09:45,681
What a psycho.

830
01:09:49,476 --> 01:09:51,061
<i>No, stop it. Get off me!</i>

831
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:54,773
Dad...

832
01:09:56,233 --> 01:09:58,736
