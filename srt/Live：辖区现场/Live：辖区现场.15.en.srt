EPISODE 15

3
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,800
Hye-ri, answer the phone.
It seems you also got a text message.

4
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,350
<i>What are you doing? Aren't you coming?</i>

5
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,320
<i>Officer Song,
you know I'm attracted to you, right?</i>

6
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,110
<i>Officer Song,</i>

7
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,450
<i>come back soon.</i>

8
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:29,950
<i>We miss you.</i>

9
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,040
<i>Hurry back.</i>

10
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:34,950
<i>Hurry back. Everyone is waiting.</i>

11
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,260
<i>Roomie,
this house sucks without you around.</i>

12
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,170
<i>Hurry back.</i>

13
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,470
<i>Hye-ri, aren't you coming back to work?</i>

14
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,060
<i>I miss you. Hurry back.</i>

15
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,400
Dad.

16
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,400
What?

17
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,910
You lost your hand
using the powdering machine.

18
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,950
But why do you still work here
instead of finding another job?

19
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,750
Aren't you afraid?

20
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,960
I'm afraid.

21
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,840
But you know what?

22
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,260
If you run away because you're scared,
you'll continue to run away until you die.

23
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,010
I become more cautious when I work
because I'm afraid.

24
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,390
Feeling afraid isn't a bad thing.

25
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,520
I told you it was a serial rape case.

26
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,030
I said we should step in
before more victims get hurt.

27
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,490
I just followed protocol.

28
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,240
And I just obeyed
the orders of my superior, right?

29
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,420
So...

30
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,720
There's only one reason
why I'm getting disciplinary action.

31
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,060
It's because you guys

32
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,520
are all using me as a scapegoat
to cover up

33
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,140
how you neglected your duty.

34
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,150
I wish you didn't use

35
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,980
the force as your excuse from the get-go.

36
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,070
"We can't be reprimanded,

37
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,110
so we ask you to take the bullet
in our place so that we can end this.

38
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,570
We're sorry."

39
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,160
Had you been honest with me...
No, actually...

40
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,410
"Our manual isn't practical enough.

41
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,290
We should revise it
to better suit the needs."

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,590
Had you suggested it
and tried to persuade me,

43
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,380
knowing my personality,
I would've been like, "Fuck!

44
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,050
I can't stand being a cop!"

45
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,970
I would've just cursed like that,

46
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,600
and this would've been over.

47
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,270
We wouldn't have had to go on about this.

48
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,400
-Captain An!
-Hey!

49
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,770
Hey, Captain An!

50
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,740
How could you...
How dare you say such a thing?

51
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,320
Shut up, all of you.

52
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:01,030
You're trying to hide behind me
so that you don't lose your positions.

53
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,370
So?

54
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,620
What will my disciplinary action be?

55
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,290
Will I get a pay cut? For how many months?

56
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,040
A pay cut is

57
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,420
too light of a punishment
considering how enraged the citizens are.

58
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,220
Then what would it be?

59
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,720
Am I getting suspended?

60
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,230
Do you want me

61
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,070
to leave this agency
because I make you uncomfortable?

62
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,700
You guys are all full of shit.

63
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,440

<i>Please try not to enter the area.</i>

at the north entrance
behind the security guard's car.

82
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,710
A few firefighters have arrived
at the main entrance of the garage.

83
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,750
The rest of the firefighters,

84
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,210
do not enter and be on standby

85
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,380
<i>until further notice.</i>

00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,090
<i>He has a cigarette in his mouth.</i>

87
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,340
<i>He probably has a lighter.</i>

88
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,890
<i>Everyone, be on standby.</i>

89
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,640

I'm sorry I couldn't be a better senior.

95
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,790
It looks like the officers here

96
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,590
are from your patrol division.

97
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,590
But you see, Han-sol.

00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,930
I'm...

99
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,510

00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,760
-I'll tase him.
-The taser gun can hurt us too.

<i>In the parking lot,</i>

<i>Su-man, let's make sure
they leave the parking lot safely first.</i>

120

Escort the woman and her kid out of there.

I'm a police officer. It's okay.

Sam-bo.

126
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,500
You said you'll take the exam

Life is shitty, you know.

138
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,550
I ended up with cancer
after working hard as a cop my whole life,

139
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,840
and bad things

140
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,010
keep happening to you even though
all you've done is work so hard.

141
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,640
Let's think that we're in this mess
called life together.

142
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,600
So please, Su-man.

143
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,520
<i>Don't do this. Let's meet up</i>

<i>and drink until we drop.</i>

00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,900
<i>We can cry our eyes out together</i>

<i>and vent to each other.</i>

147
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,450
<i>This is wrong.</i>

148
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,160
Don't start a fire.

<i>I regret the most in my entire life.</i>

<i>Hadn't I become a cop,</i>

155
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,230
I wouldn't have crossed paths
with those bastards.

156
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,360
Then I wouldn't have been
accused of using excessive force,

157
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,950
<i>and I wouldn't be in this mess now.</i>

00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,440
<i>You have no idea why</i>

181
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,980
I had to handle it this way!

182
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,690
Of course I don't. Am I a psychic?
I can't read people's minds.

183
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,740
<i>How can I know when you haven't told me?</i>

184
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,870
<i>I was diagnosed with cancer.</i>

185
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,160
<i>Colorectal cancer.</i>

186
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,270
Min-seok, where are you?

187
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,520
The complaint against you...

188
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,650
That bastard who hurt himself.

189
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,070
Have you been to his home?

190
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,490
He wouldn't come out,
so I couldn't meet him.

191
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,280
His wife said

192
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,950
that he went to a hospital for his pain.

193
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,960
She wouldn't tell me where.

194
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,180
We came by after

195
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,060
wrapping up a scene.

196
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,780
Sir.

197
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,990
What am I going to do?

198
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,280
His injuries were self-inflicted,

199
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,830
but there's no way to prove that.

200
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,200
What does he say

201
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:57,120
about him bashing his head on the floor?

202
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,040
I was just on the phone with Min-seok.

203
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,340
According to this man,

204
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,090
he remembers hitting his head
after Min-seok pushed him.

205
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:08,090
But he blacked out afterwards
because of the pain.

206
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,510
He said he floundered in agony.

207
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,470
His body just bounced because of
the pain thus hitting his head repeatedly.

208
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,850
That crazy psycho is full of shit.

209
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,980
Is he a ball?
Why would his body bounce like that?

210
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,360
Did they do an MRI scan?

211
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,570
It was clean, of course.

212
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,360
He's lying.

213
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,830
Min-seok got himself caught up
with a nasty one.

214
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,950
How much is he willing to settle for?

215
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,330
Fifty million won
for both civil and criminal charges.

216
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,380
Fifty million won for a few stitches?

217
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,470
He hit the police jackpot.

218
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,100
He knows that

219
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,430
police brutality cases
can ruin our careers.

220
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,020
Right.

221
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,440
What about Su-man's family?

222
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,020
His brother is here,

223
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,020
and his kids are on their way.

224
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,150
That reminds me. Se-chan called.

225
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,030
Who? The former police officer

226
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,070
who's now a lawyer? That Kang Se-chan?

227
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,320
Will he take this case?

228
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,870
Thankfully, yes.

229
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,040
That's great.

230
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,040
Have you met with Su-man's doctor?

231
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,880
Su-man will live,

232
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,500
but his facial wounds are deep.

233
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,180
Sang-su is guarding the operation room.

234
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,640
The surgery won't end
until after midnight,

235
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,100
so go back to the division.
You're in no shape to stay up all night.

236
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:39,980
Jeez.

237
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,070
I talked to the head of
the Retired Police Association.

238
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,440
He's willing

239
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,530
to raise the money

240
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,990
for the surgery.

241
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,040
That's very generous.

242
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,340
-Where are you going?
-To the division.

243
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:12,300
Chief, can we go somewhere and talk?

244
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,970
-Chief!
-You should go with him.

245
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,560
Damn it!

246
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,520
He has cancer.
Why is he trying to work more?

247
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,190
<i>Code one, code one. A 70-year-old old lady</i>

248
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,650
<i>is unconscious
at Byul Sauna in Hongwon 1-dong.</i>

249
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,280
<i>Officers in the area, please respond.</i>

250
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:34,490
<i>Code one, code one.</i>

251
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,910
<i>A 70-year-old old lady at Byul Sauna--</i>

252
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,410
Patrol 23 responding to the old lady

253
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,160
at Byul Sauna. Last call.

254
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,430
Each project requires
a different type of wood.

255
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,270
What will you be using it for?

256
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,480
I'm making a gun.

257
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,550
<i>Code zero. Hit-and-run vehicle
is fleeing the scene.</i>

258
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,460
-Can't we get a break around here?
-<i>Code zero.</i>

259
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,460
<i>Hit-and-run vehicle...</i>

260
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,090
No wonder Chief Ki is sick.

261
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,470
If he's out of commission,
who will take over?

262
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,510
Captain Eun?

263
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,640
You can't do it, right?

264
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,810
I don't want Captain Eun
to be interim assistant chief.

265
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,520
He's a snob

266
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,320
and will be tough on our grades.

267
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,900
Is that all you can
worry about at this moment,

268
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,320
you cold-hearted jerk?

269
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:02,620
From where I stand, it's a big deal.
I'm being realistic.

270
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:07,870
Jeez, you sure are realistic.

271
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:10,590
Sang-su.

272
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:19,080
they say you can survive being in
a lion's den, if you keep your cool.

273
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,290
If you're selfish enough to think of
yourself regardless of the situation,

274
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,590
you'll surely have a great career
as a police officer.

275
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,550
Yang-chon must have taught you well.

276
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,670
Do you get private lessons?

277
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,050
Sir, I'm sorry!

278
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,100
I didn't mean it like that.

279
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,390
I'm truly sorry.

280
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,820
Why are you in the women's restroom?

281
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,950
The chief, captain, and lieutenants
are holding at a meeting.

282
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,250
We're waiting here since

283
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,710
the men's rest area and cafeteria

284
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,540
are occupied by Team Two.

285
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,710
So what's up

286
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,170
with you two?

287
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,180
Right, you broke up.

288
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,520
I knew that.

289
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,850
This is a colossal mess.

290
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,360
Min-seok lives in a rental apartment
and pays 500,000 won for rent.

291
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,990
He's also taking care of his mom
who's suffering from cancer.

292
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,820
Where would he get 50 million won?

293
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,610
Does his fiancee know?

294
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,700
No.

295
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,120
He's afraid that

296
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,790
she'll call off the wedding
if she finds out.

297
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,200
Let's reveal everything in court.

298
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,830
Just look at this.

299
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,670
Anyone can see it's self-inflicted.

300
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,840
Everyone here knows that.

301
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,760
But how will we prove that
it was self-inflicted?

302
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,550
A doctor's hands are tied
if a patient cries in pain.

303
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,390
Besides, it's a fact that Min-seok

304
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,100
shoved this man.

305
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,220
He had a reason to do so.

306
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,810
He hit another civilian, so--

307
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:04,810
Does Internal Affairs care
about such circumstances?

308
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,850
All they care about is the manual.

309
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,900
They'll ask why he pushed a civilian.

310
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,440
They'll only look at that one fact
and hound Min-seok about it.

311
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:14,740
That's their job.

312
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,160
So, what are you thinking?

313
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,580
-Let's go and kneel.
-Let's go and kneel.

314
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,870
What?

315
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,130
We, cops, should kneel?

316
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:31,880
It's not fair, but we need to settle.

317
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,090
That's my conclusion.

318
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,880
It'll get complicated
if Min-seok's charged.

319
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,550
Settle it.

320
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:39,760
We have to make the prosecutor
suspend the indictment.

321
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,720
If this goes to court
and Min-seok gets probation,

322
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,520
he'll have to leave the force.

323
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,440
Even if this happened
while he was on duty,

324
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,860
if he's charged in civil
and criminal courts,

325
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,230
Min-seok will have to find a lawyer

326
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,440
and prove his innocence all on his own.

327
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,780
He could get a suspended sentence.

328
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,240
Even if his sentence is suspended,

329
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,450
Internal Affairs and
prosecutors will grill him.

330
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,580
Dealing with all that will kill Min-seok
before anything happens.

331
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,920
Something similar happened

332
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,340
to another cop who was investigated
and sued.

333
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,340
He felt so insulted that
he killed himself.

334
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,720
A trial's too much.

335
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,720
Do as I say.

336
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,260
This is so upsetting.

337
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:23,930
From our division,

338
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:27,680
I'm one of the guys
who is older than the plaintiff so I'll--

339
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,440
You stay out of it.

340
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,810
You want to get involved in everything.

341
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:35,860
He's right.

342
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,820
You're our leader. Stay out of this one.

343
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:42,320
So Sam-bo, Gyeong-mo and me.

344
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,490
We'll meet the plaintiff

345
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,490
and kneel and beg.

346
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:48,250
Let's get him to settle
for a lower amount.

347
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,540
Once we reach a figure,
we can all pitch in.

348
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,420
Let's get the officers from
Min-seok's year to chip in too.

349
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,710
Yes, let's do that.

350
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,340
All we have are our fellow officers.

351
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,140
That's it, then.
This issue has been dealt with.

352
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,430
Now

353
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,810
let's talk about you, Boss.

354
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:09,100
What are you doing to us?

355
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,730
Gyeong-mo.

356
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,940
How could you make us

357
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,650
find out you're sick over the radio?

358
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,440
Does that make sense?

359
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,460
Okay.

360
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,920
About my condition.

361
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,010
Neither the doctor nor I

362
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,800
are sure of anything.

363
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:48,140
My doctor said there are many tumors,
but they're a mix of benign and malignant.

364
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,770
It could be stage one or stage three.

365
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,850
He can't say for sure right now.

366
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,900
He has to open me up

367
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,690
to find out.

368
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:05,200
So I suggested he do that.

369
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:10,080
The surgery is before noon
the day after tomorrow.

370
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,040
I'll be admitted

371
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:15,670
this afternoon.

372
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,630
I couldn't tell any of you

373
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,600
for only one reason.

374
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,640
It was

375
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:35,650
because I felt sorry for
the one who'd have to fill in.

376
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,070
Eun Gyeong-mo.

377
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,860
That would be you.

378
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,220
Sam-bo.

379
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,560
You should go and see Hye-ri.

380
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,190
Go home

381
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:21,820
and get some sleep first.

382
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:24,110
Go on.

383
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,280
I know how you feel.

384
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,120
Pray that my surgery goes well.

385
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,500
I'll visit you.

386
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,640
Yang-chon, you fool, Gyeong-mo--

387
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,310
I won't be disobedient.

388
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,690
I'll serve him as I did you.

389
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,150
Just focus on your surgery.

390
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:10,570
Go.

391
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,200
Don't leave Jang-mi on her own
on a day like this.

392
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,750
You know that cancer
is nothing these days, right?

393
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,420
You'd better beat it.

394
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,220
I will.

395
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,670
Ki Han-sol

396
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,960
has colorectal cancer.

397
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,800
He doesn't know if
it's stage one or three.

398
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,170
They need to open up and see.

399
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,090
Don't bug him with your well wishes.

400
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,720
-Just go home.
-Sir.

401
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,850
Shut your mouth.

402
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,600
None of you

403
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,100
say anything.

404
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,650
Don't say a thing

405
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,730
to me at all.

406
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,150
Should we see the chief?

407
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:34,490
No, let's listen to the captain.
Let's go home.

408
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,080
Okay, let's go.

409
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,040
They cure most cancers these days, right?

410
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,750
Yes, they do.

411
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:12,860
Hey, where are you?

412
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,780
<i>What worries you the most?</i>

413
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,160
Well...

414
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,040
My weak wife.

415
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,170
<i>My newlywed daughter.</i>

416
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,930
<i>Will I be able to return to work?
Things like that.</i>

417
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,310
As of this moment,

418
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:41,810
be selfish.

419
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,100
<i>Put yourself first at all times.</i>

420
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:49,400
You got cancer for working
your butt off your whole life.

421
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:53,150
Why are you worrying about others?

422
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:58,580
You need to survive
to care for your wife and daughter.

423
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,830
<i>Without you,</i>

424
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:03,750
<i>how could your wife,
daughter and we exist?</i>

425
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,540
Don't worry about anyone else.

426
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,710
Starting right now,

427
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,420
your health,

428
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,420
your recovery.

429
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,640
That's all you should care about.

430
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:21,970
<i>After the surgery,</i>

431
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:24,640
<i>even if it's stage one,</i>

432
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,900
don't you dare think about coming back to

433
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:29,980
Hongil Patrol Division.

434
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,780
The police corporal position
at Bomun Station.

435
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:44,200
Make sure you're the one
who ends up going. Not him.

436
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,290
Answer me.

437
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,840
Okay.

438
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,970
You promised.

439
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:59,180
-Now Ki Han-sol will--
<i>-Fine, I'll be selfish.</i>

440
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,600
I'll put myself first.

441
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,350
I will survive.

442
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,980
<i>I'll live, not die.</i>

443
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,900
<i>Forget about my wife,</i>

444
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,940
daughter, loyal officers.

445
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,230
I'll think of myself first.

446
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,950
I hope

447
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:22,910
the surgery goes well.

448
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,250
Thanks.

449
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:31,330
You fool. We aren't strangers.

450
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,910
WIFE

451
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,410
WIFE

452
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:13,540
Goodness, it's my wife.

453
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:19,300
Our daughter must've told you.

454
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,300
Gosh, don't cry.
I'll be fine after the surgery.

455
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,430
You see,

456
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,520
this is exactly why I couldn't tell you.

457
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,480
This is why I've kept it from you.

458
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,030
Enough already. I'm not dying, okay?

459
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,320
Stop crying already.

460
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:47,490
I told you to stop crying.

461
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,220
Dad, are you back for good?

462
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,970
No.

463
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,390
You're so annoying.
Just move back already.

464
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,150
You brat.

465
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,110
Aren't you happier without my nagging?

466
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,070
You're just saying that, right?

467
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:28,660
I'm so annoyed.

468
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:30,540
What's annoying you?

469
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,210
You'd better not tell me
to work hard from now on.

470
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,540
-What?
-Aren't I right?

471
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:39,880
What good comes out of working hard?
Look at you and Mom.

472
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,970
Let's be honest.

473
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:46,090
You two are probably the most honest cops,

474
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:50,220
but the force reprimanded you severely
instead of rewarding you.

475
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,770
It's so crazy.

476
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:54,560
"Reprimanded"?

477
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:56,560
Haven't you heard?

478
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,190
Ask Mom about it, then.

479
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,240
Why did you call? What's up?

480
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,500
Why aren't you saying anything?
You called me.

481
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,380
<i>We heard that the police
didn't look into the case</i>

482
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,960
<i>immediately after receiving a call
about it. Why did it happen?</i>

483
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,760
<i>You must be watching the news about me.</i>

484
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,010
That's so annoying.

485
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:31,100
Why are they showing that over and over?

486
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,560
-Don't watch it.
<i>-The chief just said</i>

487
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,850
<i>that he'll severely reprimand
who was in charge.</i>

488
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,480
<i>Captain, what's your thought on it?</i>

489
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,400
<i>Father,
I'm not trying to give you an excuse.</i>

490
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,150
-<i>I really didn't do anything wrong.
-The police failed to...</i>

491
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,570
I already know that.

492
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,200
You'd never do anything wrong.

493
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,410
You always do a good job no matter what.

494
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,040
I'm okay.

495
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:54,910
I won't be discouraged by this.

496
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,750
I'm a little upset, but I'll be fine soon.

497
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,250
<i>Everyone in the country is enraged by...</i>

498
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:06,130
<i>You probably called to console me,
but you don't know what to say, right?</i>

499
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,130
<i>Since you've never done it before.</i>

500
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,550
-You're right.
-<i>The police's abuse of power...</i>

501
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,350
<i>Just the fact that you called is enough.</i>

502
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:16,890
Thanks. You made me feel better.

503
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:21,650
Yang-chon is here.
I'll pass the phone to him.

504
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,070
Dad, I can't come home.

505
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,450
I'll get some sleep here and--

506
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,450
<i>There's nothing here but this old man.</i>

507
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,040
Why would you even come here?

508
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,160
Just live there.

509
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,420
<i>A complaint has been submitted.</i>

510
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:44,050
<i>The police and the prosecution are
currently locking horns with each other</i>

511
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:47,220
<i>over investigative powers surrounding...</i>

512
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,890
Those bastards.

513
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:12,530
Why are you drinking?

514
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,740
I'm off today,

515
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,620
but don't you have to work?

516
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,370
They told me to take a break.

517
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:23,210
-I've been suspended.
-You got suspended, not a pay cut?

518
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:24,960
They obviously can't stand me.

519
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,800
They want me to get lost.

520
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:39,020
All of my achievements so far...

521
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,900
went down the drain.

522
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,570
That means
I'll never get a medal until I retire

523
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,440
no matter how hard I work from now on.

524
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:54,410
Until the day I retire, I'll have to live

525
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,870
with the disgrace
that I was reprimanded severely.

526
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,710
Both of us have been reprimanded harshly.

527
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,380
Don't you think it's funny?

528
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,380
People who don't know us

529
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:09,760
will assume that we're traitors
who betrayed our country.

530
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,060
There's no guarantee that

531
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,310
this will never happen again
if I transfer to another station,

532
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:23,270
and it'll be hard to adjust.

533
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:26,060
Shall I just leave the force?

534
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,030
I joined the force without any sense
of duty just to earn a living,

535
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,610
so I think I can quit.

536
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,160
Should we both quit?

537
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,790
I'm sure we'll be able
to earn a living somehow.

538
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,040
Even if I work in construction,

539
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,830
I'm confident
that I can support our family.

540
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,130
That makes me feel safe.

541
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,380
I'm sleepy all of a sudden.

542
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,100
I didn't get any sleep
because I was so furious all night.

543
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,310
Get some sleep.

544
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:02,480
I need to change the sheets too.

545
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,020
I haven't changed my sheets for two weeks
because I've been so busy.

546
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,810
I'll do it for you.

547
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,600
You should get some sleep too.
You worked all night.

548
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,390
I'll sleep in the living room.

549
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,310
Just sleep here.

550
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,240
Sleep beside me, you fool.

551
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,960
Sleep beside me, you fool.

552
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,180
Let me put this in the hamper first.

553
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:01,340
What time is it now?

554
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:03,180
Around 3 p.m.

555
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:08,680
Our sleep schedule is all over the place.

556
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:12,900
It's like we travel to the US and have to
adjust to a new time zone every week.

557
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,570
I still can't get used to it.

558
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:21,910
My head hurts even when I sleep.

559
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:23,410
I'm hungry.

560
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,790
Go to your place and eat something.

561
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:51,480
Jeong-o, Mom's here.

562
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,690
Those two sleep together all the time.

563
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,320
Quite often at that.

564
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,910
You should grab some coffee at my place.

565
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:06,820
They must be tired, let's let them sleep.

566
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,830
You didn't have
to bring her all this food.

567
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,620
I take good care of her.

568
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,710
-But--
-Come on. Let's go.

569
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:45,820
RICE CAKE MILL

570
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,750
Hye-ri?

571
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:05,170
What are you doing here?

572
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:20,480
Finish your coffee, so we can leave.

573
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,990
This is what I think.

574
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:29,070
If you were my daughter,

575
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,240
I'd have you quit the force.

576
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:35,120
I didn't come here to persuade you

577
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,080
to stay on the job.

578
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,960
Quit if it's that hard on you.

579
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,920
It doesn't make you a loser.

580
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:44,800
Why would you choose

581
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,050
to look at corpses
and fight nasty criminals

582
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:49,680
for a living?

583
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,930
You're young,

584
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:54,270
and there are many things
for you to do in this world.

585
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:56,850
Don't let your pride

586
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:59,560
force you to do a scary job.

587
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,060
It's not right.

588
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:04,860
You don't have to do it. Really.

589
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:09,280
Think about it

590
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:11,530
for a few more days.

591
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,370
I'll get going.

592
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:22,710
You're hilarious, you know that?

593
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:25,880
I'm your colleague, not your daughter.

594
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:29,510
This is why I hate you so much.

595
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:31,300
You don't treat me as your equal.

596
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,310
When a colleague is in distress,

597
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:37,060
you should say, "Endure it. Overcome it.

598
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,850
and I trust you."

599
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:40,850
That's what you should say.

600
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:42,940
How can you tell me to quit?

601
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:47,030
I'm going to overcome any hurdle
regardless of how hard it is.

602
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:50,820
I will be just like you

603
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:53,570
and stay composed when facing a corpse.

604
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:55,490
I will calmly help

605
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,660
those alive and in need.

606
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:01,710
I will be a better police officer than

607
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,040
Senior Officer Choi and Lieutenant Oh.

608
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:09,170
Just wait and see how good of an officer
I become.

609
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,100
That brat.

610
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,610
She sure is stubborn.

611
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:29,190
My goodness.

612
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:41,290
How did your father hurt his hand?

613
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:43,830
It's a secret.

614
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,960
So when exactly do you retire?

615
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:49,670
Next Friday.

616
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:54,140
Once I leave, Nam-il will take you
under his wings for a while.

617
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:56,720
They can't assign anyone new
to our division right now.

618
00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:00,060
Are you happy to now
roll with younger officers?

619
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:02,480
Of course I am.

620
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:13,200
RICE CAKE MILL

Han-sol...

623
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:53,360
Su-man.

624
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,700
Your son must have stepped out.

625
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:01,790
I'm sorry.

626
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,130
I know it's hard to talk, so don't speak.

627
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,050
I just...

628
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:13,670
I just came to see how you were.

629
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:17,130
You're good now.

630
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:19,220
I'm glad you're alive.

631
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:23,560
When

632
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,230
is your surgery?

633
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:29,650
Tomorrow

634
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,400
afternoon.

635
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,810
<i>Gamma Intersection.
A 50-year-old male pedestrian</i>

636
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,780
<i>-collided with a motorcycle.
-Patrol 12 responding.</i>

637
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:17,150
<i>A 30-year-old male was reported
of dine and dash.</i>

638
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,700
<i>Patrol 15 responding. Last call.</i>

639
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:21,700
<i>Patrol 15 responding. Last call.</i>

640
00:47:57,990 --> 00:47:59,070
I can't tolerate this.

641
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:04,200
Police officers commit suicide more
than any other civil employee,

642
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:08,250
and their average lifespan
is about 63 years.

643
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:12,750
I didn't understand it
even while being on the job myself.

644
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,840
But now that I've been burned
by my own people,

645
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,720
I can understand how
those statistics came to be.

646
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:27,220
Enemies of police officers
aren't annoying civilian complaints.

647
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:30,890
It's our country that
spits us out after using us.

648
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:33,270
I get it now.

649
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:35,900
Captain An, you have never

650
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,570
been a disgrace to the force.

651
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:42,490
Do you

652
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,870
ever regret becoming a cop?

653
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:46,160
No.

654
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:50,040
Who else gets to personally save civilians

655
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,750
except us and firemen?

656
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:54,880
I admire your simplicity.

657
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:57,880
Me and you.

658
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,960
We...

659
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:02,220
We're outstanding officers.

660
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,970
We have saved countless lives

661
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,550
and have been honorable.

662
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,930
We're the best cop couple there is.

663
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:11,020
This country and this world need us.

664
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:15,520
Also, the chief and section chief

665
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:18,900
are sons of bitches,
sleazeballs, dirtbags,

666
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:20,990
and are less than cockroaches and animals.

667
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:22,440
They have no honor at all.

668
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:25,450
They're rats who suck on
taxpayer´s precious money.

669
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:29,540
When did you become a rapper?

670
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,620
I'll keep going.

671
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:38,790
Those bastards

672
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:41,130
are slimeballs.

673
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:44,760
Eating those scumbags alive
won't ease our anger.

674
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:48,180
Eating those scumbags alive
won't ease our anger.

675
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:49,970
Stop it. You're tickling me.

676
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:53,350
How dare they...

677
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:56,650
Those bastards have some nerve
suspending you.

678
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:58,060
Shitheads.

679
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:00,190
What a load of fuckers.

680
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,070
-They're disgusting like snot.
-Stop it. You're tickling me!

681
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:13,000
Taking you in my arms
while calling you Captain An

682
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,040
made it seem like an affair.

683
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:19,340
-We sleep together during the day, and--
-Stop it already.

684
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:23,260
You got a text!

685
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:34,060
<i>To me, the most inspiring officer</i>

686
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:36,230
<i>is not Lieutenant Oh.</i>

687
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,690
<i>To me, it will always be you.</i>

688
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:41,820
<i>Hang in there.</i>

689
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:44,320
<i>I have nothing but respect</i>

690
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,030
<i>and love for you.</i>

691
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:53,870
This isn't fair!

692
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:56,910
This isn't fair.

693
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:02,340
How could those bastards do this to me?

694
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:04,210
How could they?

695
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:21,020
Apologize.

696
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:23,730
How could you say that to your daughter?

697
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,730
How am I sleeping around?

698
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,440
Don't you see why I said that?

699
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:31,370
Why would you sleep with a man?
And on his arm too?

700
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:33,370
I moved in my sleep and--

701
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:36,500
Your mistake was sleeping
next to him in the first place.

702
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:40,830
Sang-su's mom said to me outright

703
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,790
that she'd love you to be
her daughter-in-law.

704
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,590
Sang-su grins and says he likes you a lot,

705
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:48,010
and you just sleep with him.

706
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:51,470
Anyway, whatever the case,

707
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,140
I will never let you get married.

708
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,220
You have to live with me forever.

709
00:51:56,810 --> 00:51:57,930
What is this, <i>Misery?</i>

710
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,100
Why should I live with you forever?

711
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:02,310
I want to get married
and have two or three kids.

712
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,110
I don't want to hear that.

713
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:08,110
You said last time that
cops can go abroad too.

714
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:09,650
You can get transferred abroad.

715
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:12,280
Apply for that. Move abroad!

716
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,200
Mom.

717
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,620
Stay the night. Don't go home in the dark.

718
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:20,080
If I spend the night here,
what about the cafe?

719
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:21,960
Come home more often.

720
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,590
You're killing me, you know that?

721
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:28,420
Take care. Call me when you're on the bus.

722
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:53,160
It looks like your mom left.

723
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:54,990
Did she?

724
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,380
Why did you cause this fuss
by saying you like me?

725
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:08,250
My mom thinks we slept together.

726
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:11,630
If we were dating and we'd kissed,

727
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,340
then I wouldn't feel this bad.

728
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:21,060
You're crazy.

729
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:23,390
You lost your mind.

730
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:26,650
You said you wouldn't
feel bad if we kissed.

731
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:27,940
I don't want you to feel bad.

732
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:35,490
You lost your mind, didn't you?
How dare you do that to me?

733
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:38,080
What is wrong with you?

734
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,040
Hey, let go of me.

735
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,540
Let me go.

736
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,580
Jeong-o.

737
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,460
I got dumped a lot of times in the past.

738
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:50,250
If you

739
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:52,920
keep on saying you don't like me,
even as a joke,

740
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:55,930
I might take it seriously
and feel really bad.

741
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,390
I like you a lot.

742
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:05,390
Don't you like me?

743
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,690
Does kissing me gross you out?

744
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:14,110
People say that they like
playing hard to get,

745
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:18,200
but I'm not good at that.

746
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:21,080
My saying I like you.

747
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:27,620
Does it bother you?

748
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:32,000
Tell me.

749
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:35,130
Should I stop liking you?

750
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:41,760
Then I'll stop.

751
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:09,430
Damn it.

752
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:14,310
As soon as we go inside,
let's not say much.

753
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:18,110
We'll walk right in there
and start begging.

754
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:21,410
We'll go on our knees

755
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:23,370
and put our pride aside.

756
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:25,620
We'll beg like we never begged before.

757
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,080
Ask for his forgiveness.

758
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,960
Let's get the amount down
as much as possible.

759
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:35,130
Why are we even here

760
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:37,340
right before our shift
because of this bastard?

761
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:38,760
Hey.

762
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,300
Why would you call him a bastard?

763
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:41,630
You stay here then.

764
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,930
He can't do that.
He's standing in for Han-sol.

765
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:46,260
We need him so
we have something to show for.

766
00:56:46,350 --> 00:56:47,890
Hold back.

767
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:49,430
Sorry about this.

768
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,310
It's not about you.
It's about the scumbag.

769
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,020
I'm here too.

770
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:57,320
-You shouldn't have come.
-Leave.

771
00:56:58,030 --> 00:56:59,440
The others wanted to come too,

772
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:01,990
but we told them not to,
because this situation is embarrassing.

773
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:03,410
Why are you here?

774
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:05,660
He should back up his partner.

775
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,450
I'm glad you came.

776
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:09,120
Right. You should be here.

777
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:12,460
I guess you should be here after all.

778
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,170
Let's go.

779
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,460
I'll say it again.

780
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:18,300
As soon as we get in there, we beg.

781
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,210
Not because we did something wrong

782
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,590
but for Min-seok.

783
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:24,130
Don't get riled up.
Control your tempers and--

784
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:25,890
Are you crazy?

785
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:27,100
Stop repeating yourself.

786
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:28,930
We knelt before

787
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:30,600
our wives many times.

788
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:34,310
Do you think he ever had to
go down on his knees before?

789
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:36,100
This is his first time.

790
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:38,400
He's flustered, that's all.

791
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:40,530
Let's go.

792
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,570
We'll kneel and...

793
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:48,200
Why are you all here?

794
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:52,960
You jerks. You violent police bastards.

795
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,620
Hey.

796
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:58,340
Hit me again. Go on.

797
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,050
Hit me again, you jerk.

798
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:06,130
Hey. I bet you get paid a lot.

799
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:07,510
Your salary

800
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:10,640
comes out of the tax I pay, okay?

801
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,850
I pay a lot of taxes, you know?

802
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:17,900
I apologize, sir.

803
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:20,070
I don't know what else to say.

804
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:22,070
I apologize, sir. I'm sorry.

805
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:24,740
Think of this as saving a man's life.

806
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:27,700
Please forgive him, sir.

807
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:29,410
Are you cops?

808
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:31,490
Tell me.

809
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:34,330
What cops beat civilians up?

810
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:36,210
What if I never get to use
my right arm again?

811
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,380
Tell me, you assholes.

812
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:42,800
Tell me, you stupid pigs!

813
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:47,260
Sir, I apologize.

814
00:58:47,970 --> 00:58:48,890
Sorry, sir.

815
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:52,390
Please show us some mercy this one time.

816
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:04,860
I'm sorry, sir.

817
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,490
First you hit me and now
you kneel and beg?

818
00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:09,700
Why?

819
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:12,370
Are you scared that
you'll lose your badge?

820
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:15,370
Are you? Huh?

821
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:18,080
Damn it.

822
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:39,140
Honey. Good luck in there.

823
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:42,900
Thanks. I'll hang in there.

824
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,570
Dad. Be strong.

825
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:49,780
Thanks.

826
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:07,340
<i>It'll be another one or two hours.</i>

827
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:10,760
None of us could make it
because we're all on duty.

828
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,350
<i>He told me that he scheduled</i>

829
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:15,850
<i>his surgery for today on purpose.</i>

830
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:18,850
Ma'am, I'm sure he'll be fine.

831
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:20,270
Be strong.

832
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:21,690
Cheer up.

833
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:23,810
-Hang in there.
-Be strong.

834
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:26,480
<i>-I will.
-Call me when he comes out.</i>

835
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:27,780
I'd like to hear the results.

836
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:29,650
Take care.

837
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,450
I'll pay three million.

838
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,160
Nice.

839
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:39,450
-Thank you.
-That's gross.

840
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:40,790
Two million from me.

841
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:42,250
And me.

842
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:44,380
-What?
-Why two million?

843
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,290
-Just give one.
-Yes.

844
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:48,210
-Even half a million's fine.
-Right.

845
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:50,970
Give half a million. You retire soon.

846
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:52,590
You're all fools.

847
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:54,300
Yes, I retire soon.

848
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:57,430
Can't I give that much to help Min-seok?

849
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,310
Huh? Are you disregarding me?

850
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:00,730
God damn.

851
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:02,770
I get that you want to help,

852
01:01:02,890 --> 01:01:04,310
but it's still too much.

853
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:05,610
You're inspiring, Sam-bo.

854
01:01:09,610 --> 01:01:10,780
To lower the settlement,

855
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:13,070
four middle-aged men...

856
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:17,330
knelt and bowed down to another man.

857
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:19,580
Damn it.

858
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:21,660
That piece of shit.

859
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:24,250
Damn!

860
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,000
So how much have we raised so far?

861
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,760
Coming up with the full 40 million won
will be a problem.

862
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,510
Recently in Daegu,

863
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:38,430
a young rookie officer
suddenly died on his way home.

864
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:43,310
It wasn't deemed as a death on the job,
so they're raising money for his family.

865
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:50,940
When ordering us around,

866
01:01:51,530 --> 01:01:53,950
they entice us by saying
we serve the people

867
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:55,360
and are judges of the streets.

868
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:58,070
But when we die or get injured,

869
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:00,660
they discard us like worn-out shoes.

870
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:12,590
I asked our colleagues
to raise ten million won,

871
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,550
but it came short at 6.2 million won.

872
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:17,720
What do we do? It's not enough.

873
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:22,390
Team Two, Three, and Four
are raising money via social media.

874
01:02:22,930 --> 01:02:25,390
Sang-su, Jeong-o, Hye-ri
will see how much we got.

875
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:26,730
But

876
01:02:27,650 --> 01:02:29,060
there wasn't enough time.

877
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:32,110
I don't think we'll meet the deadline.

878
01:02:36,070 --> 01:02:38,620
We'll hang in there and do what we can.

879
01:02:39,570 --> 01:02:41,910
I should've pitched in a million won too.

880
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:43,910
I'm sorry I only handed in half.

881
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:54,380
I'm sorry

882
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:56,260
for dragging you through this.

883
01:02:57,510 --> 01:02:59,760
-Don't say that.
-Please don't be sorry.

884
01:02:59,970 --> 01:03:02,010
It's all right, so don't say that.

885
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,680
Hang in there, all right?

886
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:07,600
Go back to work.

887
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:12,940
It'll all be all right.

888
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:21,160
Team Two, Three, and Four
raised 8.1 million won.

889
01:03:22,990 --> 01:03:25,830
Some of the officers
think Min-seok is to blame.

890
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:30,960
Well, they're entitled to their opinions.

891
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:33,750
Like Chief Ki said,

892
01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:37,720
we notified the teams that
the rookies won't have to pay,

893
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:40,970
but we're all willing to pitch in, sir.

894
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,730
We still have a long way to go.

895
01:03:48,350 --> 01:03:52,060
We still have time,
so keep the account open. We can do this.

896
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:57,820
Why did Seung-jae ask
for the day off today?

897
01:03:58,650 --> 01:04:00,990
-It's what really happened.
-Really?

898
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:03,990
Old police officers
knelt before me in a line

899
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,620
and asked humbly for my forgiveness.

900
01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:10,040
It must've been quite hilarious!

901
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:12,880
-I can't believe I missed it.
-You should've come sooner.

902
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,750
Wait. Hold on a second.

903
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:18,300
Can't you really move your arm?

904
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:23,390
Of course I can't. See for yourself. Look.

905
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:25,220
I can't move it at all.

906
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:27,640
-Has he been fooled all his life?
-Stop bragging.

907
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:30,440
-Put your arm around me too.
-Don't brag.

908
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:31,900
What's there to brag?

909
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:33,560
I drove this car for 20 years.

910
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:37,110
Who are you to say it should be scrapped?

911
01:04:37,190 --> 01:04:40,110
Then find another mechanic
because it can't be fixed.

912
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:42,200
What a pain in the ass.

913
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:58,090
-What do you think you're doing?
-Let go of me!

914
01:05:07,310 --> 01:05:08,970
A man has been assaulted.

915
01:05:09,850 --> 01:05:10,730
Some crazy bastard...

916
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:13,980
He attacked a man with a monkey spanner.

917
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:28,280
Damn it.

918
01:05:33,870 --> 01:05:35,460

939

It's stage one cancer,
so chemotherapy isn't needed.
