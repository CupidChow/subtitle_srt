EPISODE 8

3
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,646
FROM JU-YEONG

4
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,065
<i>As I promised you,</i>

5
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:08,610
<i>I visit Ho-cheol's wife
whenever I get the chance to.</i>

6
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,320
<i>And I deliver your money</i>

7
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,113
<i>to her every time.</i>

8
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,699
<i>Let's have dinner together sometime.</i>

9
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,994
Do you send money to Ho-cheol's wife?

10
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,418
You even got a demotion
because of Ju-yeong.

11
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,961
Why would you stay in touch with him?

12
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,631
Go away, will you?

13
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,347
Are you going to go on the retreat?

14
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,723
Forget about the retreat!

15
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,601
I don't want to do
voluntary work when I'm off.

16
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:44,437
I want to meet a girlfriend
and get married.

17
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,274
We should get some rest when we're off.

18
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:49,901
Did you hear that?

19
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:52,070
No one wants to go on the retreat.

20
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,155
Are we going on a retreat? I like that.

21
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,408
I didn't ask you. Darn it!

22
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,409
I'm in.

23
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:01,663
All right. It's 3 to 3 now.

24
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,791
Myeong-ho has been telling me
that he wants to go on a retreat.

25
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,960
The game's over. We're going.

26
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,629
We should also ask Sam-bo and Hye-ri.

27
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,465
I'm sure Nam-il will be against it,

28
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,800
and Jeong-o will say no too.

29
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,845
If you think about it,
more people are against going.

30
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,514
Just go with people who want to go.

31
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,725
Why are you being so dictatorial
in the democratic country?

32
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,060
Darn.

33
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:27,355
It has already been decided.
Why are you complaining about it?

34
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,941
Do you think it's democratic
to change your minds constantly?

35
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:33,695
I planned this retreat
even though I didn't want to go

36
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,113
because you guys begged me.

37
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,031
Why would you go back on your word now?

38
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,741
He hurt his head and got cut with a knife.

39
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,410
I injured my leg.

40
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,121
And I don't get along well with these two.

41
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,499
We should resolve our problems
at the retreat.

42
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,751
You and I can talk things out,

43
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,129
and you can do the same with him.

44
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,673
Why? Do you want to avoid me?

45
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,842
How can you avoid each other
when we're a family here?

46
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,886
You can't even divorce him.

47
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,096
Sang-su,
be the treasurer for this retreat.

48
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,391
The fee is 100,000 won for seniors
and 70,000 won for juniors.

49
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,643
Just collect the fees among the rookies.

50
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:06,644
Gyeong-mo!

51
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:11,941
We'll leave after work around 2 p.m.
So you'll have time for a nap.

52
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,819
-Okay.
-All right. Let's go.

53
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,989
I'll show you what a retreat
from hell is like.

54
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,951
I'll fight you guys on this for cash.

55
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:25,079
All right. There will be a rival match.

56
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,749
How is this a rival match?
It's two against one.

57
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:31,544
How can they be my rivals
when I don't acknowledge them?

58
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,630
You're all dead meat.

59
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:37,217
All right. Bring it on!

60
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,885
All right.

61
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,596
So it's been decided.
We're going on the retreat.

62
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,265
Sang-su, let's go to the hospital.

63
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,600
<i>Code One.</i>

64
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,560
<i>Report of a molestation
at a subway station.</i>

65
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,103
<i>-Hongdae Station, exit 1.</i>
- Damn it!

66
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,313
Won-u. It's an incident.

67
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,523
Hurry. Let's go.

68
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,776
I'm sorry.
I'm going to the hospital with Hye-ri

69
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,778
to interview the suspect
of the Hongil Park case.

70
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,196
Okay. Hurry.

71
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,822
Sang-su, put away the bedding.

72
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,741
Hye-ri, help Sang-su.

73
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,660
It's not just a drunk man.

74
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,287
The molester is on the run,
so you could get hurt.

75
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,790
Make sure to ensure your safety, okay?

76
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,878
Choi Myeong-ho, Kim Han-pyo.

77
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,090
We're three minutes away from
from 118-1 Mahak-gil.

78
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,677
We're acting as though we're on patrol.

79
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,190
Hey, Jeong-o.

80
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,953
<i>Sergeant Kang Nam-il
and Officer Han Jeong-o.</i>

81
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,289
<i>We've arrived at the scene
and are patrolling the area.</i>

82
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:57,005
There will be a lot of female victims

83
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,798
<i>in this case.</i>

84
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,800
<i>Han Jeong-o.</i>

85
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,511
I won't make a mistake like last time.

86
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,878
Two perps are tailing you.

87
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,811
Is something wrong?

88
00:05:57,273 --> 00:06:00,234
Do you need some help?

89
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,117
No. Just keep walking.

90
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,539
Officer Han.

91
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:15,792
You should patrol this area.

92
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:20,171
Be careful on your way.
This is a crime-ridden district.

93
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:31,682
-Don't overreact.
-Yes, sir.

94
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,352
We should patrol the area
until further notice.

95
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,730
Go left.

96
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,990
<i>The perps are gathered at the house.</i>

97
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,617
What are you doing? Hurry up!

98
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:53,079
The suspect of the assault case
in the parking lot of Dongjin Officetel,

99
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,164
and a man who seems to be an organizer

100
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,125
have appeared from inside the house.

101
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,086
<i>We'll arrest them on the spot
if we find any women here.</i>

102
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,130
<i>Make sure to stay on patrol</i>

103
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,507
<i>at your location
until further instructions.</i>

104
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,884
<i>Kang Nam-il and Han Jeong-o</i>

105
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:10,012
<i>will stay within a 100-meter radius
of 118-1 Mahak-gil.</i>

106
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,099
<i>Make sure you are able to come
to the scene upon instruction.</i>

107
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,358
Look at her.

108
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,861
She's trying to buy out the entire store.

109
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,780
Who said you can buy all that?

110
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,198
Do you think a cop is a pushover?

111
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:30,783
Just buy some <i>gimbap</i>.

112
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:32,618
Do you think I'm a beggar?

113
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,465
You said you didn't have dinner.
Buy some <i>gimbap</i>.

114
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,675
I don't like <i>gimbap</i>.
I'm going to eat meat.

115
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,010
Do you have money?

116
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,721
If I ask old men for money,
they give it to me.

117
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,015
Darn it!

118
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,104
What else do you want to buy?

119
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,568
My sister and I are screwed
because of you.

120
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,736
I even lost my job.

121
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,947
I don't need anything. Get lost!

122
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,930
I'm just doing what you did to me.

123
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,532
Should the law forgive you
just because you're poor?

124
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,119
Just because
you get beat up and threatened,

125
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,790
and your sister steals money from guys,

126
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,584
does that justify using a knife
against a cop?

127
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:12,552
Today, the police reexamined
all the guys who beat you.

128
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,137
With the CCTV footage
and the testimony from pool hall owner,

129
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,515
it was concluded as
assault from both parties.

130
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,892
And the guys, who were overconfident,

131
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,895
will stand trial
on charges of coercion and assault.

132
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,565
Lieutenant Oh and I will file a petition
so that your sentence

133
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,650
can be mitigated.

134
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,947
The file I sent to your phone

135
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,865
has documents required to receive

136
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,993
benefits for people like you,
who are in need of help.

137
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,160
Fill them out thoroughly.

138
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,497
It can help you with your hospital bill
and physical therapy expenses.

139
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,875
And stop being so full of yourself.

140
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,545
How much do you know about the world

141
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:51,173
that you can’t trust the cops or people,
and you feel like you need a knife?

142
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,967
Do you even know
how tough my life has been?

143
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,468
What about you?

144
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,263
Do you know what I've been through
to get to where I am now?

145
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,310
You were scared when you cut me, right?

146
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,146
Why would you live a life of fear?

147
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,315
Live a life that's honorable.

148
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,363
Call me at the station
when you're discharged.

149
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:15,781
I'll buy you a meal.

150
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,962
Where did you get money?

151
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,672
I took it from the cop.

152
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,932
Why aren't they coming out?

153
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,065
When they go on the move...

154
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:52,568
Jeez.

155
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,455
<i>The car is moving.</i>

156
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,041
That means there's someone inside.

157
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:09,752
That means the ones who went in
will definitely come back out.

158
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:12,838
They're coming out.

159
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,393
Let's go.

160
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,437
Hurry up.

161
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,356
Get in the car already.

162
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,317
Hurry up. If you don't,
we'll sell you to a different country.

163
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,111
Hurry, hurry.

164
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,195
Hurry up.

165
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,078
Nam-il, Jeong-o.

166
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:47,081
A black van
with the license plate number, 77M 3478

167
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,083
<i>will drive by that area shortly.</i>

168
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:52,545
Do not stop the car. Do not inspect it.
Just let them go.

169
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,809
<i>I repeat.</i>

170
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,477
<i>They outnumber us.</i>

171
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,771
<i>The vehicle
with the license plate number, 77M 3478.</i>

172
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,231
<i>Just let it go.</i>

173
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,736
Be quiet.

174
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,749
Myeong-ho, you handle it from here.

175
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,544
License number, 77M 3478.
It's a black van.

176
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,302
License number, 77M 3478.
It's a black van.

177
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,388
Choi Myeong-ho, do you copy?

178
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,349
This is Patrol 24
of Hongil Patrol Division. We copy.

179
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,247
That's 3478.

180
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,504
This is Patrol 24
of Hongil Patrol Division. Patrol 24.

181
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,255
Patrol cars in the vicinity, listen up.

182
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,591
A prostitution ring is suspected of
transferring women

183
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,886
using a black Smath van.
It is headed towards Sangam on Jayu-ro.

184
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,514
Number 3478. It's a black Smath van.

185
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,350
Patrol cars in the vicinity,
turn on your sirens

186
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,228
<i>and drive them onto Hyunsung Expressway,
where there's construction.</i>

187
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,355
The command center, send us backup.

188
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,760
Help me.

189
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,517
I'm hurting.

190
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,487
Boss, we're being tailed.

191
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,323
<i>Drive faster.</i>

192
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,825
<i>This is the command center, roger that.
Code Zero.</i>

193
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,786
<i>Patrol cars in the vicinity,
please report.</i>

194
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,412
<i>Requesting backup.</i>

195
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,581
<i>Make the black Smath van
with the license place number,</i>

196
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,876
<i>Plate number 77M 3478,</i> <i>drive them onto
Hyunsung Expressway.</i>

197
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,461
<i>Don't do anything too aggressive.</i>

198
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,796
<i>Citizens might get hurt.</i>

199
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,633
<i>I repeat. It's the black Smath van
with license plate number, 77M 3478.</i>

200
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,510
<i>Drive them onto
Hyunsung Expressway safely.</i>

201
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,601
Step on it.

202
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:39,999
Get your weapons.

203
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,847
Drop your weapons.

204
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,310
-Drop your weapons.
-Drop it!

205
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,271
Drop your weapons and put your hands up.

206
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,314
-Hands on your head!
-Drop your weapons.

207
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,275
Drop it!

208
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,866
-Turn around.
-Turn around!

209
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:15,951
Turn around.

210
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,391
Please don't hurt us...

211
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,198
They wanted to do it.

212
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,949
Shut your mouth.

213
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,868
They did it because they wanted to.

214
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,001
-Calm down, Myeong-ho.
-Let go!

215
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,337
-Calm down, Myeong-ho.
-Let go!

216
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,846
<i>118-1 Mahak-gil, Hongil 2-dong.</i>

217
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:21,475
<i>We found a woman who seems to have had
an illegal abortion.</i>

218
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,479
I repeat. 118-1 Mahak-gil, Hongil 2-dong.

219
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,731
We found a woman
who seems to have had an illegal--

220
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,651
<i>Copy that.
We'll dispatch paramedics to the scene.</i>

221
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,659
There are two more rooms,

222
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,410
but they're filled with garbage.

223
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,957
It looks like at least ten people
lived here together.

224
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,084
It could've been a lot more.

225
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,172
I think those bastards will come back.

226
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,050
This woman is evidence.
It's odd that they left her here.

227
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,177
Hang on.

228
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,731
Stop right there.

229
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,483
Stop, you prick!

230
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:12,776
Hey!

231
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:15,737
Hey.

232
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,406
-Damn it.
-Stop right there!

233
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,949
Be careful.

234
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,411
There's a victim inside. Please
protect her. Please call for backup.

235
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,079
Jeong-o, Captain An told me to...

236
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,041
Patrol cars in the vicinity,
requesting backup.

237
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,835
We are in pursuit of suspects.

238
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,461
118-1 Mahak-gil, Hongil 2-dong.

239
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,213
Patrol cars in the vicinity,
please respond.

240
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,617
You are under arrest
for illegal prostitution--

241
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,868
He's out.

242
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,747
Where's the ambulance?

243
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:19,403
SEOUL MAHYEON POLICE STATION

244
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,244
HAN JEONG-O

245
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,083
I heard that aside from
the woman we found,

246
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,043
there were three more female victims

247
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,420
on the third floor,
where the suspects were.

248
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,053
Sergeant Kang Nam-il
will wrap things up with the others,

249
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,554
so you can head back.

250
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,014
If you're tired,

251
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,892
stay here and get some rest.
Tell them I made you do extra work.

252
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,186
You can get dressed now.

253
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,151
If you're not going to rest, you can go.

254
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,116
You're quite the runner.

255
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,291
It was fun to be on the same team as you.

256
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:40,877
I'll see you around.

257
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,258
You haven't changed at all

258
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,719
even though it's been a while.

259
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,437
You're wrong.

260
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:00,981
I've aged.

261
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:03,692
Get going.

262
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,433
I'm going to play hooky
instead of working today.

263
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,144
I sent Han-pyo to wrap things up for me.

264
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,521
Do you want to play hooky?

265
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,067
Let's go.

266
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,029
Don't think of anything else.

267
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:33,531
Don't ask why the world is this way

268
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,909
or why there are so many bad guys.

269
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:37,869
Don't think about that.

270
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,455
Just keep it simple.

271
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:46,086
We caught the bad guys.

272
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,967
We caught the culprit

273
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:55,011
and helped women who needed our help.

274
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,307
I'll only think about that.

275
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,894
Good job, Jeong-o.

276
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,321
What the hell did we do wrong?

277
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,115
We'll go over that at the station.

278
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:17,784
-Please get in.
-Why do we have to get in this car?

279
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,203
Mr. Choi
should be the one getting in the car!

280
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:23,081
He stole all our money
and bought himself a luxury car.

281
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,207
This is unfair!

282
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,875
That's no excuse to assault someone.

283
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,168
You even hit the police.

284
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,170
If the people passing the shops
didn't call us,

285
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,505
you would've killed him!

286
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,048
Officer Min!

287
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,883
Just take them to the division already.

288
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,469
We'll decide who was in the wrong
at the station.

289
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,847
-Let go of me!
-We didn't do anything wrong.

290
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,140
Why are you arresting us?

291
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,058
The man we hit is the bad guy!

292
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,393
Why are you arresting us?

293
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:47,522
That man stole two billion won
from the poor vendors here.

294
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:50,358
I can't believe this!

295
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:52,610
He stole the money I saved my entire life!

296
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,654
It was 300 million won!

297
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,114
Excuse me, sir.

298
00:26:56,197 --> 00:27:01,369
Both fraud and mob violence
can be charged as criminal offenses.

299
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,955
Do you think it's legal to beat up
a con man?

300
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,582
What took you so long?

301
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,959
-It's not like I was on a break.
-Let go of me!

302
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,545
-Damn it.
-Go to the third floor unit 312.

303
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:11,671
Someone's injured there.

304
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,964
-Jong-min is there.
-Let go.

305
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,050
-EMTs are coming...
-I won't go until Mr. Choi comes.

306
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,426
Bring me Mr. Choi!

307
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:19,888
So go to the station, he'll be there soon.

308
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,599
He has a broken leg,
so he can't go anywhere. Okay?

309
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:27,145
-Now get up already.
-I'm not going anywhere!

310
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:37,072
You should've gotten here faster.
What took you so long?

311
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,198
You're so lazy.

312
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,616
The assault victim is inside.

313
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,993
The assaulters say that he's a con man,

314
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,119
but he's denying it.

315
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,914
He says his ID
is in the office downstairs.

316
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,999
I'm going to run background
before the EMTs arrives.

317
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:51,669
Damn it.

318
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,198
What the hell?

319
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:21,825
Sergeant Ban!

320
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,159
Sergeant Ban! Hey Jong-min!

321
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:24,953
Sir!

322
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,081
Sergeant Ban!

323
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,499
Damn, that hurt!

324
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,420
Hey, Sergeant Ban!

325
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,588
Sergeant Ban! Jong-min!

326
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,049
-Jong-min. Sergeant Ban!
-What?

327
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,385
Jong-min. That asshole is on the run!

328
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:41,720
He's behind the building!

329
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,434
He was bitching
and saying he broke his leg.

330
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,686
Can someone run with a broken leg?
It was a lie!

331
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,688
His background check came out clean.

332
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,442
The assaulters said he's wanted for fraud,

333
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,985
but there was no record of it.

334
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,155
Damn it. It could be his brother's ID!

335
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,115
You fucking idiot!

336
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:04,659
Requesting backup. Requesting backup.

337
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,494
Man in his 30s, who's suspected for fraud

338
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,455
is on the run,
and headed down Haan-gil 41.

339
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,250
Requesting backup
from patrol cars in the vicinity.

340
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,294
-Damn it.
-Damn it.

341
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:22,594
The victim of the assault,
whom you lost today,

342
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,264
got a stay of execution for

343
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,600
specific economic crimes.

344
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,227
There's a warrant for his arrest.
He's on the most wanted list.

345
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:35,482
Article 3 of Additional Punishment
on Specific Economic Crimes says

346
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,610
when one takes over 500 million won

347
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:42,697
by means of fraud, blackmail
or breach of duty,

348
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:46,493
they can be sentenced to
up to three years in prison.

349
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:50,371
The perp swindled the vendors
out of two billion won this time.

350
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,291
Two years ago, he took
14 billion won from small ventures.

351
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:57,253
He'll get at least five years for that.

352
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,256
Who is going to

353
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,300
be responsible for losing him?

354
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,306
If cops get punished

355
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,475
for losing a criminal
despite their best efforts,

356
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,353
who wouldn't be penalized?

357
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,189
We didn't lose him while slacking off.

358
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,775
I was handing over
the people who assaulted him.

359
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,778
The man screamed and rolled about

360
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,321
saying his leg hurt.

361
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,572
It was bleeding.

362
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,533
That was all a show.

363
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,410
Do I have to take into consideration that

364
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,246
you fell for his tricks?

365
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,333
I won't take the fall for this.

366
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,168
Neither can I.

367
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,255
This was beyond our control.

368
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:46,302
It's good to see
all three of you so united.

369
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:51,140
Send all three of them
to Internal Affairs.

370
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,773
The vendors

371
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,359
lodged a complaint against you all.

372
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,778
This is what we think.

373
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:07,490
We should send all three of you
to Internal Affairs.

374
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:11,327
But that would be unfair and a loss to us.

375
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:14,455
But we can't avoid an investigation.

376
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,709
That means one of you must take the fall

377
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,419
and be investigated.

378
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:24,215
You three decide who that will be.

379
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,967
The investigation isn't a big deal.

380
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,845
But the penalty...

381
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:31,681
Your pay will be docked
for at least three months.

382
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:33,808
That's nothing.

383
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,445
It would be unfair if I were to...

384
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:48,031
Talk to your colleagues, not me!

385
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,668
Okay, congratulations.

386
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,421
Okay, bye.

387
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:10,303
Mr. Choi,
the con man that our boys lost...

388
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,305
Anpo Hanhwa Police Division caught him.

389
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,268
We've been ranked second to last

390
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,646
for the first quarter performance record
in our district.

391
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,776
-We used to come first every year.
-Who's going to Internal Affairs?

392
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,027
I don't know.

393
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:29,781
If they duke it out, someone will give in.

394
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,701
Why do so many things happen
at our division?

395
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:36,412
I'm just sick of it all.

396
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:51,970
CAPTAIN AN JANG-MI

397
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,018
Hi.

398
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:03,481
Han Jeong-o told me that you got hurt.

399
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:05,566
Is it bad?

400
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,614
Hey. You guys make it clear.

401
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,784
The one who took the call takes the fall.

402
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,452
I was just backup.

403
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,415
So you came out for backup for a change.

404
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,751
Whenever we called, you never came
because you were writing parking tickets.

405
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,795
You're the only one who broke protocol.

406
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,756
-The suspect...
-He was a victim of assault.

407
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,633
You shouldn't have left him alone.

408
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,511
You're the first person to take the call,

409
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,930
and you're also the one
who broke protocol.

410
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,823
Fine. I'll take the fall.

411
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,743
To be honest,

412
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,745
from the very start,

413
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:01,664
I knew I'd end up being the one
to be penalized.

414
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:03,916
Why?

415
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:08,212
Because you two have no sense of loyalty.

416
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:12,175
What did you do when Dong-kyu
was penalized and left?

417
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,135
You texted him goodbye.

418
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,471
You bastards.

419
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,639
Is that how you treat a colleague?

420
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,609
I'll become a dad soon.

421
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,986
Is it right that I be penalized?

422
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,447
I was single my whole life.

423
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,450
I finally met someone,
and we just set a date.

424
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,078
My girlfriend's family

425
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:43,956
hates that I'm old and I don't own a home
and that I'm a cop.

426
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,084
I said I'd take the exam
and become a lieutenant soon,

427
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,877
so to accept me as her husband.

428
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:51,005
I begged them until they finally agreed.

429
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:53,966
Do you think they'd still approve?

430
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:07,480
You.

431
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,817
You bragged about buying
an apartment two months ago.

432
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,070
We all still pay rent.

433
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:18,699
Okay.

434
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:22,203
Live a good life and enjoy it
all by yourself.

435
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,972
Hi. I'm about to get off work.

436
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:45,852
I'll buy the groceries. How's business?

437
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,481
Why...

438
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,025
Why did you

439
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,779
stop taking contraceptives
and get pregnant a third time?

440
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,788
Sure, fine.

441
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,959
It's my fault, not yours.

442
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,213
It's my fault.

443
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,217
It's my fault.

444
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:53,127
Grandpa, why are you looking outside?
Are you waiting for Mom?

445
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:57,048
Who said I'm waiting?
I was just looking outside.

446
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,593
Does your leg hurt?

447
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,553
No, it doesn't.

448
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,765
I'm going to visit Grandma this week.

449
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,266
Why bother when you're busy?

450
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:08,935
I miss her.

451
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:18,778
Hey.

452
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:22,907
Your mom got off work around dawn.
Why isn't she here yet?

453
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,910
You should cook,
why are you making Grandpa cook?

454
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:28,120
I do everything at home.

455
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:34,043
Grandpa, I'll do it. You watch television.

456
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,255
It's your mom's birthday today.

457
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,048
The seaweed soup's on the stove.

458
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,009
Why do you drink so much

459
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,136
on your own at night?

460
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,973
Who drinks on their own?
I was with my boyfriend.

461
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:51,102
You get drunk with a guy
and come home at 2, 3 in the morning?

462
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,187
Why not? She's an adult.

463
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:54,772
Shut up.

464
00:37:58,734 --> 00:37:59,568
What does he do?

465
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,613
What does he do?

466
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,325
Doesn't he work? How can he spend time
with you until 3 in the morning?

467
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,286
Is he jobless?

468
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,251
What happened?

469
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,545
I was goofing off with a friend.

470
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,839
Why would you goof off like this?
Enough to get a bruise!

471
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:22,174
Enough already. Gosh.

472
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:29,932
Hey!

473
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,772
This is Jang-mi's first birthday
after her parents passed away.

474
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,065
Be quiet.

475
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,911
Your mom and I are divorced now.

476
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:52,913
How do you feel about it?

477
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,792
I'm okay with your divorce,

478
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,838
but whenever you yell at Song-yi
like that,

479
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:01,964
I get annoyed and mad.

480
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,591
That was because...

481
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,052
I was just worried about her.

482
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,558
It looks like they're just friends.

483
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,228
If you overreact and say something to Mom,

484
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:01,899
she'll really be through with you.

485
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:05,820
That's just what I think.

486
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,823
I'm going to school.

487
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,167
Do you want to talk?

488
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,837
Should we have some tea at my place?

489
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:25,339
Your kids are home.

490
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,383
So what?

491
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,927
It's not like we have secrets to hide.

492
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,347
You and Yang-chon are divorced now.

493
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,224
Can't you take me seriously?

494
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:45,359
Do you really have feelings for me?

495
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,489
I've even given my parents a heads-up.

496
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,994
I told them I might start seeing you again
and that they shouldn't be

497
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:56,579
against it like they used to be.

498
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:03,043
I also told my brothers,
who think they're better than everyone.

499
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:04,962
I warned them to stop meddling in my life.

500
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:07,715
Just get back together with Woo-hee,
the one you dated two years ago.

501
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:11,594
I told you that I'm serious about you.

502
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,972
Then I'll get serious too.

503
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,516
I still have

504
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,727
feelings for Yang-chon.

505
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:23,481
Keep it to yourself.

506
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:26,066
It'll be exhausting if he finds out.

507
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,115
At the moment, I'm happy to be single.

508
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,746
I honestly cannot understand you.

509
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,247
What do you even like about him?

510
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,374
Mom.

511
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,252
Are you going to school?

512
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,339
Who is he?

513
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:50,549
I'm your mom's friend.

514
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:53,761
I need money to buy snacks.

515
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:01,977
You'd better not take that.

516
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,605
Mom, I'll take your money.

517
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,983
What will you do for me in return?

518
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:23,332
You should get going. And forget about me.

519
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,547
Happy birthday.

520
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,926
Also,
congratulations on divorcing Yang-chon.

521
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,480
Jeez, unbelievable.

522
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,236
For a meal?

523
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,363
Sure, let's do that.

524
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:58,200
Yes, pick a date and call me.

525
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:13,382
We haven't caught
the head of the prostitution ring, right?

526
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:18,220
I heard those at Jangdong Station
are working with us on it.

527
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:21,015
By any chance, is the officer in charge

528
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:25,102
Yang-chon's former mentee, Ju-yeong?

529
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,148
Oh, really?

530
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:33,360
Why does he want to meet up with me
for a meal out of the blue?

531
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,029
My gut says

532
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:36,989
that he may be affiliated.

533
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:41,076
If he asks you how we plan to track down
the head of the ring,

534
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,078
my hunch must be right.

535
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,456
But don't let him find out.

536
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,500
Who? You mean Yang-chon?

537
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:52,087
Yes. You know how he is.

538
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:54,256
If he finds out that his former mentee

539
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:57,134
is involved in such a horrible case,
he'll totally lose it.

540
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,512
All right, call me.

541
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:03,557
What was that call about?

542
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,435
My, this soup is so good.
It's light but flavorful.

543
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:09,313
It's really delicious.

544
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:10,689
I seasoned it.

545
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,191
And I had to fix it.

546
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,276
What's that gift from your friend?

547
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,153
Not sure. I haven't opened it yet.

548
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,905
Can I open it?

549
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:18,864
Sure.

550
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:25,412
Wow,
this is from a high-end designer brand.

551
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:27,748
A cop gave you a luxurious gift.

552
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:30,042
Can I have this?

553
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:31,502
No, you can't.

554
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,254
I want to wear nice things too.

555
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,589
You're right.

556
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,092
You deserve to wear nice things like this,
Mom.

557
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:42,554
Wow.

558
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:43,472
It's so pretty.

559
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:45,307
What are you doing
in the middle of breakfast?

560
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,142
It really is pretty.

561
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,021
A friend is better than you two.

562
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:54,483
Grandpa made you a kite,
and Dad didn't even get anything for Mom.

563
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,610
Your dad got those flowers for her.

564
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,615
My gosh, what's gotten into you?

565
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,117
You...

566
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,369
You bought those flowers for me?

567
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:20,759
Happy birthday, Mom.

568
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,095
I'll wash the dishes and clean the house.

569
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,513
You should get some sleep.

570
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,236
Did you miss me?

571
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:41,071
I missed you, Father.

572
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:44,199
I was actually going to head
to the hospital after a nap.

573
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:58,630
YOU HAVE INPUTTED THE WRONG PATTERN

574
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:06,180
TRY AGAIN IN 29 SECONDS

575
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,818
MY HUBBY, JJING, AND I
SONG-YI

576
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,632
Wow.

577
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,604
This is so fascinating

578
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,397
and cool.

579
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:05,280
Things will get easier for you
after Yang-chon's mom and I die.

580
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:09,701
You're at it again.
Please stop talking nonsense.

581
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,610
Just die, please.

582
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,488
What's the point
of staying alive like this?

583
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:25,360
Did you remember to buy it?

584
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,366
Let's get out of the car.

585
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:35,329
Isn't it nice? Isn't this place great?

586
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,497
This is awesome.
Come here. We're over here.

587
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,459
-Go over there.
-Hurry up.

588
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:41,460
This place is nice.

589
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:48,550
It's nice.

590
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:57,768
Sam-bo,
I told you this place was great, didn't I?

591
00:48:58,602 --> 00:48:59,853
-It's nice.
-I told you.

592
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:11,698
Hey.

593
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:13,992
What's with all the long faces?

594
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:17,579
People would think you're the ones
getting disciplinary action.

595
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,248
Smile. Why aren't you smiling?

596
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,167
Even I'm smiling despite getting punished.

597
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,502
What's he talking about?

598
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:25,504
I'm offering myself up
to Internal Affairs.

599
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:26,880
You know how loyal I am.

600
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:30,050
Next month, I'm welcoming my first child
after 7 years of marriage,

601
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:31,593
but I'm getting disciplinary action.

602
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:33,470
If I were you guys

603
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,598
and my peer was having a kid,
I'd take the punishment out of loyalty

604
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:39,267
and as a gift to his newborn child.

605
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:42,020
You guys are so disloyal.

606
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:45,107
You really are disloyal friends. Gosh.

607
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,692
No one's as loyal as me, Ban Jong-min.

608
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,485
Stop patronizing us.

609
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:50,987
Don't take the punishment. I'll do it.

610
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,698
Why would you take the punishment?

611
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,492
It obviously was Jong-min's fault.

612
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,994
And you. If you want to be loyal,

613
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,205
stop giving yourself credit
for being loyal.

614
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:03,333
Even after Han-sol took a knife for me,

615
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:04,793
he said...

616
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:07,754
"Yang-chon, are you all right?

617
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,466
It hurts like crazy."

618
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:12,718
With a knife in my stomach.

619
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,720
Aren't I a loyal friend?

620
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:18,932
Those two only care about their own asses.

621
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:21,059
Let me make this clear.

622
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,103
Here are the things I hate most.

623
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,688
Sexual violence, random killings,

624
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:25,856
corrupt police,

625
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,483
and officers that don't have
each other's backs.

626
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:30,485
Whoever gets punished,
keep it to yourself.

627
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,072
Why are you staring at me?

628
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:36,783
-I like you, that's all.
-What's with you two now?

629
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:39,327
You know how they're like.

630
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:42,581
Anyway, Jong-min,
I'll take the punishment,

631
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,833
so stop patronizing me about loyalty.

632
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:47,836
-I'll take the punishment.
-No, I will.

633
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:51,006
Fight, fight.

634
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:54,384
The games will be fun today
since they're already so competitive.

635
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:58,680
Sam-bo, you and I can sit back, relax,
and watch the show.

636
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,057
Gosh, you idiots.

637
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:03,727
Anyway, change into your tracksuits,

638
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:04,978
and gather out on the field.

639
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:09,065
Gosh, I told him not to do that.

640
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,692
Sam-bo, let's go.

641
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:11,777
That was nice of you.

642
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:13,487
An award will get you back on track.

643
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:14,988
There are lots of awards we can get.

644
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,114
I'll help you get one.

645
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,117
You're the best.

646
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:34,508
Why would we lose?

647
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:38,094
If the old mentors go up against us,
the young mentees, we would totally win.

648
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:39,763
He's right. Why would we lose?

649
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:40,931
I won't let it happen.

650
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:42,641
The money collected so far

651
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:45,018
and the prize money of 300,000 won
for every game is ours.

652
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:47,604
We may be able to win in other games,
but not the relay race.

653
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:50,065
-It's because of you girls.
-I'm fast.

654
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,691
You'll be surprised once you see me run.

655
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,069
Officer Choi used to run track.

656
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,029
That's too bad.

657
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:57,531
What are you talking about?

658
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,032
I used to run track too.

659
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:00,617
Don't kid yourself.

660
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,619
Just make sure you don't trip over.

661
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:03,870
He's right about that.

662
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,163
What?

663
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:08,792
I'm going to go up against him
in the relay. Don't stop me.

664
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:11,711
I don't get why you all
think he's so great.

665
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,005
If he's so great,
why is he a senior officer?

666
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,842
He should be a lieutenant.
He should at least be a sergeant.

667
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:18,510
That's because...

668
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:27,978
-There's a story behind that.
-Yes, a heartbreaking one.

669
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:29,187
Be quiet.

670
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:32,649
As of today you'll know for sure

671
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:35,735
that I'm Officer Choi's biggest rival.

672
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,362
Stop kidding yourself.

673
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:39,573
You can't just become anybody's rival.

674
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:41,074
You must be crazy.

675
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:43,493
You'll be rooting for me, right?

676
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:44,619
Why would I?

677
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:51,835
Wait a minute.

678
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,671
Your mentor is being reprimanded
instead of his.

679
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:57,257
Sergeant Kim said so in our chatroom.

680
00:52:58,592 --> 00:52:59,926
Is Sergeant Ban off the hook then?

681
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:06,224
-One, two, flip.
-One, two, flip.

682
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:08,226
-One, two, flip.
-One, two, flip.

683
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,270
-One, two, flip.
-One, two, flip.

684
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,315
-One, two, flip.
-One, two, flip.

685
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:15,108
-One, two, flip.
-One, two, flip.

686
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:16,735
Let's just do mentors versus mentees.

687
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:18,111
-One, two, flip.
-One, two, flip.

688
00:53:18,194 --> 00:53:20,572
We'll do that when
we play foot volleyball.

689
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:22,699
Right now, team spirit is more important.

690
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:24,701
-One, two, flip.
-One, two, flip.

691
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:26,369
-One, two, flip.
-One, two, flip.

692
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,080
-Yes.
-Nice!

693
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:31,082
It'll be me versus you.

694
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,251
Sure. I totally agree.

695
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:35,128
-Officer Choi, I pick you.
-Sure.

696
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:36,838
Are we picking opponents? I pick you then.

697
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,048
Do you think I'm scared?

698
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:40,175
You better not lose to Seung-jae.

699
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:41,593
Of course I won't.

700
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:43,803
Hey, don't underestimate me.

701
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:46,848
-Don't you dare lose.
-I hope you win.

702
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:54,689
-Run!
-Go!

703
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:56,691
-Go, go!
-Faster!

704
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:59,569
Nam-il, you... Stop!

705
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:00,737
Hey!

706
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,156
Hurry!

707
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:07,911
-Faster, sir.
-Why aren't you running?

708
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:09,871
-Why aren't you running?
-Go!

709
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,373
You're waiting for me, right?

710
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:15,001
You want this match
to be fair and square, right?

711
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:16,628
Shut up.

712
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:19,965
-He'll end up losing.
-Run faster!

713
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:20,966
Come on!

714
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:22,258
Gosh, Han-sol.

715
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:25,720
Eun Gyeong-mo, Eun Gyeong-mo.

716
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:28,139
Eun Gyeong-mo, Eun Gyeong-mo.

717
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:31,518
Let's win, Oh Yang-chon!

718
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,937
-Come on.
-Mr. Oh Yang-chon,

719
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:34,938
you got this!

720
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:37,941
-You can do this.
-Go, go!

721
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:40,902
Mr. Oh Yang-chon, you've got this.

722
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:46,491
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

723
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:49,160
Also,
congratulations on divorcing Yang-chon.

724
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:53,832
-Oh Yang-chon, Oh Yang-chon.
-Eun Gyeong-mo, Eun Gyeong-mo!

725
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:55,667
-Oh Yang-chon!
-Come on!

726
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:58,086
-You can win!
-Oh Yang-chon!

727
00:54:58,169 --> 00:54:59,462
Faster!

728
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:02,674
Come on, that's it!

729
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:04,175
No way!

730
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,470
Faster, sir.

731
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:10,098
Go, Oh Yang-chon!

732
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:11,975
Oh Yang-chon, Oh Yang-chon!

733
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:14,019
-Faster!
-Oh Yang-chon!

734
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,353
Go, go!

735
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:18,565
Oh Yang-chon!

736
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:21,276
-Oh Yang-chon, Oh Yang-chon!
-Faster!

737
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:23,945
-Go, go!
-You can do it!

738
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:26,698
-Faster!
-You've got this.

739
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:27,866
-Run, run!
-Go!

740
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:30,035
-You can win this.
-Faster!

741
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:32,162
Kim Min-seok, Kim Min-seok!

742
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:33,747
Nice!

743
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,374
You're nothing compared to me.

744
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:40,587
I wished

745
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:42,756
you and Jang-mi

746
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:44,966
nothing but happiness.

747
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:48,928
The day

748
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,097
I was going to propose to her,

749
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,934
you got down on your knees and cried.

750
00:55:58,688 --> 00:55:59,731
"Gyeong-mo,

751
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:01,357
let her go.

752
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:05,737
I'll make her the happiest woman
in the world."

753
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:10,158
But the result was divorce?

754
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,705
Are you saying you gave up on Jang-mi
because I begged?

755
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,793
Let's be honest.
It was because of your stuck-up family.

756
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:22,378
They didn't approve of her.

757
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:28,885
Do you want to know

758
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:30,470
why I really gave up?

759
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:36,392
It's because you're a mama's boy.

760
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:42,023
I thought

761
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:43,983
you were a decent guy.

762
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:48,196
As a colleague

763
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,073
and as a man.

764
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:53,993
Not anymore though.

765
00:56:58,164 --> 00:56:59,791
-Kim Min-seok!
-Kim Min-seok!

766
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:02,836
-Kim Min-seok, Kim Min-seok.
-Get ready!

767
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,754
Kim Min-seok, Kim Min-seok!

768
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:05,839
All right!

769
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:08,049
I got this.

770
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,759
-Hurry.
-Come on!

771
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:13,721
-Yeom Sang-su! Yeom Sang-su!
-Go!

772
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:15,890
Jeong-o, watch me win!

773
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:19,811
<i>Sang-su and Jeong-o sitting in a tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G</i>

774
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:23,106
<i>First comes love, then comes marriage
Then comes a baby in the baby carriage</i>

775
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:24,482
<i>He likes her</i>

776
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,985
The winner is my man!

777
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:28,570
Run faster!

778
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:30,738
-Come on, run!
-Faster!

779
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:32,365
Come on!

780
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,616
My goodness.

781
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:38,705
Come on, faster.

782
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,165
I love you, Myeong-ho!

783
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:42,375
-Come on!
-Sang-su!

784
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,710
I love you, Myeong-ho!

785
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:45,462
Well done!

786
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:46,963
A bit more!

787
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:00,685
You're getting too close.

788
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:01,936
Those fools.

789
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:06,232
Let's play foot volleyball next.

790
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:08,026
Mentors versus the mentees.

791
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:15,783
Okay, let's play foot volleyball.

792
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,709
-Go inside if you don't feel well.
-I'm okay.

793
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:29,631
We're at a disadvantage with two girls.

794
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:33,218
Hey, we have two old farts here.

795
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:34,844
I can beat Sam-bo.

796
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,763
I'm pretty good too.

797
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:38,014
Let's do this.

798
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:39,265
Let's do this.

799
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:42,143
I'll kill you all if we lose.

800
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:44,395
I can take anything
but losing to Yang-chon.

801
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:45,522
Let's beat them.

802
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:46,606
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

803
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:49,400
If we win, we'll split the prize money.
I'll pay for the drinks.

804
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:50,652
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

805
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,779
Let's win, be victorious, survive.

806
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:54,030
Go!

807
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:55,698
Let's win.

808
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:58,660
Guys, you know it'll be an embarrassment
if we lose to our mentees, right?

809
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,203
-Right.
-So,

810
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:01,871
Jong-min, Min-seok, Nam-il.

811
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,998
I'll kill you if you don't give your all.

812
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,583
-Okay.
-Okay? Let's win.

813
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:07,835
Pass the ball to me too, okay?

814
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:10,588
I can do this. I'm not too old yet.
Include me too.

815
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,632
Let's let our feelings go and do our best,
okay?

816
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:14,259
We can't divorce each other.

817
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:17,804
Do your best. I'm taking the fall for you.

818
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,721
I will, okay?

819
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,014
One, two, three.

820
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,891
Let's fight, smash and win.

821
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:24,227
-Go!
-Go!

822
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:25,812
Sang-su.

823
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:27,605
Sang-su.

824
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:29,816
-Okay.
-Nice.

825
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:34,195
Great!

826
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:35,822
My ball. It's mine.

827
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:36,906
Come on.

828
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:39,909
Nice one.

829
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:44,247
Myeong-ho, good eye. Good eye.

830
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,665
You have sharp eyes.

831
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:48,710
Come on.

832
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:49,919
Hurry up.

833
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:56,259
Nice!

834
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:58,678
Another point for the mentees. 11-11.

835
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:00,597
Let's do this!

836
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,599
There's no deuce. 30 points per set.

837
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:04,976
That's the end of it.

838
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:06,561
You can do this!

839
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:07,687
You're so noisy.

840
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:09,147
Nice!

841
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:10,982
Go for it.

842
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:18,031
Han Jeong-o, Han Jeong-o,

843
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,407
Han Jeong-o.

844
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:23,202
Yang-chon, hit it.

845
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:25,038
Defense.

846
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:26,581
Perfect.

847
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:28,124
Eun Gyeong-mo!

848
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:44,057
Eun Gyeong-mo! Eun Gyeong-mo!

849
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,308
Eun Gyeong-mo!

850
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:48,019
Eun Gyeong-mo!

851
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,856
Let's go, go, go!

852
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:53,107
Fight!

853
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,276
Go, go, go!

854
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,195
Be strong.

855
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:03,993
Keep going, Sam-bo.

856
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,411
Get up!

857
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:08,247
It's 21-21.

858
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:14,796
-Here.
-Go on, Sang-su.

859
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:26,182
Yes!

860
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:29,811
It's not over yet!

861
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:37,944
It's 29-29.

862
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:39,654
Hey mentees, stay alert!

863
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:41,322
There's no deuce or set.

864
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:44,325
30 points to win. Keep going!

865
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:46,285
Come on, mentors!

866
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,121
It's down to the last point!

867
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:49,956
Keep going. If we lose,

868
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,999
our mentees will look down on us!

869
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:55,002
If we lose,
it's going to haunt me in my dreams!

870
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:56,921
Fight like you're fighting
for independence.

871
01:01:57,004 --> 01:01:59,590
This isn't foot volleyball!
This is about independence!

872
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,926
Fight like you'd fight for your country.

873
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:04,804
-Now, keep...
-Here.

874
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:06,472
Fight!

875
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:11,060
-Go.
-Nice pass.

876
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:12,103
Good.

877
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:14,397
Go, go.

878
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:16,816
-Give it to Nam-il.
-Give it to Nam-il.

879
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:20,236
Keep it up.

880
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:21,988
There you go.

881
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:26,743
Get it!

882
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:28,828
-Go, go!
-Go, go!

883
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:30,872
Nice, nice.

<i>Your passionate voice rings in my ear</i>

893
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:21,839
Didn't you go off with Nam-il?
Why are you on your own?

894
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:24,175
Did he sneak off home?

895
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:26,552
He did that last time.

896
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:28,137
You're correct.

897
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:30,556
Of course he left.
He left as soon as the games ended.

898
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:35,394
Nam-il said he'll take the penalty.

899
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:37,438
What? Why would he do that?

900
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:38,731
I don't know.

901
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:41,442
I was afraid he'd change his mind,

902
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:44,070
so instead of asking any questions,

903
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:45,863
I told him to take the fall.

904
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:47,198
That's odd.

905
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:51,035
Do you hate Gyeong-mo?

906
01:03:52,578 --> 01:03:53,871
Sam-bo.

907
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,916
Do you think he and Jang-mi
would've been happy if they got married?

908
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:00,169
I think they would've.

909
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:02,547
-Of course he would've.
-Let's go.

910
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,841
Do you call this having fun?

911
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:06,175
Make way for me.

912
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:12,223
<i>-This was all I could do

914
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:16,227
Sing something else!

918
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:34,829
<i>I think it's unfair</i>

919
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:37,582
<i>that Min-seok should be
the one to be penalized.</i>

920
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:40,042
<i>You and Sergeant Ban were the ones</i>

921
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:43,045
<i>who failed to catch
the suspect who got away.</i>

922
01:04:43,462 --> 01:04:45,464
<i>Sergeant Ban volunteered to take the fall,</i>

923
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:49,302
<i>but I don't understand
why you won't do the same.</i>

924
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:52,138
<i>Each time your team were in danger,</i>

925
01:04:52,513 --> 01:04:53,848
<i>Sergeant Ban and Won-u,</i>

926
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:55,433
<i>Min-seok and I</i>

927
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:58,269
<i>did our very best to back you up.</i>

928
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:02,690
<i>While all your colleagues
did their best to help you,</i>

929
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,318
<i>where were you?</i>

930
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:08,195
See? They're going to take care of
the convenience store drunk.

931
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:12,992
How dare you show yourself. How dare you!

932
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:14,535
How dare you come here?

933
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:15,953
-Sir, calm down!
-Let go!

934
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:22,627
I hope you win.

935
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:27,089
-Go, go!
-Go, go!

936
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:49,987
<i>Min-seok's mother recently</i>

937
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:52,114
<i>has surgery for a cancer relapse.</i>

938
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:56,202
<i>The hospital bill is costly,
but if he gets a paycut...</i>

939
01:05:58,579 --> 01:06:00,623
<i>I know I'm going out of line,</i>

940
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:02,249
<i>but I wanted to</i>

941
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,294
<i>at least tell you of his circumstances.</i>

942
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:07,213
<i>I apologize.</i>

943
01:06:13,552 --> 01:06:16,389
-How many orders are there?
-A lot.

944
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:17,932
Really?

945
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:21,185
We spent all the money

946
01:06:21,268 --> 01:06:24,188
we saved to buy a house on this store.
I'm glad it's doing well.

947
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,732
Oh, right. What's going on
with the disciplinary action?

948
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:28,776
I think I have to take the punishment.

949
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:30,528
What?

950
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:36,993
What about Jong-min and Min-seok?

951
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:39,495
Jong-min and Min-seok's situations
aren't any better than ours.

952
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:41,622
One's having a kid,
the other's getting married,

953
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:44,959
supporting his sick mom,
and they don't own their own home.

954
01:06:46,293 --> 01:06:48,587
You should've told them
we're expecting another kid.

955
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:52,425
What good would that do?

956
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:56,512
Are we betting on
whose life is more pathetic?

957
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:02,393
I want to live an ordinary life too.

958
01:07:02,476 --> 01:07:04,520
What kind of a cop is always

959
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:06,439
handing out parking tickets?

960
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:09,066
Can't I live a decent life for once?

961
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,820
Damn it.

962
01:08:02,703 --> 01:08:06,040
Someone was selling it on my way here.
It reminded me of when I was young.

963
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:11,295
What were you doing here?

964
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:15,341
I went for a walk
since it's beautiful here.

965
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:17,468
Were you listening to music?

966
01:08:18,135 --> 01:08:19,178
Yes.

967
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:26,185
I want to give it a go.

968
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:27,853
Sure.

969
01:08:37,571 --> 01:08:39,573
It's been a while
since I blew bubbles last.

970
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:03,389
You're good at it.

971
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:18,714
-Are you still upset over Jeong-o?
-You aren't on my side either, right?

972
01:10:19,089 --> 01:10:20,257
I'm sorry about that.

973
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:21,967
Jeong-o might get uncomfortable,

974
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:24,220
<i>so we shouldn't show that
we're awkward with each other.</i>

975
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:26,263
We should get married.

976
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:27,681
Do you like me?

977
01:10:28,849 --> 01:10:30,226
<i>During a month's time,</i>

978
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:33,145
<i>Ju-yeong and his goons
gathered here 11 times.</i>

979
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:38,150
<i>I'm asking you what you were busy doing!</i>

980
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:41,612
<i>You'll all stay and search the grounds!</i>
