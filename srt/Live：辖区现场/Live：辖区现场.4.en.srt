CHARACTERS AND PLACES ASSOCIATED
WITH THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:58,975
Shit.

3
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,561
Do we get a ride in a police car?

4
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:02,854
This is so exciting.

5
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,856
-You must be excited.
-It's so cool.

6
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,734
Do you seriously think
you should be excited about this?

7
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:08,860
Just get in the car.

8
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,278
I told you I didn't want to come.

9
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,447
-You did have fun in there, you bastard,
-Stop it!

10
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,949
You guys are getting on my nerves.
Shut up and get in the car.

11
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:21,331
Sir, can't you just let us go?
I have an exam tomorrow.

12
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,209
I'm telling you I'm 20.
I have been held back two years in school.

13
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,252
Please let it go just this once.

14
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,339
-Hey, get in the back.
-Please let it go this once.

15
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,257
The dean of students
shouldn't know about this.

16
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,511
Hey, you're afraid of your dean,
but you're not afraid of the cops?

17
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,679
-Stay quiet.
-Just let go of me.

18
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,348
My gosh.

19
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,725
-It's so annoying.
-I have an exam tomorrow.

20
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,061
Let go of me.

21
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:46,940
I didn't know they were minors.
They're so cheeky.

22
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,236
-Look. Anyone can tell they're minors.
-My mom will kill me.

23
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:55,031
-They look like adults to me.
-You should blame your poor sight then.

24
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,955
Please clear the way.
Thank you for your cooperation.

25
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,545
Damn it!

26
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,421
Let me out!

27
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,758
Let me out! So what if you're the cops?

28
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,427
I told you I didn't know. Let me go!

29
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,762
Just let me go. Okay?

30
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:18,847
You son of a...

31
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,765
Who do you think you are?

32
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:22,934
Hey.

33
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,439
-Hey!
-You're obstructing justice.

34
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,150
And you kicked the police car.

35
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,443
You're under arrest
for damaging public property.

36
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,785
Why don't you light this cigarette

37
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:42,912
for me, the son of a bitch?

38
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:52,023
EPISODE 4

39
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,452
Now tell me why I'm a son of a bitch.

40
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,372
Han Jeong-o, you go first.

41
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,336
I don't...

42
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,672
have any complaints about you, sir.

43
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,091
When an assailant touches my breasts,

44
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,510
I should just arrest them
for obstruction of justice.

45
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,763
I shouldn't have gotten flustered
and slapped him.

46
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,765
You could've been accused of
police brutality

47
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,350
and ended your career here.

48
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,477
Don't you think so?

49
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:33,564
PROBATIONARY PATROL OFFICER: NEW RECRUITS
WHO ARE RECEIVING ONE-YEAR FIELD TRAINING

50
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,192
When drunk people start to grab my hair,

51
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,361
I should subdue them immediately.

52
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,614
I brought the police force into disrepute
by grabbing their hair too.

53
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,284
I will never let it happen again.

54
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,334
-I don't have--
-You do. Don't you dare lie to my face.

55
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,135
Stop talking behind my back
and say it to my face.

56
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,428
Start it now.

57
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,265
I...

58
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,059
I honestly...

59
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,565
don't know what I did wrong.

60
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,527
I tried my best
to calm an angry drunk man down.

61
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,321
The drunk man is a citizen.

62
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,742
I was never taught to throw
a citizen over my shoulder.

63
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,746
I honestly don't know what I did wrong.

64
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:35,126
Why am I the only one getting hit
when my peers also made mistakes?

65
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,842
The first reason why I only hit you
and not your peers

66
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,887
is that your colleagues seem to know
what they did wrong.

67
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,350
The second reason why I only hit you
and not your peers

68
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,020
is that watching you get hit

69
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,980
will make them feel terrible

70
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,982
and wish they would rather get hit

71
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,860
than watch you get hit.

72
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,616
Han Jeong-o.
Point out every mistake Yeom Sang-su made.

73
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,202
I'm not asking you to tell on him.

74
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,537
Just recite
what the initial response manual states.

75
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,628
Since the drunk person
pushed Officer Yeom Sang-su,

76
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,506
he was no longer considered a civilian

77
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,634
but an offender.

78
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:30,306
I was told that the scene
was near a four-lane road.

79
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,225
What are you smiling at, you asshole?

80
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,853
I got you now, you idiot.

81
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,439
<i>If Officer Yeom Sang-su was pushed</i>

82
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,733
<i>onto the road by the drunk,</i>

83
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,027
<i>he could've got hit by a car.</i>

84
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,536
There could've been a huge accident.

85
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:55,081
He should have used adequate force
to subdue the offender in a safe manner.

86
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,171
You don't even know
what the manual states.

87
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,258
You don't even know
that I saved your life.

88
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,718
When will you behave like a cop?

89
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:21,858
Sang-su, I'm sorry.

90
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,484
Sang-su.

91
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,027
Yeom Sang-su!

92
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,741
-Wake up.
-What are you talking about?

93
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:34,245
How annoying.
Why would you follow me to the restroom?

94
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,998
Hey, I really didn't know.

95
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,708
Okay.

96
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,919
-Give me the number.
-It's 021909429484

97
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,713
It's different from what you said earlier.

98
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,631
I'm hungry. Is there anything to eat?

99
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,758
Enough. Fill this out.

100
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,887
-Han-pyo, bring me one more of this.
-I'm on it.

101
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,054
-Won-u.
-Yes.

102
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,723
The number is 021206...

103
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,184
Please let me off the hook just this once.

104
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,894
I'll be suspended from school this time.

105
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,645
Don't you think you deserve it?

106
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,773
Be a man and stop whining about it.
Be quiet and fill this out.

107
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,776
This isn't your first time, you idiot.

108
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,612
Don't call me an idiot.

109
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,740
I'm sorry for calling you idiot,
you idiot!

110
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,492
How dare you talk back to me?

111
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,203
I can never put up with kids these days.
My goodness.

112
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,121
Just go over there, you idiot.

113
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,832
-Fill it out.
-Hey!

114
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,209
Can't you fill it out for me?

115
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,669
I don't know what I have to write.

116
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,714
-Where are you going?
-To the restroom.

117
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,758
Officer Min.

118
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:29,967
Take him to the bathroom.

119
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,260
Yes, sir.

120
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:33,888
Let's go.

121
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,480
Don't look at the window.

122
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,815
You'll be released with a warning
once your parents arrive,

123
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,360
but if you touch that,
you'll be arrested for vandalism.

124
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,528
Damn it.

125
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,489
My father will kill me.
Just let me go home.

126
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,908
You can't just go home
once you come to the patrol division.

127
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,162
Let's go. Get out.

128
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,346
Let's not do this anymore.

129
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:19,225
Like it or not, we work together.
When will you stop ignoring me?

130
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,071
Are you really going keep ignoring me?

131
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,490
Hey, Sang-su.

132
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,747
-Earlier, if I didn't answer--
-That would've been ridiculous too.

133
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,627
I admit that it was wrong
for him to hit you.

134
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:47,795
Thanks for saying that.

135
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,965
Do you have to talk like that?

136
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,092
Right now, this is the best I can do.

137
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,976
Let's grab a drink together after work.
I'll treat you.

138
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,854
I'm moving into your place in two days,
so I--

139
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,148
I have to study.
He will beat me up again if I don't.

140
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,984
You don't want to get beaten up, right?
Me neither.

141
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,075
Han Jeong-o.

142
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,453
Why are you staring at Sang-su like that?

143
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:26,042
I was out on patrol
for four hours straight without a break.

144
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,253
I have to take a nap
so that I can work hard again.

145
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,172
So if you guys want to flirt,
do it quietly.

146
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,011
Let's talk later.

147
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,771
Hey, Sang-su.

148
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,732
Isn't Jeong-o quite attractive?

149
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,193
I'm a man, too.

150
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,655
Does that mean you like her?

151
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,824
Does that even matter?

152
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,826
She must think that I'm a total loser.

153
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,245
What? "A total loser"?

154
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,459
Okay, I'll give him a warning.

155
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:11,253
I'll tell Yang-chon that he should not
hit you guys ever again.

156
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,422
That will do, right?

157
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,219
What more do you want me to do?

158
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,637
A stronger disciplinary action--

159
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,888
Stop spewing nonsense!

160
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,140
He subdued a drunk man
who was hitting his junior officer

161
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,558
in front of a four-lane road.

162
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,143
He was teaching his mentee a lesson

163
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,354
on what he was supposed to do
in such a situation.

164
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,940
He's a lieutenant
with 20 years of experience.

165
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,608
Yes, he did kick his junior's shin twice.

166
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:33,609
So what?

167
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,237
Do you think he should get fired
right away?

168
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,282
Is that what we should do
to bring justice in our society?

169
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,410
Is it? Answer me!

170
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,162
Please change my mentor
to Senior Patrol Officer Choi.

171
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,041
-How about Lieutenant Lee Sam-bo?
-No, Senior Patrol Officer Choi.

172
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,587
Why not Lieutenant Lee Sam-bo?

173
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:54,839
Because he's old?

174
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,424
Yes.

175
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,718
Try putting yourself in our shoes.

176
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:03,514
You're not good at your job,
and you bad-mouth your mentor.

177
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:07,476
You even belittle old officers.
Do you think we'd want a mentee like you?

178
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,565
As of now, your mentor is Lieutenant Lee,
who's old but knowledgeable.

179
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,152
I will make the final decision
based on both Lieutenant Lee

180
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:17,903
and Oh's review on you.

181
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,990
-I'd like Senior Officer Choi to--
-Are you in charge of this division?

182
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,080
Get out.

183
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,173
Hey, Oh Yang-chon!

184
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,967
Times have changed. You're not supposed to
beat the rookies up!

185
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,303
It's because I'm ignorant.
Are we good now?

186
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:44,930
Hey.

187
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,934
Do you think this division and I am a joke

188
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,103
because I took you in when you had
nowhere to go?

189
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,396
Let's stop here, Han-sol.

190
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,276
You think the force betrayed you?

191
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,029
Is that why you're sulking like a kid?

192
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,907
Do the chief and the commissioner
represent the force?

193
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:06,994
To me...

194
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,873
To me, everyone in this division

195
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,585
including you,
an officer with a strong sense of duty,

196
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,422
represent the police force I work for.

197
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:24,929
I'll warn you again.

198
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,514
Mind your attitude

199
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:30,017
when I or Gyeong-mo, who is no longer
your mentee but a superior, speak

200
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,936
especially when others are around.

201
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,064
No matter what anyone says,

202
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,108
I believe that we should take pride in
working in the patrol division

203
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:41,445
because we protect citizens,
and we're right there when they need us.

204
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,489
You can stay here if you agree with me.

205
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,491
If you don't, just quit this instant.

206
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,960
Jeez, I'm scared.

207
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,092
OH YANG-CHON

208
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:05,970
I'll do it for you.

209
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,103
Are you here to serve coffee?

210
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,522
Just do your job well, will you?

211
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,585
-I'm returning this pistol.
-Hello.

212
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,545
-Hello.
-Good job today.

213
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,264
Number 4146.
One blank, three live. All good.

214
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,599
Unload it.

215
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,704
It seems like
Sang-su is really mad at you, right?

216
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,708
Let's be honest. What did I do wrong?

217
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,544
Was I supposed to lie
and pretend I know nothing?

218
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,671
Is that what I should've done?
Do you think so too?

219
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,048
Yes, I do.

220
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:28,177
I knew that Sang-su didn't follow
the manual, but didn't say anything.

221
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,096
You know what's in the manual?

222
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,307
No.

223
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,185
You were honest, so I'll forgive you.

224
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,687
Next time, don't act like you know
because I'll test you.

225
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:49,073
Yang-chon,
did you write your letter of resignation?

226
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,785
No, because I need to work
to keep my head above water. Why?

227
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,703
If you can't afford to quit,

228
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,081
don't glare at me like that, you idiot.

229
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,104
Let's get some food.

230
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,357
Next time you call,

231
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:27,361
ask if I'm available for a call first.

232
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,240
Enough already!

233
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,246
Fine, I...

234
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,331
<i>I'm a total jerk.</i>

235
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,791
<i>It's all my fault.</i>

236
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,752
I didn't put our family first,
and I was a bad husband to you.

237
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,672
I admit it,
so let's please stop fighting like this.

238
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,218
I'm in the patrol division now,

239
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,513
so I no longer have to be away for days

240
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,391
like I used to when I worked
in the Violent Crimes Unit.

241
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,519
I'll be tired from working all night,
but I'll have time to--

242
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:03,897
To you, work always comes first
no matter what.

243
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,357
Same goes for me, too.

244
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,360
Honey.

245
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,154
<i>Earlier today, a young girl</i>

246
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,656
<i>was brutally raped in the mountain nearby.</i>

247
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,242
What do you think you should do now?

248
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,327
I'll call you later.

249
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,584
Gosh, I dug my own grave.

250
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,756
Is there a new case?

251
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,511
I've never had breakfast alone
for the last two years,

252
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,597
so I'm not used to eating by myself.

253
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,348
Let's get some food.

254
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,642
It looks like you're trying to hit on me.

255
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,062
Why did you stop by for no reason?

256
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,194
I'm not hitting on you.

257
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,197
I just have regrets.

258
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,533
Let's eat another time.

259
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,172
Did you find any bodily fluids?

260
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,215
No, none.

261
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,384
The assailant tied the girl to a tree
and covered the ground.

262
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,261
He even wore a condom.

263
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,721
I'm sure he has done this before.

264
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:21,517
Re-investigate similar cases.
Let's go to Sunflower Center now.

265
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,060
-Forget going home.
-Yes, ma'am.

266
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,249
Can I go now?

267
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,294
Let's go to work together after we eat.
I bought some meat.

268
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,461
I'm good.

269
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:32,754
You petty bastard.

270
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,549
Why can't you just let it go?

271
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,386
The both of you should just let this go.

272
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,804
What is wrong with you two?

273
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,140
You've been making me uncomfortable

274
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,934
since yesterday when we were getting
ready for moving all day.

275
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,436
Sang-su.

276
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,521
Are you still embarrassed

277
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,274
that she recited the response manual
correctly in front of Yang-chon?

278
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,902
-Oh Yang-chon--
-Cut it out, both of you!

279
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,452
I have no problem
with you reciting the manual perfectly.

280
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,663
What pisses me off

281
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,376
is the fact that I'm a total idiot
who doesn't deserve to be a cop.

282
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,592
I've only cared about
my performance records.

283
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:20,969
Instead of complaints,

284
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,555
I wanted compliments.

285
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,644
All I cared about was keeping my job
as a probationary officer.

286
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,939
I kept on acting like a moron
not realizing the danger I was in

287
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,023
and called him "Sir."

288
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,902
I was like a total loser.

289
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,783
You did nothing wrong that day.

290
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,496
I can only blame myself for being
a moron who couldn't recall

291
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,498
the basic protocol.

292
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,419
I'll try harder,
so this doesn't happen again.

293
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,054
Why does he keep beating himself up?
He was only doing his best.

294
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,056
I agree.

295
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,915
I'm not hungry.
But if I don't eat with you,

296
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,626
you won't believe that
I'm only mad at myself and not you.

297
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,462
Set the table.

298
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,299
Do it yourself. I'm busy over here.

299
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,967
Jeong-o.

300
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,719
Why are you smirking?

301
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,554
I thought you like Myeong-ho.

302
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,518
Do you like him?

303
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,894
Why? Am I not allowed to?

304
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:54,980
I didn't say that.

305
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,692
We've been assigned to individual mentors.

306
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,528
-Hye-ri's--
-Mine's old man Sam-bo.

307
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,196
My mentor is Sergeant Kang Nam-il.

308
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,700
I bet mine's Oh Yang-chon.

309
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,122
What is it? It looks good.

310
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,834
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you for the meal.

311
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,836
-Thank you.
-Good day.

312
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,463
Thank you.

313
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,300
Why do you keep bringing us coffee?

314
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,093
You're a cop!

315
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,014
Why can't you just drink it?

316
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:30,932
Don't make a fuss about it.

317
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:35,520
Everyone drinks coffee after a meal, so--

318
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,689
Just do what you're supposed to do.

319
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:40,358
It makes me think
that you're trying to kiss my ass.

320
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:42,903
Yes, sir.

321
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,666
I wasn't trying to kiss your ass.

322
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,010
What you taught me at the academy

323
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,553
has been of great help to me.

324
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,514
-I was grateful, so--
-The academy?

325
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,193
What are you grateful for?

326
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,487
No matter how big the culprit is,

327
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,948
I'll be able to cuff him thanks to you.

328
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,533
That is why, as your mentee,

329
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,952
I thought I should bring you some coffee.

330
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:35,580
I know that bringing you this
won't affect my evaluation.

331
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,171
It hurts my pride to hear
that I was kissing your ass.

332
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,464
It's not even true.

333
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,967
You said I taught you
how to cuff a suspect.

334
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,218
What if the suspect...

335
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,721
What if he grabs your wrist like--

336
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,782
A suspect who grabs a cop

337
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,409
should be dealt with force

338
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:14,744
no matter what the circumstances are.

339
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,920
<i>Beat 25, 89-1.</i>

340
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,839
<i>A noise complaint has been made
by a neighbor.</i>

341
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:28,717
Patrol 24 is on its way.

342
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,385
Whether it's domestic violence

343
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,721
can't be told by the report.

344
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,015
<i>We'll need a female officer just in case.</i>

345
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,933
<i>We'll need a female officer just in case.</i>

346
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,768
Beat 25, 89-1.

347
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,563
Patrol 23 will provide backup.

348
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,982
-Take a right.
-Yes, sir.

349
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,868
Did you see Jeong-o put the cuffs on me?

350
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:56,620
I did.

351
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,581
Cuffs

352
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,917
should be put on correctly with speed.

353
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,960
To prevent a secondary attack,

354
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,046
you must follow the manual to a tee.

355
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:09,132
Yes, sir. I'll always go by the book.

356
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,680
You seem at ease today.

357
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,975
Is it because
we're aiding a DUI checkpoint?

358
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,685
Unlike last time,

359
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,854
there won't be a drunk
to push you into the street.

360
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,941
Do you think it'll be
a stroll in the park?

361
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:26,983
Of course not, sir!

362
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,860
Nothing about being a cop is easy.

363
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,321
Be alert, okay?

364
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:33,865
I will, Mr. Oh Yang-chon!

365
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,084
DUI CHECKPOINT
MAHYEON POLICE STATION

366
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:55,887
Hold on. Over here.

367
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,828
I'm Officer Yeom from Hongil Patrol
Division. We're issuing a sobriety test.

368
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,037
Please blow into this.

369
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:24,874
I can't believe I'm the one
behind the wheel.

370
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,876
Hello, sir. Please blow into this.

371
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,878
How can a cop

372
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,798
get his license suspended for a DUI?

373
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,217
I'm curious.

374
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,721
Why are you with this division
when it's always loaded with work?

375
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:39,848
You're retiring soon.

376
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,809
Why not go to a division in a countryside
and take it easy--

377
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:45,270
I know I'm old,
and I know I'll retire soon.

378
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,023
Still, I want to devote myself

379
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,734
to this crazy division
that gets a shit load of work.

380
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,903
Are you worried I'll only cause harm

381
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:56,072
because I'm old and useless? Is that it?

382
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,909
You're unbelievable.
You haven't changed at all.

383
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:03,830
Besides, you're one to talk.

384
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:07,334
Your wife asked for a separation.

385
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,258
Hello, we're issuing a sobriety test.

386
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,349
Watch out!

387
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,062
Damn it!

388
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,193
Keep issuing the tests!

389
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,448
All units in the vicinity.

390
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,867
A white sedan has fled the DUI checkpoint.

391
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,202
The driver hit an officer.

392
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:47,165
<i>The car is heading to Yeondong junction.
A white sedan has fled the DUI checkpoint.</i>

393
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,167
<i>License plate, 45G3590.</i>

394
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,960
<i>License plate, 45G3590.</i>

395
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,009
Damn it!

396
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,142
You little rat.

397
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,983
Pull over, 45G3590.

398
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,069
Pull over now.

399
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,703
<i>45G3590.</i>

400
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,664
This is a warning. Pull over.

401
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,499
<i>Pull over, 3590.</i>

402
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,293
<i>Pull over to the side.</i>

403
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:51,604
<i>45G3590. Pull over and stop.</i>

404
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,732
<i>Pull over, 3590.</i>

405
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,359
<i>Pull over to the side.</i>

406
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,825
He's plastered. This could get bad.

407
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,118
Do it.

408
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:12,375
-Just do it.
-Fine, you asshole!

409
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,187
License plate, 45G3590.

410
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,565
We've got the car. Send us a tow truck.

411
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:37,859
Step out, sir.

412
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,904
You're under arrest
for refusing to take a sobriety test.

413
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,387
Sir.

414
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:10,058
I'll open your door
according to police protocol.

415
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,774
What are you doing?

416
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,484
I will smash your window.

417
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,153
Stay right where you are.

418
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,489
I will drive you to the station in my car.

419
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:27,283
Duck.

420
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,968
He's showing him what happens
when you stand up to a cop.

421
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,103
Hey!

422
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,523
It seems like you're sobering up now.

423
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,400
Sir.

424
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,280
You refused three times.

425
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,574
If you refuse one more time,

426
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,450
I can arrest you on the spot, sir.

427
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,702
This is your last chance, sir.

428
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,498
Blow into this twice.

429
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,459
You moron.

430
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,795
I blew into it earlier.

431
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,298
Your breath was too light.
You need to blow hard.

432
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:26,509
If I say keep going,
you need to keep going, sir.

433
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,513
This is enough.

434
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,390
You fool.

435
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,977
Where are you stationed at?

436
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,770
Mapo? Hongil?

437
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,522
You idiot.

438
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:44,152
How can you not recognize us?
Which station are you from?

439
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,655
Hey, you. Go and get your superior.

440
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,491
I don't believe this.

441
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,119
My goodness.

442
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,749
Step out, sir.

443
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,418
You're under arrest
for refusing a sobriety test, sir.

444
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,045
Follow me to the station.

445
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,756
You jerk.

446
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,931
You're under arrest
for refusing a sobriety test

447
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,182
and obstruction of justice.

448
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,644
You have the right to an attorney
and appeal to the terms of your arrest.

449
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,270
You'll get your chance to explain.

450
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,148
-Hey! Let go of me.
-Has he lost his mind?

451
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,983
Do you have a death wish?

452
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,568
-Hey, you fool.
-Stop.

453
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,070
-Uncuff me!
-You fools.

454
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,573
-Let me go.
-Don't you see that?

455
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:33,076
-We are in huge trouble.
-Hey!

456
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,119
Sang-su just messed with the wrong guy.

457
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:56,933
A newlywed couple lives here.
The couple fought almost every night.

458
00:32:57,016 --> 00:33:00,186
But tonight, for some reason,
the woman stopped screaming

459
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,854
five minutes after it was called in.

460
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:04,649
Myeong-ho,
Han-pyo and I will wait in the back.

461
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:05,900
Break in.

462
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,569
-I'll get the toolbox.
-Okay.

463
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,409
I hope this is just a noise complaint.

464
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,369
Do you think someone's inside?

465
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:17,704
Yes.

466
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:40,184
I think I smell something wretched.

467
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:54,782
It's the police.

468
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,536
We got a noise complaint.

469
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:01,414
It's...

470
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:04,477
She's dead,

471
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,187
but it hasn't been long.

472
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,788
Reporting a murder in Beat 25, 89-1.

473
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:27,667
Requesting support
from Forensics and Violent Crime Unit.

474
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,006
Reporting a murder in Beat 25, 89-1.

475
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,883
<i>Gosh, these bastards.</i>

476
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:39,053
We need to teach them a lesson.

477
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,513
My goodness.

478
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,599
I can't believe these idiots.

479
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,685
We don't have time for this!

480
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,396
Take that!

481
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:52,942
Hey!

482
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,278
Where's the head of this division?

483
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:58,489
How dare he make us congressmen wait?

484
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,511
Mentors, come in for a meeting.

485
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,534
Assistant Chief.

486
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,203
We can't let them off the hook

487
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,622
no matter what kinds
of positions they hold.

488
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,415
Sang-su's a rookie, but he's still a cop.

489
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:51,751
How dare he smack him around the head?

490
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:55,338
What did Sang-su do wrong?
He did everything by the book.

491
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:59,467
There's something we cops always say.

492
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,552
When we go out in the field,

493
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,597
we leave our pride and ego at home.

494
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,558
If we don't apologize to them,
they'll complain elsewhere.

495
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:08,559
You know that.

496
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:10,937
What?

497
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,980
Do you have a better idea?

498
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,483
Why are you two arguing?

499
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,443
We're here to discuss what to do.

500
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:21,822
I say

501
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,700
we let them go.

502
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,661
Assistant Chief.

503
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,288
Are we pushovers?

504
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,582
-Why must we always give in?
-Don't.

505
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,917
Darn it.

506
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:34,669
He's upset too.

507
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:36,963
If we upset our superiors,

508
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,090
it'll ruin your performance records.

509
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,885
He's doing this for you.

510
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:46,973
Let it go.

511
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,528
Just get on your knees
as soon as you go in.

512
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:02,613
Do you want me to come with you?

513
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,824
Don't come in even if you hear
a loud noise.

514
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:19,797
Get back to work, will you?

515
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,184
Hey!

516
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,103
What do you think

517
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,440
you can do by keeping us here?

518
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:39,275
Jeez, I really need
to teach you a lesson...

519
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,196
-Gosh, this moron.
-Look. Look at this, okay?

520
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,787
It's 0.03. See?

521
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:54,999
That means you have no reason
to hold me here, right?

522
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,919
You cops are abusing your power!

523
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:03,716
Well...

524
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:05,843
You're here

525
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,929
because you refused to take
the sobriety test.

526
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,850
You refused our request
and did a self-breathalyzer test

527
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,727
two hours after we brought you in.

528
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:18,939
We cannot consider that a proper way
to measure blood alcohol content...

529
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:21,901
How dare you!

530
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,528
Listen up, you prick.

531
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,114
I was on my way
to meet the Prime Minister.

532
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,116
How dare you stop a congressman,

533
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,035
who represents
the citizens of this country!

534
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,870
Belittling me

535
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:37,500
is the same thing as belittling
the citizens of this country.

536
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,172
Stop talking about the citizens.

537
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,466
-You little--
-And if I don't stop?

538
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:47,760
Hey.

539
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:51,806
What are you going to do, you prick?

540
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:54,141
We asked you what you'll do, you moron.

541
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,936
Has this prick lost his mind or what?

542
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,065
You little piece of shit.

543
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:04,068
-Hey.
-Please leave quietly.

544
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,653
Then we'll let it slide.

545
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:07,822
Congressmen,

546
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,240
please leave now.

547
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,242
Who are you?

548
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:12,785
The citizens...

549
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:17,039
wouldn't have cast their votes for you

550
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,626
had they known
you'd conduct yourselves this way.

551
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,128
So...

552
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,839
please stop talking about them
to get your way,

553
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:26,632
okay?

554
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,717
You prick. You're not getting it, are you?

555
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:31,887
My goodness.

556
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:36,308
Mr. Congressman, you're under arrest
for refusing the sobriety test

557
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,060
-and hitting an officer--
-Let go of me.

558
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,729
You're under arrest
for obstruction of justice.

559
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,440
You have the right to an attorney,

560
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,733
and you can appeal
to the terms of your arrest.

561
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,819
You'll get your chance to explain,

562
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,155
-but just don't!
-But just don't!

563
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,887
We're done here, so let's get going.

564
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,055
I'm exhausted from pulling an all-nighter.

565
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,557
Han Jeong-o.

566
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:18,934
I'm going to meet up with other mentors

567
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,769
to study the case in the afternoon.

568
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,188
I'm out.

569
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,815
I'll be there, sir.

570
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:30,029
Myeong-ho.

571
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:33,699
She must have been shocked by
what she saw today. Let's leave her out.

572
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,451
It's her first homicide case.

573
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,912
She has to deal with it
if she wants to be a cop.

574
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,330
Avoiding it wouldn't help her.

575
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:52,968
See you in two days.

576
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,762
See you in the morning.

577
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,769
Yeom Sang-su, get going already.

578
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,605
It's not your fault he got beaten up.

579
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,236
I'm sorry, sir.

580
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,073
For what?

581
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,701
For arresting both a current
and a former congressman?

582
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,205
I just followed the protocol...

583
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,334
I'm sorry.

584
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,920
You don't know your ass from your elbow.

585
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,548
How are you going to become a real cop?

586
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,050
Do you want to end your career as a cop?

587
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,379
He was the one who kept going on
about doing by the book.

588
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,732
It's so unfair.

589
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:34,695
Some only get petty cases
and get yelled at,

590
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,740
while others keep getting important cases.

591
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,076
Did you say it's a homicide this time?

592
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,956
I really envy you.

593
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:14,735
Are you going home?

594
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,785
Why does everyone look so down?

595
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:42,971
Did the chief...

596
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:45,808
really let those congressmen go?

597
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,812
As they were walking out
of the chief's office,

598
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:52,940
they slapped me on the cheek
and said this.

599
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,567
"Do your job properly, you dumb ass."

600
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,945
What the hell! They're such pricks.

601
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:07,371
Assistant Chief Ki, you should report it
to the Police Human Rights Center.

602
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:11,500
Gosh, it's so unfair.
I can't stand it anymore. Damn it!

603
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,085
-Sam-bo.
-Let go.

604
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:14,128
-Hey...
-Let go!

605
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,712
Sit down, Sam-bo.

606
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:16,839
Damn it.

607
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:22,136
Do we really have to put up
with this bullshit?

608
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,096
Do we have to keep working in the force?

609
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,390
We have the security footage.

610
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,225
Send it to the media.

611
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:32,146
We shouldn't let them trample all over us.
Let's show them who's right.

612
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,480
I'll take the bullet.

613
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,775
If it goes well,
we can teach those congressmen a lesson.

614
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:38,485
I'll take a demotion
if it doesn't go well.

615
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:40,070
Who cares if I become a sergeant?

616
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:43,282
That's a great idea.

617
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,202
They already took

618
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:49,997
all the security footage on their way out.

619
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,874
They already started
tampering with evidence.

620
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:54,084
I bet they already got to our database.

621
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:57,212
Of course. Those jerks are so thorough.

622
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:58,422
You heard that, right?

623
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:01,133
Han-sol, let me handle this.

624
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:04,344
I know a few guys in the committee.

625
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,138
-And--
-If all of us give statements...

626
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:09,016
You guys need to hear this.

627
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,648
<i>Even District Attorney Jeong called.</i>

628
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:19,109
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

629
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:23,697
Even Jeong at the Western
Prosecutors' Office is involved.

630
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:27,201
Keep listening.

631
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:32,247
<i>The prosecution won't indict them
even if we press charges.</i>

632
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:35,042
<i>We don't even have
the authority to do that!</i>

633
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:40,797
It shows why the prosecution shouldn't
have the sole power to indict.

634
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,426
I guess this will become useful one day.

635
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:50,140
And...

636
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:53,602
Ta-da!

637
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,524
My body cam.

638
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:01,818
I moved the clips on this

639
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,029
to my cell phone.

640
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,156
Watch this.

641
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,079
<i>You little piece of shit.</i>

642
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,749
<i>Listen up, you prick.</i>

643
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:19,378
<i>I was on my way
to meet the Prime Minister.</i>

644
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:21,296
<i>How dare you stop a congressman,</i>

645
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,131
<i>who represents
the citizens of this country!</i>

646
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:26,343
<i>Belittling me</i>

647
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:30,597
<i>is the same thing as belittling
the citizens of this country.</i>

648
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,101
-Why do we hold back when we have this?
-Why?

649
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:44,278
Because it'll be of no use.

650
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,947
They'll just hold a press conference,

651
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,865
bow their heads down and apologize.

652
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,118
The people will get pissed,

653
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,786
but soon, they'll forget about it.

654
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:55,914
We can't let something
this precious go to waste.

655
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:58,709
We'll wait and let it brew.

656
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:01,295
What season
are congressmen most afraid of?

657
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,297
It will be election season soon.

658
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,757
I'll release this

659
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:08,010
through various social media sites

660
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:09,928
and the media.

661
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,805
-All over.
-Spread the news.

662
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:12,889
Nice!

663
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:21,815
The former and current congressmen,

664
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:24,484
Chief of Police, and the district attorney

665
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:27,029
will all get the boot.

666
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:28,030
-Nice!
-Nice!

667
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:29,156
That's right!

668
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,532
Let's drink to that.

669
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,034
Give them the boot!

670
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:33,869
The boot!

671
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:36,163
<i>-In you go, in you go
-In you go, in you go</i>

672
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:39,458
<i>-In goes alcohol, in goes alcohol
-In goes alcohol, in goes alcohol</i>

673
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:50,344
Wait. Watch this.

674
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:55,766
<i>What are you going to do, you prick?</i>

675
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,019
Don't you think it was quite a punch?

676
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,857
Can't you hear how I'm doing my best

677
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:06,068
to be incredibly polite?

678
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,280
Every second of it

679
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:15,243
went as I had planned it.

680
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:18,205
As if. You had no intention
of doing this in the beginning.

681
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,541
How did you know that?

682
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,670
He threw quite a punch though.

683
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,089
That's enough. Let's drink!

684
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:30,300
-Cheers!
-Let's drink.

685
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:32,302
<i>-In you go
-In you go</i>

686
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:35,097
<i>-In goes alcohol, in goes alcohol
-In goes alcohol, in goes alcohol</i>

687
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:37,724
<i>-How long will this bounce last?
-How long will this bounce last?</i>

688
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:41,144
<i>-Honey, it's got to be bottoms up
-Honey, it's got to be bottoms up</i>

689
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,903
You're loyal to a boss who got punched,

690
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:53,615
but you betrayed your colleague
who got beaten up.

691
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:57,452
The boss was punched for no reason,

692
00:49:58,203 --> 00:49:59,830
but the colleague neglected his duty.

693
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,250
Let's put this behind us.

694
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:07,254
You're the only friend I have
in this division.

695
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:18,348
Just stop talking and listen to this.

696
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:26,064
Is it a baby's heartbeat?

697
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,151
Is it your unborn child?

698
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:32,320
Are you jealous? It's a boy.

699
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:42,998
Can I hear it one more time?
Just once more.

700
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:47,335
That's a strong heartbeat.

701
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:49,629
I'm jealous.

702
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,465
If so, get married.

703
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:56,386
Aren't you going to your dad's?

704
00:50:57,345 --> 00:51:00,056
I'm stopping by my place
to get fresh clothes.

705
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,311
Right.

706
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:09,191
I can't stop Team One from knowing,

707
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:12,694
but don't tell the others
about what happened today.

708
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:15,197
Keep everyone quiet.

709
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:18,283
It's embarrassing.

710
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:19,493
Don't think like that.

711
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,998
I'm too afraid of losing my job,

712
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:27,334
so I couldn't give them
a piece of my mind.

713
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:31,505
I tried to hide that fact
by mentioning the election period.

714
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:35,133
We both know
that I can't release the footage

715
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:36,802
unless I put my job on the line.

716
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:43,308
Why does life have to be so crappy?

717
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:47,312
Since you're drunk,
you'll find everything crappy.

718
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,148
Just go to sleep.

719
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,152
All right.

720
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:57,697
It's crappy. It really is.

721
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,575
It's shitty.

722
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:04,120
I wish I could just transfer out.

723
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:09,167
Once I get promoted,

724
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,587
I'll be able
to leave this crappy life behind.

725
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:40,991
The husband worked the night shift
as a security guard that night.

726
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:45,203
<i>He went to work at 21:02 p.m.,
which is 30 minutes later than usual.</i>

727
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:46,872
<i>The boyfriend</i>

728
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,498
<i>came by the house two minutes later.</i>

729
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:49,791
<i>It looks like</i>

730
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:53,295
<i>he was in the vicinity and came</i>
<i>as soon as the victim called.</i>

731
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:54,796
<i>Either that, or it's their routine.</i>

732
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,465
The neighbor filed a noise complaint

733
00:52:57,549 --> 00:53:00,468
at 21:07 p.m., five minutes
after the husband left.

734
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:03,263
The neighbor said
it was noisy for an hour.

735
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:06,892
It only dialed down five minutes
before our arrival. So that was...

736
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:09,436
That was 21:15 p.m.

737
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,187
-This means...
-The victim

738
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:14,024
could have argued with her husband
or her boyfriend.

739
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:19,738
Jeong-o, what are you thinking about?

740
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,534
This keeps bugging me.

741
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,998
Why did he turn his car around?

742
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:34,002
He said he had to take care of
something with his client.

743
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:38,423
After he made the U-turn,
he went here. To the client's.

744
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:41,676
It takes about five minutes
from his house on foot.

745
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,428
If he runs, it takes a minute or two.

746
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:44,679
Hold on.

747
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:49,351
What if he came back home
instead of going to work

748
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,770
and killed his wife?

749
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:54,898
He only suspected

750
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,443
his wife's affair

751
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,571
for the past three months
of their marriage.

752
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:04,908
Why did he become certain of it

753
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,953
that night?

754
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:12,958
The husband made a U-turn at 21:04 p.m.

755
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:18,713
The boyfriend entered
the house at 21:03 p.m.

756
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:20,382
It overlaps.

757
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:23,301
He was on his way to work,
but why did he suddenly...

758
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,470
How did he know?

759
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:28,932
Why did he make a U-turn

760
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:31,142
when the boyfriend entered the house?

761
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:35,522
-What if he...
-He must have seen something.

762
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:37,440
On the road?

763
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,818
What did he see and how?

764
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:41,903
His phone.

765
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:44,823
He hid a camera inside.

766
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,785
We got there
within five minutes of the crime.

767
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:50,704
He killed his wife,

768
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:53,039
wiped down the knife,

769
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:56,835
and ran off
as he heard the sirens wailing.

770
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:00,005
-Then the hidden camera...
-It's still in the house.

771
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:02,590
I'll get the car.

772
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,889
You should head home.

773
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,100
No. I'm coming with you.

774
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:15,895
You've never seen a corpse before, right?
It was a bloody one, at that.

775
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:21,109
It shocks everyone. I was no exception.

776
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:24,029
I only let you join us today

777
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:27,115
because I thought
you wouldn't be able to sleep anyway.

778
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,159
So go home and get some sleep.

779
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,328
Sir.

780
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:37,000
A case like this

781
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:42,505
is rare, right?

782
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:57,854
Thank you.

783
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:02,067
It's really pretty. You should get it.

784
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:07,447
Thank you.

785
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:16,998
CLAW MACHINE ARCADE

786
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:45,110
OH YANG-CHON

787
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:04,712
<i>The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable at this time.</i>

788
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,091
Is your mom having an affair?

789
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,135
Why doesn't she come home after work?

790
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:12,929
I have to go to work soon,
and Dae-gwan is at the library.

791
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:14,681
What's there to do here?

792
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:17,100
You never pick up your phone
when you work.

793
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:20,812
Call your mom.

794
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,775
She won't take my calls.

795
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:27,068
You call her.

796
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:32,198
Use your phone. She ignores my number.

797
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:41,082
She's not picking up.

798
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:51,718
Why are you so cold toward me?

799
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:56,764
You and Dae-gwan both.
Why are you so cold toward me?

800
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:58,975
We aren't cold, we just feel awkward.

801
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,478
Why would you feel awkward
around your dad?

802
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:05,064
Because we rarely see each other.

803
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,277
As a kid or even now,
we rarely see each other.

804
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:15,158
I love you two so much.

805
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:16,618
Even when I'm at work,

806
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:19,329
I stare at your photos
all the time and kiss them.

807
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:24,209
I have no complaints.

808
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:27,212
I feel more comfortable
when you're not home.

809
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:40,808
You're spilling milk everywhere.
That's disgusting.

810
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,657
Did she leave without seeing you?

811
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,743
She left these here without a word?

812
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:12,131
<i>I think I'll cry if I see you.</i>

813
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,342
<i>I only said hi to Mother.</i>

814
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:16,719
<i>I bought dried persimmons.</i>

815
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,972
<i>Chew it well,
so you don't get indigestion.</i>

816
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:29,899
When my in-laws died,

817
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:32,694
did they die peacefully?

818
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:37,073
You took your time to ask that.

819
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:26,164
<i>The cops at the station were overjoyed.</i>

820
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,583
Where was the camera?

821
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:30,043
In the cable box.

822
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:32,295
The one for the cable TV system.

823
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:36,299
<i>You might get a compliment from the chief.</i>

824
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:39,802
He'll probably just say, "Well-done,"

825
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:41,262
and give you...

826
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,806
<i>a 50,000-won gift certificate.</i>

827
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:46,100
A compliment's always good.

828
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:50,438
Why are you still up?

829
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,942
Nothing. The others are exercising,

830
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:56,444
and I'm listening to music.

831
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:00,031
How much can you drink?

832
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:03,951
A bottle of soju if I don't push myself.

833
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:05,953
<i>Then drink half a bottle and go to bed.</i>

834
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:13,002
How long

835
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:14,879
will I feel this way?

836
01:01:16,297 --> 01:01:17,298
<i>Quite a while.</i>

837
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:20,093
<i>But drink only tonight.</i>

838
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:21,886
<i>On other nights,</i>

839
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,223
listen to music like you do now.

840
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:29,060
<i>Whenever you are reminded of it,
listen to music.</i>

841
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:32,522
Okay.

842
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:34,357
<i>Sleep tight.</i>

843
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:49,265
You don't even know
what the manual states.

844
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:51,142
You don't even know
that I saved your life.

845
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:52,643
When will you behave like a cop?

846
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:54,061
I just followed the protocol...

847
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:57,899
-I'm sorry.
-You don't know your ass from your elbow.

848
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:00,860
How are you going to become a real cop?

849
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,988
Do you want to end your career as a cop?

850
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:09,911
He goes back and forth.

851
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:14,290
The two-faced bastard.

852
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:48,241
Is anyone in?

853
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:50,952
We got a report.

854
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:53,996
Mr. Kim Sang-cheol?

855
01:03:54,872 --> 01:03:56,958
Your brother, Mr. Kim Yeong-cheol,
is worried about you

856
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:58,793
because he couldn't reach you
since yesterday.

857
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:02,839
Are you home?

858
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:35,663
Search the place.

859
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:49,343
This is the police.

860
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:03,065
Mr. Kim Sang-cheol?

861
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:27,840
Someone's dying.

862
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:30,635
Lieutenant, someone's dying.

863
01:05:37,141 --> 01:05:38,601
He's alive.

864
01:05:46,984 --> 01:05:48,027
Send the paramedics.

865
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:51,447
Beat 34, 42, Jeongwang Munjigi.
Found a man poisoned with carbon monoxide.

866
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:52,782
Send an ambulance.

867
01:05:57,703 --> 01:05:59,580
Did you tear off the green tape
on the door?

868
01:06:00,414 --> 01:06:02,166
Did you spray water on the scene?

869
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,085
I heard a sound.

870
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:07,672
I tore off the tape
and sprayed water in case of a fire.

871
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,928
Who told you to do as you please

872
01:06:14,011 --> 01:06:16,097
without asking me first?

873
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:19,392
What'll you do about this now?

874
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:35,616
FORENSICS

875
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:39,495
How could you screw up
the crime scene like this?

876
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,706
You of all people?

877
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:43,582
You worked with Forensics for three years,

878
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,376
and you ruined the scene like this?

879
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,378
It's a total mess.

880
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:50,965
Is that how I taught you, you idiot?

881
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,092
I apologize.

882
01:06:54,468 --> 01:06:55,428
We're in trouble.

883
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:58,139
If the door was sealed with tape
from the outside,

884
01:06:58,222 --> 01:07:01,058
then you have to infer that it was
attempted murder, not suicide.

885
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:03,936
Even an amateur would know that.

886
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:06,147
What will you do now?

887
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:11,152
What about the evidence?
You contaminated the prints on the tape.

888
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:13,696
The crime scene was hosed down.

889
01:07:13,779 --> 01:07:17,158
Even if the older brother survives,
it's likely he won't be able to talk.

890
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:19,035
What if we can't get
his brother to confess?

891
01:07:19,618 --> 01:07:21,662
How will we nail the suspect then?

892
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:24,498
I found footprints in the house.

893
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:25,708
Other evidence will surface.

894
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:27,209
You little...

895
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:31,672
We could've wrapped this up in half a day.

896
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:34,550
You screwed everything up,
yet you still have something to say.

897
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:38,679
I'm going to report you two
to our superior

898
01:07:39,638 --> 01:07:41,849
for contaminating the crime scene.

899
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:46,312
We already have so much work,
but these idiots added to it.

900
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:11,921
Go follow him. Hurry.

901
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:14,548
You don't want to get the boot.

902
01:08:15,549 --> 01:08:16,759
He will anyway.

903
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,762
From what I hear,

904
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:21,430
your points are low this month.

905
01:08:23,849 --> 01:08:25,684
You rank lowest out of all the rookies.

906
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:35,653
That little...

907
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,295
I'm sorry for today.

908
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:59,260
If you could reevaluate my performance...
I mean...

909
01:09:00,886 --> 01:09:02,138
how can I become a good cop--

910
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:06,267
If you want to know that,
go ask an actual good cop.

911
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:43,030
Did you follow me home?

912
01:10:45,991 --> 01:10:48,452
-Are you nuts?
-Why do you keep changing your words?

913
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,372
Why?

914
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:55,834
You told me to do everything by the book,

915
01:10:57,461 --> 01:10:59,546
but then reprimanded me for
being too by the book.

916
01:11:00,547 --> 01:11:03,133
Even today, the victim's life
comes before the evidence.

917
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:06,971
He could've died
if we preserved the scene!

918
01:11:08,472 --> 01:11:09,932
Are you challenging me?

919
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:11,850
What a nutjob.

920
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:19,692
I'll be cut from the force anyway.

921
01:11:22,027 --> 01:11:23,529
I have nothing to lose.

922
01:11:27,491 --> 01:11:28,617
Mr. Oh Yang-chon.

923
01:11:59,356 --> 01:12:00,691
<i>Just make a choice.</i>

924
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:03,193
<i>Run away saying you're scared</i>

925
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:04,903
<i>or look into the case.</i>

926
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:06,447
Can I stay the night?

927
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:07,698
Are we friends?

928
01:12:07,781 --> 01:12:08,615
<i>We're not, but still.</i>

929
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:09,950
That...

930
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:11,452
<i>is a lie.</i>

931
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:15,456
-You just touched her.
-What's wrong with him liking Jeong-o?

932
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:18,292
The bigger issue here
is that you're after my wife.

933
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:21,462
<i>Let me be clear with you.
The police's duty</i>

934
01:12:21,545 --> 01:12:22,921
<i>ends as of this moment.</i>

935
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:25,424
<i>Jeong-o, you heard what they said, right?</i>

936
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:28,552
<i>I think something is going to happen
in our district.</i>

937
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:33,182
