CHARACTERS AND PLACES ASSOCIATED
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,188
I...

3
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,817
should've told you I like you first.

4
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,110
Right?

5
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,404
Is that so?

6
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,158
Do you want to go for a walk?

7
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,120
Okay.

8
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:30,942
That's too bad.

9
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,698
-Just go back.
-What's wrong?

10
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,533
Go back.

11
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:42,162
Jeong-o and Senior Patrol Officer Choi
are kissing.

12
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:43,746
-Do you want to see it?
-Really?

13
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,248
Oh, my god.

14
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,763
Jeong-o, let's go bike riding!

15
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,559
Jeong-o.

16
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,272
Jeong-o, let's go bike riding!

17
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,777
Jeong-o, answer me.

18
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,655
Let's go ride a bike!

19
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,415
Gosh, he's unbelievable.

20
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,959
How could Sang-su talk to her
in a situation like that?

21
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,295
Gosh, that's not easy.

22
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,964
Sang-su is something else.

23
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,467
He wants to confront the situation,
not avoid it.

24
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,927
He's a real man.

25
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,013
This is just as thrilling
as catching a suspect

26
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,306
of a violent crime case.

27
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,226
Has he lost his mind?

28
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,685
I know.

29
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,479
Bravo!

30
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,814
Choi Myeong-ho,
you're finally over Hyeon-su.

31
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,942
Hallelujah. <i>Amitabha</i>.

32
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,778
Jeez, that nutjob.

33
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,530
-Goodness.
-That's not an easy thing to do.

34
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,826
Jeong-o, come bike riding with me!

35
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,187
Sang-su, hurry up!

36
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,231
If you don't, I'm going to go by myself.

37
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,067
Hurry up!

38
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,549
Sang-su, you're going too fast. Wait up!

39
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,462
You're so sweet.

40
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,230
You're really sweet.

41
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,742
Sang-su, what's the matter?

42
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,578
Hey, Sang-su!

43
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,667
Hey!

44
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:33,601
EPISODE 9

45
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,561
Hey, where's pickled radish?

46
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,397
You have to pay for it these days.

47
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,775
By the way, you're so good
at foot volleyball, Sam-bo.

48
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,401
Sam-bo is a pro.

49
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,028
-Let's drink.
-Let's drink, guys.

50
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,072
-Good work.
-Good work, everyone.

51
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,533
-Thank you for everything.
-Good work.

52
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:52,370
He's hurt. He's totally heartbroken.

53
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:53,830
"Heartbroken"?

54
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,670
But what is
really going on with him today?

55
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,713
It's nothing important.

56
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,467
Right, so what is not important?

57
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,344
He...

58
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,431
saw Senior Officer Choi kissing you.

59
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,767
He likes you,

60
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,853
so he must be upset.

61
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,730
Sang-su does not have any feelings for me.

62
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,029
Senior Officer Choi and me...

63
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,490
Who else saw us?

64
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,951
It seems like you saw us.

65
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,080
I guess... Everyone?

66
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,541
"Everyone"?

67
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,043
Everyone in our division?

68
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,128
Yes.

69
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,480
Where have you guys been?

70
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,898
Come join us, Yang-chon!

71
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,404
Let's drink. Guys, raise your drinks.

72
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,617
All right. Hongil Patrol Division.

73
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,912
-Let's keep up the great work!
-Keep up the great work!

74
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:16,996
Good work, guys.

75
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,581
Thank you, sir.

76
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,294
Myeong-ho, you haven't forgotten
about tomorrow, right?

77
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,712
Of course not. I remember.

78
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:26,881
What is it about?

79
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,134
None of your business.

80
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,471
What are you two up to?

81
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:36,015
Gyeong-mo said it's none of your business.

82
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,851
Jeez, forget it.

83
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,270
I have enough to worry about anyway.

84
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,897
I don't even want to know.

85
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,525
-Here, Chief.
-I ate a lot today.

86
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,818
-I need another drink.
-Should I go to bed?

87
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,070
MY HUBBY, JJING, AND I
SONG-YI

88
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,696
Sam-bo, you should go to bed.

89
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,949
-Not yet.
-He needs a shot of soju.

90
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,784
-Why?
-He can't fall asleep without soju.

91
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,369
Yes, I'd love some soju.

92
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,329
<i>The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable</i>

93
00:08:58,412 --> 00:08:59,789
-We should make stew.
<i>-at this time.</i>

94
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,374
<i>Please leave a message...</i>

95
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:04,794
By the way,
where did all of our rookies go?

96
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,337
Two are outside, and...

97
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,743
What's up with the ambulance?

98
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,955
Yeong-guk died.

99
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,082
"Yeong-guk"?

100
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,127
You mean Jang-sun's next-door neighbor?

101
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,762
Why did he die?

102
00:09:58,806 --> 00:09:59,765
He was healthy.

103
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,686
Did he have a heart attack?

104
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,736
What are you doing?

105
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,282
Why are you digging them up?
You did all the work to plant them.

106
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:29,879
What's the point of planting them
if I may not even be around to harvest it?

107
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,716
What are you talking about?
You will harvest them.

108
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,386
I told you not to bother
because of your legs.

109
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,757
What is the matter?

110
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,135
You're not drinking
your favorite <i>makgeolli</i> or even water.

111
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,014
I told you to get your legs treated,
but you haven't.

112
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:23,766
Why?

113
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,768
Do you just want to die?

114
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,036
Do whatever you want, then.

115
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,996
You never listen to me anyway.

116
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,794
Are you devastated

117
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,130
by Yeong-guk's death?

118
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,175
I heard he burned coal briquettes.

119
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:03,889
There's a man named Cheol-myeong
who lives over the hill by himself.

120
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:08,602
I heard he and Yeong-guk were found
dead together with smiles on their faces.

121
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,772
People who saw them told me so.

122
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,942
They were smiling

123
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,111
as if they were going to a good place.

124
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,947
Apparently, they seemed at peace.

125
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,995
They were of age to die anyway.

126
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,955
There's nothing left to regret.

127
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,833
Stop spewing nonsense, will you?

128
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,210
What is the age to die?

129
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,921
We all die when we're destined to die.

130
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,757
Why did they burn briquettes?
What a hassle.

131
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,634
That's really crazy.

132
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,274
I'm just planting them back.

133
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,819
I don't expect you to look after them.

134
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,030
They also deserve a chance

135
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:03,991
to live until they can.

136
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,334
It's to die for.

137
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,255
Sang-su, tell the others
that we'll eat in ten minutes.

138
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,881
Sure.

139
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,552
Can you taste this for me?

140
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,554
Here... Goodness.

141
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:19,942
Sang-su, you're the best!

142
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:23,112
The more I see you,
the more I find you charming.

143
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:25,990
We should get married.

144
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,741
Sounds good.

145
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,201
That'd be nice.

146
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,245
You may not realize it,

147
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,497
but when I see you two,
you guys are quite compatible.

148
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,207
You're both funny and adorable.

149
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:38,669
How are we compatible?

150
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,719
<i>Ari, Ariyo</i>

151
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,971
What's with all the tension?

152
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,431
Sang-su.

153
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,184
She was only joking because we were.

154
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,979
There's no need to get all serious
and roll your eyes.

155
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,063
Hye-ri, leave us.

156
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,320
Just because you like her

157
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,113
doesn't mean that she has to
like you back.

158
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,533
If I liked you,
you must like me back then.

159
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,201
Do you like me?

160
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,329
That's enough.

161
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,206
You're going to lose
your friendship as well,

162
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,666
you loser.

163
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,505
Come on out, both of you.
Your mom's waiting.

164
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,345
Your feelings for me.

165
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,139
Was it for real?

166
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,230
I said I liked you,

167
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,357
and I asked you out.

168
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,776
I meant it no matter how I said it.

169
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,200
I don't feel the same way though.

170
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,619
You're just a friend.

171
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,245
A cute and fun friend.

172
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,771
I'm nothing more than a friend.

173
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,272
Is that it?

174
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,482
That's right.

175
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,952
Then you do your thing,
I'll keep doing mine.

176
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,078
That's what we'll do.

177
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,124
-What do you mean by that?
-I'll keep liking you.

178
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,043
Your career and money
matters more than love.

179
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,295
You said it yourself.
You're not interested in dating.

180
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,217
Don't like me more than as a friend.

181
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,302
If you do, you'll get hurt.

182
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,305
Who are you to consider my feelings?
It's none of your business.

183
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,602
Let's just eat.

184
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,696
Regardless,
I made it clear that I'm not interested.

185
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,370
Gyeong-mo!

186
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,539
Hi, Ju-yeong.

187
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,042
Is that your car?

188
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,127
That's a sweet ride.

189
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:28,297
It's my brother's car.

190
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,508
It used to be his. He gave it to me.

191
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,218
Let's head inside.

192
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:34,636
Sure.

193
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,015
Wow, your car's nice.

194
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:59,244
SEND TO CAPTAIN AN AND 1 OTHER

195
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,537
CAPTAIN AN, CHOI MYEONG-HO

196
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,584
Here.

197
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,006
You look good.

198
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,091
Do I?

199
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,095
CAPTAIN AN JANG-MI

200
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,226
Yes, Captain An.

201
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,063
Choi Myeong-ho is in charge
of the illegal prostitution case.

202
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,397
You should ask him.

203
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,316
Yes, ask him.

204
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,654
I can't talk right now
since I'm with a friend.

205
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,781
Right.

206
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,283
You're with Ju-yeong, right?

207
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,078
The photos you sent
must be of his car then.

208
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,664
All right, bye.

209
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,505
We think it's the same perp
as the case last month

210
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,799
along the number five trail
of Mount Baekun last month.

211
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,176
The culprit used a condom,

212
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,803
and brought a portable mat.

213
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,473
Thankfully, unlike last time,
he left behind the mat

214
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,100
for us to find.

215
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,435
A hiker got lost and was walking this way,

216
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,729
when he saw the perp raping her
and yelled for help.

217
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,983
That's why the culprit
left without cleaning up.

218
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:15,112
I think she was on her way to school.
There's a middle school nearby.

219
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,657
We might have
a serial rapist on our hands.

220
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,493
A female officer took the victim
to the Sunflower Center

221
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,203
and she's now at the hospital.

222
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,497
She's in pretty bad shape

223
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,832
and is only 14.

224
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,709
Sick bastard.

225
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:31,378
He preys on young, helpless students.

226
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,092
Captain An, you were right.

227
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,763
He asked about our investigation
on the case saying that

228
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,807
<i>our two divisions
are competing for performance.</i>

229
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,434
<i>I said that we were</i>

230
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,562
following up on
the corporate representative too.

231
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,191
What did the guys
we captured the other day say?

232
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,109
They're all singing the same song.

233
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,695
According to them,
the representative is the head.

234
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,614
If all goes according to plan,

235
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,533
Ju-yeong will soon arrest
the homeless man as the representative.

236
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,826
Right.

237
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,204
The homeless man will go to prison,

238
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,998
<i>the actual ringleader will thank him</i>

239
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:10,500
and he'll move the operation elsewhere.

240
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,337
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

241
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,880
<i>Did Myeong-ho find anything out?</i>

242
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,465
He just got here.

243
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,634
Captain An is on the phone.

244
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:22,721
I showed the photo of the car
to my informant's on my way to work.

245
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:26,683
One of them sent over this footage
from a car dealership.

246
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,769
His brother didn't buy the car.

247
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:29,937
He did.

248
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,607
Two months ago,
he paid the full amount in cash.

249
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:37,027
The car is registered
in his brother's name though.

250
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:38,904
It's about Ju-yeong's car.

251
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,740
Myeong-ho, check your e-mail.

252
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:44,701
Detective Jang sent you a video.

253
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,398
Hold on a second.

254
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,817
Is he still gambling?

255
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,653
<i>12 years ago, he was punished</i>

256
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,405
<i>for getting involved with gambling.</i>

257
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,325
I put my guys on it
after remembering so myself.

258
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,077
During a month's time,

259
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,205
Ju-yeong and some others
gathered here 11 times.

260
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,082
We're right.

261
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,543
They're gambling here.

262
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,878
Whose jurisdiction is this?

263
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,756
Jangdong, district eight,
behind Wonho Market.

264
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,216
Damn it.

265
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:45,554
It means that other officers
are in on it with Ju-yeong.

266
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,889
Are you kidding me?

267
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,393
I'll put Detectives Jang
and Cho on the case.

268
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,644
Please assist the stakeout.

269
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,062
I have another case to solve.

270
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,440
It's another division's jurisdiction.
Can we get involved?

271
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,735
What are you all doing here?

272
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,031
We won't get a second chance then.

273
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:07,784
We only have one shot
to catch them red-handed.

274
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,370
This is such a mess.

275
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:14,583
We're on high alert right now
because of the rise of snatch theft

276
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,876
around the area.

277
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,377
All right. Goodbye.

278
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,798
Fine, I'll make sure
the one you like doesn't know.

279
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,133
I'll take care of it!

280
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,138
What is it? What's going on?

281
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,347
You're gathered here early.

282
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,434
Why do you want to know
the business of your superiors?

283
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,229
You're our subordinate,
so just focus on doing your job.

284
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,110
He's a bit on edge,
so don't take it personally.

285
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,445
You should go.

286
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,788
If Yang-chon finds out that

287
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,166
Ju-yeong's involved in
sex trafficking, he'll lose his mind

288
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,876
and beat the shit out of him.

289
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,088
It looks like he got Yang-chon demoted

290
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,757
and got transferred to
Criminal Investigation,

291
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:07,010
so he could take money off

292
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,596
of some sex traffickers without trouble.

293
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,349
I understand. I'll keep him out of it.

294
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,894
I'll tell the guys on the team
to not tell him.

295
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,945
Gyeong-mo, we get paid so little.

296
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,864
So what's the point of working hard

297
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,742
to preserve the force's reputation?

298
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:34,204
A few corrupt bastards like Ju-yeong

299
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,665
ruin everything we work so hard for.

300
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,292
I should just

301
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,419
kill every single one of...

302
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,256
I'll kill them all.

303
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,425
What's wrong now?

304
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,428
Will you just see a doctor?

305
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:55,142
-Or quit drinking.
-We always drink together.

306
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,439
This is driving me crazy.

307
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,490
She's an employee of the Sunflower Center.

308
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,994
-Where's the child?
-In surgery.

309
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,913
I think there was a big tear
in her cervix.

310
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,599
Do you want me to set you up with someone?

311
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,726
Sure.

312
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,353
Will you give up on Jeong-o?

313
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:41,813
Am I crazy?

314
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,357
She's two-timing me and Myeong-ho.
Why should I?

315
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,067
I'll two-time her too.

316
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:50,155
Nonsense. How is she two-timing you?
You're just hitting on her.

317
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,364
She isn't two-timing you.

318
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,950
How am I hitting on her? I just like her.

319
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,036
She's free to not like me.

320
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,955
I'm free to like her. What's the problem?

321
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,500
Don't be like that.
Don't complicate things for Myeong-ho.

322
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:07,881
Hey, it's been a really long time
since he dated anyone.

323
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,549
Don't you muddy the waters.

324
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:14,804
Why is he muddying the waters?
He's not dirt.

325
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,474
Sam-bo's looking for you.

326
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:22,270
Don't berate my colleague.
It pisses me off.

327
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,566
Sang-su.

328
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,195
We like Myeong-ho a lot.

329
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,030
He's a really nice guy.

330
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:37,202
Myeong-ho used to have a girlfriend.

331
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:38,411
Why talk about that?

332
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,915
Why keep it from him
when he'll find out anyway?

333
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:42,999
That's weirder.

334
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:48,546
Myeong-ho's girlfriend
was a cop in our year.

335
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,716
She died trying to save someone
at the scene of an accident.

336
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,179
So Myeong-ho took a break
and wandered about.

337
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:58,890
He only recently came back.

338
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,935
That's why he's below us in rank.

339
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,895
That's why even if it upsets you,

340
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,606
we can't help but support him.

341
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,234
Sorry.

342
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,528
Hey, you're still young.

343
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:12,862
Find someone else.

344
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:16,908
Hello, buddy.

345
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,577
Really? Jong-min will be penalized?

346
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,288
-Yes.
-Yes, you fool.

347
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,331
I'll take the fall in your place.

348
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,541
Out of loyalty.

349
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:29,004
Then I'd be grateful to you.

350
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,922
Did you think I'd say no?

351
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,634
Did you say you'd take the fall for show?

352
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,846
You knew that I would take the fall,

353
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:41,349
-so it was a show, right?
-You bet. You know what Nam-il's like.

354
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:43,935
He always gets out of everything.
Did you think he'd do it?

355
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,187
You punk, you...

356
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,481
You know me well.

357
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,985
I'm sorry about that.

358
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,112
I treat you like
my big brother from now on.

359
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,322
Let's go, brother.

360
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:56,948
I don't have a brother like you.

361
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,326
Based on looks, anyone would think
you're older than me.

362
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,535
-Me?
-Yes.

363
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:02,704
-You look older.
-No, you do.

364
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:07,917
Sang-su. Jeong-o and I...

365
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:13,673
Me and everyone else saw you kiss her.
You don't need to explain it to me.

366
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,011
I'm sorry about that.

367
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,097
Don't be.

368
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,517
But I can't wish you well.

369
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,023
But still,

370
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,818
Jeong-o might get uncomfortable,

371
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,112
so we shouldn't seem awkward.

372
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:37,906
Regardless of how things pan out.

373
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,785
Okay, Senior Patrol Officer Choi?

374
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,914
I prefer it when you call me Myeong-ho.

375
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:47,665
I don't want to anymore.

376
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,054
You look pretty today.

377
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:04,516
<i>Code Two.</i>

378
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,560
<i>We received a report that
someone is filming a video in secret</i>

379
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,896
using a drone near the rooftop
of 14-5 in Sangmyeong-dong.

380
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,816
The caller is Lee Myeong-hee
who lives at 14-5.

381
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,776
Requesting backup from officers.

382
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:15,985
<i>Kang Nam-il's on it.</i>

383
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,195
<i>Han Jeong-o, come to the car.</i>

384
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:18,113
See you.

385
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,364
-Take care.
-<i>Next call.</i>

386
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,116
-Okay.
-<i>Yeonseo-dong 191-7.</i>

387
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,659
<i>Yangil Heights Villa unit 101.</i>

00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,327

389
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,162
<i>loud music coming from the semi-basement.</i>

390
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,580
<i>Requesting backup from officers.</i>

391
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:30,750
Patrol 18, Patrol 18, we'll take it.

392
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:32,460
<i>Code Two, Code Two.</i>

393
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:35,255
Sion Convenience Store
on Bangyeong Intersection.

394
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:37,382
Suspected violation of
the Juvenile Protection Act.

395
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,134
<i>A man who looks homeless</i>

<i>Requesting backup from officers

398
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,266
The suspected violation of
the Juvenile Protection Act.

399
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:48,977
Patrol 21 will take it. Last call.

400
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:53,106
<i>Ilseong-dong 1560-64.</i>

401
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,275
<i>A domestic violence call from the wife.</i>

00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,527
<i>The husband got drunk and beat his wife.</i>

403
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,987
Patrol 18.

404
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,156
We'll take the domestic abuse call.
Last call.

405
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,198
<i>Patrol 23.</i>

406
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,492
<i>We'll also go there. Last call.</i>

407
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,911
<i>Nam-il, why are you coming?</i>

408
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,330
Weren't you on
a motorcycle happy slap attack?

409
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,500
We lost him. He was gone
by the time we reached the scene.

410
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:16,212
What are Myeong-ho and Jong-min doing
that you have to do everything?

411
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:19,007
<i>It's direct orders from
the assistant chief and captain.</i>

412
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,551
<i>Today, you, Sam-bo, and I</i>

413
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:24,554
<i>have to take all the calls today.</i>

414
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,307
<i>Just so you know,</i>

415
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,810
the Ilseong-dong 1560-64 call
we're responding to

416
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,188
has called us three to four times a year

417
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:36,941
<i>in the last three years, day and night,
for domestic violence.</i>

418
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,487
The wounds resulted in everything
from light to severe,

419
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,156
but each time we responded,

420
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,617
the drunk husband had calmed down

421
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,620
and the wife recanted,
saying that she was okay.

422
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,206
Are you listening, Yang-chon?

423
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,500
Copy. See you there.

424
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:58,838
You're quiet.

425
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,508
I'm not the talkative type.

426
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,177
Are you upset over Jeong-o?

427
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,181
I'm upset about that too.

428
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,183
What really upsets me

429
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,478
is that it always happens to me.

430
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,316
Women don't like me.

431
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,820
I'm poor, uneducated.

432
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,697
I live with my single mom, no home.

433
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,616
I'm not exactly handsome.

434
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,035
Also, while it's huge to me,

435
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,578
others think nothing of

436
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,789
my title as an officer.

437
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,333
But then

438
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,044
if I was a woman
and had to choose between us,

439
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,712
I'd pick Myeong-ho over myself.

440
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:41,214
He's handsome.

441
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:44,384
There are rumors he's rich.
He's good at his job.

442
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,469
I bet he owns the home he lives in.

443
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:49,222
You're drowning in sorrow.

444
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:53,059
-You look like you're at a funeral.
-You aren't on my side either, right?

445
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:56,729
If you're not the boss,

446
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,439
you can't date, let alone get married.

447
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,235
The world sucks like hell.

448
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,945
Damn it.

449
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,446
My god.

450
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,824
There are all sorts of crazy people.

451
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,703
If Jeong-o likes Myeong-ho
for his money and background,

452
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,454
earn more and become like him.

453
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,206
When will I be able to do that?

454
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,624
Then give up on Jeong-o.

455
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,751
Why do you want

456
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:22,088
a girl who puts money and
background over anything else?

457
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:23,756
You moron.

458
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,776
The scene of the incident is over there.

459
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:46,195
What are you doing? Can't you drive?

460
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,572
It's not the first time.

461
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,699
The old man buys cigarettes

462
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,409
and gives it to the kids.

463
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,786
I threatened to report him,
but he won't stop.

464
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:58,499
What happens if someone else
saw this and called it in?

465
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,209
The store owner

466
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,879
and you'll be punished for breaking
the Juvenile Protection Act.

467
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,381
Welcome.

468
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,221
What do you want?

469
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,099
-Cigarettes.
-Okay.

470
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,851
That one.

471
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,775
Thank you.

472
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,323
That's him.

473
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:33,743
Let's follow him.

474
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,748
It looks like

475
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:41,209
he'll pay a fine bigger than

476
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,461
what the kids paid him.

477
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,922
This is for you.

478
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,730
Put out your cigarettes! Right now.

479
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:04,315
Put them out.

480
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,192
-Damn it.
-Put them out now.

481
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:07,777
-Throw your cigarettes out!
-Shit.

482
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:10,113
-What the hell...
-Throw them out!

483
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:11,656
Put them out.

484
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,619
How can you try to make money off
buying cigarettes for minors?

485
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,039
You'll have to come to the station
with us, sir. You know that, right?

486
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,418
Take out your cigarettes.

487
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:27,964
Take out your cigarettes.
Take everything in your pocket out.

488
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,969
Fuck... This is totally ruining my day.

489
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,304
Just let it slide, will you?

490
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,307
My old man will kill me
if he finds out about this.

491
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,601
I won't smoke ever again,
so please let this slide.

492
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,895
This was my very first time
smoking a cigarette.

493
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,150
Same here. I didn't want to smoke,
but Man-yong kept forcing me to--

494
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,359
You little...

495
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,529
Did you force them to smoke?

496
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,406
Did you?

497
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,370
How dare you spit at a cop!

498
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:04,042
You're Man-yong, right? Chairman Yu's son.

499
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,419
The bully at Yangho High School.

500
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,963
You're scared of your father, aren't you?

501
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:13,551
You're going to get yelled at
by your father today, you little punk.

502
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,803
Yes, Sergeant Kim Min-seok.

503
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,305
-Yes, that's right.
-Fuck!

504
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,769
Be still
if you don't want to be restrained.

505
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:24,562
Are you okay, sir?

506
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,439
I'm fine.

507
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,441
Don't move.

508
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:31,694
Yes, tell Man-yong's father
to come to the station.

509
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,821
-No!
-Don't move!

510
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,573
-His gutsy son
-What the hell!

511
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,367
-spat on and hit an officer
-Let me go just this once.

512
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,995
-and coerced kids to smoke.
-My dad will kill me. Don't call him.

513
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,038
He's a bad kid.

514
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,415
-I'm sorry about everything.
-And...

515
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,752
-Don't move, okay?
-Send backup to the Seongan Park restroom.

516
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,756
-My gosh.
-Don't do that, okay?

517
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:57,929
Let me go!

518
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,723
Who do you think you are
to arrest me like this?

519
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:04,310
Didn't you hear what my wife said?
She doesn't want to press charges.

520
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:07,063
You cops have no right
to get involved in our fight!

521
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:09,774
Please, sir.
We're not taking you anywhere.

522
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:13,152
I'll get you a cup of tea so that you can
calm down. Please give me a minute, okay?

523
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:16,405
Let go. You'd better let go of me.
I'm going to sue you cops.

524
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:17,657
I said, let go!

525
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:18,699
Let go of me!

526
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,119
Hey! Let go!

527
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,666
Someone, please help me!

528
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,501
-Hey! Get me out!
-That bastard...

529
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:32,255
Sir, please give me a moment.
I'll bring you a cup of tea.

530
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:37,218
Hey, are you the only one with a temper?

531
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:41,514
Don't cause trouble.
Just go back in and help.

532
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:48,104
Sir, why did you drink so much?

533
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,856
Were you angry about something?

534
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,524
Do I need a reason to drink?

535
00:35:58,614 --> 00:35:59,782
So you're saying that

536
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,494
you don't want to press charges
against him even though you called us?

537
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:06,539
That's right. I won't press charges.

538
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,584
He only gets like that when he drinks,
so it's fine.

539
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,002
Please leave now.

540
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:14,130
But doesn't your husband drink
almost every day?

541
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,133
That means this happens on a daily basis.

542
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,011
What is your problem?
I told you that I won't press charges.

543
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,017
Let's go, sir.

544
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,061
There's nothing we can do
if she doesn't want to press charges.

545
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:30,646
Ma'am.

546
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:34,150
I must say it's very dangerous
if this happens repeatedly.

547
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,945
If you neglect it,
it can lead to a more serious problem.

548
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,031
That's right.
It looks like you also have children.

549
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,284
What if he hurts them--

550
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,203
My daughters are safe
because I'll protect them.

551
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,956
How can they be safe
when their mom is not safe?

552
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,753
I'll have to divorce him
if I press charges.

553
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,713
Then what will happen to my daughters?

554
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,590
I have no means of earning income.

555
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,259
But how can you live in this unsafe--

556
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,219
Officer Han.

557
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,137
Wait outside.

558
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,058
This is insane.

559
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:13,231
I guess we'll have to leave if you don't
want your husband to be punished.

560
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,067
Officer Yeom, please bring her--

561
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,277
The information on
Domestic Abuse Victims and Support.

562
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:20,696
I'll go bring it.

563
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:27,411
Let me help. I'll do it.

564
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:43,261
Sang-su, did she take the information
sheet for domestic abuse victims?

565
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,014
She didn't want to,
but I gave it to her in secret.

566
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,685
Lieutenant Oh wants to patrol this area
for ten minutes.

567
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:55,856
Her husband might beat her again
after we leave, so until he calms down--

568
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,608
We have other cases too. Do we have to--

569
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:01,696
Is getting annoyed like that the best
you can do in this situation as a cop?

570
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,198
I'm going on patrol.

571
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,040
"I'm going on patrol."

572
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,256
The situation has been resolved.

573
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:24,385
Patrol 23 and 18 will return
after patrolling the area for ten minutes.

574
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:27,179
You lost. Just drive.

575
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,861
Those girls must be their daughters.

576
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,324
Hey, Detective Jang.

577
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,201
Do you have any leads?

578
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:33,329
According to our records,
Detective Lee works nights on Fridays,

579
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,705
so they meet here during the day.

580
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,416
It's already past 5 p.m.,
but we haven't seen them.

581
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,379
Sergeant Ban just returned to the station

582
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,005
because they're short-staffed today.

583
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,340
Let's wait a bit more.

584
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,218
I asked a friend of mine
at Jangdong Police Station,

585
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:49,929
<i>and Detective Lee is off today,
so he'll probably play today.</i>

586
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,097
Then he'll come.

587
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,224
Let's wait.

588
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,102
We're risking our lives to bust
the prostitution ring.

589
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,812
Catching the scrubs will hurt our pride.

590
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,066
<i>I'm certain that something
is happening here.</i>

591
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:03,776
<i>The evidence tells us so.</i>

592
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,166
Students shouldn't smoke.

593
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,377
-Just study hard.
-Why did you do that?

594
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,045
-Go home.
-I told you to study hard.

595
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:24,880
Let's talk at home. Go on.

596
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,843
You'd better not smoke again.

597
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,887
-I'm so embarrassed.
-We won't let you go like this next time.

598
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,848
-Thank you for coming.
-You never listen to me.

599
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,267
-Don't be too harsh on them.
-Don't do it ever again.

600
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:38,978
Let's go back in.

601
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:40,896
Come on.

602
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,491
Man-yong, don't do it again, okay?

603
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:55,911
Mr. Yu.

604
00:40:56,495 --> 00:41:00,082
Coercing other students to do bad things
can be a serious problem.

605
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,334
Have a word with him,
so he doesn't do it again.

606
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:26,192
You little punk, how dare you.
Why did you coerce them like that?

607
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,360
You're supposed to be studying, you moron.

608
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:32,573
-Jeez.
-Who told you to do such a thing

609
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,241
instead of studying? You punk.

610
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:37,828
Stop right there!

611
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:39,747
Get back here!

612
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,999
What a dysfunctional family.

613
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:43,459
Pretend you didn't see it.

614
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,558
-I'll take him to the station, sir.
-Okay.

615
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:09,360
He retired from his job
at a renowned company recently.

616
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,446
So what?

617
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:15,407
I'll be retiring soon too. So what?

618
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:17,618
I was just...

619
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:21,330
Does your leg hurt?

620
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:26,001
No, it's fine. I get paid to do this job,
so it shouldn't hurt.

621
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,029
Old man, consider yourself dead.

622
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,618
I specifically told you
not to call my dad.

623
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,874
<i>Yang-chon, are you done with your call?</i>

624
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,292
What the hell is going on?

625
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:54,423
Lieutenant, we were all busy,

626
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:57,092
<i>so you had to ride solo
on the major cases.</i>

627
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,970
I'm asking you what you were busy doing!

628
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:04,016
We had two Code Zeros and three Code Ones.

629
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:06,518
<i>What on earth were you and Myeong-ho doing</i>

630
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:07,936
<i>that you didn't show up once?</i>

631
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,855
It's not like they're taking a break.

632
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:12,441
-The captain and assistant chief--
-Exactly!

633
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,695
What were the captain
and assistant chief's orders?

634
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:20,199
<i>Everyone but me seems to know
what's going on right now!</i>

635
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:22,451
-<i>That's enough!</i>
-I haven't even started!

636
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,704
Either don't worry that I'll get hurt,

637
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:28,040
or don't make me take on
every single call.

638
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:29,833
This is bullshit!

639
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:34,171
Sang-su is still recovering
from the head injury.

640
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:37,383
Today, he wrestled a drunk man threatening
to kill his friend with a knife.

641
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,469
And I took on seven other drunkards
by myself!

642
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,221
In the end, nothing happened,

643
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:43,597
<i>so it's fine.</i>

644
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:48,560
Is that really what a captain of a team
should be saying to his subordinates?

645
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,562
<i>Do you hate me?</i>

646
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:52,356
<i>Am I being ostracized?</i>

647
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,566
Do you hate that we work together?

648
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:57,486
You have plenty of power. Just fire me!

649
00:44:57,611 --> 00:45:00,948
What's the point of making things
so complicated, you punk?

650
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:10,124
Lieutenant Oh exited the vehicle.

651
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,167
EUN GYEONG-MO

652
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:17,256
Sang-su, good job today. Your hard work

653
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,466
<i>will be considered in your evaluation.</i>

654
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,677
-Sang-su, good job--
-<i>Whatever.</i>

655
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,075
<i>Sir,
Detective Lee's car is heading your way.</i>

656
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,429
<i>Detective Jang, Detective Cho,
and Officer Choi,</i>

657
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:07,139
<i>seven men including Lee Ju-yeong</i>

658
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:09,266
<i>are entering what we think
is an illegal gambling den.</i>

659
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:13,770
In terms of illegal gambling,
evidence is most important.

660
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,606
<i>We will wait in our places</i>

661
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,649
<i>until the games begin.</i>

662
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:22,321
If they don't leave
the building within the hour,

663
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:24,531
we can assume that they are gambling.

664
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,326
That's when we make our move.

665
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,248
Can you stick this patch on my back?

666
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:46,553
<i>Code Zero. Code Zero.
We call this case "Scream."</i>

667
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,139
<i>45-1, Nakwon Villa, Hongil 3-dong.</i>

668
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:50,933
<i>An urgent woman's voice reported</i>

669
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:54,353
<i>that someone came in through her door
by punching in the code.</i>

670
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:57,564
<i>Her call ended as she screamed
after telling us her address.</i>

671
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,608
<i>Theft, burglary, rape, and murder.</i>

672
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:01,276
<i>Anything is possible.</i>

673
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:05,405
Patrol 18, Patrol 18 reporting. Last call.

674
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:09,034
Patrol 23, Patrol 23 reporting. Last call.

675
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,250
It's us and Sergeant Kang again.

676
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:18,544
You've got to be kidding me.

677
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,087
Lieutenant Lee,

678
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:23,382
I'm sure you just heard
the call from Nakwon Villa.

679
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:27,135
I find it strange that someone
punched in a code only she knows.

680
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:30,138
She must know who it is,
but yet she screamed.

681
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,933
We can assume that the perp
has been watching the victim.

682
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,727
However, the victim probably didn't know
she was being watched.

683
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:39,731
Please check her neighborhood to see

684
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,693
if there's anyone capable of such a crime.

685
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:46,113
We are heading to the scene as I speak.

686
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,365
Turn the siren off.
The culprit might hear us.

687
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,412
While filling out a report on that area,

688
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:55,038
it was noted that

689
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,666
a recently released sex offender
was living nearby.

690
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:01,044
A patrol division can't
access the ankle monitor log.

691
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:03,755
Even if we ask for access,
it'll take too long. What do we do?

692
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,215
Do you know the layout?

693
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,633
<i>There are two units on each floor.</i>

694
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,552
Three floors, so six units in total.

695
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:12,889
The sex offender lives on
the third floor on the right.

696
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:15,809
Two weeks ago,
I went there on a noise complaint.

697
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:18,645
<i>A single woman lives alone
in the right unit of the second floor.</i>

698
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:20,439
<i>That could be the one.</i>

699
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:21,815
<i>Instead of asking around,</i>

700
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,610
<i>check said unit first.</i>

701
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,320
<i>Seeing as to how she screamed </i>

702
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,488
<i>within two minutes of calling,</i>

703
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:29,948
<i>there could've been a struggle.</i>

704
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,783
<i>Get there before things escalate.</i>

705
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,718
Did you see any fire alarms
on your way up?

706
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:50,802
No, sir.

707
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,638
Then why is there one here?

708
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:56,350
Let's take a look.

709
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:11,323
It's a hidden camera.

710
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,825
Sergeant Kang is guarding the back gate.

711
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,959
We have one try. We don't have time.

712
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:32,511
Freeze!

713
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:47,818
Stand up.

714
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,289
You are under arrest

715
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:03,709
for breaking and entering,
rape or attempted rape.

716
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:05,752
-You have the right to an attorney.
-Check her.

717
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,838
You can appeal to the terms

718
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:08,964
of your arrest.

719
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:13,427
Ma'am, we're the police.

720
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:20,475
Requesting paramedics.

721
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:22,561
45-1, Hongil 3-dong.

722
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:24,479
Right unit on the second floor
of Nakwon Villa.

723
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:25,772
-Requesting Paramedics.
-Fuck.

724
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:27,983
You should've come a few minutes later.

725
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,953
He looked like he was about to
attack the victim.

726
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:41,705
It seemed that way to me.

727
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:44,374
I agree.

728
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,171
I don't know what's going on.

729
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:52,257
What are you looking at? She did good.

730
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,426
I thought he was going to attack her too.

731
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,471
Nam-il, give me a hand.

732
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:12,736
Leave us.

733
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:16,156
I'll stand by the door
until the EMTs arrive.

734
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:19,576
<i>Women & Juvenile Affairs Division
headed out five minutes ago.</i>

735
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:22,078
Women & Juvenile Affairs is coming.

736
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:52,067
Nothing happened.

737
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:54,402
You know that, right?

738
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:56,655
We got here

739
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,949
very quickly.

740
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:04,621
My fiancé

741
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:07,999
can't know about what happened today.

742
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:11,586
We're getting married soon.

743
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,924
He'll think I'm tarnished.

744
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:20,846
According to

745
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:23,056
the Victim Protection Act,

746
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:24,641
we can't tell anyone

747
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,060
about this case.

748
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:31,523
Not even to

749
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:34,067
your family.

750
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:38,989
If you want,

751
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:43,743
it'll be like this never happened.

752
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,918
I'm sure you're overwhelmed.
Don't try to speak.

753
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:54,129
Just stay as you are.

754
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,132
An ambulance will be here soon.

755
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:26,745
MY LAST ROOKIE

756
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:47,557
Enjoy.

757
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:53,897
What's going on
with the others in the team?

758
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:55,482
How can they not show up--

759
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:56,733
I don't know anything.

760
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:01,571
You know we're off the clock, right?

761
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:04,783
We won't take any calls from now on, okay?

762
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:29,140
The reason I was unfriendly
at the domestic abuse case was--

763
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:30,934
You probably thought I was cold.

764
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:34,646
But I didn't like the mom.

765
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:39,109
She refused help when she needed it

766
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:42,028
and believed her kids were safe

767
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:44,781
when her husband was abusive.

768
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,911
She doesn't think
she can raise her kids alone,

769
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:52,330
so she refuses to sue or divorce him

770
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,958
She must believe that's the best she...

771
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:01,631
Her daughters couldn't go inside.

772
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:04,217
Because their dad was home.

773
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,596
To them, he's just

774
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:13,476
a criminal who uses violence.

775
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:20,191
They saw my patrol car
but couldn't ask for help.

776
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,277
All because of their mom.

777
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:26,698
They think doing as she wants

778
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:29,659
equals taking her side.

779
00:55:40,336 --> 00:55:42,047
I was like that once.

780
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:46,092
I should have

781
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:50,263
worried about and protected my own self.

782
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:53,850
I was too busy worrying about my mom

783
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:58,730
that I couldn't do anything.

784
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:03,902
Earlier,

785
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:09,949
when we saved the woman
right before she was raped,

786
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:12,911
she wasn't worried about herself.

787
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:16,581
She was more concerned with

788
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:17,957
what her fiancé would think.

789
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:22,045
Isn't that so sad?

790
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,050
A victim has to worry about

791
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:29,219
what people think

792
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:32,555
instead of worrying about themselves.

793
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:43,817
You're right.

794
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:46,945
It's sad.

795
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:05,004
Until a while ago,

796
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,923
I thought you were a nasty girl

797
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:09,759
who liked someone for his money
and background,

798
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,970
and I was going to forget about you.

799
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:15,682
I can't do it.

800
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:19,727
You're a good person.
You're very thoughtful.

801
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:22,772
I'm going to keep liking you.

802
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:38,121
Hey.

803
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:43,084
You're really going to end up getting hurt
because of me.

804
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:44,752
I can't be responsible.

805
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:46,379
Don't worry.

806
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,256
I won't burden you by focusing on you.

807
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:49,966
I'll date other girls too.

808
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:01,853
If I end up falling for someone, so be it.

809
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:03,980
See you at the station.

810
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:06,983
What's he talking about?

811
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:13,406
You're digging your own grave.

812
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:17,869
Let her go. Why drag it on and on? My god.

813
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:19,913
Stay out of my business.

814
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:34,302
SAUNA

815
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,348
Damn it.

816
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,058
Let him go.

817
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:43,436
Go for the head. Focus on your roles.

818
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,402
We're patrolling
the area around the sauna.

819
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:17,262
MEN'S BATH

820
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:36,531
Who is it?

821
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:38,074
Hello, sir.

822
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:40,618
-Can you move the car with the plate 3377?
-What?

823
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:42,453
It's parked properly.

824
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,455
Sorry, can you move it?

825
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:45,582
Just a moment.

826
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:54,799
Stay still.

827
00:59:58,052 --> 00:59:59,012
Everybody freeze.

828
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:00,722
Freeze.

829
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:02,890
Hands up.

830
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,269
Put them up!

831
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:13,985
You're under arrest for gambling.

832
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:14,902
Stay where you are.

833
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:16,237
Which of you

834
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,406
owns the sauna or the building?

835
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:23,953
We were just having some fun.

836
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:28,291
All this comes to less than 200,000 won.

837
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:31,502
That's too little
to charge us with gambling for.

838
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,212
Hand over your IDs.

839
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:34,756
Don't do anything suspicious.

840
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:36,591
Damn...

841
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:42,347
I can't believe you're doing this.

842
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:44,182
It's just a few thousand won.

843
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:46,934
Hey.

844
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:49,520
Are you kidding?

845
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,982
-Where are you from?
-Detective Cha.

846
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:56,653
Stand guard outside the building
and by the rear entrance.

847
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:05,244
There are cops waiting inside and outside.

848
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:06,913
Everywhere.

849
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:08,790
There's a lot of us.

850
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:10,833
-We just had fun--
-"Fun"?

851
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:13,211
The 1,000-won bills are chips.

852
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:18,049
Where's the cash? In your car?

853
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,302
You exchange real cash after the game.

854
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:25,473
Does a bill equal 100,000 won? A million?

855
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:29,060
Damn it.

856
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:34,982
Fine. I'll come to the station with you.

857
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:37,860
Yes, I gambled. So what?

858
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:40,571
I used 1,000 won bills to gamble
up to 100 million won!

859
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:42,740
But...

860
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:46,661
If you don't find any money in our cars,
then you're dead.

861
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:58,131
What are you doing?

862
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,049
Why are you cuffing me?

863
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,595
This is excessive use of force!

864
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:06,472
You can deal with that later on.

865
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:09,684
Let's see if gambling
and opening a house is everything.

866
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:13,980
Perhaps there are additional crimes
of bodily harm and false imprisonment.

867
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:16,607
You never know.

868
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:20,403
We found four stacks of money,

869
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:23,281
but there are only three gamblers.

870
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:27,160
Why is it three? I'm here too.

871
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:28,786
You're the errand boy who serves drinks.

872
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:31,581
You're out of their league.

873
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:40,506
Here's the thing.

874
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,134
Seven men initially

875
01:02:44,218 --> 01:02:45,344
entered the building.

876
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:56,063
One just left,
which brings the number down to six.

877
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,691
Yet there are only four of you here.

878
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:01,319
Two are missing!

879
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:53,412
I have

880
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:55,748
a hunch
