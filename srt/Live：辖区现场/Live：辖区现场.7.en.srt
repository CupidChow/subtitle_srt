CHARACTERS AND PLACES ASSOCIATED
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:01,061
Why should you pay?

3
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,645
Why should you pay?

4
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,024
Why should you pay? You asshole.

5
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,529
Help me!

6
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,365
Help me!

7
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,079
Help me!

8
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,718
This is Han Jeong-o
from the Hongil Patrol Division.

9
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,929
A man in his 40s

10
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,848
is assaulting a young man
in the Dongjin Officetel parking lot.

11
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:42,185
<i>Requesting back up from Sergeant Kang
and patrol cars in the vicinity.</i>

12
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,734
<i>This is driving me crazy. Damn it!</i>

13
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,083
Sir.

14
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,044
Please calmly exit from the car.

15
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,098
Officer Han, arrest him.

16
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,479
<i>What the hell are they doing?</i>

17
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:30,400
-This was a done deal.
-Have they completely lost their minds?

18
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,901
Let's wrap up.

19
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,154
What the fuck...

20
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,389
A cop got hurt! An officer is hurt!

21
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:04,267
Good. That's good. Great job.

22
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,853
-An officer is hurt!
-See? Your leg is fine.

23
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,105
-Don't cry.
-A cop got injured!

24
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,065
Seo-yeong slashed an officer in the face.

25
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,567
He ran that way.

26
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:17,363
Seo-yeong slashed an officer
from his neck to face.

27
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,157
I saw him bleeding.

28
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,327
Stay here with your friend
until the paramedics arrive.

29
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,495
The entrance of Hongil Park.

30
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,415
An officer... Officer Yeom Sang-su
from Hongil Patrol Division

31
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,250
has been slashed with a knife
by a suspect.

32
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,836
Requesting paramedics!
Requesting paramedics!

33
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,088
Requesting back up from patrol cars
in the vicinity!

34
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,472
They went that way. That way!

35
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:32,605
Are your eyes okay?

36
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,357
Can you see?

37
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,318
I'm not sure.

38
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:41,864
I'm all right.

39
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,290
-Please get up.
-Just let him stay like that.

40
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,250
My chest hurts.

41
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,384
Everything else seems fine,
but I think his leg is broken.

42
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,762
You idiot, do you know what happens
when you slash a cop with a knife?

43
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,433
It's considered obstructing justice
and causing bodily harm.

44
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,942
Mr. Oh... Lieutenant.

45
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,695
The bleeding won't stop.

46
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:22,905
What's wrong with me?

47
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,383
Hongil Park on Semyeong-ro.

48
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:45,845
In front of Yangwon Villa.
Requesting help from patrol cars nearby.

49
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:48,931
Patrol cars in the vicinity.

50
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,226
Why isn't anyone coming?

51
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,395
What the hell is everyone doing?

52
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:12,246
EPISODE 7

53
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,379
-Hey, Lieutenant Oh...
-Is it serious?

54
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,131
If you read the situation, come with us.

55
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,593
Can't you see this?
I heard Team Two and Four went there too.

56
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,679
They went to deal with a school
violence case. Listen to your radios!

57
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,891
Sir, please wake up.

58
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,060
Wait up!

59
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:38,564
Sir.

60
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,694
I've been on patrol
for ten hours straight.

61
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,863
Sang-su should be okay, right?

62
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,908
What did they do that four people
ended up getting hurt?

63
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,869
Oh Yang-chon is the only one who's okay.

64
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,336
Get out of the car, please.

65
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,090
Jeez, why on earth
are you doing this to me?

66
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,926
Sam-bo, stop crying already.

67
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,971
It's a good thing, don't you think?

68
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:14,934
Her mom has dementia,
and she kept a pile of medication at home.

69
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,522
Think about how tough
Han-soon's life must've been.

70
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,900
They said...

71
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,696
Han-soon could only move her fingers.

72
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:28,948
She...

73
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,660
texted us to ask that we save her mother
even as she was dying.

74
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:36,706
She said she was okay.

75
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:38,875
She just wanted her mom to live.

76
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,212
It's better that they died together.

77
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,506
I mean,
what's her mom going to do all by herself?

78
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,968
That woman was in her 80s,
and she had dementia.

79
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,512
It's better to be alive together

80
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:55,808
and to be by one another's side
on their way to the afterlife.

81
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,312
Sam-bo, be positive.

82
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,316
No matter what happens, we, cops, must try

83
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:07,236
to be positive about everything!

84
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,616
We've arrived at your place, sir.

85
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,831
I'm sorry I made you drive
after your shift.

86
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,460
I'm off.

87
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,653
Gosh, Chief. You drank too much.

88
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,447
Let it all out, sir.

89
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,951
Just a second, please.

90
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,040
Hey, Han-pyo.

91
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,591
Chief,
you can go home alone from here, right?

92
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,009
Something happened at the station.

93
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:15,888
You don't need to go back for it.

94
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,015
I'll get going. See you tomorrow.

95
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:21,978
Taxi!

96
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,605
Taxi!

97
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,899
This patient needs urgent care.

98
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,026
Come this way, please. This way.

99
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,075
OPERATING ROOM

100
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,969
Jeez, the cut is quite deep.

101
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:02,768
By the way,

102
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,062
didn't I do such a good job today?

103
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,649
I ran after him
like my life depended on it.

104
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,571
Wasn't I pretty cool today?

105
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,657
I don't think it cut his arteries,
but why is he bleeding so much?

106
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:34,258
The victim got two teeth knocked out,
but he doesn't have other injuries.

107
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,678
So we sent him home with his parents
after he was treated and questioned.

108
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,806
The delivery guy has a broken rib,

109
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,517
but it isn't serious,
so he doesn't require treatment.

110
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,603
Senior Officer Choi
and Officer Kim are preparing

111
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,271
to send him home after questioning.

112
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,357
The suspect is undergoing surgery

113
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,233
because his leg is completely broken.

114
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:55,029
We've already confirmed his identity,

115
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,739
so we'll let him get treated first.

116
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,825
Sergeant Ban, Senior Officer Choi,
Officer Kim, and I

117
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,744
have sent their statements to the station,

118
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,663
and we're headed to
take care of another case.

119
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,262
-I'll start stitching now.
-Okay.

120
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,348
Okay. Relax.

121
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,727
Jeez, I'm so annoyed.

122
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,146
Who handles a case like this?

123
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,273
What was Oh Yang-chon doing?

124
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,235
I can't believe he let his mentee
chase the suspect alone.

125
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,780
I feel so bad for the delivery guy.

126
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,074
He got roped into this while working.

127
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,868
Both of his parents are ill,

128
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,038
so his family is dependent on his income,
but he'll be out of work for a while.

129
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,665
Hey, wait.

130
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,709
-What's wrong?
-Damn it.

131
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,637
You must've been tired.

132
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,098
Let's go.
You said something's up at the station.

133
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,142
Let me rest for a minute!

134
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,940
Is Lieutenant Oh really a legend?
Isn't he a troublemaker?

135
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,317
Or all he cares about is his performance.

136
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,320
If not, why is he always excessive
when resolving cases?

137
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,787
Why are you glaring at Won-u?

138
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,624
Are you taking Lieutenant Oh's side

139
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,084
because he was your mentor?

140
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,211
Four kids
and his partner ended up getting hurt

141
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,129
over a stupid case.

142
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:39,008
Is his job getting his partners hurt?

143
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,802
How many of his partners have gotten hurt?

144
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:46,015
-Hey! He didn't do it on purpose.
-Come on. Let's just get in the car.

145
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,601
Everyone's tired and a bit on edge today.

146
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:49,977
Let's go. Come on.

147
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,105
You should get going too.

148
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,149
You jerk. Why are you taking his side?

149
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,026
-Just let it go.
-He always takes his side.

150
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:58,986
Just let it go.

151
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,196
I'll catch you later.

152
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:06,952
-Be careful.
-Yes, sir.

153
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,289
That asshole hit our friend first.

154
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,249
He kept hindering our plays
while shooting pool,

155
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,459
so we said something to him.

156
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,794
He threw the first punch at Pil-gyu.

157
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,338
Be quiet!

158
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,132
You're making up the story as you go.

159
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,179
If your claim that Pil-gyu
was the only one to get beat up,

160
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:28,432
why does that part-timer, Seo-yeong,
have cuts and bruises on his face?

161
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,435
You guys hit him too!
All of you ganged up on him!

162
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,188
Head on home.
I'll take it from here. Okay?

163
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,983
Captain Eun wants us to wrap this up
since one of our own got hurt.

164
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,236
-Let me get a drink of water.
-Good.

165
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,073
You stay here.
The others can wait in the corner.

166
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,699
-But--
-Shut it!

167
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,785
The right park at Hyunnam Apartment
on Eonjung 4-gil.

168
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:51,247
-Father and son are fighting with knives
-Request for paramedics.

169
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,165
-Fire near Mt. Seohyun.
-and called it in.

170
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,375
Requesting local back up.

171
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,127
The right park at Hyunnam Apartment
on Eonjung 4-gil.

172
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:01,215
-Father and son are fighting with knives.
-Request for paramedics.

173
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,925
Let's get this straight.

174
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:05,970
So you...

175
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,138
his girlfriend...

176
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,267
You came onto his girlfriend,

177
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:15,312
so that man punched you a couple of times.

178
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,232
You're fine with it,
so you want to be released.

179
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,025
Is that really what happened?

180
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,027
Yes.

181
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,114
At the scene, you...

182
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,825
Sir,

183
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:31,495
you called out to the officer for help.
You said, "Help me."

184
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:33,539
Right?

185
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,126
What was that then?

186
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,461
What was it?

187
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,431
What do you think you're doing?

188
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,100
It slipped my mind,

189
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,310
but I

190
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,146
don't have to write a statement.

191
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,482
There's no rule saying

192
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,526
that I'm required to.

193
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,487
I completely forgot.

194
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:07,865
I can't write it.

195
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,283
Unbelievable.

196
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,993
Look here, sir.

197
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,289
At the scene, you clearly were--

198
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,249
I told you already.

199
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,837
He came onto my girlfriend,

200
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,839
so I got angry and beat him up.

201
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,841
But we agreed

202
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,010
to let this one slide.

203
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,806
We're making your job easier,

204
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,392
so what's the issue?

205
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,857
Sergeant Ban, Officer Choi,

206
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,400
this ass...

207
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,488
Can you watch these two gentlemen for me?

208
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,797
Look in front of you
instead of exchanging looks.

209
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,799
Add "sir", will you?

210
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,938
When did those two agree upon a story?

211
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,065
They said they fought over a girl.

212
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,525
We know it's bullshit.

213
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,610
Anyone can tell

214
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,404
that they're lying.

215
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,531
On the day the prostitute got roughed up,

216
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,992
the younger man,
who claims to be a university TA,

217
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,995
left his car in the parking lot
of the apartment building.

218
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,247
The other guy, who looks like a thug,

219
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,291
knew and waited for him
to beat the shit out of him.

220
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,503
The bigger one out there
must work for a prostitution ring.

221
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:48,007
He wanted the younger one
to pay for the damages he cost.

222
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,009
But since the TA refused,

223
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,011
-he beat him up.
-The TA

224
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,846
wanted help when he was getting beat,

225
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,015
but now that he's okay, thanks to Jeong-o,

226
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,267
he's worried that people at his school
will find out,

227
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,643
so he changed his story.

228
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,480
We're in a bigger mess though.

229
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,940
CAPTAIN AN JANG-MI

230
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,985
Captain An was ready
to follow the suspects.

231
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,946
She had a camera installed
that overlooks the car

232
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,865
-and was running surveillance.
-What?

233
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,533
<i>What are you going to do now?</i>

234
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,869
<i>We were on a stakeout for four days.</i>

235
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,954
Do your job as first responders.

236
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,081
Who told you to dig into cases? Who?

237
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,001
Detective Jang,
do you have to put it like that?

238
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:26,170
Do you think we ruined your investigation
on purpose?

239
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,255
<i>Even if it's obviously
an illegal prostitution ring,</i>

240
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,215
we don't have any conclusive evidence.

241
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,259
We were going to tail them
to get to their head.

242
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,428
<i>Do you know how hard we prepared
for this mission?</i>

243
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,597
<i>Now that they know you're onto them,</i>

244
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,725
<i>so they'll clean up operations
and go into hiding.</i>

245
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,393
A man was crying out for help.

246
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,020
Were we supposed to ignore that?

247
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,898
Detective Jang, listen to me.

248
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,109
We didn't ruin the investigation.

249
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,653
Why aren't you acknowledging
your own mistakes?

250
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,156
If only you had told us in advanced

251
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:58,452
that you wanted our cooperation
for your stakeout in our jurisdiction...

252
00:17:58,535 --> 00:17:59,953
My words exactly!

253
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,664
Why wouldn't you cooperate
with the local patrol division?

254
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,458
Are you disregarding our division?

255
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,960
-<i>Everyone, listen to me carefully.</i>
-We're listening!

256
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,213
The reason why

257
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,256
we didn't inform you about this case

258
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,510
is because most cases like this
require the help of police officers.

259
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,470
<i>It had to be top secret.</i>

260
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,639
<i>Our bosses reiterated that too.</i>

261
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,728
Regardless of that,

262
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,606
you still can't blame

263
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:28,941
the botched operation on us.

264
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:32,402
A man was banging on his window
crying for help.

265
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,071
-Jeong-o--
-<i>Officer Han.</i>

266
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,448
Yes, ma'am.

267
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,034
Did you need a merit?

268
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,915
Why would you say that?
What did she do wrong?

269
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,416
She was only following protocol.

270
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,169
Damn it!

271
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,967
No, ma'am. I didn't do it for merits.

272
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,221
I forgot.

273
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,557
Captain An, I'm sorry.

274
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,642
Sir!

275
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,186
When Officer Han...

276
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,148
reported to the parking dispute
near the apartment

277
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,358
and spotted the younger suspect there,

278
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,777
instead of running after him,

279
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,029
she should've

280
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,657
reported to you

281
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,285
at the Women & Juvenile Affairs Division.

282
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,290
I'm starving.

283
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,252
This is really frustrating.

284
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:34,840
As long as those two

285
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,593
have no intent on pressing charges,
and their stories match,

286
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,720
we can't hold them, so I'll let them go.

287
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:45,934
Let them go. Just do it!

288
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:47,811
You're free to go.

289
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,487
I'm sorry, sir.

290
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,411
It wasn't all for nothing.

291
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:08,123
Thanks to the younger suspect's
written statement--

292
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:13,879
Yes?

293
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,798
<i>The pen and paper the TA wrote with--</i>

294
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,467
We'll run them for prints.

295
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,970
He also had some water,
so we'll send his cup to Forensics.

296
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,349
His DNA can be compared
to what we found at the scene.

297
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,142
<i>Put Han Jeong-o on if she's next to you.</i>

298
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,854
Here.

299
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,404
It's me, ma'am.

300
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,323
<i>Han Jeong-o.</i>

301
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:45,369
<i>There's one more
crucial mistake you made tonight.</i>

302
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,413
I know what it is.

303
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:50,832
What do you know?

304
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,379
Because of my rash actions,

305
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,508
I may have endangered

306
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,177
a powerless victim,

307
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,306
<i>who is unable to get help or medical care,</i>

308
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,142
<i>at this very moment.</i>

309
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,815
I apologize.

310
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,110
<i>Put Captain Eun on.</i>

311
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,203
Hey.

312
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,458
Why did you break the monitor?
How will you compensate for it?

313
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,169
Sorry about today.

314
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,339
Let us cooperate on this operation.

315
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,800
<i>I'll give your boss the file.</i>

316
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,179
Team One, go home.

317
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,765
-Rest up for the night shift.
-Give me my ID.

318
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:49,808
Team One, leave.

319
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:52,227
You took my ID earlier.

320
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,312
Wrap up.

321
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,771
-Go on home.
-Okay.

322
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,995
I guess you already heard about me.

323
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,165
Clean up all our sites and lie low.

324
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,835
If you get greedy and screw me over,
you're dead meat.

325
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,175
That psycho.

326
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,306
Hey, you know our account number, right?

327
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,477
Send the money before I visit your school.

328
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,407
Thank you.

329
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,453
Han Jeong-o.

330
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,997
Are you discouraged?

331
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:56,875
We'll catch them.

332
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,421
Don't get discouraged either,
Sargeant Kang.

333
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,643
STATEMENT

334
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:29,908
Careful.

335
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:33,328
Damn it. This sucks.

336
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,882
What cop uses 2468 for a passcode?

337
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:48,426
Seriously.

338
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:52,389
The world's a scary place.
but you're so complacent.

339
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,225
Change your passcode.

340
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,359
Hey.

341
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:08,029
I'm tired too.
I helped you walk all the way here.

342
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,448
I'm going to rest before I go.

343
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:23,545
It's rotten! It was rotten. Damn.

344
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,431
Where's the rag?

345
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:37,642
Damn it.

346
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,979
Where's your wife?

347
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,900
Where's your family?

348
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:46,693
My wife

349
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:51,323
went to my divorced son's place
to take care of his kid.

350
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,575
What about your daughter?

351
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:57,162
She studies abroad.

352
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,663
Where's the rag?

353
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,210
Darn it.

354
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:05,670
There it is.

355
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,410
Why is this place so filthy?

356
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,579
The water in the sink is rotting.

357
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,587
Will I get an award?

358
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,550
Like Han Jeong-o,

359
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,846
will I get a 50,000-won gift certificate?

360
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,104
I finally got a badge of honor.

361
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:51,651
When cops have a scar or two
on their body,

362
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,237
they look cooler.

363
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,742
I hope this wound takes long to heal.

364
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:04,164
I'd be upset if it heals fast.

365
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:23,183
I'm his mom.

366
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,731
It's not too serious.

367
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:32,650
I apologize.

368
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:37,489
Why was Sang-su the only one to get hurt?

369
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,617
Why are you okay?

370
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,414
I apologize.

371
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,253
It's so dangerous to be a cop.

372
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,461
Your surgery went well.

373
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,756
They beat me up first.

374
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,383
Look at my face.

375
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,594
Look at my body.

376
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:45,432
They kept coming to my workplace
and would beat me up for not hanging out.

377
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,726
So I carried a knife with me
because I was scared.

378
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,312
The cop chased me and...

379
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,148
Ultimately, you knocked out his teeth.

380
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,692
You can't use a knife out of fear.

381
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:57,736
What else could I do?

382
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,866
If I get caught,
she'll try to take money from the boys.

383
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,954
I put up with their beatings
almost every day.

384
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:09,956
But that day...

385
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,959
They threatened they'd hurt my sister.

386
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,882
What'll happen to her now?

387
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,260
If I'm not home because I'm in prison,

388
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:23,970
if I don't bring home money,

389
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,307
my sister will start getting into trouble.

390
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,041
Aren't you coming home?

391
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:36,626
<i>I can't come tonight.</i>

392
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,571
I must say, how is it possible

393
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,990
that we have so many cases
at a patrol divison?

394
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,659
By the way, how's Sang-su doing?

395
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,912
He's not dead.

396
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,707
Give Sang-su's mother a call.
I texted you her number.

397
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:58,875
All right.

398
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:17,977
Hello?

399
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,648
This is Sang-su's mother, right?

400
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,025
Yes. How have you been...

401
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,653
You must be concerned.

402
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,871
Hye-ri.

403
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,831
Wake up already.

404
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:40,583
Hye-ri

405
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,836
Hye-ri. Last call!

406
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,129
Yes? Last call?

407
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,009
You're so full of it.

408
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,636
Why did you sleep here?

409
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:55,056
I fell asleep after I tidied up your place
because I was tired.

410
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,184
Clean your house once in a while.

411
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,686
Go wash up.

412
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,188
Take that plastic bag in front of you.

413
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:06,025
I bought a disposable toothbrush
and a pair of socks for you.

414
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:19,956
Don't act up and be careful at all times.

415
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:23,710
What if you got hurt
instead of Sang-su yesterday?

416
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,878
A pretty chick like you...

417
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,755
"Chick" is derogatory for women.

418
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,090
Use "woman" instead.

419
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,843
A pretty woman like you

420
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:35,179
would've ended up with a scar
all the way across your face.

421
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,768
Sang-su is okay.
I heard the wound is all sealed now.

422
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,232
But I have to say, your wife is mean.

423
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,654
Looking after her son
and grandkid is great,

424
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,949
but how can she be so inattentive to you?

425
00:33:56,951 --> 00:34:00,496
You're great at seasoning vegetables.
Have you lived alone for a long time?

426
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,748
Stop talking and just eat.

427
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:08,671
In a matter of a few days,
you hurt your head, neck and eyes.

428
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,090
Why do you put yourself in such danger?

429
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,384
Isn't it common for cops
to get minor injuries on duty?

430
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,136
Why is it only you though?

431
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,764
-What was Lieutenant Oh doing?
-He was protecting the victim.

432
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:22,185
You acted up, didn't you?
To earn more points to beat me.

433
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,062
Yes, I did. You have a problem with that?

434
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,438
Where's Lieutenant Oh?

435
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,273
He's going to the station after the sauna.

436
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,485
My doctor said
I can be discharged this afternoon.

437
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,861
Will you be my girlfriend?

438
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,280
You're becoming like Lieutenant Oh.

439
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:35,948
Why do you keep changing the topics?

440
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:38,743
I don't like tall guys.

441
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:42,622
Why don't you try dating one?
If you date me, you'll have a lot of fun.

442
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:45,166
Hey, who dates guys just for fun?

443
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,628
Why would you date a guy if it isn't fun?
To end up with more stress?

444
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,966
No, thanks. I have to
become successful and earn money.

445
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:55,301
Get some sleep.

446
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,637
Really?

447
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,223
Then let's date later.

448
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:14,654
We suspect that these foreign women
have engaged in prostitution.

449
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,823
It won't be easy to remember their faces.

450
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,659
We'll send their photos to your phones,

451
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,077
so keep an eye out, okay?

452
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,207
He's the head of the prostitution ring.

453
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,543
Yesterday,
Sergeant Kang Nam-il and Jeong-o

454
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,629
found an address on the statement
he ripped up and did some digging.

455
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,673
There are four counts of assault
on his record,

456
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,341
but there's nothing else.

457
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:39,512
What's notable is that his current address
is near Hongil 3-dong.

458
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,598
He recently moved here from Jangdong,

459
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,184
where illegal prostitution activities
have been reported recently.

460
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:48,146
There's definitely something fishy
about him.

461
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:51,357
That jerk fell off the grid
after we let him go yesterday.

462
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,735
Detective Jang from the station

463
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,905
staked out his place all night,
but he never showed up.

464
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,867
Women & Juvenile Affairs Division
received information that

465
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,496
there are sites of illegal prostitution
disguised as corporate offices

466
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:08,040
in Hongil 3-dong and 4-dong
and have been on stakeouts,

467
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:11,377
but all of those properties got listed
for lease this afternoon.

468
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:14,922
-They're starting their clean up.
-But we still have a chance.

469
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:19,051
We met five women in unit 816
at Dongjin Officetel alone.

470
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,970
So far, we've found six sites.

471
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,806
That means we can suspect that

472
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,684
it's not five, but at least 30 women
who work for them.

473
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,061
It won't be easy to move
all of those women

474
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,272
to a different area at the same time.

475
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,149
To them, these women mean money,

476
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:34,901
and some of them are hurt.

477
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,236
I know that many foreign women live

478
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,906
in the multiplex housing area
in Hongil 3-dong and 4-dong.

479
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,283
My team will visit each house
in that area first.

480
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:43,743
Okay.

481
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:46,329
And don't forget to put up
the photo of this jerk

482
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,789
on your patrol car's dashboard.

483
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:52,126
Don't do anything alone when you spot him.

484
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,170
Alert the team
and Women & Juvenile Affairs.

485
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,342
Where is everyone?

486
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:01,719
In the meeting room.

487
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,812
The foreign women...

488
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,272
I'm here.

489
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:16,234
My uniform is dirty though.
I'll go get changed first.

490
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,318
He does whatever he wants.

491
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:21,447
What did you just say?

492
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:25,993
You should apologize first
because you're late, but you didn't.

493
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:30,665
You always just say
whatever you need to say.

494
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,166
-Yang-chon.
-Sit down.

495
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:36,254
Assistant Chief Ki, please go on.

496
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,259
When you visit foreign women
at their homes,

497
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:44,679
exclude those who have children,
those who are over 40,

498
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,973
and those who have a family.

499
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:50,476
Focus on those who live alone
or live with one or two other women.

500
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,193
Listen up.

501
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:02,738
If you find women who seem
to be engaged in illegal prostitution,

502
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:05,491
you must report to the team
and Women & Juvenile Affairs immediately.

503
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,995
Next, the security manager
at Hacheong Club reported the case to us.

504
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,205
Put it on the screen.

505
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,507
Lieutenant Oh, you can take my seat.

506
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,509
-Just eat.
-Finish quickly and get back to work.

507
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,511
What does it matter where he sits.

508
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,773
You should eat more.

509
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,735
I guess I'm too tired.
I don't have any appetite.

510
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,741
We got a call from Hacheong Club
near Hongik University

511
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,909
about repeated theft.
They want us to catch the thief.

512
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,121
Send it to Criminal Affairs.

513
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:54,081
The call came directly to us.

514
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,750
Shall we ignore it and get a complaint?

515
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,045
Lieutenant Lee, Hye-ri,

516
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,088
Lieutenant Oh, and Sang-su

517
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:04,050
go to the club at midnight
for an undercover op.

518
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:08,554
What are you talking about?
Sang-su got slashed in the face and neck.

519
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,057
He's right. That's too harsh.

520
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:12,767
Jong-min, you should--

521
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,268
We have to go on patrol too.

522
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,190
Then ask Team Two and Three
for volunteers.

523
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:22,276
Why do we always ask for volunteers?
It's not like there's no one to fill in.

524
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:26,280
Those guys also pull all-nighters
and get injured all the time.

525
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,158
Do you think we don't care about Sang-su?

526
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:31,952
Nam-il, Jeong-o, Myeong-ho, and Han-pyo

527
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,455
have to work with W&J
on the prostitution case.

528
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:38,125
Won-u, Min-seok, Seung-jae, and I
pulled an all-nighter yesterday.

529
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,087
Today, we have to cover for everyone

530
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:44,006
and patrol and monitor
the entire district.

531
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,385
Do you want Assistant Chief Ki
to do the undercover op

532
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,638
instead of directing and overseeing
our entire division?

533
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,975
I'm not trying to slack off.
I'll go to the club too.

534
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,186
He's injured though!

535
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:59,397
Whose fault is it that he got injured?
You moron!

536
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,274
We're worried about Sang-su too.

537
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,943
That's why we've been texting him

538
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:06,654
and asking him if he's well enough
to be back out on the field.

539
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,155
Everyone has been asking him.

540
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,534
Hey, don't bother. The more we talk,
the pettier we'll look. Let's go.

541
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:16,664
When the first incident broke out,

542
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:20,042
and the victim's teeth got knocked out,
why did you make Sang-su

543
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,503
chase the suspect when his identity
was already confirmed?

544
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,549
<i>That's him!</i>

545
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,972
-Don't bother!
-Let's go and watch.

546
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,976
You should act
after you consider the case.

547
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,978
It's not a serious case like homicide.

548
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,897
It was a simple fight
where some kid lost a couple teeth.

549
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,150
The suspect's identity had also been
confirmed,

550
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,444
so we could've summoned him
on another day.

551
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,614
Weren't you able to make such judgement
as his mentor?

552
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,325
-Actually--
-It led to

553
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,953
a secondary incident

554
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:59,165
where two other poor, innocent kids
were injured.

555
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:02,001
It isn't our job
to ruin the people's lives.

556
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:05,129
Let's head out.

557
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,339
Sang-su, let's go.

558
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,885
-Sir, Lieutenant Oh didn't--
-Get out!

559
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,053
Let's go out.

560
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,430
Come on.

561
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:31,071
How many more of your partners
must get injured

562
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,365
before you get your act together?

563
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,367
While working with you,

564
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,661
I got stabbed in the stomach,
and Ho-cheol died.

565
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:42,541
I get that your mentor
isn't your responsibility,

566
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,294
but your mentee is!

567
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:47,421
The commendations, medals,

568
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,340
and being called a legend doesn't matter

569
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:51,091
when people get hurt and die
on your watch!

570
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,136
What...

571
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:57,264
What good does it all do?

572
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,725
Fucking idiot.

573
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,928
Why didn't you say anything?

574
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:39,056
You tried to stop me.

575
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,850
-I acted on my own--
-What good

576
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,103
would it do to say that?

577
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,693
I was trying to do the right thing,

578
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:53,946
but I made a mess instead.

579
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,493
I caused the injuries of two poor kids.

580
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,246
The delivery boy was speeding
in the alley.

581
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:05,124
Also, it's not protocol to go easy
on a suspect due to his situation.

582
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:07,543
Don't get emotional.

583
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:09,545
I...

584
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,673
I owe you one.

585
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:17,136
-I'll repay--
-Aren't you leaving?

586
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:45,372
<i>Yang-chon!</i>

587
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,417
Yang-chon, get out of there.
Back up is on their way.

588
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,336
Damn it. It's dangerous in there!

589
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:52,254
Yang-chon!

590
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,682
Han-sol!

591
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,435
<i>Stay awake!</i>

592
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,396
<i>Answer me, Han-sol!</i>

593
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,778
Yang-chon?

594
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,322
Yang-chon!

595
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,783
You idiot. Yang-chon!

596
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,628
Mr. Oh... Lieutenant.

597
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,589
The bleeding won't stop.

598
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:38,217
What's wrong with me?

599
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:48,227
<i>How many more of your partners
must get injured</i>

600
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,396
<i>before you get your act together?</i>

601
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,224
Damn. He looked a lot like the suspect.

602
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:34,231
Let's head to Hongil 3-dong
where the foreign residents live.

603
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:35,774
Should I drive?

604
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,527
Get some rest.
We have a long night ahead of us.

605
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,765
What does it mean to be a cop?

606
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:10,934
We have to work the day after
we get stabbed.

607
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:16,607
On a crappy day like this...

608
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:20,277
<i>This is the song to sing</i>

609
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,321
<i>Um, oh, ah, yeah</i>

610
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:25,324
<i>Myeong-ho, give me a smile</i>

611
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:28,243
<i>Give me a smile already, ah yeah</i>

612
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:32,456
<i>A car that was trying to stop
at a no-parking or standing area</i>

613
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:35,459
<i>knocked over a bicycle
already in the zone.</i>

614
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:38,253
<i>Neighbors have reported
a dispute between the driver</i>

615
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:39,880
<i>and the owner of the bike.</i>

616
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:43,467
<i>Patrol cars in the vicinity,
please respond.</i>

617
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,677
Patrol 18 responding.
This is our last call.

618
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:49,806
What's the protocol here?

619
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,643
If neither parties were injured,

620
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:53,936
it's a material damage matter.

621
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:55,521
We inform the driver

622
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:56,813
to call his insurance company.

623
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:01,652
It's almost time to go undercover.

624
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:05,322
When we arrive on scene,
don't bother mitigating the situation.

625
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:07,866
Follow protocol and wrap it up.

626
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:09,826
Yes, sir.

627
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,971
My eyes are killing me.

628
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:33,809
When will we finish looking at the footage
from all 80 cameras in the neighborhood?

629
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:35,561
It's not just one day.

630
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,647
From the day of the incident to today...

631
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,315
That's over 100 hours of footage.

632
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:45,404
-Talk about energy getting drained.
-You should get some rest.

633
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:48,949
No, I'm good.

634
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,660
I was just whining because I'm frustrated.

635
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:10,554
<i>Today's undercover op at the club
involving the serial burglar</i>

636
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:12,347
<i>must not be taken lightly.</i>

637
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:17,394
<i>Recently, burglary has been
a gateway to more severe crimes.</i>

638
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:20,480
Not long ago, in Busan and Yeosu,

639
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:23,233
personal information
from stolen phones were leaked.

640
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:25,319
<i>Some led to voice phishing,</i>

641
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,487
<i>some to random assaults on women,</i>

642
00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:31,575
and some to human trafficking.

643
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:34,369
Could that be the case with this one?

644
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:36,538
Normally, only cash is taken from wallets,

645
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:39,625
but we have reason to believe

646
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,877
that those from the club
take money, wallets,

647
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:43,587
phones, and IDs.

648
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:46,089
The club's security manager and I suspect

649
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,342
<i>that it has</i>

650
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:49,968
<i>to be an inside job.</i>

651
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,219
Of course.

652
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:53,305
If the culprit wasn't caught on camera

653
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:55,641
this means he knows where all the cameras
are facing.

654
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:57,351
It has to be an inside job.

655
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:58,977
Sang-su, Hye-ri.

656
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:02,648
<i>You're not carrying your guns or tasers,
so be careful.</i>

657
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,108
Sang-su, Hye-ri,
did you leave your IDs behind?

658
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:12,449
Are you kidding me?
Why did you bring it with you?

659
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:14,242
-We'll do better.
-I'm sorry, sir.

660
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,914
Sang-su, Hye-ri, stay under the radar

661
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:21,083
<i>so your identities don't get revealed.</i>

662
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:29,758
<i>You're in plain clothes,
not in your uniforms.</i>

663
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:31,968
<i>You will not apprehend the suspect
when you see him.</i>

664
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:35,514
<i>In case of a physical altercation,</i>

665
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,557
<i>people might come at you</i>

666
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,935
<i>since they won't know you're a cop.</i>

667
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,312
<i>When you spot the suspect,</i>

668
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:44,773
<i>you will request backup via call or text.</i>

669
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:46,608
<i>I repeat.</i>

670
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:48,652
Do not take any action.

671
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,195
Don't arrest the suspect.

672
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:53,490
Lieutenant Lee and I will
since we're in uniform.

673
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,410
I repeat. When you spot the suspect,

674
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,495
you will request backup via call or text.

675
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,955
<i>Do not take any action.</i>

676
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,416
Nothing's more important than your safety.

677
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:04,209
Your safety matters most.

678
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:05,877
I repeat.

679
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:08,714
<i>Your safety outweighs
the apprehension of the suspect.</i>

680
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:11,758
Captain Eun is better than you.

681
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:16,012
We'll patrol around the neighborhood
like it's a normal day.

682
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:30,652
Sang-su, Hye-ri.

683
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:32,821
At the left side of the club,

684
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:38,118
a man with a big build has
his back to the camera in a blind area.

685
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:41,037
<i>There seems to be another man
wearing a hoodie.</i>

686
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:41,955
<i>Check it out.</i>

687
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:01,183
The black hoodie gave the thug
a wallet and phone.

688
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:19,785
We're on the move.

689
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:21,620
Don't act impulsively.

690
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:24,080
There's no criminal without
conclusive evidence.

691
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:25,165
Don't be rash.

692
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:45,560
Miss.

693
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:49,189
That's a locked storage room.

694
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:52,567
I was looking for the toilet.

695
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:54,110
Sorry.

696
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:01,159
Song Hye-ri, stop acting out and withdraw.

697
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,373
What's going on?

698
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:09,668
Hye-ri.

699
00:52:11,127 --> 00:52:12,087
Officer Song Hye-ri.

700
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,717
You should listen to our club's music.

701
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,564
Hye-ri's fine.
She just took out her earphone.

702
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:34,734
I was hoping to help her win a merit.

703
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,237
She got me for a partner

704
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,364
and had nothing much to do.

705
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:41,157
She was excited about the undercover op.

706
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:43,827
Damn it.

707
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:48,206
Thanks to you, your partner is safe.

708
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,709
How can you say that?

709
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:53,253
I'm saying that because
everyone's so focused on safety.

710
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:55,964
Forget it, you disloyal scum.

711
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:00,969
If I'm disloyal,

712
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:02,888
who's loyal?

713
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:08,143
I didn't call you over to
Violent Crimes out of loyalty.

714
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,937
Han-sol got stabbed while working there,

715
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:12,939
and you wanted to replace him.

716
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:16,735
How could I accept you
to take on such a position?

717
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,904
Would you have let me?

718
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:38,924
Awards, medals, a legend.

719
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:41,134
Do you agree with Han-sol?

720
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:44,387
Do you think that's the reason
I continued being a cop all these years?

721
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:46,222
Do you?

722
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:54,773
You know what?

723
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,442
I don't need that shit.

724
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,786
<i>Excuse me, wait, I...</i>

725
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:11,957
Sang-su, what's wrong?

726
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,209
-Calm down.
-You touched her.

727
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,419
I didn't touch her. I bumped into her.

728
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:20,340
Captain Eun.

729
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:22,342
What's happening to Sang-su?

730
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:25,345
He's squabbling with a drunk man.
It's not serious.

731
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:26,638
<i>Yeom Sang-su.</i>

732
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:29,099
End the fight
and find the guy in the hoodie.

733
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:38,066
Sang-su, the hoodie left the bathroom.

734
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:40,318
<i>Will you please stop?</i>

735
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:43,113
Why did you grope my girlfriend?

736
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:44,572
Why did you touch her?

737
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:47,325
I passed her in a narrow hall
and bumped into her.

738
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:49,035
If you bumped into her,

739
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:52,163
why would she drop to the floor?

740
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:53,540
-Hey.
<i>-How would I...</i>

741
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:54,874
Shouldn't we stop the fight?

742
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:58,044
I see you're drunk. I'm in a hurry.

743
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:04,384
I'm outside looking for the hoodie.

744
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:09,347
I see you on the cameras,
but I can't find him.

745
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,150
<i>Why is he hitting him?</i>

746
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:24,946
This is just insane.

747
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,157
-Please stop.
<i>-Captain Eun.</i>

748
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,409
<i>Sang-su's getting beat up.
Shouldn't we get involved?</i>

749
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:33,913
Don't keep quiet. Say something.

750
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:34,998
Stay put.

751
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,542
This is crazy.

752
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,711
Please just stop.

753
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,757
Where did the guy in the hoodie go?

754
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:46,509
-Captain Eun, let's end it.
-<i>Stop hitting me!</i>

755
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:48,803
Tell him to cut it short.

756
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:53,516
<i>He could get hurt.</i>

757
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,185
<i>Are you trying to get him more injured?</i>

758
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:59,564
No, no, don't end it. I'm okay.

759
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:01,816
Yeom Sang-su,
get a grip and locate the hoodie.

760
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,735
<i>Yeom Sang-su, find the hoodie.</i>

761
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:05,320
He won't be far.

762
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,614
<i>He'll go in and out of the club
to do his job.</i>

763
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:09,491
<i>Find him. Find him and...</i>

764
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,826
Get him into view of the cameras.

765
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:13,453
<i>Stay alert.</i>

766
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:22,462
I found him.

767
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:28,218
<i>Sang-su got the hoodie into our view.</i>

768
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:37,852
<i>Stay alert, Sang-su.</i>

769
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:39,604
He started. Did you get it?

770
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,651
Damn it, you heartless jerks.

771
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:48,822
We got it.

772
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:50,698
We got him on camera picking pockets.

773
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:52,742
Yang-chon, to the main entrance.

774
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:54,702
<i>He's in white sneakers and a black hoodie.</i>

775
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:09,801
<i>Sam-bo. Sam-bo, it's Hye-ri.</i>

776
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:12,887
<i>She followed the thug to the men's room.</i>

777
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:16,641
There's no need to arrest anyone, Sam-bo.

778
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:18,518
<i>Just go in and get Hye-ri out.</i>

779
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:26,734
Stop, stop.

780
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:35,952
Sang-su,
follow regulations for drunk people!

781
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,419
You can't fight, yet you won't give up.

782
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:46,337
Shall we call it even

783
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,506
or sue each other?

784
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:14,782
Kid. Let's get cuffed.

785
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:30,590
Middle cubicle of men's room,
evidence of special larceny.

786
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,012
Freeze!

787
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:42,852
Give me your phone.

788
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,648
Give me your...

789
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:53,780
That was awesome!

790
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:57,450
Well done.

791
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:01,287
Come on.

792
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:26,854
I was just dumbfounded.

793
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,649
You two look different,

794
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:30,900
but you act just the same.

795
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:32,777
Me and Lieutenant Oh?

796
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:35,822
You too, but more him and Gyeong-mo.

797
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:38,366
-Don't curse me!
-Don't curse me!

798
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:40,952
Sang-su was getting beaten up,

799
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:43,454
but you went,
"Sang-su, follow the hoodie."

800
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,873
I can't believe you guys.

801
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:48,585
Your injured mentee and team member
was getting beat up,

802
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:51,462
but all you cared about
was catching the bad guy.

803
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:54,549
You heartless animals.

804
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:59,095
I believed Captain Eun when he said
that their safety was most important.

805
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:00,805
Why would you believe

806
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:03,725
someone who lied claiming that
safety was the most important thing?

807
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:06,561
I saw it going down
through the security camera,

808
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:10,064
and I made a judgement call
knowing the Sang-su

809
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,482
could handle it.

810
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,234
Aren't you glad I did?

811
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,569
Yes, sir.

812
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:26,247
When it got urgent, you called me
like you did when we were partners.

813
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:29,208
I must've lost my mind.
Why would I ever do that?

814
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:34,797
That shithead.

815
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:37,550
You're both nutjobs.

816
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:43,222
Don't get cocky, okay?

817
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:46,934
For the first time, I didn't think about
my performance or getting cut.

818
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,061
I just focused on the case.

819
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:50,229
Look at that cocky expression
on your face.

820
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:53,900
I wanted to close the case

821
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:56,194
and prevent further innocent victims.

822
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:59,280
I was hit with a sense of duty as a cop.

823
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:02,700
Come on. Let's go on patrol.

824
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:22,053
Sergeant Kang.

825
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:23,596
Check this woman out.

826
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:32,230
Her.

827
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:39,946
She's not the victim
from the apartment building.

828
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:46,953
Hold on.

829
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,705
Wait a second.

830
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:04,721
She's from unit 816
where all the ladies were.

831
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:07,223
The other woman

832
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:10,059
is from unit 816 too.

833
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:16,774
There was another camera
close to that alley.

834
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:21,320
DONGJIN APARTMENT PROSTITUTION CASE

835
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:37,128
118-1 Mahak-gil, Hongil 2-dong.

836
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:45,052
Captain An, it's Kang Nam-il
of Hongil Patrol Division.

837
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:47,889
We didn't find an address for the victim,

838
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:50,808
but we did find where the women
from unit 816 are staying.

839
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:55,271
I just texted you the address.

840
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:57,732
<i>We're moving out. Come back us up.</i>

841
01:02:57,815 --> 01:02:58,983
Jeong-o, I did good today.

842
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:00,067
Yes, ma'am!

843
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:02,945
I'll do this. Just get the car.

844
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:08,159
Tidy this up, all right?

845
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,459
<i>Choi Myeong-ho and Kim Han-pyo.</i>

846
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:18,920
Heading to 118-1 Mahak-gil.

847
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:20,505
Heading to 118-1 Mahak-gil.

848
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:29,722
<i>Patrol 24, Patrol 24.
Heading to 118-1 Mahak-gil.</i>

849
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:31,849
<i>Patrol 23, do you copy?</i>

850
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:33,684
Patrol 23, we copy.

851
01:03:33,768 --> 01:03:36,354
Patrol 23
will soon arrive at 118-1 Mahak-gil.

852
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:38,731
We'll soon arrive at 118-1 Makan-gil.

853
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:42,235
-Stay alert.
-Yes, sir.

854
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:04,131
I'll take better care of my partner.

855
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:10,346
My partner comes before the suspect.

856
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:12,849
I won't forget that.

857
01:04:17,311 --> 01:04:19,188
That's right, you idiot.

858
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:22,400
I know you're not hellbent
on catching criminals

859
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:24,652
just to receive awards and medals.

860
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:28,281
Our job as police officers
isn't to chase bad guys,

861
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:31,826
but to protect the citizens.
You obviously know that.

862
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:39,625
During our early days as cops,
we had to watch

863
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:42,420
Jeong-an die
because we let a suspect get away.

864
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:47,967
She was only 15 years old.

865
01:04:49,093 --> 01:04:50,386
She was so young.

866
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,390
That's probably when it started.

867
01:04:56,934 --> 01:04:59,395
That's why you turn into a mad dog
chasing after criminals.

868
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:01,814
But Yang-chon...

869
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:06,193
You can only help victims

870
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:07,945
and back your partner up

871
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:11,699
when you're in one piece.

872
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:16,579
It kills me to see the scars
that cover your body.

873
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:18,581
Imagine how hard it was for Jang-mi.

874
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:23,294
Every day, you pounce on each case
like there's no tomorrow.

875
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:26,505
Don't you think it hurt her
to see you like that?

876
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:33,846
Just like you are with victims,

877
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,599
let your wife, your family,

878
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:39,685
and your colleagues in.

879
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:46,525
You and Sang-su can call it a day today.

880
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:05,544
Wipe off the blood from your cut too,
you idiot.

881
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:17,139
Goodness.

882
01:08:24,892 --> 01:08:27,812
<i>We caught the culprit
and helped women who needed our help.</i>

883
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:33,359
<i>You haven't changed at all</i>

884
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:35,111
even though it's been a while.

885
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:38,280
Let go!

886
01:08:40,991 --> 01:08:43,661
-Do you want to play hooky?
-<i>As of today you'll know for sure</i>

887
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:45,996
that I'm Officer Choi's biggest rival.

888
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:49,250
<i>I wished you and Jang-mi
nothing but happiness.</i>

889
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:51,544
Your feelings for me.

890
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:53,754
Was it for real?

891
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:57,007
