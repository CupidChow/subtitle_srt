<i>We won't be shoved
even if the protesters push hard.</i>

3
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:04,022
<i>"We won't be shoved
even if the protesters push hard."</i>

4
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,441
<i>We won't help our comrades
even if they get hit.</i>

5
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,402
"We won't help our comrades
even if they get hit."

6
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,280
Today, we won't take action.

7
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:16,242
-"Today, we won't take action."
-"Today, we won't take action."

8
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,750
Say no to police brutality!

9
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,252
-"Say no to police brutality"!
-Onward. March!

10
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,921
-"Onward. March!"
-"Onward. March!"

11
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,215
-One, two. One, two.
-One, two. One, two.

12
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:32,258
-One, two. One, two.
-One, two. One, two.

13
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,136
<i>-One, two. One, two.
-One, two. One, two.</i>

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,722
<i>-One, two. One, two.
-One, two. One, two.</i>

15
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,390
<i>Keep going!</i>

16
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,227
<i>-One, two. One, two.
-One, two. One, two.</i>

17
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,190
<i>Sang-jun, it's summer in Australia, right?</i>

18
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,943
<i>I hope you're not working
in a wheat field every day.</i>

19
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,447
<i>You should go to the beach,
check out the ladies and go on a date.</i>

20
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:55,949
<i>Please do that.</i>

21
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,451
<i>Don't be a nerd and work all the time.</i>

22
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,705
<i>It's very cold here.</i>

23
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,834
<i>I went to suppress a protest today.</i>

24
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,169
<i>What is that, you ask?</i>

25
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,423
<i>It's when the police get beaten up.</i>

26
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,343
<i>Why did we get beaten up
without putting up a fight?</i>

27
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,305
<i>I don't know why.
We were just told to do so.</i>

28
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,642
<i>But my seniors say</i>

29
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,019
<i>that the police getting beaten up
is the right thing.</i>

30
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,773
<i>They say if the police do something
there might be a bigger problem.</i>

31
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:31,860
<i>So anyway,</i>

32
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,736
<i>we didn't</i>

33
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,072
<i>take any action today.</i>

34
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,033
<i>Even when we got kicked</i>

35
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,369
<i>and trampled.</i>

36
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,167
<i>Even when my feet were frozen,</i>

37
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,003
<i>my teeth chattered,</i>

38
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,463
<i>and my legs stiffened like a tree...</i>

39
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,424
<i>Even when I felt drowsy</i>

40
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,677
<i>and when I felt like my brain
was freezing from the cold wind...</i>

41
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,729
<i>Even when my comrade,
who looks just like you, collapsed</i>

42
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:08,855
<i>and got trampled.</i>

43
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,024
<i>Even if it broke my heart,</i>

44
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:14,611
<i>I just did as I was told.</i>

45
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,989
<i>I didn't...</i>

46
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,409
<i>I didn't take any action.</i>

47
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:46,726
EPISODE 2

48
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,523
-Good luck today.
-Yes, sir.

49
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,401
-See you tomorrow.
-Thank you for your hard work.

50
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,694
-Goodbye.
-See you tomorrow.

51
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,988
-Goodbye.
-All right. I'll see you tomorrow.

52
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,365
Goodbye.

53
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:01,866
See you.

54
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,118
-See you.
-Won-u.

55
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:07,080
-Yes?
-Cover that lady up, will you?

56
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,415
Yes, sir.

57
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:38,569
-Send him to internal affairs.
-I can't believe this.

58
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,114
Let's just cover it up.

59
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,410
Why must the police always be honest?

60
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,745
Why can't we protect our own?

61
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,581
This jerk has a grudge against Dong-kyu.

62
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,751
Dong-kyu revoked his driver's license
when he was a congressman.

63
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,004
So he came to the patrol division drunk
and beat Dong-kyu

64
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,588
every day for the past year.

65
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,799
He even beat the other officers
and made a mess.

66
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,676
That night, this jerk

67
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,387
sent his driver home and came here.

68
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,140
He singled Dong-kyu out and demanded that

69
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,850
he carry him home.

70
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,810
Just watch the video.

71
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,896
He strangled and hit Dong-kyu.

72
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,857
His actions were warranted.

73
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,694
When he made a scene, I told you
to arrest him for obstruction of justice.

74
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:22,071
If we did that,
would he have gotten punished?

75
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:22,989
He has connections.

76
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,949
That's why we should let
his connections help him

77
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,993
while we help our colleague.

78
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,455
An Jang-mi, what's your opinion?

79
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,874
I vote for covering it up.

80
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,918
I don't want him to get inspected

81
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,087
because of that asshole.

82
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,965
His dream is to work at a station
in his hometown

83
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,217
while living a quiet life
with his mother and kid.

84
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,637
If I fail to grant him such a small wish,

85
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,389
I can't call myself his senior.

86
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,350
-It's settled then.
-But

87
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:55,229
I have menopausal symptoms these days.
I'm afraid I'm being too emotional.

88
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,733
If I let Dong-kyu slide,
I will be going against the rules.

89
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,861
If I report this, I would feel bad.

90
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:03,738
It's a tough decision.

91
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:08,534
So I want my junior, Choi Myeong-ho,
who's always wise

92
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,536
to answer the question.

93
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,163
What should we do?

94
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,498
Don't be ridiculous.

95
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,709
Since when did we start listening to
our juniors' words so carefully?

96
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:19,378
What?
Since I'm a performance-oriented cop,

97
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:22,215
you want to listen to
this humane cop's words instead?

98
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,175
Hey, why would you bring that up?

99
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,511
I'll be the leader of the team
once you leave.

100
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,054
And Dong-kyu is a member of my team.

101
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,515
How could I have a member of my team
inspected as soon as I...

102
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,435
You work under me. Remember that.

103
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,731
So is that what this is about?
Your performance?

104
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,567
Damn it! What a jerk.

105
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,865
Please give me some time
to think about it.

106
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,669
I still think he should be sent to
Internal Affairs.

107
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,046
You think you're
the only upright officer here.

108
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,965
You should play dirty sometimes.

109
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:07,218
I play dirty quite often.
You just don't know it.

110
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,763
I want to divorce Oh Yang-chon.

111
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,766
Hey, stop telling me about
your family matters!

112
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,726
Just go home.

113
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,603
I hate it when you do that.

114
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,634
Aren't you going on patrol?

115
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,639
Myeong-ho, we have to go on patrol now.

116
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,099
-We'll leave in a bit.
-Okay.

117
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,477
Dong-kyu, have a good trip.

118
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,103
All right.

119
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,443
Are you taking your mother
and your kid too?

120
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,861
Of course.

121
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,531
I'm going to check out the station
I'll be transferring to

122
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,910
and look for a house in the area.
We'll eat some good food as well.

123
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,038
I volunteered to help out Team Two

124
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,790
and worked like a dog for 48 hours
just to get two days off,

125
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,752
but just thinking about the trip
makes me so happy.

126
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,340
See you later.

127
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,311
SEND

128
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,033
MY COLLEAGUE MYEONG-HO

129
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,009
Leave your car at home.
Take the bus for your trip.

130
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,261
You look tired.

131
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:16,514
And when you come back,
go to Internal Affairs on your own,

132
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,683
or I'll report you.

133
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,653
AUTOPSY REPORT

134
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:39,829
Is this another theory?

135
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,123
This only has photos.

136
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:45,960
It's not like we found the same DNA
from nine years ago in this vehicle.

137
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,129
How can we use this as evidence?

138
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,215
Look at the next page.

139
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,761
It was taken two weeks ago.
He's the one who rented the car.

140
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,598
The DNA found on his cigarette butts match

141
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,766
the DNA from the hair
which was found 9 years ago.

142
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,560
What do you say?

143
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,145
Will you do it?

144
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,314
What the hell?

145
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,067
Chief still thinks that you and I

146
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,903
are working on
the Incheon nightclub assault case.

147
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,197
He has no idea that we've been

148
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,159
neglecting the case and have been
following Ho-cheol for days instead.

149
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,119
I want to ask you.

150
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,204
What will you do about the Incheon case?

151
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,748
So?

152
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,083
Are you saying you won't help him?

153
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,793
Let's say we took care of this case.

154
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,920
What will we get from it?

155
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,089
Ho-cheol's honor?

156
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,592
We'll just end up dishonoring the police.

157
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,761
"Why didn't you investigate the car then?

158
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,804
Why didn't you do anything
when the victim's mom

159
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,931
committed suicide two years ago?

160
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,143
What on earth are you guys
trying to do now?"

161
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,355
Is there water in the car?

162
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,858
Just go home. Don't do anything stupid.

163
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,486
You haven't gone home
since that day, right?

164
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,905
Go home!

165
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,915
Hey, Yang-chon! Stop! Yang-chon!

166
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,250
What the fuck are you doing?

167
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,836
Do you want to get me fired or what?

168
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,546
Give my car back!

169
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:23,557
Listen, you jerk.

170
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,894
Ho-cheol will retire soon
after working in the force for 40 years.

171
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,397
He said that it's his wish to solve

172
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,066
the one case
he couldn't solve before he retires.

173
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,359
Knowing all of that,

174
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,861
I can't tell him not to do anything
and just retire

175
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,696
so that he can live off his pension.

176
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,240
And what? Even if we solve it,

177
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,325
we won't benefit from it?

178
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,119
Catching criminals
is what the police does.

179
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,704
Our job isn't collecting kickbacks,
you asshole.

180
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:46,956
Gosh, you piece of...

181
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:48,707
If you don't back us up,

182
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:52,044
Ho-cheol and I will catch him
and send him off to the local police.

183
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,381
And I'll tell the media
that you and the chief

184
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,591
-chose not to help us!
-Damn you!

185
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,219
Do you think having seniority
is everything?

186
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,933
In other words,

187
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:09,019
the chief will have to give up
the commissioner position he wants,

188
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:13,107
and you'll never become the head
of the Criminal Investigation Division.

189
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,025
Just know that you're screwed now.

190
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,864
Just come and help us
if you don't want that.

191
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:24,160
Arrive by ten o'clock.
I'll message you the location.

192
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,749
Ho-cheol, where are you?

193
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,544
What do you think?
I'm keeping an eye on that bastard.

194
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,004
Are they going to come?

195
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,797
<i>-No, they aren't.</i>
-What?

196
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,217
Gosh,
it'll be hard if it's just the two of us.

197
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,553
It's not like we can shoot him.

198
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,014
-<i>We'll shoot him if we have to.</i>
-What the...

199
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,057
<i>Why should we be scared of
shooting a criminal?</i>

200
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,059
Does this country allow the police
to use guns?

201
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,479
All the officers that have
used firearms ended up...

202
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:52,730
CHIEF KIM HAN-SEOK

203
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,440
Chief Kim is calling.

204
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,442
Ju-yeong must've told him.

205
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,777
Are you scared of
getting yelled at by Chief Kim?

206
00:12:58,861 --> 00:12:59,987
<i>Hey.</i>

207
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,948
Why would I be scared of him
when I'm retiring soon?

208
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,451
The possibility of never catching
the suspect I lost scares me.

209
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,455
My, you are a true police officer.
You really are.

210
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,207
Shut it. Just get here quickly.

211
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,143
Hello?

212
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,854
Yes.

213
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,943
Okay, I'll be there shortly.

214
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,593
Cook your own food.

215
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,514
Seriously...

216
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,565
What was the call about?

217
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,733
Do you have to go somewhere?

218
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,820
Your grandparents are
in critical condition.

219
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:30,244
We've heard that many times,
but nothing has actually happened.

220
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,083
I have to go to work.

221
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,421
Call me if anything happens.

222
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,346
Cook me some <i>ramyeon</i>.

223
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,556
Cook it yourself.

224
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,058
I'm going through puberty.

225
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,352
I'm going through menopause.

226
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,739
Clean the house, both of you.

227
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,533
I'm so annoyed.

228
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,412
<i>Hi, my dear wife.</i>

229
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,664
Mom and Dad are critically ill.

230
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,292
<i>What?</i>

231
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:20,878
<i>Whose mom and dad?</i>

232
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:21,962
Mine.

233
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,175
I see, your parents.
What are you going to do?

234
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,594
<i>Not sure. What should I do?</i>

235
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,346
Well, I don't know these things.

236
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,097
And I do?

237
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,808
<i>Come on. You know everything.</i>

238
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,646
<i>Well, I have to arrest a suspect soon.</i>

239
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,606
<i>Honey, just go and see
how they're doing first.</i>

240
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,943
Can you call me if something happens?
Right now, I'm...

241
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,279
Asshole.

242
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,675
It's that bastard's.

243
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,353
Why is the bite mark so clean-cut?

244
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,440
On this photo, it looks like
half of a frontal tooth is missing.

245
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:24,775
The teeth look different.

246
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,528
What if we have the wrong guy?

247
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,910
Here, have a look.

248
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,871
GAN DENTAL CLINIC

249
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,380
Dental veneers!

250
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:48,924
I did some digging

251
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,094
and found out that he got
all of his teeth done five years ago.

252
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,222
The chance that he may be connected
to other cases...

253
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,182
Is 200 percent.

254
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,232
You idiot. Why are you so excited?

255
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,068
Oh, right.

256
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,709
This time,

257
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,712
I thought they were really
going to pass away this.

258
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,547
The doctor and I both did.

259
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:32,801
How's Mother?

260
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,763
She'll be lucky if she actually dies.

261
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,101
The bill, please.

262
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,448
Father.

263
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:01,914
I'm going to divorce your son.

264
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,304
I wanted to divorce him a long time ago

265
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,098
but I didn't, for you.

266
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,016
Don't talk me out of it,

267
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,060
not that I'd waver.

268
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,775
I'll be saying goodbye
to my own parents soon,

269
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,320
so why should I stay married to Yang Chon?

270
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,530
I want to end things.

271
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,957
Are you buying?

272
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,310
I'll drive you home.

273
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,855
Father. Father?

274
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,274
I can't sleep without my daily walk.

275
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,442
It'll take you two hours!

276
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,486
I do it all the time.

277
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,240
I'll have your son's belongings
sent to you soon.

278
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:19,700
Okay?

279
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,223
<i>Hello. I'm...</i>

280
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,311
<i>I see the three of you came together.</i>

281
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,272
<i>Don't just stand over there</i>

282
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,858
-<i>and please take your seats.</i>
-Damn it.

283
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,278
<i>All right then.</i>

284
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,281
<i>We'll start with you. Give us</i>

285
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,366
-<i>a few words of determination.</i>
-Damn it.

286
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,912
Okay.

287
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,163
<i>Hello.</i>

288
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:09,208
<i>This is a crucial moment
of your child's life</i>

289
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,669
<i>for it can move forward or step back.</i>

290
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:13,962
Lower the volume.

291
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,089
<i>I want to ensure that the child</i>

292
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,507
<i>has a bright future.</i>

293
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,927
-Lower the volume.
-<i>I'll be the best babysitter.</i>

294
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,511
-<i>Thank you.</i>
-I see.

295
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:26,225
<i>More than anything,
communication with the child</i>

296
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,434
<i>is most important.</i>

297
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,658
Hey, Kim Hak-sun.

298
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,952
You're under arrest

299
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:30,289
for sexual assault of a minor,
murder, and illegal disposal of a body.

300
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,124
You have the right to an attorney.

301
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,584
You can appeal
to the terms of your arrest.

302
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,296
You can justify yourself
if you want, you bastard.

303
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,588
Get up.

304
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,923
REVIEW OF ARREST AND CONFINEMENT

305
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,468
You bastard.

306
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,095
Son of a bitch.

307
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,388
Let him go.

308
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,519
Let him go, you bastard.

309
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,066
You dirty son of a bitch, let him go.

310
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,451
You bastard!

311
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,164
I hope you rot in jail.

312
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,457
That hurt.

313
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,169
Did you crawl all the way here?
What took you so long?

314
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,421
Crawl? I practically flew.

315
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,965
Can't you see my wings?

316
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:25,927
Get up!

317
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,345
I'm going.

318
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:31,141
Another officer is downstairs,
so don't try anything stupid.

319
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,856
You'll get a promotion for this.

320
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:40,525
Escort him to the station safely.

321
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,569
-We'll follow you shortly.
-Yes, sir.

322
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,577
You seem awfully ecstatic.

323
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,965
I called the victim's father.

324
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:06,927
He's pissed at me.

325
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,472
He said catching the culprit

326
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,390
won't bring back his dead wife
and child back.

327
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:17,187
He's right about that. Did it upset you?

328
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,107
Why would I be upset?

329
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:23,276
I'm fine now that I've cleared my debt.

330
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,656
I was able to help the kid rest in peace.

331
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,408
It's all that matters.

332
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,370
I'm proud to call you my mentor.

333
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,046
I'm exhausted.

334
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,340
It was freezing out there.

335
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:47,759
Who knew it'd be exhausting to do nothing?

336
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,971
Not doing anything and just standing there

337
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,473
has made my whole body go stiff.

338
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,060
I'm worried I'll get a bladder infection.

339
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,355
Stop whining because I already have it.

340
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,358
It's been a while
since I've been able to pee.

341
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,116
Relax and take your time eating.

342
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,340
It's warm.

343
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:29,509
Why the generosity?

344
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:34,222
What's this for?
Are we going back out there?

345
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:37,517
They fed the officers
at the union strike too.

346
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,061
It's like feeding pigs before slaughter.

347
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,064
I guess that's what it is.

348
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,780
Relax and listen up.

349
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,575
There will be no roll call tonight.

350
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:58,371
Tomorrow, you will wake up at 3:00 a.m.

351
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,875
No wonder. Damn it.

352
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,293
You'll wear your uniforms.

353
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,963
Maybe we won't get beaten
since we're not wearing our riot gear.

354
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:07,881
You're right.

355
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,383
They wouldn't make us
get beaten in our uniforms.

356
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,302
Don't you agree?

357
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,055
Do you think we have to hit someone?

358
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:19,768
All week, they told us not to take action.

359
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:22,687
What if they make us throw punches?

360
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,189
While enjoying your snack,

361
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,107
sing the National Police Anthem.

362
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:30,695
-<i>The rose of Sharon blooms beautifully</i>
-<i>The rose of Sharon blooms beautifully</i>

363
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,449
-<i>Up and down the country</i>
-<i>Up and down the country</i>

364
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,215
You fool.

365
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,926
A cop can't drink on duty.

366
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,303
I'm off the clock now.

367
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,346
You said you'd drive.

368
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:40,140
-Let me drink.
-No.

369
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,017
Shut up and drink this.

370
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,645
-Go on.
-You're no fun.

371
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,401
It's black coffee.

372
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,195
Wear your seat belt.

373
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:59,534
-<i>The rose of Sharon blooms beautifully</i>
-<i>The rose of Sharon blooms beautifully</i>

374
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:03,455

381
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:32,275

382
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,401
Wait.

383
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,278
What's that?

384
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,697
Stop the car.

385
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,328
Yeong-sun!

386
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,418
-Yeong-sun!
-What's he doing?

387
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,423
-Yeong-sun!
-This sucks.

388
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,719
-What should we do?
-In this freezing weather? Is he crazy?

389
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,514
Stay and call it in.

390
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,349
Hey, hey.

391
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,558
Let's just call it in.

392
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,186
Are you saying we should let him die?

393
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,356
Hey, Yang-chon.

394
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,525
Yeong-sun!

395
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,110
Mister!

396
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,569
Yeong-sun!

397
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:19,406
-Mister!
-My love!

398
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,539
Come here!

399
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:29,499
What a moron.

400
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:33,920
Darn it. I'm too old for this.

401
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,672
Mister, come back!

402
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,433
Is this the police? I'm by
a coastal road near Sangrim Highway.

403
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,601
Someone jumped into the sea.
Get here quickly.

404
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,565
Hey, hey, Yang-chon! That fool.

405
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:56,484
Yang-chon! Don't go in any further!

406
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:59,612
Yang-chon! That idiot.

407
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,239
Yang-chon! You idiot!

408
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,374
Yang-chon!

409
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,043
Get out of there!

410
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,714
Yang-chon!

411
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,300
It's dangerous if you go any further!

412
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,681
Get out of there!

413
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,110
Yang-chon.

414
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,868
Yang-chon!

415
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:26,825
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight. One, two, three, four.

416
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:35,917
I see someone there!

417
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,044
Get him out!

418
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,800
One, two, three, four...

419
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,442
One, two, three, four...

420
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,224
One, two, three, four...

421
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,564
Come on.

422
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,609
Ho-cheol, come on.

423
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,583
Ho-cheol.

424
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,127
Ho-cheol!

425
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:15,928
Ho-cheol.

426
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,432
Ho-cheol.

427
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,175
Platoon One and Two, prepare immediately.

428
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:58,054
-Platoon Three, standby after dinner.
-<i>This is Platoon One. Roger that.</i>

429
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,890
<i>This is Platoon Two. Roger that.</i>

430
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,185
Be mindful of safety
so no unexpected events occur.

431
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,795
Did you eat?

432
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:41,764
<i>Secure the right side of the intersection.</i>

433
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:45,184
<i>Violent incident happening in the area.</i>

434
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,311
<i>Monitor the section.</i>

435
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,606
<i>Be alert.</i>

436
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,775
<i>Be well-prepared.</i>

437
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,446
Stop eating.

438
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,244
-One, two. One, two.
-One, two. One, two.

439
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,164
-One, two. One, two.

00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,666
-One, two. One, two.
-One, two. One, two.

441
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,126
-One, two. One, two.
-On the spot!

442
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:12,378
-One, two. One, two.
-One, two. One, two.

443
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:17,008
-One, two. One, two.

-<i>I won't change</i>

446
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,265
Why are cops needed at a college?

447
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:27,685
No idea. Apparently, students
have taken over the president's office.

448
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:31,063
But still, why do the police
need to get involved?

449
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,024
Just shut your mouth.

450
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,943
Female officers first. Forward!

451
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,029
-One, two. One, two.
-One, two. One, two.

452
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:42,116
-One, two. One, two.
-<i>I love you, just like this</i>

453
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,913
-One, two. One, two.
-<i>I've been longing to end my wandering</i>

454
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:49,707
-<i>I want to tell you, even though</i>

-How long will this last?
<i>-Toward you</i>

460
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:06,891
-They won't make us force them out
-<i>Don't wait for a miracle</i>

461
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:11,354

00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,946
-I think this is wrong.
-<i>I can't give up</i>

465
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,447
We'll beat them if we have to.

466
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,075
We'll be sent to patrol divisions soon.

467
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,826
Obey unless you want to quit.

468
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,329
This is your fourth warning.

469
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:32,708
You've illegally taken over
the president's office.

470
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,002
Such illegal takeover and protest

471
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,921
cannot be protected by the law.

472
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,297
We're not doing anything illegal.

473
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,841
-This isn't illegal!
-We're not violating the law!

474
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,760
All students, leave the site immediately!

475
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:45,596
-We're not going anywhere!
-<i>I've been longing to end my wandering</i>

476
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,723
-Move forward!
<i>-I leave behind</i>

477
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,809
-Get the students out of here!
<i>-This world's</i>

-Didn't you guys hear that?
-<i>Unending sadness</i>

479
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,397
Get the students out of here immediately.

480

Formation march!

481
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:59,610

Don't move!

484
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,449
We must hold out!

485
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,617
Don't move!

486
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,119
Don't let them drag you!

487
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,955
-No!
-Don't move! Don't get dragged out!

488
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,331
Hold out!

489
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,126
-Hey...
-You must hold out!

490
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:16,377
-Hey!
-No!

491
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,129
-Don't!
-Don't do this to us!

492
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,964
-Stop!
-Don't!

WE WANT THE CHANCELLOR GONE
RESIGN AS CHANCELLOR

494
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,141
We must stay in place!

495
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,393
We must hold out!

496
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:37,815
Fight!

497
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,358
-No!
-Please don't do this to us.

498
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,360
WE WANT THE CHANCELLOR GONE

499
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,447
We must hold out!

500
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,290
-No!
-Don't!

501
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,629
Don't do this to us!

502
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,798
-Go away!
-Get lost!

503
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,218
Please don't do this to us.

504
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,810
Go away!

505
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,937
I won't move!

Don't!

00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,533
GUARANTEE STUDENTS' SAFETY

508
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,119
WE WANT THE CHANCELLOR GONE

509
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,269
-No!
-Stop!

510
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:02,108
-Stop!
-Let go!

511
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,075
Let go! Let go of me!

512
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,244
-Don't do this. You'll get hurt.
-Let go!

513
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:15,371
-Let go of me!
-I said, let go.

514
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,444
Thank you for coming.

515
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:49,488
This is Ho-cheol's wife and his sons.

516
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,324
Your father was the best police officer
in the entire country.

517
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:10,176
Take it easy.
The chief mourner shouldn't get drunk.

518
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,262
Fuck you.

519
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,273
Dad.

520
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,693
Mom wants you to come greet a guest.

521
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,061
Please go have some food.

522
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,398
-This way, please.
-Okay.

523
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,330
By the way, who is he?

524
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:23,457
He looks familiar.

525
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,627
Dad's cousin.

526
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,128
I see.

527
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,256
The one who lives in Suncheon?

528
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,716
No, he lives in Seoul.

529
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,304
He lives in Guro, right?

530
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,434
No, he lives in Jamsil.

531
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,272
Jamsil.

532
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,316
Father has many cousins, you know.

533
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:51,694
Are there four?

534
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,073
He's the only one.

535
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:01,704
I've been

536
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,331
too inattentive,

537
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,250
haven't I?

538
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,836
-Just go.
-Where?

539
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,546
Your mentor's funeral.

540
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,220
Jang-mi.

541
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,181
Ho-cheol died because of me.

542
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:23,475
He was trying to save my life.

543
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:28,355
I should've died.
Why did Ho-cheol die like that?

544
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,152
I keep thinking that
maybe I shouldn't have done anything.

545
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,449
Yang-chon.

546
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:40,117
Spare me a second.

547
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,404
<i>Today at 4 a.m., a police officer drowned</i>

548
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,198
<i>on a beach in the west coast</i>

549
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:21,575
<i>while trying to save a fellow officer
who was drunk.</i>

550
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,787
<i>Due to this, the media is criticizing
the police for lack of discipline.</i>

551
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,998
<i>Chief Kim Han-seok
of Jangdong Police Station</i>

552
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,833
<i>held a press conference at 10 a.m.</i>

553
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,460
<i>to formally apologize to the citizens.</i>

554
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:34,880
<i>We'll come up with a plan to make sure
incidents like this don't happen again,</i>

555
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,758
<i>and we'll take strict disciplinary action
against</i>

556
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,510
<i>the officer who drank while on duty.</i>

557
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,178
<i>Those in the police force</i>

558
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:44,139
<i>are concerned that this incident
may negatively affect the issue</i>

559
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,016
<i>of their independent investigation rights.</i>

560
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:55,526
SOON-TO-BE-RETIRED POLICE OFFICER
DIES TRYING TO SAVE A DRUNK FELLOW OFFICER

561
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,278
What the fuck...

562
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,738
What is this bullshit?

563
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:03,033
There are no articles about us
catching the suspect in the cold case.

564
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,910
The commissioner and the chief

565
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:08,080
must've cut a deal
and manipulated the press.

566
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:10,165
The chief has done it many times,
you know.

567
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:13,836
Did you drink that night?

568
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:17,965
The chief is here.

569
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,694
Who drank and jumped into the ocean?

570
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:42,239
Who drank and jumped into the ocean?

571
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:43,657
You're drunk.

572
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:47,244
Let go of me!

573
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,581
<i>-You...
-Who said that, you asshole?</i>

574
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,749
<i>-Get off me.
-Who said that?</i>

575
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,376
<i>Tell me!</i>

576
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:57,504
Do you have a death wish?

577
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,465
Get off me. Let go!

578
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,633
-Stop it.
-What on earth are you doing?

579
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,260
A drunk cop

580
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,888
jumps into the sea and kills fellow cop?

581
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:07,514
Why would I do that to Ho-cheol?

582
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,601
Why aren't they reporting on
how we saved a man?

583
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,520
We saved a man who was drowning!

584
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,564
What about

585
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:18,192
how we solved a cold case
and caught the culprit?

586
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:19,985
Let go!

587
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:27,284
What did you do? What the fuck did you do?

588
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:28,660
Tell me what you did.

589
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:30,537
Tell me!

590
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:31,914
Come back here.

591
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:33,332
-Yang-chon...
-Stop right there!

592
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:34,708
-Yang-chon...
-Get back here!

593
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:36,960
Let go of me.

594
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:39,213
Yang-chon...

595
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:41,757
Yang-chon, let's go.

596
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:45,969
I can't open a savings account.

597
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,222
I'm taking out a loan

598
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,308
to pay back my father.

599
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,435
<i>How much is your monthly salary?</i>

600
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:54,686
1.4 million won.

601
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:57,689
You only get 1.4 million won as
a probationary patrol officer?

602
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,401
-<i>What about overtime?</i>
-It's not much.

603
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,278
<i>What the fuck!</i>

604
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,781
<i>You studied your ass off
for about three years</i>

605
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:07,824
<i>and that's all you get paid?</i>

606
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,327
<i>You still have a year before...</i>

607
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,705
<i>When will you earn a living, get married,</i>

608
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,707
<i>and pay back your father?</i>

609
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,251
Jeong-o,

610
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,003
even I earn more than
1.5 million won a month.

611
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:22,548
I get insurance and a pension later on.

612
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:25,050
<i>What did I tell you, huh?</i>

613
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:28,428
<i>I told you to study harder
and become a commissioned officer.</i>

614
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,752
-What's up with the popsicle?
-Why are you talking casually to me?

615
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:04,006
-We're the same age.
-Do you know me?

616
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:06,800
Everyone in our class knows you.

617
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:09,761
You're the tallest one in our class.

618
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,391
You have three penalty points left.

619
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,394
There's a bet going on

620
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:19,855
regarding your fate.

621
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,066
I'm Yeom Sang-su.

622
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:25,110
I'm Han Jeong-o.

623
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:31,408
It's not against the rules tonight to talk
to the girls or to give them things.

624
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,661
That's why the guys are going up to girls,

625
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,122
handing out gifts, and asking for numbers.

626
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:38,790
Look down there.

627
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:40,917
-Congratulations on graduating.
-Where are you headed?

628
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:50,969
I heard you applied to
Hongil Patrol Division.

629
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:54,139
That's why I gave you a popsicle.
I applied there too.

630
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,434
It's known as Korea's criminal central.

631
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:59,269
Chances for promotions are high there.

632
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,104
That's why

633
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:05,275
-I'm training like crazy.
-And going on riot control.

634
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,570
It's our first time off in eight months.

635
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:14,826
Are you hurt?

636
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:21,875
I don't want to talk about today's events.

637
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:25,962
You're right.

638
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:27,547
It feels wrong.

639
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,678
Why do we have to drag the students out?

640
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,180
It's unfair.

641
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:39,518
If we say that it's not right,

642
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:41,478
will something change?

643
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,565
It's not like

644
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:47,984
I'd give up becoming a cop
after all this hard work.

645
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,038
The students probably got hurt as well.

646
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,380
I'm going to become a police in two days!

647
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:11,675
Congratulations.

648
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:13,093
Congrats.

649
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,768
Hello.

650
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,313
The chicken
is from the school dean and president.

651
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,607
There are coke and juice,

652
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:30,569
so enjoy them like they are beer!

653
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,624
-Guys, we're police officers now.
-Yes!

654
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,128
I have a job too!

655
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,172
I'm not a loser anymore!

656
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:35,675
I'm a police officer now!
A police officer!

657
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:39,262
Sang-su, receive my salute. Attention!

658
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:40,889
-As you were.
-As you were!

659
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:08,834
-Han Jeong-o!
-Han Jeong-o!

660
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,255
Hye-ri, you're up.

661
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,843
Song Hye-ri, Song Hye-ri!

662
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:37,112
-Hello.
-Good day.

663
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,114
-Good morning.
-Morning.

664
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,699
Hello, everyone.

665
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:44,202
Are they the rookies?

666
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:47,080
-Do well today.
-Good day.

667
00:52:58,967 --> 00:52:59,968
-Hello.
-Hi.

668
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:01,845
Rookies...

669
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:08,310
This is the men's locker room,
and this is the women's.

670
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:09,895
Change into your uniforms

671
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:13,023
and gather outside
the men's locker room in ten minutes.

672
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:14,274
-Yes, sir.
-Yes.

673
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:20,113
-Come in.
-Yes, sir.

674
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:26,661
-So?
-I'm probationary officer Yeom Sang-su.

675
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:28,955
Do you really have to ask?

676
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:31,917
I'm telling you I went
all the way to the restaurant.

677
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,585
Does he count the number of pieces?

678
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:37,047
-This is yours. See your name?
-I went with him.

679
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:39,758
He lined up the drumsticks,
thighs and wings...

680
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:41,843
-Do I sound condescending?
-He ordered it...

681
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:44,220
-We're the same age, but I have seniority.
-Yes, sir.

682
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,056
-Change and standby.
-Did he count the pieces?

683
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:48,058
Of course he did.

684
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:49,142
It was a perfect set.

685
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,811
Each set had 18 pieces.

686
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,563
The gizzard was cut into four pieces.

687
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:58,902
That means the owner didn't commit fraud.

688
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:02,447
-That's crazy.
-It's nothing to laugh about though.

689
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:04,199
Because of it,

690
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:06,952
we were late to the scene
of the 29th street domestic violence case.

691
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:08,787
Someone could've actually died.

692
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:12,040
Where were you yesterday?

693
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:16,211
Patrol.

694
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:18,004
Bullshit. "Patrol"?

695
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,215
You ditched the call on purpose, right?

696
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:23,301
Will you stop it?
You're getting fired up again.

697
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,095
He didn't respond on purpose, right?

698
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:27,097
He just went on patrol in the back alley.

699
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,015
-I don't know.
-I'm not sure.

700
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,850
Of course you don't.

701
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:32,268
You don't know anything.

702
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:37,107
Who is this, and why is he so tall?

703
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,401
You. What's your name?

704
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:41,069
I'm Yeom Sang-su.

705
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:42,654
Who's your mentor?

706
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:43,822
I don't know yet.

707
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:46,950
He hasn't gotten assigned yet.
He'll be under Captain Eun for now.

708
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,245
How tall are you?

709
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:53,581
I'm about 188cm.

710
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,417
Say the exact number.

711
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,668
I'm 190cm.

712
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:00,964
Don't let your height bother you,

713
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,048
or you'll answer to me.

714
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:05,427
Police officers shouldn't let
anything bother them.

715
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:09,055
Keep that in mind.
Don't let anything bother you.

716
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:10,473
Yes, sir.

717
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,185
CHOI MYEONG-HO

718
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:17,731
Traitor.

719
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:22,152
Do you have a problem?

720
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:23,820
You bet I do.

721
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,613
That's enough. I'm warning you.

722
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:27,699
You ratted out your own colleague.

723
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,410
Let's fight it out.

724
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:31,995
Pick a date.

725
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,124
Damn it.

726
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:37,208
Hey.

727
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,961
Get changed. Get dressed.

728
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:43,173
The juniors are watching.

729
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:45,800
You're their senior.
Don't let them see you fight.

730
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:49,095
There's nothing to see here.

731
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:51,222
-Get dressed.
-Yes, sir.

732
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:56,478
There are seven female officers here.

733
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:58,980
You won't see the other four
in Group Three and Four.

734
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:00,648
I'll be re-assigned in 2 days.

735
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,359
Night shift Song Hye-ri, clean the room.

736
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:06,071
-Han Jeong-o, you're on supplies.
-Okay.

737
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:07,989
Locker one has cleaning supplies
for the room,

738
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:09,491
locker two for the corridor.

739
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:10,992
Keep everything in order

740
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:13,244
-and that's Han Jeong-o's responsibility.
-Okay.

741
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:15,080
We don't get special treatment.

742
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:17,290
The toilet's unisex and there's no shower.

743
00:56:17,373 --> 00:56:19,375
If you need to wash, go to the sauna

744
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:20,543
or wash up in the bathroom.

745
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,087
See you outside.

746
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:24,214
-See you in a bit.
-See you in a bit.

747
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:27,926
-What did she say?
-I don't know.

748
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:32,180
One blank, three live.

749
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:41,940
Blank at one o'clock, three live.

750
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:44,818
<i>You're back, welcome back</i>

751
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,278
<i>Dear Ms. Sook-ja</i>

752
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:50,156
You're back as if you made an appointment.

753
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:54,285
Why did you bring so much with you today?

754
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:55,787
Who's in charge of the rookies?

755
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:57,956
Senior Choi, sir.

756
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:00,542
Your vests are yellow, mine is black.

757
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:01,960
What's the difference?

758
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:04,504
He bought his, ours were supplied.

759
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:06,798
Buy your own off the Internet.

760
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:09,134
Your pants are straight-leg,
mine are tailored.

761
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:11,261
Pay to get your pants altered.

762
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:13,012
My belt is leather.

763
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:15,098
To look good, buy your own.

764
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:19,769
Rookies, release your batons.

765
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:28,695
Put them back.

766
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:39,747
Mine was imported, yours were supplied.

767
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:42,417
If you're jealous, buy your own.

768
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:50,800
We collect 100,000 won a month
for food regardless of rank.

769
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:53,219
Yeom Sang-su,
you will collect it the day after payday.

770
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:55,930
So 70,000 won is for food,
30,000 is for the team.

771
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,140
Got it.

772
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:00,226
-What does the team spend it on?
-How would he know?

773
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:03,188
Coffee, drinks, team dinners
and other things.

774
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:05,523
The government pays for nothing.

775
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:08,818
We have one unwritten rule.
You can upset the head of patrol,

776
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:10,653
but do not upset the cook.

777
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:14,908
Soy sauce, red pepper paste,
chili powder, salt, various sauces.

778
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:17,785
Small plates, big plates, pots and pans.

779
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,996
Remember where they're all kept.

780
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:22,790
-If you don't clean up...
-Your superiors must.

781
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:24,292
Don't make us do that.

782
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:25,710
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

783
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,382
Memorize all the supplies,

784
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:34,052
sort them out in the backyard
and go on patrol.

785
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:36,012
Yes, sir.

786
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,269
Did you understand everything they said?

787
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:44,729
Am I the only who didn't?

788
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,523
You're the only one who didn't.

789
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:49,901
You should've taught me sooner then.

790
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:01,746
This house was robbed recently.

791
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:03,998
And in that alley

792
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:06,376
someone reported students smoking.

793
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:07,418
Okay.

794
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:09,420
-Hello.
-You're hard at work.

795
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:10,880
Don't catch a cold.

796
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,258
-Take care.
-Thanks.

797
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,679
To the right is a dangerous area.

798
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:20,139
We get three calls a day.

799
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:23,142
Up to 20 or 30 on Fridays and weekends.

800
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:26,354
Violence, robbery, stabbings,

801
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:29,107
fraud, rape, sexual assault,

802
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,317
and more.

803
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:36,990
Look over there. Damn it.

804
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:39,200
She's completely drunk.

805
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:41,995
Hold on. Damn. Stop the car.

806
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:46,791
Are you crazy?
Probationary Patrol Officers aren't cops.

807
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:50,253
You can get fired if you're useless, okay?

808
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:53,214
Get out.

809
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,390
Stand with your hands behind your back.

810
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:06,185
Ma'am.

811
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,229
Are you all right?

812
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:21,618
Sir.

813
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:23,286
Wake up.

814
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:25,079
Wake up.

815
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:28,499
Get out, sir.

816
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:45,308
Leave me alone.

817
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:46,392
What's wrong?

818
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:49,896
-What's your problem?
-Come at me.

819
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:51,981
Sit down, you two.

820
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:53,191
Sit down!

821
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:56,903
If you keep fighting, we'll lock you up
for obstruction of justice.

822
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:58,279
-What a mess.
-Like this?

823
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:01,032
Yes, sort all that out first.

824
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,575
-I'm a police officer.
-Be careful.

825
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,452
-Be aware of fires.
-I have to move you.

826
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:06,162
Yeom Sang-su, where are you?

827
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:07,830
I'm trying to get his ID.

828
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:09,957
What about the patrol car?
Shouldn't you clean it?

829
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:12,251
-I'll clean it right away.
-Move, move.

830
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,128
-Hey...
-Let me borrow this before I get fired.

831
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:17,173
Hey. I really need help.

832
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:19,676
Here, I can't help you, so listen.

833
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:23,513
Are you going to quit
before probation's over?

834
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:25,556
Use your hands.

835
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:41,614
That hurts.

836
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:45,243
What's going on? What happened?

837
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:49,831
Hey, are you sleeping?

838
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:54,585
Are you expecting special treatment
because you're a woman?

839
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:55,962
No, sir.

840
01:01:59,006 --> 01:02:00,466
Do you feel better, sir?

841
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,010
Oh dear, try to get up.

842
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:04,470
Be careful.

843
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:09,726
Unclog it. Okay?

844
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:26,719
NIGHTTIME CIVIL AFFAIRS SERVICE

845
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:40,358
You're really lucky.

846
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:41,651
When I was a rookie,

847
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:45,112
I had to deal with stabbings all the time.

848
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:50,576
All you have to deal with are drunks.

849
01:03:51,452 --> 01:03:53,496
You're really fortunate.

850
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:56,958
Hallelujah.

851
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:04,590
Instant noodles should be
regulated by law.

852
01:04:05,299 --> 01:04:07,426
All these instant noodles... Gosh.

853
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:11,472
Did I go through all that crap
to become a cop to do this?

854
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:15,685
I want to get involved in a real case.

855
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:18,104
Like a theft or a murder.

856
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:12,116
I'm off to school.

857
01:05:45,524 --> 01:05:47,485
Hey! Wake up!

858
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:53,366
Wake up.

859
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:54,408
What now?

860
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:57,161
Are you kidding me?

861
01:06:00,247 --> 01:06:01,499
Is this why you took time off?

862
01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:02,875
You brat.

863
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:08,130
<i>The number you have dialed
is not available. Please leave a...</i>

864
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:16,555
Ho-cheol's wife won't answer her phone.

865
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:21,686
She must believe that
I actually caused his death.

866
01:06:28,275 --> 01:06:29,402
Are you going to work today?

867
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:31,737
To the station?

868
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:34,657
Why the Women & Juvenile Affairs Division?

869
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:37,201
You transferred out two years ago.

870
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:39,412
Why not another division?

871
01:06:46,293 --> 01:06:48,254
Why won't you talk to me?

872
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:50,172
I'm your husband.

873
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:58,264
Why did Song-yi take time off school?

874
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:00,266
She should graduate and get married.

875
01:07:01,475 --> 01:07:02,476
What's her plan?

876
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:07,231
Huh?

877
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:09,483
Let's get a divorce.

878
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:20,995
Didn't you hear me? I want a divorce.

879
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:42,516
-Are you done?
-Thank you.

880
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,768
-Did you go on patrol?
-Yes.

881
01:07:44,518 --> 01:07:45,603
I'm starving.

882
01:07:59,533 --> 01:08:01,327
Oh Yang-chon is coming to our
Patrol Division.

883
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:04,246
We should brace ourselves.
It's the chief's direct order.

884
01:08:05,372 --> 01:08:06,707
I feel bad for you.

885
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:17,468
Gyeong-mo will try and rip his throat out.

886
01:08:18,886 --> 01:08:20,304
Yang-chon won't let it happen.

887
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:29,230
Are you guys still living in a study room?

888
01:08:29,313 --> 01:08:31,440
-Yes, we couldn't find a place.
-Yes, sir.

889
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:33,442
There are a few in my neighborhood.

890
01:08:35,402 --> 01:08:36,570
Hey, there.

891
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:37,655
ZIGBANG

892
01:08:41,408 --> 01:08:42,535
What about this place?

893
01:08:44,328 --> 01:08:45,538
It's quite spacious.

894
01:08:46,038 --> 01:08:47,456
-We could fit a couch.
-Right.

895
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:48,749
Check it out on your day off.

896
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:54,088
You've been with us for a week now.

897
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:57,049
-How do you feel?
-They'll probably feel like dying.

898
01:08:58,592 --> 01:09:02,263
Really? Will you be quitting then?

899
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:03,639
Go ahead.

900
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:04,807
No, sir.

901
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:07,434
What about you?

902
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:10,396
I want a real task.

903
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:13,482
I want to solve a big case.

904
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:14,692
Like a violent crime.

905
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:35,045
For a week,
I've been wiping puke off drunks,

906
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:38,174
helping old ladies with dementia get home,

907
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:41,093
and going out on traffic control.

908
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:53,898
We're just saying that
we want to do real police work.

909
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:57,818
We're the police,
but we practically do nothing

910
01:09:57,902 --> 01:09:59,695
while living off the people's tax money.

911
01:09:59,778 --> 01:10:01,363
As civil servants,

912
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:03,240
we feel guilty for...

913
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:06,035
<i>Code zero. 765 Imhyeon Intersection.</i>

914
01:10:06,118 --> 01:10:08,621
<i>A sexual assault has been reported.</i>

915
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:09,955
<i>Code zero.</i>

916
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:13,542
-<i>Code zero. 765 Imhyeon Intersection.</i>
-Are you kidding me?

917
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:16,795
<i>A sexual assault has been reported.</i>

918
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:19,173
Are you happy now?

919
01:10:19,673 --> 01:10:22,218
We were assigned a violent crime
thanks to your big mouth.

920
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:25,054
There's a jinx. The moment someone's says

921
01:10:25,137 --> 01:10:28,182
we're not doing real police work,
we'll get thrown a messy one.

922
01:10:28,265 --> 01:10:29,391
You and your big mouth!

923
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:32,561
<i>Code zero. 765 Imhyeon Intersection.</i>

924
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:35,689
<i>A sexual assault has been reported.</i>

925
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:39,902
The last rookie to hop on the squad car

926
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:41,570
is dead meat! Run!

927
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:31,453
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

928
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:33,914
<i>-We'll stay safe today.
-We'll stay safe today.</i>

929
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:35,499
A patrol division? Sounds good.

930
01:11:35,582 --> 01:11:36,667
I hear he's a total legend.

931
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:39,003
-Stop!
-What's his name?

932
01:11:40,921 --> 01:11:42,089
-Oh Yang-chon.
-Damn.

933
01:11:42,423 --> 01:11:44,842
<i>Stop making your hatred for him obvious.
You'll get fired.</i>

934
01:11:45,509 --> 01:11:48,012
You can't assault your juniors
in this day and age!

935
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:50,097
Yang-chon,
did you write your letter of resignation?

936
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:52,850
-<i>Han Jeong-o seems nice.</i>
-I'll work harder

937
01:11:54,101 --> 01:11:58,647
so that this never happens again.
I honestly don't know what I did wrong.

938
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:04,194
