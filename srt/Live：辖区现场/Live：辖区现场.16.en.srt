EPISODE 16

3
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,920
<i>-Let's go.
-You can't eat a lot today.</i>

4
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,050
-I don't eat a lot.
-That's not true.

5
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:06,960
-I'm serious.
-Don't be ridiculous.

6
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,050
-Hello.
-Hello.

7
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,640
We'll have two portion of <i>rabbokki.</i>

8
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,390
Please add 3 fried dumplings and 3 eggs.

9
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,390
And we'll have 3 fish cake skewers
and 3 servings of <i>gimbap.</i>

10
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:20,060
Hey, are you a pig? That's too much.

11
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,610
-You eat the most.
-You crazy punk.

12
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,150
I lost weight.

13
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,690
You have the biggest head among us.

14
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,360
Let's measure the size of our heads then.

15
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,070
Hey, give me your head.

16
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,530
You have to measure it fair and square.

17
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,120
-All right.
-Just measure it.

18
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,500
Hello.

19
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,410
I'm the mother of
the cute boy with a big head.

20
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,580
Then some kids came
from the opposite direction, and...

21
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,210
Please tell him
his mother paid for the food.

22
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,460
After they finish their food.

23
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,640
Hey, I can beat you.

24
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,690
What am I doing?

25
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,280
What's there to do for a suspended cop?

26
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,780
I'm taking care of my children
who have been on the back burner,

27
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,490
and I'm doing some chores.

28
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,540
-What?
-<i>The prosecutor</i>

29
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,210
is like Lee Ju-yeong's attorney.

30
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,500
He prosecutes Lee Ju-yeong
only for what he says.

31
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,670
He even rejected crucial evidence

32
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,670
like handwritten records.

33
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,300
<i>The court has no choice.</i>

34
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,010
<i>The prosecution closed
the case of prostitution.</i>

35
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,850
They only prosecuted him for gambling.

36
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:38,890
Damn it.

37
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,390
What's the point of arresting criminals?

38
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,390
Prosecutors and judges
will release them anyway.

39
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,320
Hello?

40
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,400
Captain An?

41
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,370
<i>The active police officer, who was charged</i>

42
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,870
<i>with gambling and prostitution,</i>

43
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,500
<i>was sentenced to a fine of
seven million won.</i>

44
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,120
<i>There's criticism that the prosecution
and police didn't mount</i>

45
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,830
<i>a proper investigation.</i>

46
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,710
<i>The Seoul Central District Court</i>

47
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,670
<i>sentenced Lieutenant Lee Ju-yeong
of Jangdong Police Station,</i>

48
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,010
<i>who was prosecuted for gambling,
a fine of 7 million won.</i>

49
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,510
<i>Lieutenant Lee was charged</i>

50
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,810
<i>with gambling and prostitution last March,</i>

51
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,640
<i>but the prosecution and police</i>

52
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,940
<i>only admitted the charge of gambling.</i>

53
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,600
<i>And the court accepted the prosecution</i>

54
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,520
<i>and pronounced a fine for gambling.</i>

55
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,610
<i>According to the Police Officers Act,</i>

56
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,320
<i>he can be dismissed only when he's
sentenced to suspension or more.</i>

57
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,660
-<i>Therefore Lieutenant Lee will...
-These crazy assholes.</i>

58
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,630
Don't you know I'm suspended?

59
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,420
You should talk about these things
with your new boss.

60
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,560
-How much is this?
-Hold on.

61
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,660
<i>The case of fleeing after assault</i>

62
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,290
<i>of the owner of Myeongil Auto Shop and
the clerk at Stop Convenience Store.</i>

63
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,420
<i>Patrol 18 responding. Last call.</i>

64
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,050
<i>Heading to a three-way intersection
near Mahyeon Gym.</i>

65
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,380
I repeat. Patrol 18 responding. Last call.

66
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,350
Heading to a three-way intersection
near Mahyeon Gym.

67
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,930
Patrol 21 will aid Patrol 18. Last call.

68
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,100
Heading to the intersection
near Mahyeon Gym.

69
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,440
Patrol 23 will aid Patrol 18. Last call.

70
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,230
Heading to the intersection
near Mahyeon Gym.

71
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,790
Hold on. It's that sedan.
It has the plates 8729.

72
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,410
It's him. Stop him!

73
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,170
Damn it!

74
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,440
-What happened?
-My goodness.

75
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,900
Is someone injured?

76
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,650
-I think someone's inside.
-Oh, my goodness.

77
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:35,940
Is he getting off?

78
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,490
-What's going on?
-Patrol cars nearby, please report.

79
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,860
There was an accident.

80
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,530
What is going on?

81
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,960
What was that? Is it a gun?

82
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,270
Sang-su, duck!

83
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,580
Sang-su, be careful.

84
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,390
Hye-ri, don't get out. Request backup.

85
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,180
We're at the intersection
near Mahyeon Gym.

86
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,100
An officer has been shot.
I repeat, an officer has been shot!

87
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,520
Requesting back up from patrol cars
in the vicinity.

88
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,860
Put down the gun.

89
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,190
<i>I repeat.</i>

90
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,990
<i>An officer has been shot
at the intersection near Mahyeon Gym.</i>

91
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,110
Put down the gun.

92
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,280
<i>Requesting back up from patrol cars
in the vicinity.</i>

93
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,700
<i>Is the suspect still...</i>

94
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,870
<i>An officer is shot at the intersection
near Mahyeon Gym.</i>

95
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,750
<i>Requesting back up from patrol cars.</i>

96
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,710
-Take cover behind the car.
-Okay.

97
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,390
Put down the gun.

98
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,280
Die!

99
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,540
Die, you assholes!

100
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:05,880
Put down the gun.

101
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,890
<i>Got it. We're on the way.</i>

102
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,430
Lieutenant Oh. Lieutenant Oh Yang-chon.

103
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,440
Lieutenant Oh.

104
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,780
Cover me.

105
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,620
Cover him.

106
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,540
-Cover him.
-Cover him.

107
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,430
The situations with the assaults

108
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,770
at Myeongil Auto Shop
and the convenience store

109
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,190
as well as the shooting of an officer
is now over.

110
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,360
The situation is over.

111
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,530
We've arrested the suspect
with an illegal homemade pistol.

112
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,490
The suspect was shot by an officer,
and he's injured now.

113
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,320
Also...

114
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,370
The officer,

115
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,200
who was shot
by the suspect's illegal pistol

116
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,960
at the scene,

117
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,920
is dead.

118
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,050
Send paramedics to the scene. I repeat.

119
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,090
An officer, who was shot by the suspect's
illegal pistol at the scene,

120
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,140
is dead.

121
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,970
Send paramedics to the scene.

122
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:34,940
FORENSICS

123
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,180
You must know that you'll be investigated
by Internal Affairs if your use

124
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,930
of firearms violated the rules
or code of conduct in any way.

125
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,060
It's likely nothing will happen,

126
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,650
but the fact that two officers shot him
might cause trouble.

127
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,480
The suspect shot at us
with a homemade pistol.

128
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,360
-If we didn't shoot him--
-Should we have let him shoot us?

129
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,780
You should try being shot at.

130
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,570
Stop spewing total nonsense.

131
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,030
I'm sorry.

132
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,120
-I'm just worried, that's all.
-I understand what you're saying,

133
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,580
but keep your mouth shut.

134
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:33,130
We know as much as you do because
we've been doing this for over 20 years.

135
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:37,300
Don't bring up the rules in a situation
like this even if you're worried.

136
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,880
We're not in our right minds
at the moment.

137
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,320
Okay, all right.

138
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,610
Good work.

139
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,610
Everyone must be in shock.

140
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,950
Try to console them, Gyeong-mo.

141
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,290
Okay.

142
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,040
Goodbye.

143
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,590
Honey.

144
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,510
Are you okay?

145
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,930
I'm sleepy.

146
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,640
You should go home.

147
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,190
All right, then. Get some sleep.

148
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,480
I'll see you later.

149
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,950
<i>Well...</i>

150
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,370
<i>Last week, I had a relapse.</i>

151
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,050
I came by to ask
if you could let me have the spot.

152
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,510
<i>I guess I can't.</i>

153
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,390
<i>Your situation is just as bad.</i>

154
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:51,310
Captain Eun, the suspect survived.

155
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,060
He's an alcoholic
who suffers from paranoia.

156
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,520
He said he wanted to teach those

157
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,690
-who belittled him a lesson--
-Enough.

158
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:01,820
I don't want to hear it.

159
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,070
All of our guys are already out
at the scene.

160
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,410
You should just go home early.

161
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,690
All mentors probably
won't be able to sleep tonight anyway.

162
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,270
Let's grab a drink at the pub
across the street.

163
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,770
Han-pyo, you should gather all mentees.

164
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,150
Don't spend your own money...

165
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,530
I'm not going.

166
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,280
I'm going to

167
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,570
assemble all mentees.

168
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,990
Han-pyo, take charge

169
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,580
and bring them all to the front
of the building.

170
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:01,290
Why?

171
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:04,050
Do I have no authority because
I'll be retiring soon?

172
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,630
Sir, we're really sorry,

173
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,300
but Won-u and I have
important plans this evening.

174
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,390
We don't want to disobey your order,

175
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,560
-but we apologize--
-Then you guys can go.

176
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:25,400
What about you?

177
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:27,900
Do you have plans too?

178
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,110
No, sir.

179
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,450
I'll go let Officer Han
and Officer Song know as well.

180
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,460
Sam-bo, don't be like that.
Let's just grab a drink--

181
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,590
Shut up.

182
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,710
-Sir.
-Be quiet!

183
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,720
You guys aren't the only ones
who can think.

184
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,760
Our fellow officer

185
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,810
got shot in the head by a homemade gun

186
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,600
in broad daylight and died

187
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,150
in a country where guns are illegal.

188
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,570
And he wasn't there alone.

189
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,150
He was surrounded by other officers,

190
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,610
but he still had to die like that.

191
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,660
Two years ago,
there was a shooting in Yanghyeon.

192
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,700
It was only after
a cop was shot and killed

193
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:23,330
that they decided to change
the heavy, hard to wear body armor

194
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,710
into newer, lighter ones.

195
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,340
But he couldn't even wear
that body armor today.

196
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,010
He was battling cancer.

197
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,590
He went to the scene
in the middle of his treatment.

198
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:39,390
He was supposed to transfer
to an easier position very soon.

199
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,230
Sir, please.

200
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:48,570
-Sam-bo.
-I know I'm not the only one who's sad.

201
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,440
You guys must be distraught too.

202
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,780
But you see, my heart aches so much.

203
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,580
I'm sorry, guys.

204
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,470
When I saw Captain Kang getting shot,

205
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,270
all I could think was my kids

206
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,350
and my wife.

207
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,860
Come out, guys.

208
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,780
Let's drink.

209
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,880
Hye-ri.

210
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,890
Hye-ri.

211
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,310
Let's leave her be, Sang-su.

212
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:18,950
Do you want a hug?

213
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,460
I was so scared.

214
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,470
I thought we were all going to die.

215
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,680
I know.

216
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,360
We were all scared.

217
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,790
BATTING CAGE

218
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,040
Darn!

219
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,540
Do it again.

220
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,920
I got the hang of this now.

221
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,380
-There.
-Nice!

222
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,510
Good one.

223
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,590
-Do it again.
-Here it comes.

224
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,390
They've been drinking and
singing at a karaoke room

225
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,680
and playing at an arcade.

226
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:27,390
They had the time of their lives.

227
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,810
I recorded it all.

228
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,110
-What are you doing?
-Do better!

229
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,190
I think we have enough.

230
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,570
Won-u,
send the video you recorded to Seung-jae.

231
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,320
He'll relay them all to Sergeant Kim.

232
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,530
Won-u,

233
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,870
you and I are going to
get a good look at them.

234
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,540
I sent the video I recorded.

235
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,750
You should leave.

236
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,670
-But Won-u...
-Leave it to us and go.

237
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,800
-This is the last one.
-You've got this.

238
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,060
-Home run!
-Yes!

239
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:11,440
-Did you see that?
-We sure did.

240
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,190
-Who the hell are you?
-You bat well

241
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,860
even with that shitty stance.

242
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,280
-Who are you bastards?
-We heard that you paralyzed

243
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,570
your right arm
and have a severe headache with vertigo.

244
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,450
You seem fine though.

245
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,950
It wasn't 1 or 2 minutes,
but for 30 minutes straight,

246
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,620
you were able to swing like a pro.

247
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:36,960
Your arm is fine.

248
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,630
You guys are cops, aren't you?

249
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,710
You bastards.

250
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,590
You.

251
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,300
Hand me your phone.

252
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:49,590
My friend, I think your huge payday

253
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,720
just went down the drain.

254
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,640
Give me your phone.
If you don't want to die,

255
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,350
you'll hand it over when I ask nicely.

256
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,770
Hand it over, you asshole.

257
00:22:58,730 --> 00:22:59,730
What are you looking at?

258
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:02,150
What can you do about it anyway?

259
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,480
Hand it over.

260
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:06,740
Give it to me.

261
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,860
Your dead meat.

262
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,870
Everybody look up!

263
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,040
What you just did has been
caught on camera, so what now?

264
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,420
Would you like to hit us again?

265
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,330
We won't hit you back.

266
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,670
You guys are all screwed now.

267
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,970
Yes, the police can't hit civilians.

268
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,890
But know this.

269
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,060
You...

270
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,600
Assaulting a police officer

271
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:41,650
-can also put you behind bars.
-Why you...

272
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,980
Officers in the area will swarm this place
once I press this.

273
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,990
Don't belittle us.

274
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,650
I can beat the crap out of you any day.

275
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,740
I'm only holding back

276
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,870
because I'm a police officer.

277
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:58,330
-Do you get that?
-Just so you know,

278
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,460
I'm reporting you for assault.

279
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,330
I'll see you at the station.

280
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,760
Shit! Why did you have mess with cops?

281
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,220
-This is all because of you.
-Damn it.

282
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,680
If I could,

283
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,980
I'd gladly throw a punch.

284
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,440
If I wasn't a police,
I would've beaten him to death.

285
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,400
As you all know,

286
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,990
I'm retiring this Friday.

287
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:34,870
Although

288
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,870
I'm the oldest here,

289
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,330
I haven't done anything for you.

290
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,540
I'll pay 100,000 won

291
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,080
for each of you at the firing range today,

292
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,000
so fire away.

293
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,550
Thank you.

294
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,590
Thank you.

295
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:53,090
-Thank you.
-It's up to you

296
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,760
to protect yourselves.

297
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,600
Gun related cases like today can happen

298
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,390
anytime in Korea now.

299
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,350
Illegal homemade firearms, air guns,

300
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,440
and even smuggled guns are a possibility.

301
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,690
Crimes are getting more vicious.

302
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,030
No matter how tired you are
from your workload,

303
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:11,860
no matter

304
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,910
how expensive it is to practice here,

305
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,820
you should

306
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,080
come to the firing range
and practice once a week.

307
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,910
-That's how--
-Incidents like today...

308
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,460
Can't be avoided

309
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,250
despite our good aim.

310
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,590
He got shot in the head.

311
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,420
Still, you and
Lieutenant Oh hit the suspect

312
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,760
in the arm and leg.

313
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,890
It prevented further casualties.

314
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,890
There's a reason why we say

315
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:44,440
we're in the line of fire.

316
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:46,900
But what can we do?

317
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:48,770
That's our job.

318
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,730
We have to go to the scene of crimes.

319
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,070
I'm not smart enough

320
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,820
to say something cool to you all.

321
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:01,790
Just make sure you always stay safe

322
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:04,750
and retire of old age like me.

323
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,250
Understand?

324
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,420
-Yes.
-Yes.

325
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,760
Some slots have opened up.

326
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,550
Go in and practice.

327
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:16,930
-Yes.
-Yes.

328
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,520
Why aren't you going in?

329
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,610
You were amazing today.

330
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,940
"I have a partner.

331
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,780
I'm not alone."

332
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,950
knowing that, I felt reassured.

333
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,570
Hye-ri, your arms move around too much.

334
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,120
-Do more push-ups.
-Yes, sir.

335
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,830
Sang-su, drop your shoulders.

336
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,250
Yes, sir.

337
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,960
Jeong-o, you have great form.

338
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,810
Arrest him for blackmailing and calumny.

339
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,610
Don't agree to a settlement

340
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:55,980
even if he begs.

341
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:57,780
With this as evidence,

342
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,740
his head injury will be ruled
as self-inflicted, so...

343
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,910
Thank you.

344
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,910
Thank you so much.

345
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:15,090
<i>Moving on.</i>

346
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:17,710
<i>In a Seoul downtown area,
a shocking turn of events occurred</i>

347
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,720
<i>when a police officer</i>

348
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,880
<i>was gunned down by a suspect
with a homemade firearm.</i>

349
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,800
<i>Around three o'clock this afternoon</i>

350
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,720
<i>at a three-way intersection
in Mahyeong-gu,</i>

351
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:29,560
<i>Captain Kang Tae-hun
of Myeongu Patrol Divison</i>

352
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,060
<i>responded to an assault case in the area.</i>

353
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:36,900
<i>The suspect in the case fired
his homemade pistol at him.</i>

354
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,820
<i>Captain Kang was shot in the head,</i>

355
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,860
<i>and he lost his life at the scene.</i>

356
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:46,490
<i>The late Captain Kang
fulfilled his duties as an officer</i>

357
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,540
<i>despite suffering from gastric cancer.</i>

358
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:52,040
<i>He was known to always
arrive first at a dangerous scene,</i>

359
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,750
<i>which is why this loss is devastating.</i>

360
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:58,750
<i>The police has announced
a special promotion for Captain Kang...</i>

361
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,050
<i>We shared the sad news
of losing Captain Kang Tae-hun,</i>

362
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:05,260
<i>but not all police officers
have a sense of duty like him.</i>

363
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,140
<i>Despite illegal gambling
and sex trafficking charges,</i>

364
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,930
<i>the police officer in question
has not been charged</i>

365
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,560
<i>with an adequate sentence.
Seoul Jangdong Police...</i>

366
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,940
Every news outlet

367
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,900
should be reporting
Captain Kang's fall in the line of duty.

368
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:20,940
Instead they're reporting
on that piece of shit.

369
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,780
He must have connections
in the prosecutor's office.

370
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,700
Even a 10-year prison sentence
isn't enough for what he did,

371
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,870
but how could he get off with a fine?

372
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,960
He loses his badge if he gets probation,

373
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,090
so they fined him instead.

374
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,800
That's just dirty.

375
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,880
I don't know about him but...

376
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:45,890
I bet he'll get a cushy position soon.
Son of a bitch.

377
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:51,850
Shut your mouths

378
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,310
and raise your glasses.

379
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,060
Safety first.

380
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,860
-Safety first.
-Safety first.

381
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:16,960
See you tomorrow.
Another drink and I might cause trouble.

382
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,380
-See you tomorrow.
-Take care.

383
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,390
He brought his car.

384
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,970
Don't worry. He called someone.

385
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:37,690
Let's finish our beers and go home.

386
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:38,980
Safety first.

387
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,310
-Safety first.
-Safety first.

388
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,090
Who were you calling?

389
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,220
Chauffeur service.

390
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:12,140
I saw the news.

391
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,430
You did well, my husband.

392
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,140
Honey.

393
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,270
I don't want to say anything.

394
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:24,820
Okay.

395
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,650
Get in. I'll take you home.

396
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,300
Aren't you getting in?

397
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,910
HAN-SOL

398
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:01,960
Hi, Boss.

399
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,670
You retire in two days.
I'm not your boss anymore.

400
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,920
Just call me Han-sol.

401
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,300
Should I do that?

402
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,180
Should I

403
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,390
call you Han-sol now?

404
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,600
Yes.

405
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:23,190
Sam-bo. You did great today,
catching the perpetrator.

406
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,850
Well done.

407
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:28,980
<i>You did even better by not getting hurt.</i>

408
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,240
<i>I commend you for that.</i>

409
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:33,530
Thank you

410
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,160
for not getting hurt.

411
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:38,160
<i>The kids got scared.</i>

412
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,620
Boss.

413
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,080
Will you

414
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,330
come to my retirement?

415
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,880
<i>Of course.</i>

416
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:54,130
I can't drink alcohol or be on duty,

417
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,970
but I'll definitely be there.

418
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,430
Thanks.

419
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,140
Don't thank me, Lieutenant Lee.

420
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:07,190
<i>I mean, Sam-bo.</i>

421
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,650
I'll see you then.

422
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,320
Goodbye.

423
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:57,200
A cop can't run away when someone shoots.
He must catch the shooter.

424
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:00,030
What if he dies?

425
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,580
He didn't die.

426
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,250
He didn't die or get hurt today,

427
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:07,080
but what about next time?

428
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:11,210
Cops are human beings too.
Bullets kill them.

429
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,250
That goes for Yang-chon and you too.

430
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,760
It's all over once you die.

431
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:23,390
The pension for dying on the job,
the honor,

432
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,730
the respect of others
means nothing once you're dead.

433
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:35,400
That's a huge kite.

434
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:36,900
Is it for me?

435
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:39,070
It's for the cop who died today.

436
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,410
I want to fly it for him.

437
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,360
What are you thinking about?

438
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:23,490
About when Captain Kang got shot.

439
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,460
I felt sorry for his partner
who was dazed and shocked.

440
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,840
What's the difference

441
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,710
between him and me right now?

442
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,300
What's the worst part?

443
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,980
The fact that someone died.

444
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,400
"I'm so glad I didn't die.

445
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:00,820
I'm glad it wasn't someone
from my division.

446
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,410
I'm so glad."

447
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,460
I keep having such selfish thoughts.

448
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,730
GOVERNMENT FUNDED
STUDY ABROAD PROGRAM

449
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:44,860
<i>During the day I heard about
the shooting in your district,</i>

450
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,490
<i>and tonight they did a report
on random killings on the news.</i>

451
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:49,830
All that is keeping me up.

452
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:54,750
<i>Jeong-o, is it okay to be a cop?</i>

453
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,880
Others do it, so why can't I?

454
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:01,130
<i>When can you apply to go abroad
on that thing you mentioned?</i>

455
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:03,170
I don't qualify yet.

456
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:12,390
There's a good opportunity.

457
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:14,690
I want to apply
for a government funded program.

458
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:21,400
That'll work as an advantage when I apply
for a promotion or to work abroad.

459
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:24,490
<i>I'm glad you're considering that.</i>

460
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,700
<i>Then you can quit
working at your division soon.</i>

461
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,910
<i>And you won't have to go back there.</i>

462
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:32,410
<i>I'm so scared about you working there.</i>

463
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,660
<i>My heart pounds so fast.</i>

464
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:38,080
<i>The panic disorder I'm finally
recovering from might come back.</i>

465
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:41,500
Okay. I get it, so hang up.

466
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,800
Jeong-o, come and sleep with me.

467
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:47,130
I keep waking up.

468
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:50,180
Mom, I have to go. Sleep well.

469
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,560
Go to bed. I'll join you soon.

470
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,140
I like you.

471
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,100
I like you too.

472
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,660
Jeong-o.

473
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:02,790
Are you really going to study abroad
on the government scholarship

474
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,710
and work somewhere overseas after that?

475
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,800
What about Sang-su?

476
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,930
It looks like he'll stay at the division.

477
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,640
Will you break up with him?

478
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,150
Just go to sleep.

479
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,510
Her tongue has been cut off.

480
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,000
The random attacks where civilians
are getting stabbed

481
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,090
and sprayed with flour have been
spreading from Jangnam to Jangdong.

482
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,880
Our precinct isn't safe.

483
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:37,680
Hence, I've decided to carry a gun
with me at all times from now on.

484
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,480
From Captain Kang's case,
I learned that taser guns can't shoot far

485
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,480
and the effects only last a few seconds,
so it's hard to detain suspects.

486
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,690
I heard Sergeant Kang was the only one
who hit the suspect with the taser.

487
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,690
Just carry a taser gun.

488
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,780
Sergeant Kang was supposed
to have a gun on him.

489
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,780
It hurts our back, but there's a reason
why we carry taser guns.

490
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,830
In this country,

491
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:04,040
guns aren't used to shoot perps.
Haven't you heard that we cops

492
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,920
are better off throwing them at perps?

493
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,590
The suspect yesterday wasn't moving,

494
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:13,510
so Lieutenant Oh and Lieutenant Lee
could shoot him in the arm and leg.

495
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,130
But most of the time, they move.

496
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:18,140
What if you end up killing the suspect?

497
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:21,060
I don't even want to think about it.

498
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,430
Plus, you'll be investigated
by Internal Affairs right away

499
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,810
and go to trial too.

500
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,600
That's right.
Last year, an officer shot a robber,

501
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:29,230
who ended up with a full-body paralysis,

502
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,610
and the officer got fired
for excessive use of force.

503
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,150
He got fired?

504
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:37,450
I'm sure he shot the guy
because he had no other choice.

505
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:39,320
Everyone,
from the government to the citizens,

506
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,080
wants us to catch criminals
with our bare hands.

507
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,580
A few years back in Cheongma,

508
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,960
an officer was killed by bastards
causing a scene with axes.

509
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:51,670
Because using a gun almost always
leads to disciplinary action,

510
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,920
he tried to stop them
without shooting them.

511
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,800
But as for Captain Kang's case,

512
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:59,760
the perp used a gun, and a cop died.

513
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:03,600
The media and the prosecution
can't criticize us for shooting him,

514
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,180
-but in most cases--
-Perps use knives.

515
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:09,310
Sometimes, they use axes or pickaxes.

516
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:12,480
How can we fight them with our bare hands?

517
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:15,650
Apparently, that's why
they give us a salary and a pension.

518
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,610
That's what some people say.

519
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,700
If we fail to catch suspects,

520
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:23,160
people will just say
that cops are incompetent,

521
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:25,040
but what will happen if we die?

522
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,000
What will our families do?

523
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:30,750
Jeez...

524
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:38,550
If I let a perp get away, he will
threaten another innocent civilian.

525
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,800
That's just wrong.

526
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,220
I like your sense of duty.

527
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:00,700
Why haven't you asked Jeong-o
about it yet?

528
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,580
Don't you want to know if she's really
going to leave you to study abroad?

529
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,710
I told you about it two days ago.

530
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:11,750
I was hoping she'd tell me first,
but she hasn't.

531
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:14,590
I should ask her now.

532
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:17,170
Jeong-o!

533
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,840
Let's have breakfast together.

534
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:06,260
Are you really going to take

535
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,060
a leave of absence
and apply for the scholarship?

536
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,440
Yes.

537
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:27,240
Then what am I supposed to do?

538
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:35,830
Let's go.

539
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:37,670
We'll be late.

540
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,880
The cartridge and the battery checked.
All good.

541
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:18,840
Just take a gun.

542
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:21,840
Well, my back hurts.

543
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,130
That's just an excuse.

544
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:26,180
You're trying to avoid catching
the perps that run.

545
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:30,310
Get going.

546
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:38,350
The cartridge and the battery checked.
All good.

547
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,710
One blank, three live. All good.

548
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,000
Go.

549
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:04,920
Just let me

550
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,380
go on patrol today.

551
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:09,760
Today is my last day here.

552
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,310
It sucks to be in the situation room.

553
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:15,350
That's what everyone in the team
including Chief Ki wants.

554
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:18,270
You can't go on patrol today, sir.

555
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,110
Please go to your position.

556
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,870
Enjoy, everyone.

557
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:32,910
All right.

558
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:46,970
Stop it, guys.

559
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:48,470
I'm just looking after my mentee.

560
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,010
-Eat up.
-Thank you.

561
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:56,180
-Do you want coffee?
-Yes, sir.

562
00:47:58,350 --> 00:47:59,520
Sir, I'd love some coffee too.

563
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:01,150
Me too!

564
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:02,190
Forget it, you brats.

565
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:04,440
Sam-bo, what about us mentors?

566
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:05,980
I'll make you guys coffee.

567
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,240
-I don't want coffee.
-Okay.

568
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,710
Did I do something wrong?
Why aren't you saying a word to me?

569
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:43,810
We're busy enough here.

570
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:48,230
He said he'll drop charges against you.
Do you have to sue him?

571
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:52,490
They say
to make way for a mad man and a bull.

572
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:57,040
People think that they can walk
all over us because we cops

573
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:00,080
always let things like this slide.

574
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:02,750
But you did push him.

575
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:11,260
You messaged all mentees
on social media yesterday and said,

576
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:14,970
"Pushing a civilian,
regardless of the reason, is my fault."

577
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:18,350
"You should not make the same mistake
I did.

578
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,480
Still,

579
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:24,190
no one should falsely accuse a cop...

580
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:26,900
Actually, no one should

581
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:30,030
falsely accuse anyone
and threaten one's livelihood."

582
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,110
I'll receive disciplinary action
for pushing the civilian.

583
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,910
However, I won't just stand by

584
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:37,580
and let this matter slide.

585
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:39,410
I wouldn't sue him,

586
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:45,330
but I'm not always right.

587
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:53,010
The money we raised for you
will be going to Captain Kang and Su-man.

588
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:55,550
Good job.

589
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,430
Take this as far as you can.

590
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:09,980
Make sure he's punished.

591
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:38,930
You've been ignoring me
since the shootout.

592
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:43,520
I have nothing to say.

593
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,480
We were all scared.

594
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,110
Jeong-o, Hye-ri and I were shocked.

595
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,400
We were all scared.

596
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,800
Jeong-o, Hye-ri and I were shocked.

597
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,790
As a veteran,
you probably weren't as fazed.

598
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:07,500
I'm human too, you know.

599
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:09,300
I get shocked too.

600
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:16,050
Attention.

601
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,570
My belt feels uncomfortable.

602
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:32,320
Would you rather die or be uncomfortable?

603
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:35,950
Uncomfortable, sir.

604
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:38,790
Am I trying to scare you or make you aware

605
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:41,250
when I say it's life or death?

606
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,080
It's to make me aware, sir.

607
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:48,040
Then is it okay to fasten your pistol
like this?

608
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:51,380
It is not okay, sir.

609
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:10,610
Get your head straight, okay?

610
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:13,070
I will, sir.

611
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:15,660
I will.

612
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:29,000
I'm glad that you weren't

613
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:32,380
injured the other day.

614
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:39,390
I'm glad

615
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:42,970
you weren't injured too.

616
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,980
If that happened to you, then I...

617
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:53,190
I don't think I could live.

618
00:52:57,530 --> 00:52:58,570
Get ready to head out.

619
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:08,210
The investigation on Captain Kang's case
must be over already.

620
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:10,250
His burial is tomorrow.

621
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:11,800
We should see him off.

622
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:16,090
Everyone will be here tomorrow anyway

623
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:17,630
since it's your last day,

624
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:19,510
so it works out.

625
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:26,390
Welcome, ma'am.

626
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,320
This is probably
my last time seeing Sook-ja.

627
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,740
Consider yourself lucky.

628
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:38,280
-Aren't you tired of handling cases?
-You're right.

629
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,780
I'm sick and tired of them.

630
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:45,040
Oh, my. What's that?

631
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:48,290
Where did you come from?

632
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:52,630
It's a kitten.

633
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:54,300
-Isn't it adorable?
-Hye-ri!

634
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:56,510
Who said you could move from your station?

635
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:57,670
I'm sorry, sir.

636
00:53:58,090 --> 00:53:59,380
Where do you live?

637
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:01,800
My goodness. It's just a baby.

638
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:04,220
It must be living on the street.

639
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,810
-It's adorable.
-I know.

640
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:10,440
Code zero, code zero.

641
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,440
78-1, at a dead-end alley
below Mount Somyeong,

642
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,610
an old man collecting recyclables
has been spotted bleeding.

643
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:19,400
A woman in her 20s reported the incident.

644
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:20,700
His condition is unknown.

645
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:22,370
Code zero, code zero.

646
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:24,450
<i>An old man has been spotted bleeding.</i>

647
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:25,830
<i>His condition is unknown.</i>

648
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:32,420
Hurry. Hurry up!

649
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:36,800
He's over there!

650
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:38,800
Make a right at the top!

651
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,600
Over here!

652
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:56,110
He's alive.

653
00:54:56,610 --> 00:54:58,570
The victim is alive!

654
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:12,710
Cars with plate number 9895 and 6781.
Move your vehicles!

655
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:16,210
Cars with plate number 9895 and 6781.
Move your vehicles!

656
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:17,670
Make room for the ambulance.

657
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:20,420
-9895 and 6781.
-A man is injured!

658
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:23,260
Hold on.

659
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,510
We set up a perimeter.

660
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,470
Can you stand guard
until a detective gets here?

661
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,560
-Sure. Let's go.
-Cars 9895 and 6781!

662
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,480
A man is injured.
Please move your vehicles.

663
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,230
There's no phone number.

664
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:38,820
Cars 9895 and 6781!

665
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:41,360
Shit!

666
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:45,160
A man is injured.
Please move your vehicles.

667
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:46,870
Please move out of the way.

668
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:54,670
Over there!

669
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:55,880
At the end, over there!

670
00:55:58,460 --> 00:55:59,550
It's me, Gil.

671
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:02,840
Why haven't you picked up for
the past couple of days?

672
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:05,800
Is it because I had the baby

673
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:08,220
when you didn't want it?

674
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:10,850
I'm scared.

675
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:12,560
Call me.

676
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,270
Move! This is an emergency!

677
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:17,190
Over here.

678
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:20,360
Out of the way!

679
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:21,650
This is an emergency!

680
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:25,450
MOM

681
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:27,950
OB/GYN

682
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,330
Mom, it's me.

683
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:31,830
Of course, I'm fine.

684
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:34,960
What do you mean you're visiting?

685
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,890
Lieutenant Oh,
you and the officers did a great job,

686
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:51,680
but the old man passed away.

687
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,930
He would've lived if he got here
three minutes earlier.

688
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:56,980
If not for the illegally parked cars...

689
00:56:58,230 --> 00:57:00,610
You should head back
and leave the rest to us.

690
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:06,740
Sang-su.

691
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:08,950
-Yes?
-Lieutenant.

692
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:11,330
Let's not head back just yet.

693
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:13,750
-Let's head to the scene.
-And tow all those cars.

694
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:15,620
I was just about to say that.

695
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:19,790
Is this Boryeong Towing? This is
Sergeant Kang of Hongil Patrol Division.

696
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:24,550
Send a tow truck to
66, 74, 48 Hongan 1-dong...

697
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:28,010
I don't care which jurisdiction
the area falls under.

698
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:30,350
I'll take full responsibility!

699
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:32,640
Tow all the cars there
that are illegally parked.

700
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:47,030
Why are you towing my car?

701
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:48,860
I only parked it briefly
in front of my house.

702
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:52,240
This road should be cleared
for emergency purposes.

703
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:54,910
Also, it was here since
the incident earlier today.

704
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:57,830
Why weren't you here when
you were asked to move it?

705
00:57:58,410 --> 00:58:01,420
A man died today because
of all these illegally parked cars!

706
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,340
-Unbelievable.
-What?

707
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,510
-Are you kidding me?
-Damn it!

708
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:16,560
<i>The elderly and teenager
are being targeted by a suspect</i>

709
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,690
<i>who sprinkles flour at the scene
after stabbing them.</i>

710
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:20,600
<i>These random stabbings</i>

711
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:22,650
<i>are occurring all over Seoul.</i>

712
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:24,940
<i>The public is trembling in fear.</i>

713
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:27,280
<i>There were three cases
over the past two days.</i>

714
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:29,900
<i>One of the three victims died,
and two were gravely wounded.</i>

715
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:31,950
<i>Let's go to our reporter on the scene.</i>

716
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:35,120
<i>The first random attack happened
2 days ago at around 11 p.m.</i>

717
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:38,500
<i>inside the restroom of
Jangnam-gu's district library.</i>

718
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:40,790
<i>An unidentified male stabbed
a middle-school student</i>

719
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:42,420
<i>in the stomach multiple times,</i>

720
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,880
<i>sprinkled flour on and around the boy,</i>

721
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:45,880
<i>and then ran off.</i>

722
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:49,630
<i>The man was captured by
a security camera outside the toilet.</i>

723
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:50,880
<i>He is relatively tall,</i>

724
00:58:50,970 --> 00:58:52,930
<i>wore a black cap and sunglasses,</i>

725
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:54,970
<i>and looked down to hide his face.</i>

726
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:58,060
<i>He wore a tracksuit and white sneakers.</i>

727
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:01,890
<i>The second attack happened
last night at around 9 p.m.</i>

728
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:03,520
<i>72-year-old Ms. Hwang</i>

729
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,360
<i>was leaving her store</i>

730
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,940
<i>in Jangdong-gu's Jangdong Market.</i>

731
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:10,030
<i>She was found on the ground
after being stabbed multiple times.</i>

732
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:12,860
<i>Police found flour on the site as well.</i>

733
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:15,530
<i>Today at around 4 p.m.
in a narrow street near Mount Somyeong,</i>

734
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:19,410
<i>inMahyeon-gu, Hongan 1-dong
the third attack occurred.</i>

735
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:22,080
<i>Mr. Park, a 75-year-old
who was collecting paper to recycle,</i>

736
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:24,460
<i>was found on the ground with stab wounds.</i>

737
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:26,790
<i>He was taken to hospital
for emergency surgery,</i>

738
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,630
<i>but he lost his life.</i>

739
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:31,720
<i>Again,
there was flour at the scene of the crime.</i>

740
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:35,800
<i>No fingerprints or footprints
were found on the scene,</i>

741
00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:37,640
<i>and the flour was used</i>

742
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:40,060
<i>to cover up all traces of the crime.</i>

743
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:42,270
<i>The police believe all three attacks
were committed by</i>

744
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:45,100
<i>one person attempting to commit
a perfect crime.</i>

745
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,900
<i>The criminal wore gloves</i>

746
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:49,690
<i>and shoes with their soles cut out.</i>

747
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:52,400
<i>The first victim, a student,
was stabbed with a blade</i>

748
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:55,950
<i>and the second and third victims,
the elderly man and woman</i>

749
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:57,950
<i>were stabbed with a sharpened screwdriver.</i>

750
00:59:58,030 --> 01:00:00,580
<i>Those are the conclusions
the police reached so far.</i>

751
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:02,620
<i>The three victims are not connected.</i>

752
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:06,540
<i>The pattern reveals the perpetrator
targets weak children</i>

753
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:08,800
<i>or the elderly to commit
this heinous crime.</i>

754
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,550
<i>The police believe
the criminal is antisocial</i>

755
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:14,880
<i>and hurts others for his pleasure.</i>

756
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:52,670
Patrol 24, Hongan 3-dong,
two friends assaulted each other.

757
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:56,050
Neither wanted to press charges,
so they settled and parted ways.

758
01:00:56,130 --> 01:00:57,090
They got a warning...

759
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:59,930
I love it
when we let people off with a warning.

760
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,140
It feels like we're really
judges of the streets.

761
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,060
We're winding down on our duties
and returning to the station.

762
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:08,690
Returning to the station.

763
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:57,610
What's up?

764
01:01:58,740 --> 01:01:59,570
"What's up?"

765
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:05,660
Will you really take time off
and apply to study abroad?

766
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:09,120
If I'm chosen, I will apply for time off.

767
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:14,550
And?

768
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:16,880
Did you apply?

769
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:23,760
I plan to apply today when I get home.

770
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:31,980
Don't you like me?

771
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:36,190
I do like you,

772
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:41,280
but working abroad

773
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,580
was a dream of mine
even before I became a cop.

774
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:48,580
I don't like you

775
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:52,040
enough to give that up.

776
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:58,400
Sorry, Sang-su.

777
01:03:02,030 --> 01:03:03,190
I don't have

778
01:03:04,610 --> 01:03:06,280
the sense of duty you do.

779
01:03:06,910 --> 01:03:08,740
I became a cop to make a living.

780
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,370
Even after I come back,

781
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,410
I'll continue being a cop,

782
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:18,250
but I won't return to a patrol division.

783
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:22,210
Two days ago we lost a colleague,

784
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:25,220
and today someone else died.

785
01:03:26,930 --> 01:03:28,260
Somewhere, there's a kid,

786
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:31,470
another person getting hurt.

787
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:36,140
Things happened every day.

788
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:40,150
I don't think I can stand
watching that happen.

789
01:03:43,030 --> 01:03:44,110
The patrol division

790
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:48,160
doesn't suit someone like me,
who doesn't have a sense of duty.

791
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:55,120
<i>Code Zero, Code Zero.</i>

792
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,370

<i>A resident reported an abandoned newborn</i>

799
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,470
There's ten minutes left. I have to work.

<i>A resident reported...</i>

801
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:14,350
You can go home.

802
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,430
-I'll find the baby.
-<i>Please respond.</i>

803

813
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:58,850
Nam-il, come with us to the right.

814
01:04:58,930 --> 01:05:00,390
-The rest to the left.
-Okay.

815
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,480
We'll go left.

816
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:04,440
Be careful everyone.

817
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:12,570
I wish they told us
exactly where the baby is.

818
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:16,040
How is "near the patrol division" helpful?
That's a huge area to cover.

819
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:19,040
We're just about to get off the clock.

820
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:22,000
Team Two went out right away
to work on another case.

821
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:24,880
The weather is too cold for a baby too.

822
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:27,050
I hope they find it soon.

823
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:28,960
I know.

824
01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:39,480
Wait!

825
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:42,020
I want to ask you something.

826
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:44,440
Wait.

827
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,980
Sam-bo, what is it?

828
01:05:47,070 --> 01:05:48,440
I think she's the mom.

829
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:50,530
She ran off after we made eye contact.

830
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,110
Be careful! There's a car coming.

831
01:06:04,290 --> 01:06:06,250
You go right, I'll go left.

832
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:07,960
We need to find the mom to find the baby.

833
01:06:08,050 --> 01:06:09,170
-Right.
-Stay safe.

834
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:10,300
Okay.

835
01:06:10,590 --> 01:06:12,380
She's in her 20s and wears a gray hoodie.

836
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:14,590
-Okay. Take care.
-You too.

837
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:44,750
-Did you find the baby, Sang-su?
-No, not yet.

838
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:48,250
We'll look again.

839
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:14,450
Oh, no.

840
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:38,260
I found it!

841
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,970
I think the baby's turning blue!

842
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:50,520
Its breathing is irregular.

843
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:53,360
The baby's breathing funny. Help!

844
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:56,530
Help me, Sergeant Kang!

845
01:07:56,610 --> 01:07:58,990
-Make way.
-Hongil Patrol Division.

846
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:01,080
-Coming through.
-The baby's freezing.

847
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,620
Turn on the boiler in the restroom!

848
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:04,370
Seung-jae, get the heating fan.

849
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:06,250
Get everything in storage.

850
01:08:06,330 --> 01:08:08,170
I can perform CPR on infants.

851
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:10,170
-Coming through.
-Yes.

852
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:12,040
-Coming through.
-I took a course.

853
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:13,550
Come quick!

854
01:08:18,510 --> 01:08:19,590
Shit, where is it?

855
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:21,350
Where's the heating fan?

856
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:24,310
Damn it!

857
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:26,480
I know I saw it somewhere here.

858
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:29,480
Get some warm water ready for the baby.

859
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:30,690
Right.

860
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:43,530
Where the hell is it?

861
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:02,550
I'm telling you...

862
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:03,800
Shut him up.

863
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:06,220
Be quiet. You're going to scare the baby.

864
01:09:06,930 --> 01:09:08,640
Are you telling me to shut up?

865
01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:31,370
Help me. Help!

866
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:32,880
Somebody help--

867
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:40,800
<i>I'm a cop without a sense of duty.</i>

868
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:43,180
<i>I only became one</i>

869
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:45,680
<i>to make a living.</i>

870
01:09:46,970 --> 01:09:48,810
<i>I've never been ashamed to say it.</i>

871
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:51,480
<i>So,</i>

872
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:53,730
<i>why am I running</i>

873
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,190
<i>running as if my life depended on it?</i>

874
01:09:57,730 --> 01:09:59,150
One, two, three, four...

875
01:09:59,230 --> 01:10:01,110
<i>It's a job no one gives us credit for.</i>

876
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,650
Again. One, two, three, four...

877
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:05,370
<i>Tomorrow,
another case will be at the forefront.</i>

878
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:06,740
One, two, three, four...

879
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:08,870
<i>Those who appreciate us</i>

880
01:10:10,450 --> 01:10:12,540
-<i>isn't the police force.
-We'll go around in turns.</i>

881
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,580
<i>It's just our pitiful selves.</i>

882
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:19,210
-One, two...
-Not so hard.

883
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:20,420
A baby is fragile.

884
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:22,800
Be careful.

885
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:26,720
<i>Still,</i>

886
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:29,930
<i>I wished for the baby to live.</i>

887
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:31,810
Five, six, seven...

888
01:10:31,890 --> 01:10:34,350
<i>If there was another job for me,</i>

889
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,230
<i>I'd gladly quit this one.</i>

890
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:38,980
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

891
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,240
One, two, three, four...

892
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:51,910
<i>I have a weak sense of duty.</i>

893
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:54,620
<i>But we...</i>

894
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:57,500
<i>No, as long as I've met the baby now,</i>

895
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:02,510
<i>I just hope</i>

896
01:11:03,970 --> 01:11:05,510
<i>that it'll live.</i>

897
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:43,260
Attention. Salute!

898
01:11:45,470 --> 01:11:46,840
Isn't the baby adorable?

899
01:11:46,930 --> 01:11:47,800
It is.

900
01:11:47,890 --> 01:11:50,850
Wasn't that one grand retirement present?

901
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:52,890
I'm sorry.

902
01:11:52,970 --> 01:11:54,390
For what?

903
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:57,310
I'm going to request a leave
if I get accepted.

904
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,940
<i>Beat 29, men's restroom at
the east gate of Mahyeon Park.</i>

905
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:07,860
<i>An officer has been stabbed.</i>

906
01:12:07,950 --> 01:12:10,660
<i>Please send paramedics.
Please send paramedics!</i>
