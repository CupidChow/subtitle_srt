I'm still

23
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,639
in a meeting with a client.

24
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,400
A client?

25
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,199
Is it a man or a woman?

26
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,520
A male client.

27
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,840
I refused to believe
that Xie Qing was dead,

28
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,080
so I kept looking for her.

29
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,599

00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,199
I didn't lie, did I?

31
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,280

after meeting Li Ze Liang.

33
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,479
She is missing...

34
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,240
Who can tell me what happened?

35
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:02,719
Xie Yi,

36
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,840
I'm back.

37
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,120
Xie Yi.

38
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,039
Xie Yi!

39
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,520
Hello? Xie Yi?

40
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,439
Where did you go?

41
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,639
I'll be home in a minute.

42
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,039
Xie Yi.

43
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,560
Is that you?

44
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,479
Xie Yi.

45
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,240
Where did you go, Xie Yi?

46
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,199
I have something to ask you.

47
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,120
When I called you

48
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:28,079
before my sister went missing,

49
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,800
were you meeting with a male client?

50
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,120
Xie Yi.

51
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,040
Why are you suddenly asking that?

52
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,920
Are you going to keep lying to me?

53
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,199
I'm sorry, Xie Yi.

54
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,920
I didn't mean to lie.

55
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,240
Why were you there

56
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,480
with my sister?

57
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,959
She called me

58
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,800
and asked to meet me.

59
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,319
When I met her,

60
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,319
she had already recovered.

61
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,800
If she had, then why did she go missing?

62
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,319
What did she tell you?

63
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,519
She asked me

64
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,680
about how you had been.

65
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,600
She wants you to be happy.

66
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,439
And?

67
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,160
(Please don't say)

68
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,839
anything about this to Xie Yi.

69
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,680
I don't want to see her hurt and upset

70
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,519

71
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,920

72
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,759
That was it.

73
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,480
Impossible.

74
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,959

75
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,360

Xie Yi.

77

with what happened to Xie Qing.

00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,480
She left to do something.

174
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:50,279
What?

175
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,039
Did you guys get into a fight?

176
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:55,879
Something's wrong.

177
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,679
If it were just an argument,

178
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:00,919
you wouldn't be frowning so much.

179
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,919
She and I had some

180
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,000
complicated misunderstandings.

181
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,759
My mind's a mess right now.

182
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,559
Liang.

183
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,000
We've never kept

184
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,320
any secrets between us.

185
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:19,159
If there's something

186
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:19,840
bothering you,

187
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,799
tell me.

188
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:23,519
It might make you feel better.

189
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,840
So Xie Qing had something to do
with Zhiwei going bankrupt

190
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,960
back then.

191
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,399
But how could she?

192
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,360
Even you're saying that.

193
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,399
It would be even harder
for Xie Yi to believe.

194
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,399
Xie Yi is in

195
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,360
a depressed state right now.

196
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,759
That's why

197
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:54,519
you couldn't bear to tell her, right?

198
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,159
In Xie Yi's heart,

199
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,679
Xie Qing

200
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,080
had always been the best sister.

201
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,960
After Uncle Shen passed away,

202
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:11,639
Xie Qing became Xie Yi's

203
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,799
pillar of support even more.

204
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,120
Right now,

205
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,159
she is in her saddest moment.

206
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,559
I'm worried
she won't be able to handle it.

207
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,679
Xie Yi's condition is sensitive.

208
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:27,279
After all, she was traumatized before

209
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,399
and even fell ill.

210
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:30,000
If it were me,

211
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:32,039
I wouldn't tell her the truth either.

212
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,360
You have it hard.

213
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:52,360
Liang.

214
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,360
Do you know what I admire

215
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:55,240
the most about you?

216
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:56,480
Don't say

217
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:58,039
it's because I'm handsome or rich.

218
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,840
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

219
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,240
Of course not.

220
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,360
What I admire the most about you

221
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:08,000
is how

222
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,600
you're like a roach.

223
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,519
Exceptionally tenacious.

224
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,519
No matter what happens,

225
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,639
you always get back on your feet.

226
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,240
And, you can even

227
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,519
take care of everything

228
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:23,159
in a smooth and orderly manner

229
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,080
while considering the bigger picture.

230
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,840
What are you trying to say?

231
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,360
What I meant

232
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,480
is that you will definitely find a way

233
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:35,720
to clear up the misunderstanding
between you and Xie Yi.

234
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:38,240
But you can't

235
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:40,879
lose your calm first.

236
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,799
If you're tired,

237
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,399
get some rest.

238
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:45,679
But promise me

239
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:47,000
that after tonight,

240
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,200
you'll go back

241
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,720
to the Li Ze Liang you were.

242
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,399
All right?

243
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,399
Hello, Miss Su.

244
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,840
I am the officer

245
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,200
in charge of investigating
Shen Xie Qing's case. My name is Wang.

246
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,360
We have yet to discover

247
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,559
any traces of Shen Xie Qing.

248
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,399
The rescue team

249
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,519
will continue to expand its search area

250
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:05,960
deeper into the river
and the surrounding area.

251
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,679
We will inform you immediately

252
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:09,159
if we find anything.

253
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:10,720
Please keep your line open.

254
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:15,960
Xie Qing,

255
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,080
is that me?

256
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,600
I'm not that fat.

257
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,559
All right, all right.

258
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:23,120
This is me. I am that fat.

259
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,120
All right?

260
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:25,720
This is the wedding dress

261
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:27,120
my sister had made.

262
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,600
However, she fell ill

263
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:31,720
before the wedding.

264
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,159
That must be

265
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,320
her greatest regret.

266
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:55,600
Xie Qing.

267
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,440
What did you tell Yan?

268
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:03,080
Why did you do something so foolish?

269
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,399
I need to use the washroom.

270
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:13,200
(Dad,)

271
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:15,160
(I was wrong.)

272
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,200
(I will turn myself in.)

273
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,079
(Please forgive my cowardice.)

274
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,759
(To the man)

275
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,200
(I loved my entire life,)

276
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:24,920
(there was a moment
I wanted to turn him in.)

277
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,559
(But I couldn't bring myself)

278
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,640
(to send him to jail myself.)

279
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:30,079
(Let him)

280
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:32,359
(decide his own fate.)

281
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,279
(If he truly loves me,)

282
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,310
(he will be spared.)

283
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:44,750
(Minxian Police Station)

284
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,359
Xie Qing.

285
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:01,359
Any further,

286
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:03,079
and you'll reach the police station.

287
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,279
What are you trying to do?

288
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,079
Be good.

289
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:13,160
Come home with me.

290
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,119
You're awake.

291
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:30,359
Ming Hao.

292
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,519
Where am I?

293
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,680
I'm scared.

294
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,160
I want to go home.

295
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,920
Stop pretending.

296
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:41,039
I know you've recovered.

297
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:50,880
Where did you want to go?

298
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,240
I wanted to go home,

299
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:57,400
but

300
00:18:58,279 --> 00:18:59,279
I got lost.

301
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:00,920
And you wandered off
to the police station?

302
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,799
To expose me?

303
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:04,640
No, Ming Hao.

304
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,599
How could you think that?

305
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:09,440
Why would I expose you?

306
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,559
I just couldn't handle

307
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,079
the torment in my heart.

308
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:14,960
After all,

309
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,119
Dad committed suicide because of me.

310
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:20,920
I wanted to turn myself in.

311
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,480
But don't worry,

312
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,240
I will never give you up.

313
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,799
I just...

314
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,000
I just wanted to let myself

315
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:34,079
feel better.

316
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,359
How can I believe

317
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,759
that you wouldn't give me up?

318
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:45,559
Ming Hao.

319
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,440
We've been together for so many years.

320
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:49,400
You know well

321
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:51,279
how much I love you.

322
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:53,759
I don't dare to ask

323
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,039
for all your love.

324
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:57,759
I just hope

325
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:01,759
that you would have

326
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:04,319
the slightest bit of love for me.

327
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,799
I would do anything for you.

328
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,400
Do you really not hate me?

329
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,759
I only hate myself.

330
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:18,200
You know 

331
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,200
that I wanted to end my life

332
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:24,160
two years ago.

333
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,960
I do.

334
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,200
I have good news for you.

335
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,079
Thanks to the suicide note

336
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:33,200
you wrote two years ago,

337
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:34,599
everyone thinks

338
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,680
that you committed suicide now.

339
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,480
That means, from this moment on,

340
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,319
you, Shen Xie Qing,

341
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:39,720
are deceased.

342
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,359
(Xie Qing,)

343
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,680
I brought the ginseng

344
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,640
I bought for you.

345
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,039
I'll make soup for you tonight.

346
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,799
Why do you have my phone?

347
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:04,880
It was you.

348
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,720
What?

349
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,039
You disguised yourself as K of Spades

350
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,440
and had Huo Jian ruin Zhiwei,

351
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:12,200
didn't you?

352
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,839
What nonsense are you speaking?

353
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,200
I'm not speaking nonsense!

354
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,920
I've seen all the messages

355
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:20,759
in here!

356
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,359
So you've found out.

357
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,599
Great.

358
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,000
I can finally stop pretending.

359
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,279
Yes, it was me.

360
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,839
I had Huo Jian

361
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:33,960
ruin Zhiwei.

362
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,799
Why?

363
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,119
Why did you do it?

364
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,279
Why?

365
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,440
Why?

366
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,359
You killed Dad!

367
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,000
Because he wouldn't let me love Xie Yi.

368
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,720
Because he looked down on me.

369
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,680
What did you say?

370
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:59,039
Stop pretending.

371
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:01,279
I meant to give that doll

372
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,599
to Xie Yi back then.

373
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,640
You know well

374
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,039
that you were the one

375
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,839
who hogged my love for Xie Yi.

376
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:08,240
She is the one

377
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,680
I loved from the start.

378
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,319
Impossible...

379
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,000
You love me.

380
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:19,119
You love me, right?

381
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:20,359
How long are you going

382
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:21,440
to keep fooling yourself?

383
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:22,880
Also,

384
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:25,000
I wasn't the one
who killed Shen Zhi Hong.

385
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,680
It was you, Shen Xie Qing.

386
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,759
Your father died because of you.

387
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,920
No...

388
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,599
That's not what happened...

389
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,079
Why are you so upset?

390
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:46,440
I only did it for us.

391
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:48,359
Only after his death

392
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:49,759
can we live without worry.

393
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,799
Isn't that right?

394
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:52,599
No.

395
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,880
No...

396
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,240
Dad, I'm sorry...

397
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,370
(I will leave now.
Do not come and find me.)

398
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,640
What exactly

399
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:08,759
are you trying to do?

400
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,400
I only helped you to do

401
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,039
what

402
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,480
you wanted to do two years ago.

403
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:14,559
I'm helping you fulfill your wish.

404
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,960
Xie Ming Hao, I beg you.

405
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:20,079
Stop torturing me.

406
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,440
Why don't you just kill me?

407
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,880
Put an end to my misery, won't you?

408
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,319
I love you so much.

409
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:27,720
How could I bear to hurt you?

410
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,519
I couldn't bear to do it two years ago,

411
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,240
and I can't bear to do it
even more so now.

412
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,480
Tell me the account number
and the password.

413
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:37,200
I can't remember.

414
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,319
Xie Qing.

415
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,839
That was what we deserved.

416
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:42,000
Tell me,

417
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:43,039
and together,

418
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,359
we'll leave this place.

419
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,400
I just recovered.

420
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:49,400
I can't remember it yet.

421
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,880
Stop pretending!

422
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,599
Tell me.

423
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,960
I really can't remember.

424
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,079
All right. You don't.

425
00:24:58,359 --> 00:24:59,960
Then think harder.

426
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:01,039
Before you recall it,

427
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,519
don't even think about going anywhere.

428
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,559
Take your time.

429
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,119
Don't try to play any more tricks.

430
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,920
You won't be able to get out of here.

431
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:15,039
If you try to start a fire,

432
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,160
you'll only burn yourself to death.

433
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,519
And if you want to escape,

434
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,960
have you ever considered
what would happen to Xie Yi?

435
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,279
What did you do to her?

436
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:22,240
What I do to her

437
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,440
depends on your compliance.

438
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,680
If you try to escape,

439
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,799
I'll assume that you went to the police.

440
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,440
If you dare try to corner me,

441
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:28,119
I'll drag Xie Yi

442
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,200
down with me.

443
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,759
From now on,

444
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,960
I shall be very close to her.

445
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:33,759
You wouldn't dare!

446
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:35,480
You know I would.

447
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:36,799
You've already killed your father.

448
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,279
Do you want to kill your sister too?

449
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:44,680
Tell me when you figured things out.

450
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:51,039
Remember to change your clothes.

451
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,570
(Ocean Group)

452
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:30,319
Good morning.

453
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:33,240
What are you doing?

454
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:37,559
Buying coffee.

455
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:39,319
Doesn't Xie Yi usually

456
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,400
get coffee for you?

457
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,440
Did she not come with you today?

458
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,920
She wasn't feeling well today,

459
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:47,599
so I applied for leave for her.

460
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,839
Hello, Ms. Shi.

461
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:58,839
Didn't you apply for leave?

462
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:03,319
I went to the design company
this morning

463
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:04,559
and picked up the revised draft

464
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,400
of the Lantian Bay project.

465
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:07,480
I'll bring it to you later.

466
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,839
Then,
are you still applying for leave today?

467
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:12,200
- Yes.
- No.

468
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,880
What she said.

469
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:23,680
All right.

470
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:41,240
Are you free at noon?

471
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,799
I would like to treat you to lunch.

472
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,519
Sorry, Mr. Li.

473
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,240
I have

474
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,480
to go to the construction site later.

475
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,079
I'll probably have to be there
until late afternoon.

476
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:49,640
What about tonight?

477
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,079
I've made myself clear last night.

478
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:57,240
Unless

479
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,920
you remember what my sister

480
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,279
said to you.

481
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,039
Your coffee.

482
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,160
Mr. Xie.

483
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:33,160
Last time,

484
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:34,960
you said there was an opportunity
to let me redeem myself.

485
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,960
What is it?

486
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,079
Look at how pitiful he is.

487
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,720
Stop beating around the bush.

488
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,180
Mr. He, you've been running
a self-media account for many years.

489
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:50,279
You often do undercover investigations

490
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:51,799
and mingle in various places.

491
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,960
You're good at disguises as well.

492
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,200
Yes.

493
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:55,119
You remember

494
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,000
what I told you last time, right?

495
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,799
A chance to save yourself.

496
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,720
What do you mean?

497
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:07,640
Open it.

498
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:15,839
It's easy.

499
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:17,039
You just need to turn

500
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,319
what Li Ze Liang said into fake.

501
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,720
And what you "exposed" of him

502
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:21,119
last time would become real,
wouldn't it?

503
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:23,759
This is for your own good.

504
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,200
Do you remember

505
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:26,240
what I told you?

506
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,880
You'll have to do it

507
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,720
whether you like it or not.

508
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,319
All right.

509
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:41,720
Tell me

510
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,720
what I need to do.

511
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,839
You must have waited long, Xie Yi.

512
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,839
Get in the car.

513
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,680
Here.

514
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,279
Thank you.

515
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,319
When did you move here?

516
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,160
Last night.

517
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:39,319
Was it

518
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:41,319
because of what I said?

519
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,559
Xie Yi.

520
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,279
You wouldn't blame me, would you?

521
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,400
I didn't want

522
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:53,359
to affect your relationship
with Li Ze Liang either,

523
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:54,680
but...

524
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,960
I couldn't keep it from you.

525
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,359
A family

526
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:03,559
shouldn't keep secrets from its members.

527
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,400
Then, about Xie Qing

528
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:12,240
meeting up with him,

529
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,759
did he say anything about it?

530
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:16,839
He admitted

531
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,720
he went to see her.

532
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,480
He said she wanted me to be happy.

533
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,960
Nothing else.

534
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,640
They talked for such a long time.

535
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:43,640
Did he not

536
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:45,200
notice anything strange
about her at all?

537
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,039
Last time, when she saw

538
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,559
Li Ze Liang at the nursing home,

539
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,160
she became anxious all of a sudden.

540
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,680
And this time,

541
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,839
she disappeared

542
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:00,000
after talking to him.

543
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,359
Do you think Mr. Li

544
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,480
is hiding another side of him?

545
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:07,599
I don't think Yan

546
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,119
has any ill intentions.

547
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,960
He might not want to tell me

548
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,400
because

549
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,839
he has his own concerns and reasons.

550
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:16,839
I'm only mad

551
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:19,759
because

552
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,440
if he had told me sooner
about meeting my sister,

553
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:23,000
I might have

554
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,880
been able to see her.

555
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:26,000
And Xie Qing might not...

556
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:32,319
This is

557
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:33,599
my greatest regret.

558
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,400
In the end,

559
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:40,880
it's my fault.

560
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,759
If I hadn't been so careless,

561
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,720
Xie Qing wouldn't have gone missing.

562
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:49,599
And

563
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,240
this wouldn't have happened.

564
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:04,960
Ming Hao.

565
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,759
It is what it is.

566
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:11,559
You don't have to blame yourself.

567
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:16,400
Xie Yi.

568
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,680
Uncle Shen is gone.

569
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:20,799
Xie Qing is gone.

570
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:24,880
You're the only one I have left.

571
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,119
Move in with me.

572
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,880
I only meant

573
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,400
I could take better care of you
that way.

574
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:37,279
You're the only family I have left.

575
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,759
I can't lose you too.

576
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:40,559
Ming Hao.

577
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,480
You don't have to worry.

578
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,519
I can take care of myself.

579
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:48,519
The search team
is salvaging along the river,

580
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:50,359
but they haven't found anything yet.

581
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:53,319
No news

582
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:55,200
is the best news.

583
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,880
It means Xie Qing might still be alive.

584
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:03,559
You're right.

585
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,920
I wish

586
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,960
she could come back too.

587
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:20,880
Xie Ming Hao.

588
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:25,719
Mr. Li.

589
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,199
Here to see Xie Yi?

590
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,599
I'm here to see you.

591
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,480
Mr. Li.

592
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:36,800
Doesn't this scene look familiar

593
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:38,320
to you?

594
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,679
Xie Ming Hao.

595
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,280
I'm warning you.

596
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,519
Stay away from Xie Yi.

597
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,119
Xie Qing just passed away.

598
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,480
Xie Yi

599
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,800
needs care and comfort
the most right now.

600
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,920
You can't give it to her.

601
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,239
Yet, you want me to stay away?

602
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,960
Is Xie Qing really deceased?

603
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,079
Did she actually commit suicide?

604
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:06,079
Or is it because she found out

605
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:08,559
too many of your secrets?

606
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:10,159
What do you mean, Mr. Li?

607
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,440
Not only is she Xie Yi's sister,

608
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,719
but she is my fiance,

609
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:16,119
the woman I love the most.

610
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,239
Losing her has already
caused me great pain.

611
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:19,599
Isn't it too cruel of you

612
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,960
to insinuate such things?

613
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,880
Is the person you love really Xie Qing?

614
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,760
Did you really think I didn't know

615
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,880
if it was

616
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:31,360
Xie Qing or Xie Yi
who took the rock for you

617
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,480
and had her head shaved?

618
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,280
So you found out.

619
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:39,599
So what?

620
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,159
Go ahead and tell her.

621
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:42,800
And your meeting

622
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,159
with Xie Qing,

623
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,119
what did you tell her exactly?

624
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,320
Why you wouldn't tell Xie Yi?

625
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:52,159
Are you afraid
that she'd be traumatized,

626
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,719
lose her memories,
and forget about you again?

627
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,599
Or

628
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:56,519
that she would follow
in her sister's footsteps?

629
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:00,039
You can't afford

630
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:01,119
for either to happen, right?

631
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:06,440
Xie Ming Hao.

632
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,079
Don't get ahead of yourself.

633
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,239
The police will find out

634
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:10,840
that you are K of Spades
sooner or later.

635
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:12,400
All right.

636
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:14,440
But I suggest you let go first.

637
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,000
Look at where we are.

638
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:17,360
If Xie Yi saw this,

639
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:18,880
how would you explain it to her?

640
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:22,360
She'll be upset at you even more
if she sees this.

641
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:33,039
I'm telling you,

642
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,599
the police will find the evidence

643
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,519
and expose your true colors.

644
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:38,840
Just you wait.

645
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,840
All right.

646
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,760
You'll be busy

647
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,920
when that happens.

648
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,519
Didn't expect it, did you?

649
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,400
I'm staying here too.

650
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:13,719
Just kidding.

651
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,719
One shouldn't drink and drive.

652
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,800
Don't be nervous.

653
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,480
Everything is in order.

654
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,719
To the next warehouse.

655
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:50,880
All right.

656
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,190
(Warehouse No.6)

657
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:09,280
(I've already bribed the supplier)

658
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,079
(of the insulation board materials)

659
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,480
(for the Lantian Bay project.)

660
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,880
I had him make a copy

661
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:15,719
of the key to the warehouse

662
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,039
when they were delivering the supplies.

663
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,719
Disguise yourself as a worker

664
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,800
and bring this key with you

665
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,599
to enter that warehouse tonight.

666
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:42,840
(The supplier told me)

667
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,440
(that there was a ventilation fan)

668
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:46,159
(that works around the clock)

669
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,480
(to ensure the warehouse
is well-ventilated.)

670
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:48,920
This wire looks exactly the same

671
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,039
as the connection wire

672
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:51,239
of the ventilation fan.

673
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:53,800
(But the voltage it can withstand
is much lower)

674
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,639
(than the normal voltage required)

675
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,440
(for the operation
of a ventilation fan.)

676
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,280
Let's take a look over there.

677
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,280
(Place the wire)

678
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,119
(near the insulation boards.)

679
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,840
(Once the ventilation fan
resumes operation,)

680
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:53,280
(it will be overloaded
in less than a day,)

681
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,199
(and the electricity leakage
will cause a fire,)

682
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,199
(igniting the cable.)

683
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:57,719
(When that happens,)

684
00:39:58,039 --> 00:39:59,590
(we'll be waiting for your news report.)

685
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:08,700
(Warehouse No.6)

686
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,719
(If another girl)

687
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:37,880
(who was even better than my sister)

688
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,360
(pursued you)

689
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,679
(when you and my sister
had just started dating,)

690
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,159
(would you hesitate?)

691
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:43,360
(I'd never change)

692
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:44,679
(my decision once it's been made.)

693
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,000
Xie Yi.

694
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:48,159
Someday, you will understand

695
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,400
that there is

696
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,679
true love in this world.

697
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,960
Ming Hao.

698
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:56,119
Thank you.

699
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:03,239
(Thank you, Ming Hao.)

700
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:05,039
(I promised Yan)

701
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:06,079
(I would get that tooth removed.)

702
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:08,400
(Yan was right.)

703
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:11,000
(Medicine won't solve
the root of the problem.)

704
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,400
(I should have removed
this wisdom tooth a long time ago.)

705
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,000
Ming Hao,

706
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:16,440
thank you for your medicine.

707
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:18,760
You don't have
to go through the trouble anymore.

708
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,840
Actually,

709
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:22,920
I've moved in

710
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,000
with Yan.

711
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:38,840
(Xie Yi, after tomorrow,)

712
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:40,079
(I will)

713
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,760

714
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,679
