1
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:16,630

2
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:25,100
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

3
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:33,610
♫  Still haunts me now and then in quiet nights  ♫

4
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:41,330
♫  And turn to face all the long lost times  ♫

5
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,370
♫  Brace the pain  ♫

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:51,210
♫  Let memories wake up from oceans deep  ♫

7
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,250
♫  No place to hide  ♫

8
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,450
♫  No way to run  ♫

9
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,820
♫  New dawn counts down  ♫

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,030
♫  I fight  ♫

11
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,110
♫  I cry  ♫

12
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,700
♫  I give up  ♫

13
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:15,610
♫  Memories forgotten, forsaken surround  ♫

14
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:24,030
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

15
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:32,370
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

16
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:40,850
♫  Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

17
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:49,650
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

18
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:57,650

19
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,950

20
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:09,000
How well do you know Zeliang?

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,939
Director Shi, if I don't, I don't think we will be together.

22
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:19,460
Since Zeliang chose to make your relationship public, I'll wish you well.

23
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,120
But I heard about you two.

24
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,080
You met two years ago.

25
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,879
You lost touch with each other in between.

26
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:32,800
Yes, but fate still let us be together.

27
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,919
So my question is, do you know the "Li Zeliang" now?

28
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,879
You seem to be concerned about Zeliang.

29
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:46,220
Of course.

30
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,120
After all, we've been friends for a long time.

31
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:55,159
Was he the real reason you fired me?

32
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:59,059
I'll be frank. We're women.

33
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:01,360
I could feel you had a purpose

34
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,679
from the moment you joined the company to approach Zeliang.

35
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:07,780
I dislike opportunistic people with self-interest.

36
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,280
I don't know why you split two years ago.

37
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,439
I only hope, since you're with him, you must love all of him.

38
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:19,419
Don't hurt him the second time.

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,500
Sure. Thank you for the advice.

40
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,539
I can do it.

41
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,510
Good.

42
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:41,680
Director Shi, do I apply for leave from you in the future or...?

43
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,180
What's wrong?

44
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,639
Toothache.

45
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:48,240
It happens from time to time. I want to collect my prescription.

46
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,859
You're working for Director Li now. You can just talk to him directly.

47
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:54,679
Thank you, Director Shi.

48
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,439
Director Chen!

49
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,339
Boss Qin!

50
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:14,580
It’s hard to meet you.

51
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,960
Come on. Let's have a seat. Have some tea.

52
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,720
Good things take time.

53
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,100
Selling works of art isn't like other ordinary businesses.

54
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,900
We mustn't rush it.

55
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,419
Boss Qin, I know your concerns.

56
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:36,820
Boss Chen, who used to work with us, has migrated.

57
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,859
That's why he recommended me to you.

58
00:04:38,859 --> 00:04:41,499
We have worked with Boss Chen for quite a long time.

59
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:45,199
He's also an old friend of yours. What else do you have to worry about?

60
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,260
In fact, we're not in a rush either.

61
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,700
But the hotel has started operating.

62
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,379
We have also received the budget from the group.

63
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:59,900
I just think if we can cut this deal earlier,

64
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:04,799
you can feel relieved earlier when the deal is set in place.

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,759
All right.

66
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,859
Same rules, then.

67
00:05:11,859 --> 00:05:16,099
Twenty percent of the deal will go into your designated account.

68
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:19,660
Boss Qin, you're indeed a man of your word.

69
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,460
But let me be straight with you.

70
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,319
I may seek profits.

71
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:29,939
But you and I know the quality of these paintings.

72
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:34,340
The quotation for the works is outrageous.

73
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,959
Aren't you afraid of the risk?

74
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,600
These are works of art.

75
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,619
You get it. There's a way of going around the quotation.

76
00:05:41,619 --> 00:05:44,739
It's not the first time we're doing this, anyway.

77
00:05:44,739 --> 00:05:48,000
So please rest assured.

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,700
So is the rebate negotiable?

79
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,199
To be honest, I'm only acting under orders.

80
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:03,900
I hope you won't make it difficult for me.

81
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,980
You're an important client.

82
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,020
But I request a lump sum payment.

83
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,560
No problem.

84
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,560
But,

85
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,099
for my cut...

86
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,520
Have some tea.

87
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:38,619
- I have another request. 
 - Please tell.

88
00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:41,720
I want to meet your superior because I need to know

89
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,040
your financial capacity is guaranteed.

90
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,920
We may have been keeping in touch for two months and have built up some trust.

91
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,730
But after all, it's our first time working together.

92
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,720
If we don't meet even once,

93
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,410
how are we going to talk about long-term cooperation?

94
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,360
All right.

95
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,820
I'll relay your request to my boss.

96
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,620
Great! I look forward to working with you.

97
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,700
Same here.

98
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,500

99
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,720

100
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,619
Hello, miss. Please show me your membership card or tell me your mobile number.

101
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:52,059
I'll register for you.

102
00:07:52,059 --> 00:07:53,499
It's my first time here.

103
00:07:53,499 --> 00:07:56,900
Let me show you around, then.

104
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,019
- This way, please. 
 - Okay.

105
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:02,159
Over here, we have Gade's paintings.

106
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:04,489
His forte is landscape painting

107
00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:08,220
and he is the most outstanding young painter in recent years.

108
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:14,360
By the way, is your boss' surname Qin?

109
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,399
Do you know our boss?

110
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,800
Is he here now?

111
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:20,680
I'm sorry.

112
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,140
Our boss doesn't receive random guests.

113
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,179
- Unless...
- Unless what?

114
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:28,719
Unless you become our Gold Member.

115
00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:32,179
Only then will our boss provide you with exclusive services.

116
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:35,700
What are the terms to be a member?

117
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,279
A single purchase of one million yuan.

118
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,000
This one. This, this, this, and that one.

119
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,719
I want all of these. Are these enough?

120
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:53,639
Yes, it's enough.

121
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:56,520
What's your payment method?

122
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,619
Pack these up for me first.

123
00:08:58,619 --> 00:09:01,420
I'll get Li Zeliang of Ocean Hotel Corporation to pay for these.

124
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:05,300
I'm sorry. It's against our policy.

125
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,700
Excuse me.

126
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,639
- Boss. 
 - Hello there.

127
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,600
I'm the owner of this gallery.

128
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,759
- Boss Qin? 
 - Yes, I am.

129
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:17,320
I heard what you said just now.

130
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,019
May I know who you are to Mr. Li of Ocean Hotel Corporation?

131
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,499
Zeliang is my boyfriend.

132
00:09:24,499 --> 00:09:26,619
My name is Su Xieyi.

133
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,719
Miss Su, how about we go to my office?

134
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:33,340
We'll chat while having tea.

135
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,740
- Sure. 
 - All right. This way, please.

136
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,520
 Qin only wants to increase the price after beating around the bush.

137
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,490
 But I rejected him.

138
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:47,019
If he's only greedy for money, there's nothing to worry about.

139
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,100
 You're right.

140
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,359
 The cut from the rebate remains the same as discussed. There are no changes.

141
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,100
Get it done quickly, then.

142
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,620
 No problem.

143
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:59,380
Also, he has another request. He wants to meet you in person.

144
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,639
 He seems to doubt our ability to pay.

145
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:07,699
But I think his request is common since it's a huge amount.

146
00:10:07,699 --> 00:10:09,679
He's pretty cautious.

147
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,399
I'll let you know.

148
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,799
 Got it.

149
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,700
Why? Is he scared it's a trap after giving him so much benefit?

150
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,480
It's not wrong for him to be cautious.

151
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,099
After all, this deal concerns a huge amount of money.

152
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,109

153
00:10:27,109 --> 00:10:28,840
-  Chairman Huo.  
 - What's wrong?

154
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,240
Su Xieyi is odd.

155
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,620
She dressed up differently and went to an art gallery.

156
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,900
Which art gallery?

157
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,000
Pinxuan Art Gallery.

158
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:43,880
Okay. Keep an eye on her.

159
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,920
Okay.

160
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,160
Su Xieyi also went to that art gallery?

161
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,440
It can't be a coincidence.

162
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,680
Hello? I want you to contact Boss Qin now

163
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,460
and tell him I'm going to see him now.

164
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,399
Have a seat, Miss Su.

165
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,220
Have some tea.

166
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,879
Boss Qin, this art gallery has been around for years, right?

167
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,039
More than ten years.

168
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:18,840
Miss Su, is there a reason you want to see me today?

169
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:22,620
Of course, it's to make a deal with you.

170
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,920
A deal? Okay.

171
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,679
Please tell me.

172
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,079
This deal is related to the previous client who was here.

173
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,039
I'm sure you know the reason I'm here.

174
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:40,179
Do you mean Chen Hengsheng?

175
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,580
That's right.

176
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,460
You should know he's not the person in charge.

177
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,519
He was only running errands.

178
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:53,520
Are you saying Chen Hengsheng

179
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,439
is working for you?

180
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:04,460
It looks like he did a good job at being discreet.

181
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,120
This is the reason I've been keeping him.

182
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,959
I would never have thought

183
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,439
that the person who planned such a huge deal is such

184
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:22,019
a young woman who's also the girlfriend of Li Zeliang

185
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:24,859
from Ocean Hotel Corporation.

186
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,660
Let's cut to the chase.

187
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,660
What were the conditions he laid?

188
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,477
Miss Su, before I answer your question,

189
00:12:39,477 --> 00:12:43,219
shouldn't you answer my questions first?

190
00:12:43,219 --> 00:12:45,800
Why? You don't believe me?

191
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,979
Of course I do.

192
00:12:47,979 --> 00:12:50,320
I'm only curious.

193
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,179
It's a huge deal.

194
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:55,039
Does your boyfriend, Li Zeliang, know about this?

195
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:57,340
Why didn't he come with you?

196
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:02,320
Are you worried about my financial capacity?

197
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:08,040
It seems that you don't know much about my relationship with Zeliang.

198
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,360
You only need to simply ask to know how conspicuous

199
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,520
is his love affection for me.

200
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:19,040
I've heard of his show of affection at the cocktail party.

201
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,000
Let me put it this way.

202
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,120
If I wanted to pick a star, he would never pick the moon.

203
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,359
I'll be honest. He has proposed to me.

204
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:32,300
So I'm not only his girlfriend.

205
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,479
To be exact, I'm his fiancée.

206
00:13:36,479 --> 00:13:41,180
So, do you still doubt my financial capacity?

207
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,140
You're a smart person. There's no need to go against money.

208
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,200
You never showed up before.

209
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,920
Why do you want to see me out of a sudden?

210
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:00,359
Honestly, Chen Hengsheng has been dealing with you.

211
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:04,219
I don't know if anything fishy in this deal.

212
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:08,240
So It has always been my concern about the terms he laid out to you.

213
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,840
Are you scared that he's benefiting from both sides?

214
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,459
Of course, I trust him.

215
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:19,259
But what if?

216
00:14:23,359 --> 00:14:30,800
So can you now tell me the terms Chen Hengsheng promised you?

217
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:33,699
Of course.

218
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:40,020
Speaking of the devil.

219
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,960
Hello, Manager Chen.

220
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,779
 Boss Qin, it's me.

221
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:46,320
 I've told my boss of your request.

222
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,540
That's great.

223
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,220
 My boss is thrilled.

224
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,240
 He should be there now.

225
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,700
All right.

226
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:03,279
Miss Su, you know how it works in business.

227
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,440
In our first meeting, we only have tea.

228
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,960
As for cooperation, we'll discuss it next time.

229
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:13,239
Okay.

230
00:15:13,239 --> 00:15:17,459
But I hope you can keep my identity a secret.

231
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,960
And please don't tell anyone that I was here.

232
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,519
Of course. That includes Chen Hengsheng.

233
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,519
I'll excuse myself, then. Okay.

234
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:30,340
I won't be seeing you off.

235
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:59,420
I didn't know you were in the mood to enjoy paintings here.

236
00:16:02,499 --> 00:16:04,680
You're here too, Chairman Huo.

237
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,460
I was passing by, so I dropped by.

238
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,140
Is that so?

239
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:14,240
As far as I am concerned, this is a member-only art gallery.

240
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,859
You drop by just because you passed by.

241
00:16:15,859 --> 00:16:18,259
Even the owner received you in person.

242
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:19,919
That doesn't make sense at all.

243
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,760
Besides, I'm curious

244
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,179
what were you and the owner talking about in the office.

245
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,080
Uncle?

246
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,580
You're here too?

247
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,020
Zeliang, you're here too.

248
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,620
Yes.

249
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,220
Didn't you say to come together?

250
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,179
Why did you come here by yourself?

251
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:56,820
I did say that. I was afraid you would be busy, so I came here first.

252
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,319
Naughty.

253
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,480
I'm not.

254
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,060
Well, here is the thing.

255
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:15,520
Xieyi saw a painting in this gallery that she really likes on the internet.

256
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,379
She keeps on telling me to buy it for her.

257
00:17:18,379 --> 00:17:22,160
I didn't expect you to remember what I said casually.

258
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,160
So are you going to buy it for me?

259
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,030
As long as you like it.

260
00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:31,000
Mr. Li is such a great guy.

261
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,820
Miss Su said you'll buy anything she likes.

262
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,260
So it's true.

263
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:41,939
Miss Su, you're lucky to have such a doting boyfriend.

264
00:17:41,939 --> 00:17:43,039
Of course.

265
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,000
You see, Miss Su chose seven paintings.

266
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,799
All of them are fine works of art.

267
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,459
It costs a total of 10,150,000 yuan.

268
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,720
Didn't you say only one painting?

269
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,599
Director Li, so...?

270
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:12,179
Zeliang, it's my first time here.

271
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:14,699
So I chose a few.

272
00:18:14,699 --> 00:18:16,119
You don't have to buy them.

273
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:19,200
Moreover, your uncle is also here today.

274
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,039
Let's not make your uncle think that you have a girlfriend who only knows how to spend money.

275
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,980
How about this?

276
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,880
Later, I'll pick the best painting.

277
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,480
All right.

278
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,460
It's okay, Xieyi. I'll buy whatever you want.

279
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,540
Let's go to the mall later.

280
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,560
Let's check out real estate.

281
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,960
Aren't you Chairman Huo and Director Li?

282
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,440
I've heard so much about you.

283
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,680
Let me introduce myself. I'm the owner of this art gallery, my surname is Qin.

284
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,240
- Hello, Boss Qin. 
 - Hello.

285
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,020
Boss Qin, I need to speak to Director Li in private.

286
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,099
- Do you have any... 
 - Yes, we do.

287
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:01,709
Let's head to my office on the second floor. It's quieter there.

288
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:03,079
Okay.

289
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:07,960
Yi Fei, keep Miss Su company and pick a good painting.

290
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,460
Okay.

291
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:11,979
Let's go, Zeliang.

292
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:19,220
Go ahead. I'll go to you once I'm done picking.

293
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,300
All right. Pick any paintings that you like.

294
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,039
Yi Fei, take good care of her.

295
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,240
Let's go, Uncle.

296
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,940
This way, please.

297
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:36,759
Are you here to buy a painting for Miss Su?

298
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,580
Yes, Uncle.

299
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,240
In that case, you already know which painting she likes

300
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,400
before she comes here, right?

301
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,440
Is there any problem with that?

302
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,539
Let's play a game. Let's guess

303
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,659
which painting she'll buy in the end.

304
00:19:55,659 --> 00:19:59,959
If you guess it right, this painting will be a gift from me to both of you.

305
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:08,240
If you want to give a gift, no need to go through the trouble.

306
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,960
It doesn't matter what you give, Xieyi and I will like it.

307
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,060
No, no, no.

308
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,139
The gift itself doesn't matter.

309
00:20:18,139 --> 00:20:21,359
What matters is the interesting process.

310
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,899
I'll be honest with you.

311
00:20:26,899 --> 00:20:30,860
Before we came here, Xieyi already told me

312
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:34,020
that you'd ask me to guess which painting she'd buy.

313
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:38,440
The guessing game is no longer interesting anymore.

314
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:44,000
Why are you hesitating, then?

315
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,180
All right, then.

316
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,600
It's the fifth painting from the left.

317
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,639
All right. We shall see.

318
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,439
- This one... 
 - All right.

319
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:53,459
I'll wrap it up for you.

320
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:55,519
I don't really like it.

321
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:38,539
 Su Xieyi, have you forgotten about the tree?

322
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,119
I'll take this one. All right.

323
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,040
Thank you for your gift.

324
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,060
I care about you. So it's only natural.

325
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:31,739
I won't disturb you enjoying the paintings, then.

326
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,000
I'll get going now.

327
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:53,219
It's such a pity. I was so close.

328
00:23:53,219 --> 00:23:56,219
I almost got Boss Qin to reveal it.

329
00:23:56,219 --> 00:23:58,259
It must be the call he answered that ruined my plan.

330
00:23:58,259 --> 00:23:59,959
Enough!

331
00:24:01,699 --> 00:24:03,480
What did you promise me last night?

332
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,720
What's wrong?

333
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,959
I told you I'd continue investigating it.

334
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:09,540
You can investigate.

335
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:13,419
But you would have been exposed if I didn't show up today, do you know that?

336
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:15,459
I didn't know I'd run into Huo Jian here today.

337
00:24:15,459 --> 00:24:19,920
Or was he the person who talked to Chen Hengsheng yesterday?

338
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,239
So do you know

339
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,480
that it's not a coincidence he showed up there now?

340
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,400
He most probably went to the art gallery to confirm

341
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,459
whether you were the one who heard their conversation last night.

342
00:24:31,459 --> 00:24:34,900
So do you think our act can deceive him?

343
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,799
I don't know.

344
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,479
Let's get in the car first.

345
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:58,459
Chen Hengsheng said you wanted to see me.

346
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:03,480
It shows you have doubts about our cooperation.

347
00:25:05,499 --> 00:25:10,499
Chairman Huo, what other doubts would I have now that you're already here in person?

348
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:15,560
Good. Since you have no doubts,

349
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,600
I have a question, which I hope you can answer truthfully.

350
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,519
Sure, I'll tell you what I know.

351
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:27,419
Boss Qin, do you know Miss Su?

352
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,550

353
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,280
If it's inconvenient for you to answer because of me, you can stop by the roadside.

354
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,779
I'll answer it.

355
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,240
 Is it convenient to talk?

356
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:57,819
Yes.

357
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,580
 Is Su Xieyi really your girlfriend?

358
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,240
Yes.

359
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,199
 Why is she interfering in Chen Hengsheng’s affair?

360
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,260
It's a long story.

361
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,160
I'll tell you about it next time.

362
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,989
Huo Jian asked me...

363
00:26:18,989 --> 00:26:22,500
 Do you know Miss Su?

364
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,140
 No, I don't.

365
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,959
 - It's my first time meeting her. 
 - Isn't it against your policy

366
00:26:26,959 --> 00:26:30,680
 for you to receive her in person when it's her first time here?

367
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,379
 She said she's Li Zeliang's girlfriend.

368
00:26:33,379 --> 00:26:35,120
 That's why I invited her to the office.

369
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,920
 Chen Hengsheng has been keeping your identity a secret.

370
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:42,620
 I thought the person behind Chen Hengsheng was her.

371
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,859
 Don't you think you're being too careless?

372
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:49,979
 Then, did you tell her about our deals?

373
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,399
 Here.

374
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,740
 Of course not.

375
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:03,920
 Before anything else, I asked her purpose here.

376
00:27:04,739 --> 00:27:08,419
 Then why did she want to see you?

377
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:10,419
 To buy paintings.

378
00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:13,019
 She said she saw a painting from my gallery on the internet.

379
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:16,400
 She likes it very much and wanted to buy it.

380
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:25,240
 Boss Qin, our deal costs billions.

381
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,680
 I hope you're not lying to me.

382
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,780
 Chairman Huo, you know we're dealing
with a huge business.

383
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,459
 So there's no reason for me to lie to you.

384
00:27:34,459 --> 00:27:38,400
 I can't give up something big over something small.

385
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,000
 Am I right?

386
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,979
 Boss Qin, you're something.

387
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,839
 So about our contract...

388
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:55,219
 Wait for my news.

389
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,480
All right, I got it.

390
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:12,080
In order to find out Huo Jian has been secretly using art purchases to seize Ocean's assets,

391
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,400
 we've set this up for half a year already.

392
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,459
 It wasn't easy to gain Chen Hengsheng’s trust and meet Huo Jian.

393
00:28:18,459 --> 00:28:20,160
It's the most critical time now.

394
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,419
There's must be no mistake.

395
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:26,140
I know. In fact, for Xieyi coming to you today

396
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,792
has both disadvantages and advantages.

397
00:28:27,793 --> 00:28:28,847
 How so?

398
00:28:28,848 --> 00:28:31,219
Huo Jian has been suspecting Su Xieyi.

399
00:28:31,219 --> 00:28:33,799
 He was worried that Xieyi would investigate the matter at the gallery

400
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,699
 because she overheard their conversation.

401
00:28:35,699 --> 00:28:37,960
He must have imagined a lot of things

402
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,780
when he ran into Xieyi at the gallery today.

403
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:44,440
But he would never imagine that you're on my side.

404
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,659
So he'll contact you again.

405
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,279
 Okay.

406
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:53,079
 Remember to tell me in advance the next time.

407
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,520
Okay. Bye-bye.

408
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:03,039
No wonder when I told you about this, you told me not to get involved.

409
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,859
Why are you doing this?

410
00:29:04,859 --> 00:29:06,659
What do you think?

411
00:29:07,459 --> 00:29:11,740
Find evidence against Huo Jian to take  him down

412
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,919
and take charge of Ocean again.

413
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:25,559
What are the odds of this happening?

414
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:30,680
There's one thing that's more suspicious.

415
00:29:31,379 --> 00:29:33,179
What do you mean?

416
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,420
When I was accompanying her picking the paintings...

417
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:39,839
 This one, then.

418
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,079
 Do you like this painting?

419
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,619
 Not bad. It looks pretty.

420
00:29:51,619 --> 00:29:56,060
If I didn't see it wrongly, it should be a voice recorder.

421
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:00,240
Also, she should be the one who eavesdropped during Hengye's cocktail party.

422
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,899
I fear she may have recorded the conversation that day.

423
00:30:02,899 --> 00:30:05,199
I don't care if she did.

424
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:07,419
We must destroy it after we make sure.

425
00:30:07,419 --> 00:30:08,819
Okay.

426
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,120

427
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:41,119
Thank you for taking me home.

428
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:43,719
I'm sorry about today.

429
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:46,179
I hope it won't happen again.

430
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:48,760
Don't worry. It won't.

431
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:44,759
 Chairman Huo, I didn't find any voice recorder.

432
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:47,820
 But there are some audio files on the laptop.

433
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,760
Stop right there.

434
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,780
Give me the voice recorder.

435
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,420

436
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:46,160
Who are you calling?

437
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,599
Are you trying to call the police?

438
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:49,299
Let me go!

439
00:33:50,619 --> 00:33:52,319
Give it to me!

440
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:55,839
Hand it over! Give it to me!

441
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,580
Xieyi!

442
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,920
Xieyi, are you okay?

443
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,420
Xieyi!

444
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,419
Xieyi!

445
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:06,919
Xieyi!

446
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,979
Trying to be a hero?

447
00:34:08,979 --> 00:34:12,900
After leaving Ocean, you're just a piece of trash!

448
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:16,179
Trash!

449
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,960
You wanted to push me to my death, right?

450
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,039
Come on.

451
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:22,039
Come on, then!

452
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,960
Xieyi.

453
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,880
Xieyi.

454
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,900

455
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:27,760
You're up.

456
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,419
I'll leave the medicine here. Remember to take it, okay?

457
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,119
Where's the person who sent me here?

458
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:35,620
Your friend is in Room 603.

459
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,880
- What happened to him? 
 - He's injured and taking his rest now.

460
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,044
Remember to take your medicine later, okay?

461
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:02,850
♫  Rain falling down from the sky  ♫

462
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:08,200
♫  Veiling the tears that are falling from my eyes  ♫

463
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,400
♫  I’ll be all right  ♫

464
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,750
♫  Tears, they are like the footprints of the heart  ♫

465
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:22,720
♫  My life begins and ends in my love for you  ♫

466
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,820
♫  Trapped in infinity  ♫

467
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:29,200
♫  Circle of love  ♫

468
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,770
♫  I don’t know how to win your heart  ♫

469
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:38,650
♫  I don’t know how to be the one for you, to be good enough for you  ♫

470
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:44,020
♫  But you’re just like a distant star  ♫

471
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:47,760
♫  Looking so closely but yet so far  ♫

472
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,770
♫  I need to stop, I need to give you up  ♫

473
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:56,730
♫  Before my heart comes apart  ♫

474
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:07,390
♫  Circle of love  ♫

475
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:34,860
So you're up.

476
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:37,199
He didn't take it away, did he?

477
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,719
Don't worry. It was taken care of.

478
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:44,259
It was a recording of you and Boss Qin.

479
00:37:44,259 --> 00:37:45,959
Good, then.

480
00:37:46,799 --> 00:37:49,179
But why was Lin Tai looking for that?

481
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:51,519
Could Huo Jian order him to do it?

482
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,480
I suspected that too.

483
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:59,299
But don't try to act tough no matter what you do in the future.

484
00:37:59,299 --> 00:38:03,299
Is this an order of a superior or the concern of a boyfriend?

485
00:38:03,299 --> 00:38:04,760
Is there any difference?

486
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,930
Of course, there's a difference.

487
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,939
My way of repayment will be different.

488
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:14,679
Even if it's a stranger, I wouldn't just sit back and do nothing.

489
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:16,679
Moreover,

490
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:21,460
you're my girlfriend in name.

491
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,520
Come in.

492
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,060
Miss Su, you're here too.

493
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,980
You should get some rest.

494
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,400
I'll stay here to take care of Mr. Li.

495
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,079
I'll stay here tonight.

496
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:44,239
Why?

497
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:47,340
Are you his girlfriend, or am I?

498
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,660
Don't worry. I'll take good care of him.

499
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,550

500
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:29,480
Have you found Secretary Lin?

501
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,280
 Not yet. But I'm on a stakeout at the hospital his father is hospitalized.

502
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,440
 Even if he's going to flee, he should visit his father, right?

503
00:39:37,139 --> 00:39:40,019
Okay. I understand.

504
00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:41,959
Thank you for your hard work.

505
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,679
Lin Tai, I've overestimated you.

506
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,000
I told you to take care of something.

507
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,380
Forget that you failed at it.

508
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,420
But you almost killed someone.

509
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,840
Yet, you have the nerve to see me.

510
00:40:23,219 --> 00:40:25,480
It was urgent at the time.

511
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,919
I had to do it. She wanted to call the police.

512
00:40:28,919 --> 00:40:33,179
I've told you this is your last chance.

513
00:40:33,179 --> 00:40:36,890
It's too bad you've ruined it.

514
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,260
I'm sorry.

515
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:43,780
Chairman Huo about the reward you promised me at that time...

516
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,840
My dad is still at the hospital waiting for me to bring the money for his treatment.

517
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,540
Reward?

518
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,760
How about this? I'll play a game with you.

519
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,159
I have darts there.

520
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:13,700
The percentage of the rewards will be based on how many you can hit.

521
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:43,960
See? Even God thinks you're a fool

522
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,079
who doesn't deserve a cent.

523
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,500
Chairman Huo, give me one more chance.

524
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,101
I can hit it. Just wait.

525
00:41:50,101 --> 00:41:52,380
How do you expect me to trust you?

526
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,080
Go home!

527
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:59,180
Huo Jian, if you don't pay me,

528
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,459
I'll tell everyone about all of you!

529
00:42:01,459 --> 00:42:05,499
Do you think I don't know what dirty business you and Chen Hengsheng are up to?

530
00:42:05,499 --> 00:42:10,580
You two work together to resell works of art in the name of the hotel.

531
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,619
You know how much you make from this.

532
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:19,940
Yes, you asked Yi Fei to find that Spider.

533
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:23,200
It must be related to Mr. Li Senior's death, right?

534
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,760
♫  I need you, I love you  ♫

535
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,510
♫  I’ll brave the waves for you  ♫

536
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:46,890
♫  You don't have to be brave all the time  ♫

540
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:18,890
♫  Halfway through the journey on the train,  ♫

541
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:22,710
♫  a new passenger takes a seat  ♫

♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

549

♫  How's it going with him?  ♫

550
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:50,960
♫  I bet his temper is better than mine  ♫

551
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,940
♫  He's better at guessing your complicated thoughts  ♫

552
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:58,740
♫  Does he hold you when you're sad?  ♫

553
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,820
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

554
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,750
♫  Everything must be going well  ♫

555
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:06,480
♫  Do you want to hear what I haven't said?  ♫

556
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:13,970
♫  Do lyrics of love songs stir up your emotions and recall all of our memories?  ♫

557
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:17,340
♫  It doesn't seem to be difficult  ♫

♫  You and fate have not given me an answer  ♫

561

♫  The wager is who can let go first  ♫

♫  Silence is the best that I can do  ♫

567
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:15,150
♫  Whatever pain and suffering may come,  ♫

568
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:17,990
♫  I'm not afraid at all  ♫

569
