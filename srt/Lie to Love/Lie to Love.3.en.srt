You should rest early.

20
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,920
I'll head back then.

21
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,400
Okay.

22
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,439
Thanks, Uncle.

23
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,719
You have visitors this late?

24
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:18,960
You're popular.

25
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,520
Is no one going to open the door?

26
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,800
Hi.

27
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,039
Is Mr. Li here?

28
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,759
I need him to sign several documents.

29
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:46,479
Let her in.

30
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,280
Please come in.

31
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,400
Ze Liang, this is...

32
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,439
Mr. Huo.

33
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,400
Hi.

34
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,919
I'm Su Xie Yi,

35
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,560
Mr. Li's temporary assistant.

36
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,680
I have several documents

37
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,280
pending his signature.

38
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,000
I still have matters to discuss
with Mr. Huo.

39
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,680
I'll sign tomorrow.

40
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,439
Wait.

41
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,120
Show me the documents.

42
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,000
If I'm not mistaken,

43
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,319
you were assigned

44
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,719
to be Ze Liang's assistant

45
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,360
the first day

46
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:25,080
you started working?

47
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:26,919
Yes, sir.

48
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,319
You barely started

49
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:31,479
and you already know Ze Liang's address.

50
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,319
You come to him at this ungodly hour.

51
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,879
Why? Are you close to him?

52
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,879
You must be jesting, sir.

53
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,039
I can't possibly be very close
to Mr. Li.

54
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,479
It was Jessica who told me

55
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:48,080
his address, his itinerary,

56
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,840
his habits, and his hobbies.

57
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,879
These are all important info

58
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,280
that a personal assistant
should have from the get-go.

59
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,039
Good.

60
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,560
Ze Liang.

61
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,000
You picked the right candidate.

62
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,479
Miss Su here is better

63
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,199
than I expected.

64
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,000
You're exaggerating, Uncle.

65
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,800
She's just a random candidate

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,599
that the General Manager's Office
sent to me.

67
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,960
She's on the probation period anyway.

68
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,720
Might as well give her a trial.

69
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,920
It's late now.

70
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,240
I'll leave you guys be.

71
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,519
See you.

72
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,439
Let me see you off, Uncle.

73
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:24,079
No need.

74
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,759
Don't drink so much.

75
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,759
Rest early.

76
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,160
As for rock climbing,

77
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:30,800
be patient.

78
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
Don't hurt yourself.

79
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,000
Thanks, Uncle.

80
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:35,879
Ying Song.

81
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,800
See my uncle off.

82
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,560
Yes.

83
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,879
I invited you just now

84
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,079
and you said no.

85
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,199
Why did you come out of a sudden then?

86
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,959
My work is not done.

87
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,720
I need you to sign

88
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,040
the documents here

89
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,480
so that I can send them off tomorrow.

90
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,279
You're working so hard.

91
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,360
Of course.

92
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,639
You don't need to work,

93
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,040
but I have to.

94
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,360
I'm still a newbie

95
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,759
and I'm on a probation period.

96
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,000
I have to work hard.

97
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,200
(Li Ze Liang)

98
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,319
What are you looking at?

99
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,680
I like your house layout.

100
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,120
Aren't you in a hurry
to send these documents off?

101
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,759
Leave now then.

102
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,560
Mr. Li, I have an upset tummy suddenly.

103
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:20,959
Can I

104
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,120
use your loo?

105
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,040
Go ahead.

106
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,600
Thanks.

107
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,879
You went past it.

108
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,560
(The contract might be in his study.)

109
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,160
(I can't leave now.)

110
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,920
(I need to find a way to stay here.)

111
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,279
Miss Su, My floor can be slippery.

112
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,600
It's your first time here.

113
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,279
Don't slip and fall.

114
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,000
Thank you.

115
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:39,439
Then...

116
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,399
if there's nothing else,
I'll leave then.

117
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,920
If you're not in a hurry,

118
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,759
help clean my house too.

119
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,800
My uncle complained

120
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,879
that my house is too messy.

121
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,560
It needs a good cleaning.

122
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:02,399
Never mind.

123
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,079
I should

124
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,480
let Ying Song handle it.

125
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,079
You don't look like

126
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:09,079
you can do house chores.

127
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:10,519
No.

128
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,319
Mr. Ji is a man.

129
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,240
I'm sure he doesn't do
house chores at all.

130
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,959
I'm the right person to do it.

131
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:16,839
Whether I'm happy

132
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,680
or upset, I do house chores.

133
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:19,600
Now,

134
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,199
I consider myself

135
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,480
a perfect house manager.

00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:24,920

137
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,639
Go do the dishes.

138
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,839

139

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,000
Then come clean the living room.

I'm on it.

180
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,960
This feels good.

181

Of course.

182
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,879
Meanwhile, I'm all exhausted here.

183
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,559
But it's good.

184
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,360
Once I'm done with the living room,
the study will be next.

185
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,360
Sorry, Mr. Li.

186
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,840
I didn't do it on purpose.

187

189
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,879
I'll pay for it.

190
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:07,200
Forget it.

191
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,840
I never like

192
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,120
that accessory anyway.

193
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:10,320

Don't touch it.

197
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,679
You need a medical plaster

198
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:27,440
to disinfect the wound.

199
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:28,559
Come on.

200
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,279
Is your hand okay?

201
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,480
Just some cuts.

202
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,320
Put it on yourself.

203
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,080
Since you're injured,

204
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,279
you don't need to clean anymore.

205
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:00,519
You can go back now.

206
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:01,440
No!

207
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:05,879
Mr. Li.

208
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,960
I'm really fine.

209
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:08,759
Look.

210
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:10,519
I've cleaned the kitchen,
the living room,

211
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,360
and the bedroom.

212
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,240
I aired the bed sheets,

213
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,720
changed the duvet.
There's only the study left.

214
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:14,799
Please let me

215
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,759
finish the cleaning.

216
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:28,360
Fine.

I gave it a name, Chestnut.

Chestnut,

231
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:46,320
allow me to introduce.

241
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,639
What are you doing?

242
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:15,480
I saw a messy rack,

243
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:16,919
so I went to arrange it.

244
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,240
It's been a night.

245
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:21,519
Are you not tired?

246
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:24,799
You came to ask me to sign something,
then you had a stomachache,

247
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,679
and then you started cleaning my house.

248
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,320
I must give credit to your acting.

249
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,919
But you asked me to do the cleaning.

250
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:35,759
Is that so?

251
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,360

in order to become my assistant...

255
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:49,720
Did I ask you to do all that?

256
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:54,080
Also,

257
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:59,200
you didn't lose your memory, did you?

258
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,919
What do you mean?

259
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,919
Those who are amnesiac

260
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:16,480
will inquire about the details

261
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,279
when they see a photo of themselves.

262
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,279
But you didn't.

263
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,360
You stowed it away.

What exactly do you want?

267
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,320
Fine.

268
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:41,399
Yes, I did see the photo.

269
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,679
But how is that a solid reason

270
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,279
for you to doubt me?

271
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,240
In the past two years,

272
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,200
many people have used

273
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,519
"I think we have met" as an excuse

274
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:51,159
to approach me.

275
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,960
I talked to them in hopes that I could

276
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:53,919
find something useful,

277
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,399
but what I received
was sinister intentions,

278
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,039
one after another.

279
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,039
You're just like them.

280
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,039
In your eyes,

281
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,640
someone amnesiac

282
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,640
is like a liar.

283
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:12,960
I see now.

284
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,079
You already started to doubt me

285
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,200
when we were

286
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,440
in the crab roe noodles restaurant,
didn't you?

287
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:20,960
Why do you do this?

288
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:23,000
I just want to know

289
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,200
who I am,

290
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,079
what happened in my past.

291
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,319
Is that too much to ask for?

292
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,519
After all this time,

293
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:33,519
I finally understood something.

294
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:36,880
Don't simply show

295
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,119
your wound

296
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,039
to someone else.

297
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,039
Not only is it pathetic,

298
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,240
but it is also because
no one will truly pity you.

299
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,480
That's why I learned to keep quiet.

300
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,759
I learned to stop asking.

301
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,000
I learned to shut myself

302
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:57,000
in my own world.

303
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,119
It's painful,

304
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,839
but it's the best way

305
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,559
to protect myself.

306
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,480
Just so you know,

307
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,279
no one

308
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:09,799
will ever joke with his or her trauma.

309
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,480
You have never lost your memory,

310
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,039
so you have no idea

311
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:16,880
how torturous it is to lose your memory.

312
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,000
Can you imagine one day,

313
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:21,799
when you open your eyes,

314
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,079
you can't remember a thing?

315
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:26,319
Like the world

316
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,559
just abandoned you?

317
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:34,400
Like you're just

a lone ship on the vast ocean.

319
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:38,359
No matter how hard you try,

320
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,119
you can never get

321
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,799
any signal.

324
00:18:58,119 --> 00:18:59,880

Su Xie Yi.

00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:10,359
You shouldn't have come today.

356
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,839
You were too reckless.

357

She's interesting.

361
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:22,880
She is hired by HR

362
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,359
through legit means.

363
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:26,799
I heard she used to study in Germany.

364
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:28,680
I don't think

365
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,880
it's that simple.

366
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:32,880
Because she took

367
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,030
(Calligraphy)
Lin Tai's position?

368
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,759
My nephew

369
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:45,400
never allows any outsider

370
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:46,720
into his house.

371
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:49,279
But that girl just started

372
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:51,440
and she barged into his place.

373
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,920
They have a unique relationship.

374
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:56,960
I will

375
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:58,440

the girl I told you about?

400
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,799
Which girl?

401
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,200
Oh, I remember.

402
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,160
Was it the girl

403
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,319
you saw when you went

404
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,559
rock-climbing two years ago,

405
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,400
who you think were your soul mate

406
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:38,559
but ended up disappearing?

407
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,519
Yes.

408
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,000
She's back now.

409
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,839
She's in Ocean Hotel

410
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:47,240
and is now my assistant.

411
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,160
What?

412
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:50,599
She's back?

413
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,400
And she's your assistant now?

414
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,279
But she said she had lost her memory

415
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,200
and couldn't recognize me.

416
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:56,400
Yet, she kept trying

417
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,559
to approach me.

418
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,519
What do you think she wants?

419
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,720
This sounds complicated.

420
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,759
You know what?

421
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,240
Let's start from the top.

422
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:09,759
Was it love at first sight?

423
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,279
(Allow me to introduce myself.)

424
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,559
I'm Li Ze Liang.

425
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:14,599
And you?

426
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,640
You can call me Yi.

427
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,880
Did you wish you two could meet earlier?

428
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:49,079
What do you think?

429
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:50,839
Does my rainbow sweater look good?

430
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,680
It's quite good.

431
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,640
But next time

432
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,920
when you're changing,

433
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,960
remember to switch off the light.

434
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:03,839
Perhaps

435
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:04,960
I did it on purpose.

436
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,359
Did you guys click with each other?

437
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,720
Giving someone a taste

438
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,079
of his own medicine

439
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:27,640
is my forte.

440
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,200
Thanks for the lesson.

441
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,519
You too.

442
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,440
Did something intimate happen

443
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,240
between you two?

444
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,319
All the boxes are ticked.

445
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:57,119
I thought you two

446
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:58,640
just met each other once. That's all.

447
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,759
Does Chu Chu

448
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,839
know about this?

449
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,440
She'll be back soon.

450
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,119
What does this have anything
to do with Shi Chu Chu?

451
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,599
You know

452
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:10,079
Chu Chu's feelings, don't you?

453
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:12,519
She told me loud and clear

454
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,039
that she doesn't like me.

455
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,240
She's just acting tough.

456
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:20,759
Also,

457
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,359
why drag her into this?

458
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:24,480
You've asked me many questions.

459
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,599
What's your analysis?

460
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,400
Well,

461
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,440
have you confronted her about
why she approached you?

462
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,160
Yes,

463
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,680
but I couldn't get anything useful.

464
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,599
She won't admit it?

465
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,039
I think

466
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:39,960
she's pretending to be amnesiac.

467
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:41,799
But

468
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:42,960
if she never lost her memory,

469
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,559
why go through the hassle?

470
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,839
Perhaps...

471
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,720
she still loves you?

472
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,359
You like

473
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,720
rock climbing a lot?

474
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:21,640
Yes.

475
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:23,039
I love

476
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,119
how relaxing it can be.

477
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,880
You know,

478
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,680
if you want to escape from time,

479
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:31,599
you should listen to music.

480
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:33,440
If you want to prolong time,

481
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,880
you can travel.

482
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,559
If you want to stop time...

483
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:47,720
If you want to stop time,

484
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,079
then?

485
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:53,319
Oh, right.

486
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,039
Why did you

487
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,000
come here

488
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,039
and camp alone?

489
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:00,640
You want to capture the sunrise?

490
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,079
My father has always wanted

491
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:05,319
to watch the sunrise from this spot,

492
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:07,319
but he's been very busy.

493
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:09,000
So this time,

494
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,440
I snuck here

495
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:12,160
to take a photo of the sunrise

496
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,319
as his

497
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:13,920
birthday present.

498
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,079
He will be over the moon.

499
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:23,960
What's wrong?

500
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,880
You're doing a great job.

501
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,400
It's just that...

502
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:32,160
the opportunity
might not always be available.

503
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,119
Why so sentimental out of a sudden?

504
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:38,880
Nothing.

505
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:40,640
It's just that it reminds

506
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:43,599
me of how I never

507
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:45,279
gave my father

508
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,599
a present before he passed away.

509
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,359
I'm sorry.

510
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,759
Don't be.

511
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,480
It's just

512
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,559
a cycle of life.

513
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,799
But back then,

514
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,119
I thought my father

515
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,759
was invincible.

516
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:05,559
He could have everything

517
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,960
he wanted.

518
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,240
But when I think about it now,

519
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:11,599
I realized

520
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,039
I never cared to find out

521
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,480
what he truly wanted,

522
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,160
what he truly liked.

523
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:18,480
Besides,

524
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,720
I never offered

525
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,480
to share his burden.

526
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:25,880
Hayao Miyazaki once said

527
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:28,160
that if the people around you

528
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,240
have to leave,

529
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:30,839
even if it pains you a lot,

530
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,200
you still have to smile
and bid them farewell.

531
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:35,119
After all, life is short,

532
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:36,920
so try to fill it with joy.

533
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,960
Let me ask you this question then.

534
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:50,759
Do you know why

535
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,720
we turn into stars

536
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,599
when we pass away?

537
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,359
Because the stars

538
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,720
are actually your family

539
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:58,440
who lights up the path for you

540
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,160
when everything is dark.

541
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,440
(Sherlock Holmes once said)

542
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,799
that when you have eliminated
the impossible,

543
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,240
whatever remains,

544
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:17,079
however improbable,

545
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,319
must be the truth.

546
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,920
She worked so hard

547
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,599
to approach you.

548
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Perhaps she still has feelings

549
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,799
towards you.

550
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:28,559
But why

551
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,119
did she claim to be amnesiac?

552
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,279
It doesn't make sense.

553
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:33,880
It's like what they show on TV.

554
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,720
Only a unique woman

555
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,039
can attract

556
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:39,759
the attention of an elite man.

557
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:41,880
Makes sense.

558
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:43,319
Based on my experience,

559
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:44,720
her advances

560
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,119
towards you

561
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,759
is like this glass of wine,

562
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:49,960
you'll get addicted to it.

563
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:52,000
It's just a matter of how long
you can resist it.

564
00:30:59,319 --> 00:30:59,960
What?

565
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,319
Didn't you say

566
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,799
a tree has its own memory?

567
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,960
We'll write our name

568
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:05,160
on a tree leaf

569
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:06,640
and hide it inside a tree hollow.

570
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,559
That way,

571
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,240
it will remember us forever.

572
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,039
Your turn now.

573
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:19,039
So childish.

574
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,900
(Yi, 2018...)

575
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,400
Give it to me.

576
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:35,070
(Yi, Liang)

577
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,480
Done.

578
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:38,759
Acting tough.

579
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:57,839
Do you think anyone

580
00:31:57,839 --> 00:31:59,519
will find it if I put it there?

581
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:05,240
How about

582
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,359
we come here again to check on it?

583
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,000
Sure.

584
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,720
Take this.

585
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:17,920
Don't you think

586
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:20,079
we're very close to the stars?

587
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,559
Thank you.

588
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,279
Didn't you say

589
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,000
you want to stay in this moment forever?

590
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,519
Let's stop the time then.

591
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,279
So...

592
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,319
What's the answer?

593
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,400
If you want to stop time,

594
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,400

(Ming Hao)

603
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:40,960
Hello?

604
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,079
Xie Yi.

605
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:43,279
Are you home?

606
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:45,920
Yes, Ming Hao.

607
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,440
Tired from work?

608
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,240
You don't sound well.

609
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:52,400
I'm fine.

610
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,680
Something unexpected

611
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,119
happened

612
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:57,680
and it was tricky to deal with it.

613
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,000
Xie Yi,

614
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,519
your plan isn't the priority.

615
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,680
Your safety is.

616
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:05,119
Don't worry.

617
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:08,079
I know what to do next.

618
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,119
Okay.

619
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,599
No matter what,

620
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,440
protect yourself first.

621
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:16,559
Don't push yourself too hard.

622
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,039
Okay.

623
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,119
I'm going to Heping Night Market

624
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,840
to buy some mung bean cakes
for your sister.

625
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,159
Do you want to join me?

626
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:24,239
No, thanks.

627
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,440
Tell my sister

628
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:28,000
that I miss her a lot.

629
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,360
Oh, right, Ming Hao.

630
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,480
Can I ask you something?

631
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,559
Sure.

632
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,000
If

633
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,639
my sister stays that way forever,

634
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,840
will you still remain by her side?

635
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:50,239
Even though we're merely

636
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:51,840
engaged to each other,

637
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:54,199
I promised her

638
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,960
that no matter what happens,

639
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:58,559
I won't give up on her.

640
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,559
Thank you.

641
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,760
Rest early.

642
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,119
Rest your mind.

643
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:13,880
(If the contract)

644
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,360
(is not at Li Ze Liang's place,)

645
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:17,280
(it must be inside Ocean Hotel.)

646
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:32,760
(If)

647
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,519
(my sister stays that way forever,)

648
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,559
(will you still remain by her side?)

649
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,300
(Hospital Wards)
(Psychiatric Rehab Center)

650
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,760
Xie Qing.

651
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,079
Come out now.
Time to take your medicine.

652
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:54,119
No!

653
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,280
Come out now.

654
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:56,440
Don't touch me.

655
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,960
You'll recover
after you take your medicine.

656
00:35:58,119 --> 00:35:58,639
- Come on.
- No!

657
00:35:58,639 --> 00:35:59,559
I don't want to take medicine.

658
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,440
Be a good girl.

659
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:01,320
Come on.

660
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,119
- Come out.
- I don't want medicine.

661
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:02,880
Come out.

662
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,079
I don't want medicine. Don't touch me.

663
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:04,519
Come on.

664
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:05,800
I'll stay here. Don't touch me.

665
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,519
I don't want medicine.

666
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:07,320
Listen to us, please.

667
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,920
I don't want medicine.

668
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:09,960
Let's get you out of there first.

669
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,719
- What happened?
- Okay?

670
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:11,639
No!

671
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:12,960
Mr. Xie.

672
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,159
Thank god you're here.

673
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:15,840
We don't know what to do here.

674
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:17,480
Let me handle this.

675
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,000
Xie Qing.

676
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,079
Xie Qing.

677
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:31,079
It's me.

678
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:33,159
Come on. Come out.

679
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,400
Come on.

680
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,559
Don't touch me!

681
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:46,159
Xie Qing.

682
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,119
Xie Qing.

683
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:50,119
It's okay.

684
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:51,159
Come out.

685
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:52,960
It's me.

686
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,400
Ming Hao.

687
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:02,960
Ming Hao?

688
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:10,760
Xie Qing.

689
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:12,920
Take the medicine,

690
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:13,679
okay?

691
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:15,119
I don't want to.

692
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:16,960
You don't want to?

693
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,480
No, I don't.

694
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,440
Okay.

695
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,840
We won't take it then.

696
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:25,119
Look

697
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:26,920
what I bought you.

698
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:31,719
Take the medicine

699
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,119
and you can have the mung bean cakes,

700
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,199
okay?

701
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:38,760
That's my Xie Qing.

702
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,119
Hold this, okay?

703
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,440
Here.

704
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:54,480
Take the medicine.

705
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:03,679
Careful. Hot.

706
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:07,039
Wait for me.

707
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:23,599
Good.

708
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:30,880
I miss the time

709
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:32,320
when we were in Germany.

710
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,320
The three of us were so happy.

711
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:38,159
Here.

712
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:45,400
But Xie Yi

713
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,440
insisted on doing something risky.

714
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,840
Don't worry.

715
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,440
I'll protect her.

716
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:56,199
Rest for a while.

717
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,800
We can have the cakes later,

718
00:38:58,039 --> 00:38:58,639
okay?

719
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,039
Xie Qing

720
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:04,440
just arrived here from Germany.

721
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,320
She's not used to the new environment.

722
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:09,320
Back in Germany, she was very obedient.

723
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,480
Dr. Zhu,

724
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,920
please be patient

725
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:13,960
with her.

726
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,840
Don't worry, Mr. Xie.

727
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,480
Hi, Dr. Zhu.

728
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,030
(Friendly Tips)
We will do our best to help Xie Qing

729
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,239
get used to the new environment.

730
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:21,920
However, Mr. Xie, I must say

731
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:23,440
that you're very dedicated to her.

732
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:24,800
Many spouses can't even do

733
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,599
half of what you did.

734
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,719
Not to mention

735
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:27,800
you're just her fiancé.

736
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,000
It's my duty.

737
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:32,440
We're a family.

738
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,039
And a family

739
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,400
won't leave each other.

740
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,360
