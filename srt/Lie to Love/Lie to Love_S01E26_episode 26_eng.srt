2
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:25,100
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

3
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:33,550
♫  Still haunts me now and then in quiet nights  ♫

4
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:41,330
♫  And turn to face all the long lost times  ♫

5
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,370
♫  Brace the pain  ♫

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:51,210
♫  Let memories wake up from oceans deep  ♫

7
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,250
♫  No place to hide  ♫

8
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,450
♫  No way to run  ♫

9
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,820
♫  New dawn counts down  ♫

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,930
♫  I fight  ♫

11
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,010
♫  I cry  ♫

12
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,900
♫  I give up  ♫

13
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:15,510
♫  Memories forgotten, forsaken surround  ♫

14
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:24,130
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

15
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:32,370
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

16
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:40,850
♫  Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

17
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:49,420
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

18
00:01:49,420 --> 00:02:00,050

19
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,950

20
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:25,819
At that time...  Where are you? Why aren't you back yet?

21
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:29,099
 I'm still having a meeting with a client.

22
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:31,060
 A client?

23
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,560
 Is it a man or a woman?

24
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,260
 A man.

25
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:42,040
I refused to believe that Xieqing was dead, so I kept looking for her.

26
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,199
Until I found this.

27
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,199
I didn't lie, did I?

28
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:51,020
Xieqing went missing after meeting Li Zeliang.

29
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,579
She is missing...

30
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,040
Who can tell me what happened?

31
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,560
Xieyi, I'm back.

32
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,000
Xieyi.

33
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,880
Xieyi!

34
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:34,559
Hello? Xieyi?

35
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:36,299
Where did you go?

36
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,239
 I'll be home in a minute.

37
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,580
Xieyi.

38
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,280
Is that you?

39
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,259
Xieyi.

40
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,140
Where did you go, Xieyi?

41
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,080
I have something to ask you.

42
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:29,420
When I called you before my sister went missing,

43
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,800
were you meeting with a male client?

44
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:38,539
Xieyi. Why are you suddenly asking that?

45
00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:40,820
Are you going to keep lying to me?

46
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,799
I'm sorry, Xieyi.

47
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,379
I didn't mean to lie.

48
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:10,380
Why were you there with my sister?

49
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,040
She called me and asked to meet me.

50
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,918
When I met her, she had already recovered.

51
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:24,000
If she had, then why did she go missing?

52
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,219
What did she tell you?

53
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:31,480
She asked me about how you had been.

54
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,300
She wants you to be happy.

55
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,139
And?

56
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:43,478
 Please don't tell anything about this to Xieyi.

57
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,420
 I know I have no right to ask this of you, but I don't want to see her hurt and upset over what happened in the past ever again.

58
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,500
That was it.

59
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,100
Impossible.

60
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,859
You guys talked for so long.

61
00:05:57,859 --> 00:06:00,360
What are you hiding from me?

62
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:08,899
Xieyi. I had nothing to do with what happened to Xieqing.

63
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:10,600
You have to trust the police.

64
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,680
They will do everything they can to find her.

65
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,620
I trusted you.

66
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,519
Why did you lie to me?

67
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:35,539
You could have told me.

68
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:39,020
I could have seen my sister one last time.

69
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,080
I even missed the chance to save her.

70
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,560
Did you forget?

71
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,640
You said you would never lie to me again.

72
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:50,950
♫  Rain falling down from the sky  ♫

73
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:56,270
♫  Veiling the tears that are falling from my eyes  ♫

74
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,519
I'm sorry.

75
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:05,790
♫  Tears, they are like the footprints of the heart  ♫

76
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:10,400
♫  My life begins and ends in my love for you  ♫

77
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,130
A'Yan.

78
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,250
I'll ask you one last time.

79
00:07:17,258 --> 00:07:20,560
♫  I don't know how to win your heart  ♫

80
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,139
What did my sister say to you?

81
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:29,699
Xieyi. No matter what Xieqing told me,

82
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:35,158
what she really hoped for

83
00:07:35,158 --> 00:07:38,220
was that you and I could live together happily.

84
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,319
♫  Before my heart comes apart  ♫

85
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,200
I don't care how you doubt me,

86
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,660
but I must warn you this.

87
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,079
Don't trust Xie Minghao.

88
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:56,439
He is not who you think he is.

89
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:59,180
Li Zeliang.

90
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,170
I don't know which of your words can I still believe.

91
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:06,600
♫  I was the shadow that chased you round and round  ♫

92
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,417
Where are you going?

93
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,440
Come and find me when you want to tell me the truth.

94
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,070
♫  Now I need to take back myself  ♫

95
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:21,970
♫  Trust in another to heal these open scars  ♫

96
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:25,430
♫  So I can love again  ♫

97
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,360
♫  Circle of love  ♫

98
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,210
♫  I don't know how to win your heart  ♫

99
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,990
♫  I don't know how to be the one for you  ♫

100
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,980
♫  To be good enough for you  ♫

101
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:43,330
♫  But you're just like a distant star  ♫

102
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:47,150
♫  Looking so close but yet so far  ♫

103
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,980
♫  I need to stop, I need to give you up  ♫

104
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:55,080
♫  Before my heart comes apart  ♫

105
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,200
 I don't want you to cry.

106
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,720
 Even if you would hate me forever, I won't let you cry.

107
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,799
Mr. Li.

108
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:39,440
Miss Su went home to retrieve her luggage and checked into a hotel.

109
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,299
She won't come back because she doesn't want to see me.

110
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:45,820
She is upset right now.

111
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,240
Let her calm down first.

112
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,820
Mr. Li. You...

113
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,677
I'm fine.

114
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,659
Just help me keep an eye on her.

115
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:58,100
I will. Don't worry.

116
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,739
A'Liang.

117
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,282
This guy...

118
00:10:10,282 --> 00:10:11,879
A'Li...

119
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,599
Oh, you're home.

120
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:17,100
Then, why didn't you open the door for me?

121
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,880
Why do you have the key to my place?

122
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,840
I forgot to give it back to you after our plan last time.

123
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,959
But what are you doing there in the dark in the middle of the night?

124
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,419
Where's Xieyi?

125
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:39,400
I came to see her.

126
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,399
She...

127
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,580
She left to do something.

128
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,120
What?

129
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,020
You got into a fight?

130
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:56,200
Something's wrong.

131
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,519
If it were just an argument, you wouldn't be frowning so much.

132
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,519
She and I had some

133
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,480
complicated misunderstandings.

134
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,559
My mind's a mess right now.

135
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:14,179
A'Liang.

136
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:18,380
We've never kept any secrets between us.

137
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,110
If there's something bothering you, tell me.

138
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,550
It might make you feel better.

139
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,440
So Xieqing had something to do with Zhiwei going bankrupt back then.

140
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,999
But how could she?

141
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:43,260
Even you're saying that.

142
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,240
It would be even harder for Xieyi to believe.

143
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,419
Xieyi is in a depressed state right now.

144
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:55,519
That's why you couldn't bear to tell her, right?

145
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,758
In Xieyi's heart,

146
00:12:03,758 --> 00:12:06,380
Xieqing had always been the best sister.

147
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,760
After Uncle Shen passed away,

148
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:14,140
Xieqing became Xieyi's pillar of support even more.

149
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:18,740
Right now, she is in her saddest moment.

150
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,318
I'm worried she won't be able to handle it.

151
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:26,039
Xieyi's condition is sensitive.

152
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:28,719
After all, she was traumatized before and even fell ill.

153
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:32,939
If it were me, I wouldn't tell her the truth either.

154
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,160
You have it hard.

155
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:55,759
A'Liang. Do you know what I admire the most about you?

156
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:58,739
Don't say it's because I'm handsome or rich.

157
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,840
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

158
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,240
Of course not.

159
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:11,300
What I admire the most about you is how you're like a roach.

160
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,219
Exceptionally tenacious.

161
00:13:13,219 --> 00:13:17,839
No matter what happens, you always get back on your feet.

162
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,659
And, you can even take care of everything

163
00:13:20,659 --> 00:13:26,080
in a smooth and orderly manner while considering the bigger picture.

164
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,640
What are you trying to say?

165
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,595
What I meant is that

166
00:13:31,596 --> 00:13:33,780
you will definitely find a way to clear up the misunderstanding

167
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,390
between you and Xieyi.

168
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:41,579
But you can't lose your calm first.

169
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:44,679
If you're tired, get some rest.

170
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:50,424
But promise me that after tonight, you'll go back to the Li Zeliang you were.

171
00:13:50,424 --> 00:13:52,080
All right?

172
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,000
 Hello, Miss Su.

173
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,140
 I am the officer in charge of investigating Shen Xieqing's case. My name is Wang.

174
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,359
 We have yet to discover any traces of Shen Xieqing.

175
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:04,759
 The rescue team will continue to expand its search area

176
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:06,620
 deeper into the river and the surrounding area.

177
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,659
 We will inform you immediately if we find anything.

178
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:11,879
 Please keep your line open.

179
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,419
 Sister, is that me?

180
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:19,500
 I'm not that fat.

181
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,279
 All right, all right. This is me. I am that fat.

182
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,979
 All right?

183
00:14:24,979 --> 00:14:28,120
 This is the wedding dress my sister had made.

184
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,517
 However, she fell ill before the wedding.

185
00:14:32,517 --> 00:14:35,020
 That must be her greatest regret.

186
00:14:54,659 --> 00:14:56,359
Xieqing.

187
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,440
What did you tell A'Yan?

188
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:04,080
Why did you do something so foolish?

189
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:58,099
 I need to use the washroom.

190
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:15,879
 Dad, I was wrong.

191
00:17:15,879 --> 00:17:18,017
 I will turn myself in.

192
00:17:18,017 --> 00:17:20,678
 Please forgive my cowardice.

193
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,699
 To the man I loved my entire life,

194
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:25,340
 there was a moment I wanted to turn him in.

195
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:29,440
 But I couldn't bring myself to send him to jail myself.

196
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,259
 Let him decide his own fate.

197
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:35,679
 If he truly loves me,

198
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,319
 he will be spared.

199
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:44,750

200
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,659
Xieqing.

201
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:03,379
Any further, and you'll reach the police station.

202
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,979
What are you trying to do?

203
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,719
Be good.

204
00:18:11,719 --> 00:18:13,860
Come home with me.

205
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,700
You're awake.

206
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,259
Minghao.

207
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:33,619
Where am I?

208
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:35,880
I'm scared.

209
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,160
I want to go home.

210
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,259
Stop pretending.

211
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:41,739
I know you've recovered.

212
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,480
Where did you want to go?

213
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,599
I wanted to go home,

214
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:59,559
but I got lost.

215
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:01,720
And you wandered off to the police station?

216
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,499
To expose me?

217
00:19:03,499 --> 00:19:05,160
No, Minghao.

218
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,299
How could you think that?

219
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:10,340
Why would I expose you?

220
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:14,260
I just couldn't handle the torment in my heart.

221
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,919
After all, dad committed suicide because of me.

222
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,920
I wanted to turn myself in.

223
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,359
But don't worry,

224
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:26,740
I will never give you up.

225
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,620
I just...

226
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,757
wanted to let myself

227
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:34,879
feel better.

228
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,659
How can I believe that you wouldn't give me up?

229
00:19:44,739 --> 00:19:48,440
Minghao. We've been together for so many years.

230
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,779
You know well how much I love you.

231
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,459
I don't dare to ask for all your love.

232
00:19:56,459 --> 00:19:58,259
I just hope

233
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:02,659
that you would have

234
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,119
the slightest bit of love for me.

235
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,699
I would do anything for you.

236
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,200
Do you really not hate me?

237
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,359
I only hate myself.

238
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:20,900
You know that I wanted to end my life

239
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:24,960
two years ago.

240
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,560
I do.

241
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,100
I have good news for you.

242
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,341
Thanks to the suicide note you wrote two years ago,

243
00:20:33,341 --> 00:20:35,680
everyone thinks that you committed suicide now.

244
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:40,420
That means, from this moment on, you, Shen Xieqing, are deceased.

245
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,280
 Xieqing, I brought the ginseng I bought for you.

246
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,939
 I'll make soup for you tonight.

247
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,699
 Why do you have my phone?

248
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,380
 It was you.

249
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,960
 What?

250
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:13,299
 You disguised yourself as K of Spades and had Huo Jian ruin Zhiwei, didn't you?

251
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,940
 What nonsense are you speaking?

252
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,001
 I'm not speaking nonsense!

253
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,359
 I've seen all the messages in here!

254
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,780
 So you've found out.

255
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,200
 Great.

256
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,900
 I can finally stop pretending.

257
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,860
 Yes, it was me. It was my plan to have Huo Jian take down Zhiwei.

258
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,680
 Why?

259
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,480
 Why did you do it?

260
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,180
 Why?

261
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,439
 Why? You killed my Dad!

262
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:50,640
 Because he wouldn't let me love Xieyi.

263
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,600
 Because he looked down on me.

264
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,380
 What did you say?

265
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:00,039
 Stop pretending.

266
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:02,880
 I meant to give that doll to Xieyi back then.

267
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,739
 You know well that you were the one who hogged my love for Xieyi.

268
00:22:07,739 --> 00:22:10,280
 She is the one I loved from the start.

269
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,680
 Impossible...

270
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,800
 You love me.

271
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,459
 You love me, right?

272
00:22:19,459 --> 00:22:22,240
 How long are you going to keep fooling yourself?

273
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,900
 Also, I wasn't the one who killed Shen Zhihong. It was you, Shen Xieqing.

274
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,559
 Your father died because of you.

275
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,900
 No...

276
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,460
 That's not what happened...

277
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,179
 Why are you so upset?

278
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:47,540
 I only did it for us.

279
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,200
 Only after his death can we live without worry.

280
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,000
 Isn't that right?

281
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,879
 No.

282
00:22:53,879 --> 00:22:58,140
 No... Dad, I'm sorry...

283
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,470

284
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,140
What exactly are you trying to do?

285
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:13,280
I only helped you to do what you wanted to do two years ago.

286
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,579
I'm helping you fulfill your wish.

287
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:20,679
Xie Minghao, I beg you. Stop torturing me.

288
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,640
Why don't you just kill me?

289
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,040
Put an end to my misery, won't you?

290
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,620
I love you so much. How could I bear to hurt you?

291
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,880
I couldn't bear to do it two years ago, and I can't bear to do it even more so now.

292
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,979
Tell me the account number and the password.

293
00:24:35,979 --> 00:24:37,900
I can't remember.

294
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,280
Xieqing. That was what we deserved.

295
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,159
Tell me, and together, we'll leave this place.

296
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,500
I just recovered.

297
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,419
I can't remember it yet.

298
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:52,240
Stop pretending!

299
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,760
Tell me.

300
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,961
I really can't remember.

301
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:57,579
All right. You don't.

302
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:00,359
Then think harder.

303
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:03,460
Before you recall it, don't even think about going anywhere.

304
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,340
Take your time.

305
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,640
Don't try to play any more tricks.

306
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,519
You won't be able to get out of here.

307
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:16,440
If you try to start a fire, you'll only burn yourself to death.

308
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,060
And if you want to escape, have you ever considered what would happen to Xieyi?

309
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,559
What did you do to her?

310
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:23,880
What I do to her depends on your compliance.

311
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,060
If you try to escape, I'll assume that you went to the police.

312
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:29,340
If you dare try to corner me, I'll drag Xieyi down with me.

313
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:33,119
From now on, I shall be very close to her.

314
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,359
You wouldn't dare!

315
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:35,759
You know I would.

316
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:38,962
You've already killed your father. Do you want to kill your sister too?

317
00:25:42,879 --> 00:25:45,280
Tell me when you figured things out.

318
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:51,919
Remember to change your clothes.

319
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,570

320
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:31,299
Good morning.

321
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:34,019
What are you doing?

322
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:38,259
Buying coffee.

323
00:26:38,259 --> 00:26:40,979
Doesn't Xieyi usually get coffee for you?

324
00:26:40,979 --> 00:26:43,240
Did she not come with you today?

325
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:48,399
She wasn't feeling well today, so I applied for leave for her.

326
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,880
Hello, Ms. Shi.

327
00:26:56,979 --> 00:26:59,639
Didn't you apply for leave?

328
00:27:01,739 --> 00:27:05,759
I went to the design company this morning and picked up the revised draft of the Lantian Bay project.

329
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:08,080
I'll bring it to you later.

330
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:11,079
Then, are you still applying for leave today?

331
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:12,800
- Yes. 
 - No.

332
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,620
What she said.

333
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:24,239
All right.

334
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:41,879
Are you free at noon?

335
00:27:41,879 --> 00:27:43,580
I would like to treat you to lunch.

336
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,820
Sorry, Chairman Li. I have to go to the construction site later.

337
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,599
I'll probably have to be there until late afternoon.

338
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:50,340
What about tonight?

339
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,319
I've made myself clear last night.

340
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:01,179
Unless you remember what my sister said to you.

341
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,739
Your coffee.

342
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,240
 Lawyer Xie.

343
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,580
Last time, you said there was an opportunity to let me redeem myself.

344
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,760
What is it?

345
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,440
Look at how pitiful he is.

346
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,820
Stop beating around the bush.

347
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,719
Mr. He, you've been running a self-media account for many years.

348
00:28:50,719 --> 00:28:53,300
You often do undercover investigations and mingle in various places. You're good at disguises as well.

349
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,559
Yes.

350
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,899
You remember what I told you last time, right?

351
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,699
A chance to save yourself.

352
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,720
What do you mean?

353
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,359
Open it.

354
00:29:15,188 --> 00:29:18,477
It's easy. You just need to turn what Li Zeliang said into fake.

355
00:29:18,477 --> 00:29:22,439
And what you "exposed" of him last time would become real, wouldn't it?

356
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:24,759
This is for your own good.

357
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:26,640
Do you remember what I told you?

358
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,680
You'll have to do it whether you like it or not.

359
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,639
All right. Tell me what I need to do.

360
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,140
You must have waited long, Xieyi.

361
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,860
 Get in the car.

362
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,520
Here.

363
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,000
Thank you.

364
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,319
When did you move here?

365
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,659
Last night.

366
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:41,919
Was it because of what I said?

367
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,480
Xieyi.

368
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,119
You wouldn't blame me, would you?

369
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:53,700
I didn't want to affect your relationship with Li Zeliang either,

370
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:58,380
but... I couldn't keep it from you.

371
00:31:00,019 --> 00:31:04,659
A family shouldn't keep secrets from its members.

372
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:13,277
Then, about Xieqing meeting up with him,

373
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,759
did he say anything about it?

374
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:19,520
He admitted he went to see her.

375
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,480
He said she wanted me to be happy.

376
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,660
Nothing else.

377
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,340
They talked for such a long time.

378
00:31:43,139 --> 00:31:46,039
Did he not notice anything strange about her at all?

379
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,098
Last time, when she saw Li Zeliang at the nursing home,

380
00:31:51,098 --> 00:31:52,880
she became anxious all of a sudden.

381
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,259
And this time,

382
00:31:55,259 --> 00:32:00,800
she disappeared after talking to him.

383
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,780
Do you think Mr. Li is hiding another side of him?

384
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,919
I don't think A'Yan has any ill intentions.

385
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:15,400
He might not want to tell me because he has his own concerns and reasons.

386
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,639
I'm only mad

387
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:22,140
because if he had told me sooner about meeting my sister,

388
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,810
I might have been able to see her.

389
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:27,000
And Xieqing might not...

390
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:34,299
This is my greatest regret.

391
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,219
In the end,

392
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,779
it's my fault.

393
00:32:41,779 --> 00:32:44,359
If I hadn't been so careless,

394
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,620
Xieqing wouldn't have gone missing.

395
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:52,240
And this wouldn't have happened.

396
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:05,879
Brother Minghao.

397
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,759
Things happens.

398
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:12,579
You don't have to blame yourself.

399
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:17,559
Xieyi.

400
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:19,880
Uncle Shen is gone.

401
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,739
Xieqing is gone.

402
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:25,679
You're the only one I have left.

403
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,819
Move in with me.

404
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,439
I only meant I could take better care of you that way.

405
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:39,859
You're the only family I have left. I can't lose you too.

406
00:33:39,859 --> 00:33:42,719
Brother Minghao. You don't have to worry.

407
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:45,319
I can take care of myself.

408
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,839
The search team is salvaging along the river,

409
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:51,159
but they haven't found anything yet.

410
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,900
No news is the best news.

411
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,580
It means Xieqing might still be alive.

412
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:04,359
You're right.

413
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,860
I wish she could come back too.

414
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:21,739
Xie Minghao.

415
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:28,539
Mr. Li. Here to see Xieyi?

416
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:30,839
I'm here to see you.

417
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:39,000
Mr. Li. Doesn't this scene look familiar to you?

418
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:48,180
Xie Minghao. I'm warning you.

419
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,319
Stay away from Xieyi.

420
00:34:50,319 --> 00:34:52,919
Xieqing just passed away.

421
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:56,860
Xieyi needs care and comfort the most right now. You can't give it to her.

422
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,039
Yet, you want me to stay away?

423
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,760
Is Xieqing really deceased?

424
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,559
Did she actually commit suicide?

425
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:09,039
Or is it because she found out too many of your secrets?

426
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:11,059
What do you mean, Mr. Li?

427
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,440
Not only is she Xieyi's sister,

428
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,210
but she is my fiance, the woman I love the most.

429
00:35:16,219 --> 00:35:18,679
Losing her has already caused me great pain.

430
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:21,320
Isn't it too cruel of you to insinuate such things?

431
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,680
Is the person you love really Xieqing?

432
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:31,998
Did you really think I didn't know if it was Xieqing or Xieyi who took the rock for you

433
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,380
and had her head shaved?

434
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,400
So you found out.

435
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,960
So what?

436
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,159
Go ahead and tell her.

437
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:44,859
And your meeting with Xieqing,

438
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,260
what did you tell her exactly?

439
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,920
Why you wouldn't tell Xieyi?

440
00:35:50,922 --> 00:35:53,840
Are you afraid that she'd be traumatized, lose her memories, and forget about you again?

441
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,820
Or that she would follow in her sister's footsteps?

442
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:01,940
You can't afford for either to happen, right?

443
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:08,240
Xie Minghao. Don't get ahead of yourself.

444
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,219
The police will find out that you are K of Spades sooner or later.

445
00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:12,979
All right.

446
00:36:12,979 --> 00:36:14,880
But I suggest you let go first.

447
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,419
Look at where we are.

448
00:36:16,419 --> 00:36:19,780
If Xieyi saw this, how would you explain it to her?

449
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:23,299
She'll be upset at you even more if she sees this.

450
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:34,159
I'm telling you,

451
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:38,019
the police will find the evidence and expose your true colors.

452
00:36:38,019 --> 00:36:40,660
- Just you wait. 
 - All right.

453
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,820
You'll be busy when that happens.

454
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,400
Didn't expect it, did you?

455
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,300
I'm staying here too.

456
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:14,919
Just kidding.

457
00:37:14,919 --> 00:37:17,919
One shouldn't drink and drive.

458
00:37:17,919 --> 00:37:19,580
Don't be nervous.

459
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,159
Everything is in order. To the next warehouse.

460
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:51,659
All right.

461
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,199

462
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:13,321
 I've already bribed the supplier of the insulation board materials for the Lantian Bay project.

463
00:38:13,321 --> 00:38:17,220
I had him make a copy of the key to the warehouse when they were delivering the supplies.

464
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,060
Disguise yourself as a worker and bring this key with you

465
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,499
to enter that warehouse tonight.

466
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:31,890

467
00:38:42,077 --> 00:38:44,698
 The supplier told me that there was a ventilation fan

468
00:38:44,699 --> 00:38:47,679
 that works around the clock to ensure the warehouse is well-ventilated.

469
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:52,239
This wire looks exactly the same as the connection wire of the ventilation fan.

470
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:53,960
 But the voltage it can withstand is much lower

471
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:58,260
 than the normal voltage required for the operation of a ventilation fan.

472
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,440
Let's take a look over there.

473
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,480
 Place the wire near the insulation boards.

474
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:54,000
 Once the ventilation fan resumes operation, it will be overloaded in less than a day,

475
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,639
 and the electricity leakage will cause a fire, igniting the cable.

476
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:00,799
 When that happens, we'll be waiting for your news report.

477
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:38,519
 If another girl who was even better than my sister pursued you

478
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:42,679
 when you and my sister had just started dating,   would you hesitate?

479
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:45,280
 I'd never change my decision once it's been made.

480
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,739
 Xieyi.

481
00:40:46,739 --> 00:40:53,079
 Someday, you will understand that there is true love in this world.

482
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:56,960
 Brother Minghao. Thank you.

483
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:04,239
 Thank you, Brother Minghao.

484
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:07,159
 I promised A'Yan I would get that tooth removed.

485
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:09,000
 A'Yan was right.

486
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,480
 Medicine won't solve the root of the problem.

487
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,079
 I should have removed this wisdom tooth a long time ago.

488
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,939
 Brother Minghao, thank you for your medicine.

489
00:41:16,939 --> 00:41:19,757
 You don't have to go through the trouble anymore.

490
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,019
 Actually, I've moved in with A'Yan.

491
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:39,540
 Xieyi, after tomorrow,

492
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:44,479
 I will make you leave Li Zeliang and return to me for good.

00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,970
♫  I need you, I love you  ♫

494
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:52,550
♫  I'll brave the waves for you  ♫

495
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:58,670
♫  You don't have to be brave all the time  ♫

496
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:01,890
♫  Please believe that I am by your side  ♫

497
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:08,640
♫  Ever and after  ♫

498
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:22,080

499
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,890
♫   Halfway through the journey on the train,   ♫

500
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:31,710
♫   a new passenger takes a seat   ♫

501
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:35,840
♫   The bells on the platform are ringing   ♫

502
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,410
♫   I wave my hands to see the passengers off   ♫

503
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:42,240
♫   With a one-way ticket stub in your hand   ♫

504
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,960
♫   you've embarked on a journey to happiness   ♫

505
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,360
♫   I didn't save your contact information   ♫

506
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,720
♫   But in my heart, I secretly ask   ♫

507
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,470
♫   How have you been lately?   ♫

508
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:56,350
♫   How's it going with him?   ♫

509
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:59,860
♫   I bet his temper is better than mine   ♫

510
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:03,940
♫   He's better at guessing your complicated thoughts   ♫

511
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:07,640
♫   Does he hold you when you're sad?   ♫

512
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,620
♫   How have you been lately?   ♫

513
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,450
♫   Everything must be going well   ♫

514
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:15,480
♫   Do you want to hear what I haven't said?   ♫

515
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:22,870
♫   Do lyrics of love songs stir up your emotions and recall all of our memories?   ♫

516
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:27,640
♫   It doesn't seem to be difficult   ♫

517
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:55,340
♫   How have you been lately?   ♫

518
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,180
♫   How's it going with him?   ♫

519
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,890
♫   You and fate have not given me an answer   ♫

520
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:04,910
♫   The price of growing up is like a pile of bargaining chip   ♫

521
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:08,660
♫   The wager is who can let go first   ♫

522
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,510
♫   How have you been lately?   ♫

523
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:12,490
♫   How's it going with him?   ♫

524
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:16,760
♫   Life is not as complicated as I thought   ♫

525
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:21,010
♫   Silence is the best that I can do   ♫

526
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:23,950
♫   Whatever pain and suffering may come,   ♫

527
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:28,390
♫   I'm not afraid at all   ♫

528
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:37,510
