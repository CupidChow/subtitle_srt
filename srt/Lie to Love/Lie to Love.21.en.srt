Dr. Wu.

20
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,879
It's about Yan's leg.

21
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,759
I have some questions.

22
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,719
I'm listening.

23
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,719
It's been over two years
since the amputation.

24
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,400
But Yan's leg

25
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,000
still hurts very often.

26
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,759
Why is that?

27
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,080
There are two reasons
why Mr. Li often experience

28
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,240
the pain.

29
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,280
One of them is known
as the phantom limb.

30
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,039
It's a form of pain

31
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,319
caused by psychological conditions.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,560
Even with modern medicine,

33
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,599
it's still hard to cure it.

34
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,159
The other one

35
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,319
is caused by swelling.

36
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:35,759
Swelling?

37
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:36,800
After the amputation,

38
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,159
the limb will undergo rapid atrophy.

39
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,039
After the rapid decline
of muscle function,

40
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,719
blood circulation will be affected,

41
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,520
so is the flow of lymph.

42
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:46,639
Let me put it this way.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,680
The lower half of the body must support
the weight of the body.

44
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:53,039
At the same time, the weight
is also exerted on the prosthetic limb.

45
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,840
It's harder for blood

46
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,879
to flow back into his heart.

47
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,599
These two are the main causes

48
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,400
of the swelling.

49
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,919
The pain

50
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,520
is very agonizing.

51
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,680
If it gets worse...

52
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,280
What if it gets worse?

53
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:07,719
He can't use the prosthetic limb?

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,199
If it gets worse,

55
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,120
the only solution

56
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,759
is to amputate further up the leg.

57
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,479
He will undergo another amputation.

58
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,919
What can we do to prevent that?

59
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,240
Reduce the use of the prosthetic limb.

60
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,319
Try using a wheelchair instead.

61
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,000
Reduce the abrasion and pressure between

62
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,120
the amputated part and prosthetic limb.

63
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,479
Mr. Li is very strong-willed.

64
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,520
He dislikes the use of a wheelchair.

65

You have quite a sense

176
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,279
of justice.

177
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,079
I simply help

178
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:24,759
however I can.

179
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,920
I was told Liu Ah Wei

180
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,120
also got legal aid for Xiao Xiao.

181
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
Did Li Xia tell you that?

182
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,000
Or did Xiao Xiao tell you?

183
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,879
Mr. Xie, do you know Liu Ah Wei?

184
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:48,800
It's been too long,

185
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,360
I don't remember all the details.

186
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,120
But after you left that day,

187
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,160
I saw Liu Ah Wei's photo

188
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,720
at Li Xia's house.

189
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:55,639
I must say,

190
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,240
he did look quite familiar.

191
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:00,560
What is it?

192
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,680
Does Xiao Xiao

193
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,639
need legal aid to defend

194
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,680
her civil right?

195
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:05,920
Let me know.

196
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,120
I can help.

197
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:10,519
It's nothing.

198
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:12,920
All right,

199
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,680
thank you for the tea.

200
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:16,720
I have an appointment with my client.

201
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,680
I should get going.

202
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:18,920
Wait, Mr. Li.

203
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,839
Could you

204
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,680
pass this medicine to Xie Yi?

205
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,319
She must be running low on it.

206
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,120
She's been taking this medicine.

207
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,000
It works wonders.

208
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,919
It does.

209
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,720
However, it only subdues
the pain temporarily.

210
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,399
Unless we find a cure,

211
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:48,399
Xie Yi will be dependent
on the medicine.

212
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:49,440
If she takes the medicine

213
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,559
for every toothache,

214
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,200
Xie Yi will forget

215
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,360
that what she really needs

216
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,720
isn't a painkiller.

217
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,799
She should remove

218
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:59,240
her aching wisdom tooth.

219
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,000
Perhaps you don't know her

220
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,440
the way I do.

221
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,919
She is terrified of dental extraction.

222
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:07,360
Is that so?

223
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:11,120
I should really have a word with her

224
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,039
regarding the matter.

225
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,679
As for the medicine,

226
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,759
you can keep it for now.

227
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:18,799
I must go now.

228
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:38,320
(Li Ze Liang,)

229
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,960
(you started this war.)

230
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:48,370
[Incoming call: Shi Chu Chu]

231
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:00,000
Xie Yi.

232
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,759
Does your tooth still hurt?

233
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,759
No.

234
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,440
I took the medicine.

235
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,080
You need to ease up on the antibiotic.

236
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:11,960
It's bad

237
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,240
for your health.

238
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,399
Trust me.

239
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,879
You should get

240
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,879
your wisdom tooth removed.

241
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,840
But I'm really scared.

242
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,159
Unless you tackle the root cause,

243
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,519
the problem

244
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,159
will never stop bothering you.

245
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,600
It's not hurting anymore.

246
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,480
Let's see how it goes next time.

247
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:42,039
What is this chair doing here?

248
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,440
I can move it out for you.

249
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,720
You can fall if you bump into it.

250
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,720
I put it there on purpose.

251
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,879
I can't

252
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,200
put on the prosthetic
when I take a shower.

253
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:51,639
I can use the chair

254
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,039
as support.

255
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:06,399
Ms. Shi.

256
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,639
Mr. Xie.

257
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:09,159
I'm sorry

258
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:09,799
you have to

259
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,799
come all the way here at night.

260
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:12,080
I always see to

261
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,120
the job you give me.

262
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,440
These are the contracts

263
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,519
that involved collection issues.

264
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:22,440
I need your

265
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:23,440
legal department to sort them out.

266
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:24,159
Sure.

267
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,799
You could come have

268
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:27,559
waited until tomorrow.

269
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,840
I need to spend some time
with Xie Qing tomorrow.

270
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,840
She loves drawing,

271
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,399
so I'm taking her out
to sketch some scenery.

272
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,240
Your fiancee is very fortunate

273
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:35,759
to have met you.

274
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,679
Mr. Li is also very fortunate

275
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:39,240
to have a confidant

276
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,039
such as yourself.

277
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:43,799
What?

278
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,440
Ms. Shi.

279
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:46,879
Stop lying to yourself.

280
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,759
You work overtime until late at night

281
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:50,399
because you are using the job

282
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,600
to ease your pain.

283
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,639
Mr. Xie,

284
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,000
your job is to finish

285
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:57,480
the tasks I give you.

286
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:58,679
My personal life

287
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,360
is none of your concern.

288
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,360
Ms. Shi.

289
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:02,720
We've

290
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:04,159
known each other for a long time.

291
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,080
I've always

292
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,159
admired

293
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:07,919
your resilience.

294
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,080
If you gave up now,

295
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:11,639
that wouldn't be

296
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:12,919
the Ms. Shi I knew.

297
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:14,840
If there is nothing else

298
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,600
to discuss,

299
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,240
leave.

300
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:18,759
Your greatest qualities

301
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,200
are your charisma and capability

302
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:20,960
at work.

303
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,600
Huo Jian just got arrested.

304
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,399
Ocean Hotel suffered a huge blow.

305
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,240
Mr. Li must

306
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,120
deliver great result

307
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,320
to prove his worth

308
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:29,519
and Ocean Hotel.

309
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:30,799
If you choose

310
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,240
to help him in his cause

311
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,600
and deliver a great result,

312
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,200
he will see your worth and charisma

313
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,320
in the process.

314
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:46,679
Honestly,

315
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,320
every man would want

316
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,519
to have

317
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,320
a capable wife.

318
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:01,600
Huo Jian's arrest

319
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,639
was very satisfying,

320
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:05,279
but it left a great impact
on Ocean Hotel.

321
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:06,200
We should plan

322
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,279
for Ocean Hotel's future

323
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,360
by looking at the bigger picture.

324
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,360
Ocean Hotel

325
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,720
has two options.

326
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,720
One,

327
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,279
new hotels in foreign countries.

328
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,559
Two,

329
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:21,679
local projects.

330
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,240
Impressive,

331
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,720
ace corporate lawyer.

332
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,519
You know more than you need to.

333
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,000
I was in charge of

334
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,559
the partnership contracts.

335
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,000
If I didn't know the field,

336
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:36,159
I'd be neglecting my occupation.

337
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:41,120
So what are your thoughts on the matter?

338
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,120
New hotels

339
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,960
in foreign countries
can be a promising plan.

340
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,639
It can display Ocean Hotel's ambition
for the international market.

341
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:48,519
But for it to work,

342
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,440
you must see to it personally,

343
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:51,399
Ms. Shi.

344
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,120
You might even need to

345
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,200
live abroad,

346
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,399
away from friends and families.

347
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:00,919
What about the other plan?

348
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,960
As for the local projects,

349
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:05,279
we can focus on the Lantian Bay Resort.

350
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:06,279
It's in a strategic location

351
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,600
and yields promising profits.

352
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:08,759
Not to mention Ocean Hotel

353
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:09,720
only need a resort

354
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,159
to build a complete domain.

355
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,679
That project is only a matter of time.

356
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:14,200
The one downside

357
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:16,759
is the high cost.

358
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,320

360

520
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:29,359
How did you answer?

521
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:30,880
You took

522
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,759
better care of my father than I did.

523
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,160
What more could I ask of you?

524
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:37,160
I owed a lot to Mr. Shen.

525
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:38,359
I was returning the kindness.

526
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:39,799
By the way,

527
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,480
I ordered a steak.

528
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:42,559
Let's have lunch together.

529
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,000
There is something I must see to.

530
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,279
I can't stay too long.

531
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,200
It's all right.

532
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,880
How is your toothache?

533
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,599
I came here

534
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,920
to pass you the medicine.

535
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,200
You must have finished the last box.

536
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,279
Thank you, Ming Hao.

537
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,559
But soon enough,

538
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:01,960
I won't need the medicine anymore.

539
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,240
What do you mean?

540
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:05,920
I promised Yan

541
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:06,799
to have the tooth removed.

542
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:08,799
Are you going

543
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,160
to the dentist later?

544
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,960
Yan is right.

545
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,960
Taking medicine won't cure the pain.

546
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,400
I should have removed
the wisdom tooth long ago.

547
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,519
Ming Hao.

548
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,000
Thank you for the medicine.

549
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,599
You won't have to get it for me anymore.

550
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,440
You have my support

551
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,680
for having the courage to remove it.

552
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:31,400
By the way,

553
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:32,440
you can't have

554
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,319
solid food for a few days.

555
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,359
How about this?

556
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:35,839
Let me look after you.

557
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:36,960
It's fine.

558
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:38,000
I have Yan around.

559
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,039
He can take care of me.

560
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:40,799
I doubt that.

561
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:42,200
I used to take care of you

562
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:43,480
when we were in Germany.

563
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,279
I can do a better job than him.

564
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:50,400
Actually, I've moved into

565
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,359
Yan's place.

566
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:02,640
When was that?

567
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,079
Why didn't you tell me?

568
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,160
Yan and I think

569
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:09,319
we've wasted too much time

570
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:10,400
while we were apart.

571
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,680
We cherish each other.

572
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,559
Now that Huo Jian has been arrested,

573
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,079
I just want to spend my life

574
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,119
with the person I love.

575
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,720
What about me?

576
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:26,680
All this time

577
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,720
I've never left your side.

578
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,920
You promised to come back

579
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,039
after the investigation is over.

580
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,599
Are you

581
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,200
going to leave me forever over him?

582
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,480
I've waited for you for so long.

583
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,319
Do I mean nothing to you?

584
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:50,240
What are you talking about?

585
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:51,559
I don't get it.

586
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,160
I should get going.

587
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,799
Xie Yi.

588
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:00,440
Don't get it wrong.

589
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:01,960
I meant our bond as a family.

590
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:06,240
Ming Hao.

591
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:08,400
My sister needs you.

592
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,799
Spend more time with her.

593
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:09,960
Xie Yi.

594
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:12,599
Xie Yi!

595
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:18,640
What's on your mind?

596
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,359
You look upset

597
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,799
the whole way.

598
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,559
It's nothing.

599
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,839
Maybe the thought of tooth extraction

600
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,119
got me nervous.

601
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,960
Don't worry.

602
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:32,799
I got you the best dentist.

603
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,079
It won't hurt at all.

604
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,880
Let's go.

[United Dentist Group]

606
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:45,119
It's on the left side of the upper jaw.

607
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:46,799
Stay still.

608
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:48,039
We'll give you the anesthetic.

609
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:48,920
Don't be afraid.

610
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:50,319
I'm right here

611

Excuse me,

613
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:54,559
that is my seat.

614
00:24:56,759 --> 00:24:57,279
Sorry.

615
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,240
I'll stand right here.

616
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,319

Sorry.

620

Sorry.

621
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:17,279
We need you to leave

622
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:18,599
so we can carry out our work.

623
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,839
Sorry.

624
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,720
I'll wait outside.

625
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:30,200
Sir,

626
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:31,440
please close the door.

630
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:44,799

I've been too busy.

670
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:38,920
I overlooked so many things.

00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:20,079
What?

692
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:21,880
Don't you want to

693
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,680
grow old together with me?

694
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:25,480
That depends on your attitude.

695
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,400
By the way,

696
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,039
I almost forgot.

697
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,720
My father used to tell me

698
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:36,759
that removed teeth

699
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,119
should be tossed into the river

700
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:39,960
so I can make a wish.

701
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,359
When I was little...

702
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,599
What's wrong?

703
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:50,960
Which tooth did you remove?

704
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:52,519
An upper-jaw tooth.

705
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,000
Upper-jaw teeth go into the river,

706
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:54,839
the lower-jaw teeth go to the roof.

707
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,680
I got it right.

708
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,680
That's right.

709
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,240
But the tooth you removed
was a wisdom tooth.

710
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,839
What's wrong with it?

711
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,400
You didn't let me finish.

712
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:04,559
I said,

713
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:05,920
when I was little

714
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,319
my father told me

715
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,759
people tossed away their teeth

716
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:09,720
to make wishes.

717
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:10,960
However,

718
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,480
that's for...

719
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:15,640
For the teeth

720
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:17,640
to grow back again.

721
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,240
I got careless.

722
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:24,559
Whatever.

723
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,359
As long as my wish comes true,

724
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:27,960
I don't mind going through

725
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,799
the trouble again.

726
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:35,200
Don't worry.

727
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:37,519
I was just kidding.

728
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:39,079
I inquired the doctor.

729
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,960
Under normal circumstances,

730
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,480
a wisdom tooth

731
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,599
doesn't grow back.

732
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:45,960
That's good to know.

733
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:47,319
But what wish

734
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:48,240
did you make?

735
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:49,880
Why would you

736
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,200
go through the pain again

737
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:53,279
just to realize the wish?

738
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,400
I can't tell you just yet.

739
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,519
I'll tell you after I get well.

740
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,000
Very well.

741
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,960
But I think

742
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:04,880
I can almost guess what it is.

743
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:07,480
Don't get too confident.

744
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,640
If I didn't have
the confidence to guess,

745
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,400
how could I be our boyfriend?

746
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,640
What happened?

747
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:34,599
When did you

748
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,960
start having feelings for Xie Yi?

749
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,440
Mr. Shen,

750
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,119
Xie Yi is like

751
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:42,039
a sister to me.

752
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:43,319
You scoundrel!

753
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:45,359
If I didn't see it myself,

754
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:45,960
who knows

755
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:47,319
what could have happened?

756
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:48,920
Sorry.

757
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:51,759
I've fallen in love with her

758
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,960
long ago.

759
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,640
Now that she's returned from Germany,

760
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,200
I'm glad...

761
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:56,920
Silence!

762
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,279
You can't have such perverted thoughts

763
00:32:58,359 --> 00:32:59,160
about your sister!

764
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,559
Xie Yi is still young.

765
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:01,440
I don't want

766
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,599
you to affect her study.

767
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,200
I will never allow it!

768
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,480
Why not?

769
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,960
Am I not good enough

770
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:08,920
for her?

771
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,759
You've always known it.

772
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,759
Xie Qing likes you.

773
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:16,640
I don't want you

774
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:17,720
to affect

775
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,240
the relationships of my daughters!

776
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,720
Over the years,

777
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:22,839
Xie Qing stood by you

778
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:23,640
and supported you.

779
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,839
Do not let her down!

780
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:29,799
Is this

781
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:31,960
a gift for Xie Yi?

782
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,960
I warn you,

783
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,720
as long as I live and breathe,

784
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,039
it will never happen!

785
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,920
I know what you mean,

786
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,519
Mr. Shen.

787
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:59,880
Xie Qing is the right partner for me.

788
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:00,920
Don't worry.

789
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,519
I will take good care of her.

790
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,039
I can let it slide this time.

791
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,640
Tomorrow I am sending Xie Yi

792
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,480
back to her school in Germany.

793
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,360
You must never contact her again!

794
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:28,559
(Xie Yi.)

795
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:30,519
(I will)

796
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:31,760
(make you mine.)

797
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,880
(No one can stop me)

798
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,920
(from getting what I want.)

799
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:45,159
Mr. Huo.

800
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,440
You intoxicated me

801
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,880
and changed the sum

802
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,360
of the liquidated damage compensation.

803
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,360
You're clearly scamming me.

804
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:54,760
It's all written

805
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,000
on the contract.

806
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,519
How is it scamming?

807
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:00,760
Besides,

808
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:02,960
as long as your supply comes in time,

809
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,119
the liquidated damage

810
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,880
won't be an issue.

811
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:09,079
But...

812
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,639
I can't come up with the supply in time.

813
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:14,599
That's why I've come to you for help.

814
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,559
How is it possible?

815
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,039
Zhiwei is a massive firm.

816
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:23,639
I can't get the supply

817
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:26,039
within the time frame.

818
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:27,000
Mr. Huo.

819
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,079
We've been partners

820
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:29,039
for years.

821
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,800
Could you give me a few more weeks?

822
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,000
I assure you,

823
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,119
I'll figure out a way.

824
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:37,800
I beg of you.

825
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,440
Mr. Huo.

826
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:45,719
I beg of you!

827
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:52,280
I beg of you!

828
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,559
I beg of you!

829
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:02,480
I want the liquidated damage

830
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,360
to be paid in full sum.

831
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,079
Mr. Shen!

832
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:12,320
Xie Yi.

833
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,119
I won't give up on you.

834
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:30,590
[Ocean Hotel Corporation]

835
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:31,280
We've upgraded

836
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,110
[Booking System Upgrade]
the booking system.

837
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,559
We are making sure

838
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:36,239
no one can resell their reservations.

839
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:37,920
On the other hand,

840
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:39,519
not just Yunfeng Hotel,

841
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,239
all the hotels under
Ocean Hotel Corporation

842
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,199
have undergone

843
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,639
a thorough internal investigation.

844
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,039
The result is very apparent.

845
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:46,800
Great work.

846
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:48,480
But we cannot

847
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:49,559
dwell on

848
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:50,920
our past success.

849
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,239
After the scandal with Mr. Huo,

850
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:55,800
the market has lost its faith

851
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:57,119
in Ocean Hotel.

852
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:58,440
For the time being,

853
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,480
we need a project

854
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:01,400
that will

855
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,400
pique the market's interest.

856
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,480
Next,

857
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:07,559
I plan to focus our effort

858
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,039
on the Lantian Bay Resort.

859
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:13,039
But this project

860
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:14,280
is massive.

861
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:16,519
If we push it now,

862
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:17,760
we have to

863
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,400
mortgage all the assets
Ocean Hotel has.

864
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,880
High investment brings high returns.

865
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:25,280
I also think

866
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:27,320
[Investment Approximation and Funding]
Lantian Bay resort

867
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:29,159
will become a necessary step

868
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:30,719
for the company to make a comeback.

869
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:32,480
I've read the development proposal

870
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:34,440
written by Huo Jian.

871
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:38,239
In regards to the project cost,

872
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:39,159
many corners

873
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,480
were cut.

874
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,599
Most importantly,

875
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,599
he even planned

876
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:44,320
to save the cost of
digging underground water

877
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,960
by using artificial hot water
as hot springs.

878
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:48,920
He only wanted to fill his own pocket

879
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:50,760
and disregard the company's reputation.

880
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:53,960
Listen up.

881
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,519
We need to make a profit
when we run a business.

882
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,360
But we must never cut corners
and lie to the consumers.

883
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:00,840
Otherwise,

884
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:02,960
we'll end up

885
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:04,159
just like Huo Jian.

886
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:10,280
I'll redo

887
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,119
the development proposal.

888
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:14,119
We'll discuss it further
when it's done.

889
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,480
Dismissed.

890
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,440
Ze Liang.

891
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:26,559
What will you do

892
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,119
with Huo Jian's proposal?

893
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:29,360
I'll keep it for now.

894
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,639
It's worth keeping for reference.

895
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:34,880
As you mentioned,

896
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,559
the proposal involves

897
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,199
cutting a lot of corners

898
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:39,800
to reduce the project cost.

899
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,159
Make sure you keep it well.

900
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,519
If it got leaked

901
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,840
and raised questions,

902
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,280
we'd be in trouble.

903
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:51,760
Don't worry about it.

904
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:53,599
I'll keep it inside my home.

905
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,639
As soon as I come up
with a new proposal,

906
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:57,280
I'll dispose of it immediately.

907
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:01,800
Mr. Xie.

908
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:02,519
Ms. Shi.

909
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:03,760
Sorry for

910
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,480
the long wait.

911
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:05,800
It's all right.

912
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:07,440
I've settled

913
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:08,519
all the contracts

914
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:09,559
that involved legal disputes.

915
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,360
I brought them here for you.

916
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:12,719
That was fast.

917
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:13,920
I always finish your order

918
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:15,159
as fast as I can.

919
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,119
An ace lawyer indeed.

920
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,480
You are very efficient.

921
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:25,559
What's wrong?

922
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,039
It's nothing. I think

923
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,079
you've become

924
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,519
the vying person

925
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,360
you were before.

926
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,039
Did you heed my advice?

927
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,519
Speaking of that,

928
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,800
I should thank you

929
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,960
for the pointer.

930
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,599
I suggest Mr. Li

931
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:42,039
focus our efforts

932
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:43,599
on the Lantian Bay Resort.

933
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,960
As it turned out,

934
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:46,920
he had the same idea.

935
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:48,199
We've just decided in

936
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:49,239
the meeting.

937
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,039
I might be even busier than ever.

938
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,239
Since you're already here,

939
00:41:54,519 --> 00:41:55,360
stay for a while.

940
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,960
You helped me a great deal.

941
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,599
Let me treat you to lunch.

942
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,119
Sorry, Ms. Shi.

943
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,320
I must visit Xie Qing

944
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:02,480
at the hospital.

945
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,679
Xie Yi just extracted her wisdom tooth.

946
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,599
So she won't make it.

947
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,559
I must keep Xie Qing company.

948
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:11,599
Why would Su Xie Yi visit Xie Qing?

949
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,880
Who is she to Xie Yi?

950
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,280
I don't think

951
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,079
it's a secret anymore.

952
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,519
Xie Qing is Xie Yi's older sister.

953
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,079
Xie Yi is actually

954
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:22,679
Mr. Shen's daughter.

955
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,320
