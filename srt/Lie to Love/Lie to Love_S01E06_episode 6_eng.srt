00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:25,100
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

3
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:33,510
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

4
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:41,430
♫  And turn to face all the long lost times  ♫

5
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,270
♫  Brace the pain  ♫

6
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:51,110
♫  Let memories wake up from oceans deep  ♫

7
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,250
♫  No place to hide  ♫

8
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,450
♫  No way to run  ♫

9
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,820
♫  New dawn counts down  ♫

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,930
♫  I fight  ♫

11
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,010
♫  I cry  ♫

12
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,000
♫  I give up  ♫

13
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:15,610
♫  Memories forgotten, forsaken surround  ♫

14
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:24,030
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

15
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:32,370
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

16
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:40,850
♫  Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

17
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:49,450
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

18
00:01:49,450 --> 00:02:00,050

19
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,050

20
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:11,879

21
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,800
 Share transfer agreement.

22
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,080

23
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,239
 Does this look like your signature?

24
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,339
 It does,

25
00:02:26,339 --> 00:02:28,360
 doesn't it?

26
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,960
 Thanks to your loyal secretary, Yi Fei.

27
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,339
- Chairman Huo. 
 - Yes?

28
00:03:13,339 --> 00:03:15,170
Are you looking for me?

29
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:21,439
From now on, keep an eye on someone for me.

30
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,979
Who?

31
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:38,379
Chen Hengsheng. See you tomorrow.

32
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,070

33
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:19,770

34
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:24,199
Lawyer Xie.

35
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:26,339
- Director Zhang! It's been a while.
- It's been a while.

36
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:28,419
This lady is your...

37
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:29,780
- My family member. 
 - Hi.

38
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,739
Hi.

39
00:04:30,739 --> 00:04:32,720
I'll leave you guys be. I'll grab something to drink.

40
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,099
- Okay. 
 - Don't wander too far.

41
00:04:50,619 --> 00:04:53,140
I didn't expect you to show up this time.

42
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,270
I gave you my word, I shouldn't break it.

43
00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:01,160
Oh, where is Uncle Shi?

44
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,439
My father is busy upstairs. He'll be here soon.

45
00:05:09,299 --> 00:05:10,339
Hi, Chuchu.

46
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:13,719
- It's been a while.
- It's been a while.

47
00:05:13,719 --> 00:05:17,939
- So? 
 - Sorry, enjoy your chat. Excuse me.

48
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,040
How are you? How's your work?

49
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,240
Everything is good.

50
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,550

51
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:43,599
 If I'm not mistaken, you're not invited, Miss Su.

52
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,040
 Are you doubting the security system of Hengye, Director Li?

53
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,980
 I'm here on a legal, law-abiding ground.

54
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,819
 Why are you here?

55
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,360
 It is my private time.

56
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,959
 I can drink, enjoy tea, or even look at eye candies.

57
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:16,190
 It's none of your business.

58
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,720
- Hello, Chairman Huo. 
 - Hi.

59
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,959
- Hi, Chairman Huo. 
 - Director Liu.

60
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,590
Hello, Chairman Huo.

61
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,730
 My uncle doesn't like smarty-pants.

62
00:06:40,179 --> 00:06:42,279
 Don't let him know then.

63
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,759
- Hi, Chairman Huo. 
 - Hello.

64
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:51,319
- Uncle. 
 - You're here.

65
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:55,239
Come with me to have a drink with Uncle Shi later.

66
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:57,879
Chuchu said Uncle Shi is still in a meeting with his clients upstairs.

67
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,710
It's fine, we have time.

68
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,220
You look good today, Miss Yi.

69
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,920
- Gorgeous. 
 - Thank you.

70
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,380
 Chen Hengsheng: Chairman Huo, I have prepared snacks for you on the third floor for the work briefing.

71
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,760
I have some business to attend to. I'll see you later.

72
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,460
All right, Uncle.

73
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,600

74
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:51,399
This place and Yunfeng, which one is better?

75
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:53,570
Yunfeng, of course.

76
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,399
Yunfeng is a gold mine.

77
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:01,460
In Ocean Hotel, the only person, I trust who can fill that position

78
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,900
The person I trust to fill that position is... you.

79
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,839
Thank you for your offer, Chairman Huo.

80
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,040
Lately, I bought some odd lots on the market.

81
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,580
It's time to prepare new funds.

82
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:32,259
The wine business with Yunfeng has always been our moneymaker.

83
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:33,979
It provides regular income.

84
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:36,840
I will transfer the profit we earned lately to the designated account.

85
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,950
Of course, art objects are also another gold mine,

86
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,500
that's why I'm here.

87
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,080
I have booked an appointment with President Qin from Pinxuan Art Gallery.

88
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,679
I'll meet him at 3 PM tomorrow.

89
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:50,059
 Who is he reporting to?

90
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,520

91
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:24,400
Chairman Huo, we should go back to the party.

92
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,540
 I haven't found that person yet. But that person should be in the building.

93
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,059
Ladies and gentlemen.

94
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:31,420
I am honored to be able to invite all of you to attend this party.

95
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:37,840
Before the party begins, I would like to present a gift to the woman

96
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,600
I love the most in my life, my daughter.

97
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,200
Chuchu.

98
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:56,060
Due to work reasons, my daughter was overseas for two months.

99
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,340
As her father, I was forced to miss her birthday for the first time ever.

100
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:04,460
As such, I will make up for my beloved daughter during this party

101
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,159
and give her, her birthday gift.

102
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,159
 Great!

103
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:12,340
Please unveil it.

104
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,359
The thing I'm about to do is for your own safety.

105
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,359
Who is that girl?

106
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:57,120
Su Xieyi.

107
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,750
♫  Rain falling down from the sky  ♫

108
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:05,260
♫  Veiling the tears that are falling from my eyes  ♫

109
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,410
What is Su Xieyi doing here?

110
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:11,360
Judging from this scene, she came with Li Zeliang.

111
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,550
Chuchu will be upset now.

112
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:20,500
♫  My life begins and ends in my love for you  ♫

113
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,700
♫  Trapped in infinity  ♫

114
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,990
♫  Circle of love  ♫

115
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,630
♫  I don't know how to win your heart  ♫

116
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:33,630
♫  I don't know how to be the one for you  ♫

117
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:36,640
♫  To be good enough for you  ♫

118
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,850
♫  But you're just like a distant star  ♫

119
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,500
♫  Looking so close but yet so far  ♫

120
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,460
♫  I need to stop I need to give you up  ♫

121
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:53,120
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to use Uncle Shi's party

122
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,959
to make an announcement.

123
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:59,620
Miss Su Xieyi

124
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,719
is my girlfriend.

125
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,120
Thank you for just now.

126
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,799
Do you have any idea how risky it was?

127
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:49,700
If Chen Hengsheng finds out, he'll do anything to eliminate you.

128
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:58,499
So… are you worried about me, or are you testing me?

129
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,400
Su Xieyi.

130
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,100
Do you want to come clean or do you want me to say it?

131
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,280
Come clean about what?

132
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,600
About who you are.

133
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:12,180
Who I am?

134
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,879
I want to find out too.

135
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,320
I'll say it then.

136
00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:35,319
You can't recognize this photo, can you?

137
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,359
Chestnut, does that ring a bell?

138
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:41,859
- I don't know what you're talking about. 
 - Good.

139
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:43,360
Continue your acting.

140
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,739
Su Xieyi, you really thought I wouldn't notice if you faked your amnesia?

141
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:51,120
You pretended to be amnesiac and approached me because you thought

142
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,940
no one else in Ocean Hotel other than me knows you, right?

143
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,879
What are you trying to say?

144
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:03,240
Unfortunately, Su Xieyi, you forgot something.

145
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,740
My father has one loyal employer.

146
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:10,300
He is an old friend of your parents from more than two decades ago.

147
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,220
Without him as an eyewitness,

148
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:19,920
it'll be very hard to find out that you're the daughter of Shen Zhi Hong.

149
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,159
Fine. Bravo.

150
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:26,679
It seems like you know everything.

151
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:32,340
You must be thinking I'm the culprit who destroyed your family.

152
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,919
So originally, you approached me to investigate me?

153
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:38,220
Of course.

154
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,520
Tell me. That day when my father died,

155
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,200
what were you doing on the rooftop?

156
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,140
You saw everything?

157
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:51,999
So you pretended to be an amnesiac to get close to me.

158
00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:53,380
Why?

159
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,440
You think I'm the killer who will throw you off a building too?

160
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,540
Go ahead.

161
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,960
I would love to see your true face before I die.

162
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,519
The police already announced the truth.

163
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:06,359
Shen Zhihong committed suicide.

164
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,580
I only believe what I saw.

165
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:13,219
So I'm asking you what did you do that day on the rooftop?

166
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:41,699
Once I received the news, I rushed to the spot.

167
00:17:41,699 --> 00:17:44,299
But I was too late.

168
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,600
 Uncle Shen!

169
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,219
 I wanted to save him.

170
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:12,759
 I was so close.

171
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:27,040
Su Xieyi, you think you're the only one suffering?

172
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:32,460
You know, for the last two years, that scene

173
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,380
has also been my nightmare.

174
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:45,319
Explain the contract to me then.

175
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:49,640
I read through the contract in my father's mailbox.

176
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,240
But on the day of signing, the liquidated damages went up tenfold.

177
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,959
Ocean Hotel made my father sign an unconscionable contract.

178
00:18:57,959 --> 00:18:59,659
Sorry.

179
00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:04,620
I wasn't there when the contract was signed.

180
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:10,419
So I've also been investigating the truth behind it.

181
00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:13,300
I found that contract in the archive.

182
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,759
You weren't the signer.

183
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:18,679
And the date of signature

184
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:21,279
was when we were on the mountaintop.

185
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,890

186
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:36,040
So... am I still a suspect?

187
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:43,059
Before the truth resurfaces, everyone in Ocean Hotel is a suspect.

188
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:47,020
But I will believe you more than others.

189
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,400
Why were you at the party today?

190
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,000
I attended the party to find Chen Hengsheng.

191
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
He signed the contract.

192
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,800
He definitely knows the truth.

193
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,600
What did you find?

194
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,200
I saw him talking to someone.

195
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,500
Something about they want to use wine and art objects to make money.

196
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,000
Su Xieyi, this is Ocean Hotel's internal issue.

197
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,200
Please don't meddle in this business anymore.

198
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,800
Fine.

199
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,000
I won't meddle in Ocean Hotel's business,

200
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,800
but you can't meddle in my private business, either.

201
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,200
But you need to keep me in the loop at least

202
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,800
so that I'll know if I should stop or help you.

203
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:57,400
If you want to help me, drink with me.

204
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,800
So many things were buried in my heart.

205
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,800
It feels amazing to vent.

206
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,600
Isn't it the same for you?

207
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,600
 Hello. The number you have dialed is currently unavailable.

208
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,100
 Please try again later.

209
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,800
 Miss Su Xieyi...

210
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,100
 is my girlfriend.

211
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,490

212
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,200
You believe me

213
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,200
just because the one who signed the contract wasn't me?

214
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,200
That's not all.

215
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,200
It's also because of that day and night and

216
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,000
that photo of the starry night sky and Chestnut!

217
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,200
I didn't actually lie to you about being amnesiac.

218
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:37,200
I witness my father die in front of me.

219
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,700
It's very hard to accept the truth.

220
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,200
For half a year,

221
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,600
I kept telling myself

222
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,200
how great it'd be if I lost my memory.

223
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,500
That way, I won't remember so many painful things.

224
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,600
I dream about my father almost every night.

225
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,800
In my dream,

226
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:06,500
I see him staring at me from the stone-cold floor.

227
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,600
So no one can stop me from finding the truth.

228
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,600
It gives me a reason to live.

229
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,300
I really miss my father.

230
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,800
I miss him so much.

231
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,200
♫  Listen to the stars  ♫

232
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,800
♫  They tell me every night the stories of your past  ♫

233
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,400
♫  Your shadows, your brokenness  ♫

234
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,800
♫  I'm sorry I wasn't there for you  ♫

235
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,800
♫  Listen to my heart  ♫

236
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:49,200
♫  If I can grow a piece of feather on every scar  ♫

237
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,200
♫  Then I'd have such wings  ♫

238
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,400
♫  To fly up to the sky  ♫

239
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,200
♫  Even if I'll melt away  ♫

240
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,700
♫  To give you love  ♫

241
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,400
I told you to follow Su Xieyi.

242
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,800
She's at the party, and you didn't know?

243
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,800
Sorry, Chairman Huo.

244
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,000
Last night, my father's condition deteriorated

245
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,600
so I went to the hospital.

246
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,400
What a filial son you are.

247
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,700
It is negligence on my part.

248
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,200
But don't worry, Chairman Huo.

249
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,800
I will guarantee you that I will quit everything else just to keep an eye on her.

250
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,200
Leave.

251
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,500
Okay.

252
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,600
Do you truly believe that Su Xieyi

253
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,400
was having a date with Li Zeliang at the party?

254
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,300
What do you think about that art piece?

255
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,600
It's good.

256
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,600
But it's a counterfeit.

257
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,200
What's fake can never be true.

258
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,600
Observe patiently.

259
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,400
The flaw will reveal itself.

260
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,000
You're awake.

261
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,000
Go wash up yourself.

262
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,600
I bought you a new toothbrush.

263
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,900
Once you're done, have breakfast.

264
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,400
Okay.

265
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,800
I know you just came back from abroad so

266
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,000
I made something western.

267
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,700
Sit here.

268
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,800
Have a glass of milk.

269
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,700
It's easier on your stomach.

270
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
You're too nice.

271
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,700
Are you sending me away after I finish this meal?

272
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,200
I would love to

273
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,200
but now is not a good time.

274
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:13,200
Don't forget you're also now my girlfriend.

275
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,700
That's easy.

276
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,800
Just dump me again.

277
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,600
Or I can dump you.

278
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,739
That might work.

279
00:27:21,739 --> 00:27:27,000
But... if we break up straight after we go public,

280
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,200
people will get suspicious.

281
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,400
Let's act for a few more days then.

282
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,400
After all, we have been acting in front of each other.

283
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:45,600
Well... I was quite hammered yesterday.

284
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,000
Did I say something?

285
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Yes.

286
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,400
What did I say?

287
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:57,100
You said something that you'll definitely regret

288
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,900
if you make me say it out loud now.

289
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,400
Enough. Good.

290
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,800
I don't want to know. They are not that important.

291
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,300
Okay then.

292
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,800
Let's forget about yesterday then.

293
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,700
Let's talk about our future.

294
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:21,500
At the moment, we have to keep pretending to be a couple.

295
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,800
Don't worry. I will work with you.

296
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:27,799
Don't make it sound like you are forced.

297
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,400
It is I who have to assist you.

298
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,400
However, I will continue my investigation.

299
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,900
What? Feeling guilty?

300
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:50,600
You can continue but you have to promise me that whatever you do,

301
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,400
you have to inform me beforehand.

302
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,200
I can inform you but please don't be a hindrance.

303
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,600
To our deal.

304
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,800
Just a kind reminder from me.

305
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:19,600
In the office, everyone will have their eyes on us.

306
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,000
Make sure your performance is believable.

307
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
You too.

308
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,300
Is it delicious?

309
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,000
Not bad.

310
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,600
Which one do you like?

311
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,300
I like the waffles.

312
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,100
How do you know I like waffles?

313
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,100
You said it last night.

314
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,200
For real?

315
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,400
Of course. It's on the internet.

316
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,200
What are you guys talking about so early?

317
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,800
- You don't know? 
 - What?

318
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:04,239
Xieyi and Director Li are an item now.

319
00:30:04,239 --> 00:30:05,799
For real?

320
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:07,400
You still can't see it?

321
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,160
That haute couture dress is a gift from Director Li.

322
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,280
Morning. I bought you girls coffee.

323
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,079
No need, Xieyi.

324
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,279
We should take turns buying coffee.

325
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:18,700
Take turns? No. It'll be my treat now.

326
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,540
No need to be shy.

327
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,319
Come. Your coffee.

328
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:24,319
Thanks.

329
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,059
Your coffee. Sugar with milk.

330
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:37,820
Thanks, Xieyi.

331
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,620
What's the matter?

332
00:30:41,619 --> 00:30:43,759
Well, Xieyi.

333
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:47,240
I used to bad-mouth Director Li in front of you.

334
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,850
Please don't take them to heart.

335
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,520
All of us look up to him, actually.

336
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,800
But you know me, I speak before I think.

337
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,980
Please forgive me.

338
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:59,039
It's okay. It's not like you're wrong about him.

339
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,300
He does have a poker face.

340
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,200
But I like it.

341
00:31:04,899 --> 00:31:06,799
What do you like?

342
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:07,920
Secretary Yi.

343
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,720
What? I can't listen to gossip now?

344
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:19,839
Xieyi, I was there when he made the announcement yesterday.

345
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:22,139
Congratulations.

346
00:31:22,139 --> 00:31:23,839
Thank you.

347
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:26,640
However, I'm curious.

348
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,119
How did you make Director Li fall in love with you?

349
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:31,079
- I'm curious too. 
 - Me too.

350
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:32,559
- What did you do? 
 - Tell us what happened.

351
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,120
How?

352
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,179
Well...

353
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,179
Uncle, Xieyi asked me to bring you this because she wants you to have a taste.

354
00:31:43,179 --> 00:31:45,260
How thoughtful of her.

355
00:31:46,459 --> 00:31:51,260
Uncle. Since I publicly announced my relationship with her,

356
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:54,300
I hope you can do us a favor.

357
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:58,080
Why? You want her back?

358
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,540
I have tons of things to take care of in my office.

359
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:06,540
Xieyi has learned a lot in the General Manager's Office.

360
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,060
She should be able to help me in that regard.

361
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:12,439
Sure. It's not like she has started here officially anyway.

362
00:32:12,439 --> 00:32:14,800
Thanks, Uncle.

363
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,880
But Zeliang,

364
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,240
why didn't you tell me earlier that Su Xieyi is your girlfriend?

365
00:32:22,419 --> 00:32:26,319
Xieyi and I used to date each other two years ago.

366
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:30,379
And this time, she wants to rekindle our relationship.

367
00:32:30,379 --> 00:32:34,459
I also decided quite recently to give us a fresh start.

368
00:32:35,459 --> 00:32:38,160
I didn't know there was more to your story.

369
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,540
But Zeliang, I know that two years ago,

370
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:48,039
Miss Su was diagnosed with amnesia.

371
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:50,260
Has she recovered from it?

372
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,840
I know several renowned psychiatrists.

373
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,880
If you need them, I can introduce them to you.

374
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,559
Thanks, Uncle.

375
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:00,780
There's no need for that.

376
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,459
Xieyi has made full recovery.

377
00:33:02,459 --> 00:33:06,300
That's why she came back to find me.

378
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,559
She has sacrificed a lot for me.

379
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,200
Did she apply to Ocean Hotel for you?

380
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,920
It's just one of the things she did.

381
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,740
Also, I need to

382
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,740
tell you about something.

383
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,400
What thing?

384
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:31,920
Xieyi confided to me that she's behind the video scandal.

385
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:36,059
When she was staying in the hotel, she noticed something suspicious about Secretary Lin.

386
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:39,536
And it's something that will tarnish my reputation

387
00:33:39,537 --> 00:33:43,939
so she did that in a fit of rage.

388
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,200
She did it?

389
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:57,419
She's that reckless.

390
00:33:57,419 --> 00:33:59,479
Which is why I broke up with her.

391
00:33:59,479 --> 00:34:01,740
She did a great job.

392
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,760
A parasite like Lin Tai should have been eliminated earlier on.

393
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:10,460
Thank you for understanding, Uncle.

394
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:17,519
But Zeliang, how did Su Xieyi and you meet?

395
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,999
It might sound preposterous. I was rock-climbing back then.

396
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:34,320
When I almost reached the top, she almost pushed me off the cliff.

397
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,360
What? You thought Director Li was a wild boar?

398
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,639
That's ridiculous.

399
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,160
Yes.

400
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:46,259
But when I noticed how good-looking he was, I decided not to let him go.

401
00:34:46,259 --> 00:34:47,765
- And then? 
 - And then...

402
00:34:47,765 --> 00:34:50,289
And then

403
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:53,280
I find an excuse to make him stay.

404
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,360
We admired the night sky and took a lot of photos.

405
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,440
Taking photos under a starry sky?

406
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,920
That's so romantic!

407
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,300
I want to look at the photos. Do you guys want to look at the photos?

408
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,320
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

409
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,480
I do have the photos,

410
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,940
but you asked for it, okay?

411
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:18,679
This looks like the poster for a romantic drama!

412
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,599
So romantic.

413
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,879
Yes.

414
00:35:33,879 --> 00:35:35,840
He did go rock-climbing that day.

415
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:41,260
And he looked very different from now two years ago.

416
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:47,119
Their love story is identical, even the details.

417
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,980
In that case, joining Ocean Hotel, going to his place,

418
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,519
and ousting Lin Tai all make sense now.

419
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,800
But I still feel something's off.

420
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,500
Why?

421
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,940
Because it's too logical.

422
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:15,079
The calmer the sea, the more ferocious the current.

423
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:17,380
I still don't know

424
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:22,699
the other facade of my nephew

425
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,900
when I'm not around.

426
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:29,060
You're saying he wanted Su Xieyi back?

427
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,840
I don't have a strong reason to keep her.

428
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:34,699
Right.

429
00:36:35,299 --> 00:36:38,100
We just need to be patient.

430
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:41,480
The flaw will reveal itself.

431
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:45,400
Just keep looking.

432
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,400
Noted.

433
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,380
I ruined your birthday yesterday.

434
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,599
Sorry.

435
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:12,219
You and her... When did it happen?

436
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,800
Two years ago.

437
00:37:23,259 --> 00:37:26,360
That's good. You found yourself a relationship that suits you.

438
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,619
I'm happy for you.

439
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:33,280
But you never told Oscar and I.

440
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,239
Are we not good enough for you?

441
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:36,540
Chuchu.

442
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:40,039
I'm sure you know Oscar and you are my two best friends.

443
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:43,139
I never wanted to hide anything from you two.

444
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:44,919
It's just that

445
00:37:46,779 --> 00:37:50,679
you know how I've been for the past two years.

446
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,840
A relationship wasn't what I wanted.

447
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,399
So, you asked me to fire her last time

448
00:37:58,399 --> 00:38:00,440
because you were worried that it might affect your work

449
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,299
or was it something else?

450
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,000
You know, it's an office romance.

451
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,019
We have to be more cautious.

452
00:38:12,019 --> 00:38:13,299
Right.

453
00:38:13,299 --> 00:38:15,480
I'll accept this explanation.

454
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,030
But the way and the place you made your announcement

455
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:22,060
pissed me off.

456
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:29,061
I'm sorry, Miss Shi. I apologize to you once more.

457
00:38:29,061 --> 00:38:31,960
I didn't know it would turn out like this.

458
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:35,900
If it's an apology, it still lacks sincerity.

459
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,100
All right then.

460
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,139
Every year, we gather around and have a meal for your birthday.

461
00:38:39,139 --> 00:38:41,779
I ruined the mood for you yesterday.

462
00:38:41,779 --> 00:38:43,759
I'll make up for you.

463
00:38:43,759 --> 00:38:45,980
Since we're already here anyway, let's have lunch together?

464
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,580
Sure.

465
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,339
 Su Xieyi: Lunch together?

466
00:39:01,467 --> 00:39:03,285
 No, thanks.

467
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,719
 Emergency!

468
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:12,259
 If I have lunch with this bunch of nosy colleagues, my soul will leave my body.

469
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,800
 Deal with it yourself.

470
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,619
If you're busy, we can pick another day.

471
00:39:27,619 --> 00:39:30,659
I just realized I have a video conference.

472
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,580
Okay then.

473
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:38,260
Do your work. I'll make up for you next time.

474
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,019
Why are you this late?

475
00:39:58,019 --> 00:40:00,239
Didn't we agree to have lunch together at noon?

476
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,600
Let's have Japanese.

477
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,200
The Japanese restaurant below the hotel is pretty good.

478
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,000
Let's go.

479
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Sure. Anything you like.

480
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,100
I'm off for lunch. Bye.

481
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,000
Let's go.

482
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,800
Please understand my predicament.

483
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,800
I've been explaining to them for the entire morning. My throat is parched.

484
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,800
If I have lunch with them this noon, my jaw will dislocate.

485
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,800
You have to deal with it.

486
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,000
No.

487
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,600
They bombard me with so many questions.

488
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,900
What if I slipped and said something wrong?

489
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Your body language suggests that we're strangers.

490
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,800
Please change it.

491
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,900
Excuse me.

492
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,600
Here. Thanks.

493
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,000
Your food has been served. Bon appétit.

494
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,300
Thanks.

495
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,800
I don't like foie gras.

496
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,800
Me neither. But it's in the lunch set.

497
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,200
We have to make do.

498
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,900
When it comes to food, I never make do.

499
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,400
What a coincidence.

500
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,700
- Uncle. 
 - Chairman Huo.

501
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,200
I mean... Uncle.

502
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,200
- Care to join us? 
 - Please do.

503
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,900
No. I wouldn't want to disrupt your romantic lunch.

504
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,400
- Please, sit down. 
 - Let's sit.

505
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,200
Zeliang, I thought you never liked foie gras.

506
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,100
Xieyi ordered it. She loves it.

507
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,500
Right?

508
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,400
I'm too old for this.

509
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,300
Enjoy your lunch.

510
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,800
- Delicious? 
 - Didn't I say I don't like foie gras?

511
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,400
Huo Jian is here to spy on us.

512
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,300
Can't you see it?

513
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:58,200
Fine. In that case, I'll return you the same favor.

514
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,200
Delicious?

515
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,500
Very.

516
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,700
Very delicious.

517
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,200
Here, Xieyi.

518
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,500
Okra, your favorite.

519
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,400
I'll have to disappoint you.

520
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,200
I am not afraid of spicy food.

521
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,400
- What are you doing? 
 - Come, Zeliang.

522
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,300
You crossed a line.

523
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:12,200
Zeliang, it's just a piece of sushi.

524
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,200
No need to get so emotional.

525
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,000
Stop crying.

526
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,500
Stupid wasabi. It's so spicy.

527
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,600
 Art objects are also another gold mine.

528
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,200
 I have booked an appointment with President Qin from Pinxuan Art Gallery.

529
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,900
 I'll meet him at 3 PM tomorrow.

530
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,300
One hour and a half left.

531
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,200
Miss Su.

532
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:13,000
♫  I need you, I love you  ♫

533
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,700
♫  I'll brave the waves for you  ♫

534
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:20,000
♫  You don't have to be brave all the time  ♫

535
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,500
♫  Please believe that I am by your side  ♫

536
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:31,000
♫  Ever and after  ♫

537
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:43,000

538
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,800
 ''How Have You Been Lately?'' - Silence Wang

539
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,800
♫   Halfway through the journey on the train,   ♫

540
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:55,600
♫   a new passenger takes a seat   ♫

541
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:59,800
♫   The bells on the platform are ringing   ♫

542
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,200
♫   I wave my hands to see the passengers off   ♫

543
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:06,000
♫   With a one-way ticket stub in your hand   ♫

544
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,800
♫   you've embarked on a journey to happiness   ♫

545
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,200
♫   I didn't save your contact information   ♫

546
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,400
♫   But in my heart, I secretly ask   ♫

547
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,200
♫   How have you been lately?   ♫

548
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,200
♫   How's it going with him?   ♫

549
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:24,000
♫   I bet his temper is better than mine   ♫

550
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,800
♫   He's better at guessing your complicated thoughts   ♫

551
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:31,600
♫   Does he hold you when you're sad?   ♫

552
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,600
♫   How have you been lately?   ♫

553
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,600
♫   Everything must be going well   ♫

554
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,400
♫   Do you want to hear what I haven't said?   ♫

555
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:46,800
♫   Do lyrics of love songs stir up your emotions and recall all of our memories?   ♫

556
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,500
♫   It doesn't seem to be difficult   ♫

557
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,200
♫   How have you been lately?   ♫

558
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,300
♫   How's it going with him?   ♫

559
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,900
♫   You and fate have not given me an answer   ♫

560
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:28,800
♫   The price of growing up is like a pile of bargaining chip   ♫

561
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,600
♫   The wager is who can let go first   ♫

562
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,400
♫   How have you been lately?   ♫

563
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,400
♫   Everything must be going well   ♫

564
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,600
♫   Life is not as complicated as I thought   ♫

565
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,800
♫   Silence is the best that I can do   ♫

566
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,000
♫   Whatever pain and suffering may come,   ♫

567
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
♫   I'm not afraid at all   ♫

568
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:01,460
