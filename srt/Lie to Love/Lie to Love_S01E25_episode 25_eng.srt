00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:13,930

2
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:25,000
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,450
♫  Still haunts me now and then in quiet nights  ♫

4
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:41,430
♫  And turn to face all the long lost times  ♫

5
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,370
♫  Brace the pain  ♫

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:51,210
♫  Let memories wake up from oceans deep  ♫

7
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,250
♫  No place to hide  ♫

8
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,450
♫  No way to run  ♫

9
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,820
♫  New dawn counts down  ♫

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,930
♫  I fight  ♫

11
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,110
♫  I cry  ♫

12
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,600
♫  I give up  ♫

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:15,510
♫  Memories forgotten, forsaken surround  ♫

14
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:23,930
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

15
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:32,370
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

16
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:40,950
♫  Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

17
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:49,520
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

18
00:01:49,520 --> 00:02:00,150

19
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,950

20
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,279
Xieqing.

21
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,560
I must admit that I did have feelings for Xieyi.

22
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,459
But ever since I lost you, I realized

23
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:21,219
that you are the one I loved the most.

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,080
There is no one in this world who loves me and treats me better than you.

25
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,599
And there is no one who cares more for me

26
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,739
and would do anything for me in this world than you.

27
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,560
Just as how I protect you, you would protect me too, right?

28
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,860
Hello? Mr. Li? You were right.

29
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,580
Xie Minghao moved into a new apartment in the east of the city.

30
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,480
I suspect Shen Xieqing lives here too.

31
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,719
He went through all that effort to hide her.

32
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:08,400
He must be worried that she would let something slip.

33
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,481
That's right.

34
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:13,499
The more he doesn't want us to see her, the more certain it is that he is hiding something.

35
00:03:13,499 --> 00:03:17,899
Xie Minghao must be involved in what happened that year.

36
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,519
No.

37
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,420
I'm worried he'll harm Xieqing.

38
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,339
We must get Xieqing away from there immediately.

39
00:03:23,339 --> 00:03:27,000
Xie Minghao hasn't left since he went inside last night.

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,479
Should I go in and check?

41
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,539
Don't alert him. I'll think of a way.

42
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:32,879
All right.

43
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,420
Chuchu.

44
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,560
Chairman Li, I'm back.

45
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,039
Why are you standing there?

46
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,859
Have a seat.

47
00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:11,219
Director Shi, weren't you on break?

48
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:12,839
You came back so soon.

49
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:15,400
Did you not want me to come back so soon?

50
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,079
Of course, I want to you be back soon.

51
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,158
Without you around, many things need to be taken care of but lack someone capable of handling them.

52
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,979
We have yet to decide on a supplier for the construction materials of Lantian Bay Resort.

53
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:29,140
How could I enjoy my break?

54
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,439
So I came back to work early.

55
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,999
Perfect.

56
00:04:33,859 --> 00:04:37,360
We've decided on a supplier for the external wall insulation materials.

57
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,860
Take a look.

58
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,940
Already?

59
00:04:43,179 --> 00:04:45,820
This is a supplier with good credentials.

60
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,740
Xieyi, chose it.

61
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,700
That's good.

62
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,839
You can't go wrong with Miss Su's choice.

63
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,260
Chuchu.

64
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:06,619
You know I don't wish for there to be any misunderstandings between you and Xieyi.

65
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,099
Actually, I've thought about it over the past few days.

66
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:12,559
You were right.

67
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,900
Even if I don't believe Su Xieyi, I should have faith in you.

68
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,080
Besides, there were many suspicious aspects regarding the incident with He Jianghua.

69
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,859
I shouldn't have acted on impulse and questioned her.

70
00:05:23,859 --> 00:05:26,820
That's the Shi Chuchu I know.

71
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,439
Thank you.

72
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,300
I'll get back to work then.

73
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,679
Oh, right.

74
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:44,240
There's an important contract that needs to be drawn up this afternoon.

75
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,800
I need you to invite Lawyer Xie over.

76
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,200
All right.

77
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,659
Xieqing, have some porridge.

78
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,799
Be good. Have some.

79
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,239
Xieqing is a good girl.

80
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,280
The wedding dress you drew is beautiful. Did you know?

81
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,080
Not being able to help you put on your wedding dress myself has always been one of my regrets.

82
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,000
You must tell me when you regain your consciousness.

83
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,559
I will make it up to you.

84
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,860
Come on. Have some more.

85
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,760
Hold on.

86
00:06:58,052 --> 00:07:00,020
Hello? Director Shi? Is something the matter?

87
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,120
Lawyer Xie, I have an urgent agreement that needs to be drawn up.

88
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,519
Can you come over to the company?

89
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,759
 Now?

90
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,199
Yes. Now.

91
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,939
All right. I'll be right there.

92
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,500
Xieqing.

93
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,779
I need to go out for a bit.

94
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:18,080
Stay home and wait for me to come back.

95
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,060
Xieqing, I'm leaving. Stay at home and be good.

96
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,720
Minghao.

97
00:07:49,859 --> 00:07:50,960
Minghao.

98
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,159
I am the one you love the most, right?

99
00:07:58,119 --> 00:08:00,200
You are the one I love the most.

100
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,339
Mr. Li, Xie Minghao has left.

101
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:31,820
 Follow him immediately.

102
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,360
Don't give him a chance to turn back.

103
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,230
Keep me informed of his whereabouts.

104
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,819
- I'll head over right away. 
 - Yes.

105
00:08:36,819 --> 00:08:38,839
 Xie Minghao lives on the 16th floor of the first building.

106
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,639
 I don't know his exact apartment number.

107
00:10:33,398 --> 00:10:36,360
Hurry! Get the fire extinguisher! Hurry!

108
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,160
- Quickly! 
 - Okay.

109
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:45,140
Hello? Is anyone home?

110
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:48,259
I'm from property management. Your smoke detector was sounded.

111
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:50,040
Is anyone home?

112
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,660
- Split up and look for the source of the fire. 
 - All right.

113
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:05,940
Over here.

114
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,960
Who's there?

115
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:28,900
Hello?

116
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,139
 Hello? Mr. Xie? I'm from property management.

117
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:35,560
 Your apartment's smoke detector was sounded earlier, so we came to check on it, but there wasn't a fire.

118
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,640
But when I opened the door, a woman ran out of your apartment.

119
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,780
That is my sister. She is mentally unstable.

120
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,920
But it's all right. She would be somewhere nearby.

121
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,479
I'll go and look for her.

122
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,620
 Li Zeliang

123
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,199
Hello?

124
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:44,720
 Hello, Mr. Li Zeliang.

125
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,800
 This is Shen Xieqing.

126
00:12:49,859 --> 00:12:52,159
Director Shi. This is a supplier

127
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:54,840
I found for the external wall insulation materials when you were away.

128
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,600
These are their information and the procurement contract I drew up.

129
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:07,279
Is there a problem?

130
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:11,579
Miss Su. I've given it some thought over the past few days.

131
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:13,400
Zeliang was right.

132
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,439
There are many suspicious aspects concerning the issue.

133
00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:21,359
Perhaps, I was too stressed, so I lashed out at you.

134
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,760
You wouldn't take it to heart, would you?

135
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,120
Of course not.

136
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,360
You were only considering the best for the company. I understand.

137
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:30,161
Thank you.

138
00:13:30,161 --> 00:13:32,440
However, I still have the same words for you.

139
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,999
Do well at work.

140
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:36,980
Yes, Director Shi.

141
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,919
I'll leave the contract with you.

142
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:43,640
If there aren't any problems, we can proceed with the procedures.

143
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,200
All right.

144
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,980
I'll take a good look at it.

145
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:52,439
I have to admit that you are quite efficient.

146
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:53,679
Go ahead and do your best.

147
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:54,979
Thank you, Director Shi.

148
00:13:54,979 --> 00:13:57,040
I'll get back to work then.

149
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,100

150
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,280
Hello, Chairman Li.

151
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,980
You've actually recovered?

152
00:14:36,939 --> 00:14:39,959
It's as if I had a dream.

153
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:42,619
And now, it's finally time to wake up.

154
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,440
This is great.

155
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,439
Xieyi would be overjoyed to know about this.

156
00:14:50,439 --> 00:14:52,160
I'll give her a call.

157
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,020
Wait, Chairman Li. Don't call her yet.

158
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:56,900
Why not?

159
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,800
Has...

160
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,980
Xieyi been well?

161
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,100
You'll know when you see her.

162
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:09,339
I called you because I don't want to see her.

163
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,800
I let her down.

164
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,240
I'm embarrassed to see her.

165
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:26,199
Is it because of Zhiwei?

166
00:15:26,819 --> 00:15:29,839
You must have found out a lot about what happened back then, I'm sure.

167
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,839
Pardon my bluntness,

168
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:36,040
but do you know the K of Spades?

169
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,439
Of course.

170
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,259
I am K of Spades.

171
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,459
I'm the one behind everything

172
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,700
that happened to Zhiwei back then.

173
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,400
From what I know,

174
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,579
Uncle Shen had always treated you well back then.

175
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:08,600
Why did you do those things?

176
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,100
Yes.

177
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:14,479
He had always treated me well.

178
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:16,759
But all along,

179
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:19,920
I had felt insecure and inferior

180
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:22,499
because I was adopted.

181
00:16:22,499 --> 00:16:26,639
When I was young, I was jealous of how much love Xieyi got from our father.

182
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,600
When I grew up,

183
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:33,140
I was jealous because Xieyi owns Zhiwei.

184
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,499
No matter how much effort I put in, how hard I worked,

185
00:16:36,499 --> 00:16:41,200
in the end, all I did would only be for her.

186
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,300
Our father would never hand Zhiwei to me.

187
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:49,179
All of this happened

188
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,720
only because Xieyi was his biological daughter.

189
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,099
And I wasn't.

190
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:02,700
So you hollowed out Zhiwei

191
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:07,040
and had Huo Jian set a trap.

192
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:19,480
But I never thought that after finding out everything I did,

193
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,719
my father didn't blame me...

194
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,440
He even sacrificed himself to protect me.

195
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,600
All along...

196
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,599
All this time, he had treated me like his own biological daughter.

197
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,400
Yet, I didn't trust him.

198
00:17:41,219 --> 00:17:43,180
It's all my fault.

199
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,659
I'm to blame for everything.

200
00:17:47,979 --> 00:17:50,299
I let him down.

201
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,100
I'm sorry.

202
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,960
Was Xie Minghao involved too?

203
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,360
He...

204
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:09,400
He was only following my orders.

205
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,779
Xieqing. Why are you still protecting him?

206
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:17,879
What do you mean?

207
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:20,919
I don't understand.

208
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,719
Let me ask you this.

209
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,057
If you were K of Spades,

210
00:18:28,058 --> 00:18:31,419
then how would Huo Jian suddenly find out that Xieyi and I

211
00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:35,419
were in Yun'an Town when we were searching for Liu A'Wei?

212
00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:40,380
And why would Xie Minghao coincidentally show up at the same place?

213
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:44,560
Xieqing, you should know that you've never been the one

214
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,800
Xie Minghao truly loved.

215
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,400
Turn back.

216
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,500
You only need to speak up now, and you'll be able to end all of this.

217
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,259
Enough.

218
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,320
Do you think Xieyi would be able to handle all of this?

219
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,600
Did you forget how she lost her memories in the first place?

220
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,240
Sorry.

221
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,439
Please give me more time.

222
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,880
When I figure things out,

223
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,000
I will take responsibility for everything I have done.

224
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,860
But in the meantime,

225
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:33,559
please don't tell anything about this to Xieyi.

226
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:38,719
I know I have no right to ask this of you,

227
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,019
but I don't want to see her hurt

228
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:43,859
and upset over what happened in the past ever again.

229
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,650

230
00:20:04,979 --> 00:20:06,519
Hello? Xieyi?

231
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:08,119
 Hello? A'Yan?

232
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:10,860
 I have good news to share.

233
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:14,899
Director Shi acknowledged my work today,

234
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:16,939
and she even approved my procurement contract.

235
00:20:16,939 --> 00:20:18,879
 She's not upset with me anymore.

236
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,920
Is that so?

237
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,819
I told you Director Shi would come around.

238
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:29,219
By the way, where are you?

239
00:20:29,219 --> 00:20:31,119
Why aren't you back yet?

240
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:39,160
I'm still having a meeting with a client.

241
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,840
A client?

242
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,040
Is it a man or a woman?

243
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,700
A man.

244
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:48,219
 A male client?

245
00:20:48,219 --> 00:20:50,340
Then, I have nothing to worry about.

246
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,639
All right.

247
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,119
Thank you, Chairman Li.

248
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:59,699
Actually, I only came to meet you today

249
00:20:59,699 --> 00:21:03,559
to see if my sister is happy.

250
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:06,439
Now, I can rest assured. With you by her side,

251
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:08,900
I'm sure she'll live a happy life.

252
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:15,219
I hope you'll always treat her well.

253
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,440
Both of you have a private account, don't you?

254
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,120
Xie Minghao told you to open it, didn't he?

255
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:36,520
You are mistaken.

256
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,780
There is no private account.

257
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,480
I've spent all the money.

258
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,780
Xieqing. Why are you still protecting him?

259
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,640
You only have to make that private account public,

260
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,340
and the transactions within it will be able to prove whether he is innocent or not.

261
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:01,219
Minghao...

262
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,399
His fate lies in his own hands.

263
00:22:07,879 --> 00:22:09,779
What do you mean?

264
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:27,819
This is what we'll do.

265
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,199
Xie Minghao must have been looking for you.

266
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:34,100
I'll find you a safe place to stay for now.

267
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,960
We'll discuss the other things at a later date.

268
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,760
Thank you.

269
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:47,580
I need to use the washroom.

270
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,920

271
00:23:03,139 --> 00:23:05,119
I apologize for keeping you waiting.

272
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,819
It's all right.

273
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,200
This is a printout of the contract we agreed upon and drew up.

274
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,899
We have confirmed everything on our end.

275
00:23:14,899 --> 00:23:16,260
Please go through it as well.

276
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,599
If everything is in order, we may officially sign the agreement.

277
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:21,299
There's no need for that.

278
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:24,319
Lawyer Xie drafted the agreement.

279
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,779
I have complete faith in him.

280
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:29,539
Besides, I've read the soft copy at least ten or more times.

281
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:33,340
- Let's sign the contract immediately. 
 - All right.

282
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,740
Then, I'll sign and seal the agreement on behalf of Ocean Group.

283
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,140
All right.

284
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,900
This is your copy.

285
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,500
This is for you as well.

286
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,208
- To fruitful cooperation. 
 - To fruitful cooperation.

287
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,200
- Hello? Brother Minghao? 
 -  Xieyi, Xieqing is missing.

288
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,759
What?

289
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,620
- Xieyi. 
 - Brother Minghao, where is my sister?

290
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,243
Come inside first.

291
00:25:01,888 --> 00:25:05,119
To take care of your sister better, I moved her to a better and quieter apartment.

292
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:08,140
I was planning to make her some soup, but she ran out on her own.

293
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,200
So what's going on right now?

294
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,179
She left this note.

295
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:16,699
I'm worried. What if she does something to hurt herself?

296
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,580
 Minghao, I love you.

297
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:23,499
 But I don't know how I should face this world and you.

298
00:25:23,499 --> 00:25:27,179
 Living means only pain and suffering for me.

299
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:30,459
 Perhaps only in death can I find salvation.

300
00:25:30,459 --> 00:25:33,059
 I will be going now. Do not come and find me.

301
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,279
We have to find her immediately.

302
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:37,779
Let's go.

303
00:25:38,219 --> 00:25:39,959
Xieqing!

304
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,380
Xieqing!

305
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:46,459
Xieqing!

306
00:25:46,459 --> 00:25:48,219
Sorry.

307
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,760
Xieqing!

308
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:01,679
Xieqing! Xieqing!

309
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,979
- Sister! 
 - Xieqing!

310
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:08,119
I can't find her anywhere, Brother Minghao.

311
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:15,359
Let's look over there.

312
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:18,200
- Xieqing! 
 - Xieqing!

313
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,420
- Sister! 
 - Xieqing!

314
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,620
What is it, Xieyi?

315
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:56,200
Xieyi. You haven't eaten anything all day.

316
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,780
Have some milk.

317
00:28:14,219 --> 00:28:15,919
Xieyi.

318
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,680
I know you're upset,

319
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,559
but you have to take care of your health too.

320
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:28,060
Don't worry. Xieqing will be fine.

321
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,130
We've contacted the police.

322
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,119
They will find her.

323
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,559
It's my fault.

324
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,480
I was so obsessed with getting revenge.

325
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,040
I never thought about spending more time with her.

326
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:51,180
I only thought of myself.

327
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,380
I never thought about how lonely she could be.

328
00:28:56,899 --> 00:28:59,200
She was on her way to a full recovery,

329
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,060
but I didn't know anything about it.

330
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,620
A'Yan.

331
00:29:05,999 --> 00:29:09,859
Do you think I let her down?

332
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,919
No, you didn't.

333
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:22,340
You have to believe in how much she cares for you.

334
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:27,479
She must want you to be happy

335
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,499
and live well too.

336
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:37,080
Then, why... why would she rather disappear than see me?

337
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:41,060
She must blame me for not spending more time with her.

338
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:44,059
She must be upset with me...

339
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:07,480
 Sir, the lady who was in this seat earlier left a note for you.

340
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,980
 Thank you.

341
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,179
 Thank you for listening to me.

342
00:30:17,179 --> 00:30:19,520
 I haven't figured out how to face Xieyi yet.

343
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,000
 I need more time.

344
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,619
 Please do not tell Xieyi about this matter for now.

345
00:30:23,619 --> 00:30:25,819
 I will be in touch again.

346
00:30:25,819 --> 00:30:29,599
 I hope you and Xieyi will stay happy together.

347
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:34,140
 I'm sorry, Xieyi.

348
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:37,879
 I can't tell you what happened to your family back then.

349
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:40,219
 It would be too cruel to you.

350
00:30:40,219 --> 00:30:44,500
 That's why I can't tell you about my meeting with your sister.

351
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:47,199
 Your sister's matter is too odd.

352
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:49,880
 I will find out the truth for your sake.

353
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,540
 You only need to speak up now,

354
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,680
 and you'll be able to end all of this.

355
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:59,319
 Do you think Xieyi will be able to handle all of this?

356
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:02,860
 Did you forget how she lost her memories in the first place?

357
00:31:19,219 --> 00:31:21,499
Miss Su has fallen asleep?

358
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,000
She cried a lot earlier.

359
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:30,900
She tired herself out.

360
00:31:37,259 --> 00:31:39,860
There are still no signs of Xieqing's body as of yet.

361
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:43,519
However, the estuary was not far from that river.

362
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,480
Her chances of survival are slim.

363
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,820
And she left a suicide note as well.

364
00:31:51,499 --> 00:31:56,979
Xieqing said she would take responsibility for what she did.

365
00:31:57,739 --> 00:32:00,079
I thought she would turn herself in,

366
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:05,110
but why would she suddenly decide to end her own life?

367
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:12,419
Moreover, another thing is odd as well.

368
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,260
What is it?

369
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,021
I clearly remember

370
00:32:16,021 --> 00:32:21,000
that she wasn't carrying that doll with her when I met her.

371
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,919
But Xieyi said she saw that doll floating on the river,

372
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:30,059
and that's how she deducted her sister committed suicide.

373
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:33,140
Could she have gone back to retrieve it?

374
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:37,519
Xieqing escaped from that apartment.

375
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,060
Xie Minghao was looking for her as well.

376
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:43,040
If she had gone back just to retrieve that doll,

377
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:47,159
wouldn't she have increased her risk of being found out by Xie Minghao?

378
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:48,859
That doesn't make sense.

379
00:32:48,859 --> 00:32:50,700
That's true.

380
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,950
However, with this incident,

381
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:56,250
we'll have lost our trail on Xie Minghao as well.

382
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,059
The most important thing to do right now is to comfort Xieyi.

383
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:18,799
Xieqing's death is too much for her.

384
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,580
I know very well

385
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,919
how much suffering she has been in for this period of time.

386
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:29,920
Mr. Li. You have to take care of yourself too.

387
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,000
You've been overexerting yourself

388
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,799
for Miss Su lately.

389
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,100
I'm concerned about your health.

390
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,700
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

391
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:51,699
You've been working hard lately as well.

392
00:33:51,699 --> 00:33:53,259
I'm only doing what I should.

393
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:11,639
 Xieqing. To think you met Li Zeliang.

394
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:15,339
 Good. You gave me another useful card.

395
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:50,320
 You've always been in the wrong position.

396
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,240
 From tomorrow on, everything shall return to their rightful places.

397
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,560
Xieyi. The weather is nice today.

398
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,679
Let's go out for a bit.

399
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,100
I don't feel like going out.

400
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:41,300
You've been staying home all day lately. I'm worried you'll be bored.

401
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:45,960
I'm fine. You should get to work.

402
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:50,539
I'll be working from home for these few days.

403
00:35:50,539 --> 00:35:52,519
I want to keep you company.

404
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:55,380
I'm really fine.

405
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,680
That won't do either. Look at you.

406
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,459
You haven't been eating properly.

407
00:36:00,459 --> 00:36:03,020
Your body won't be able to handle that.

408
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,660
How about this?

409
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,740
I'll make you your favorite crab roe noodles.

410
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:15,960
All right. I'll go and buy the best hairy crabs for you.

411
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,379
You stay home by yourself for a bit.

412
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,840
Okay.

413
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,400
Good girl.

414
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:26,839
I'm off then.

415
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,540
Wait for me.

416
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,510

417
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:00,200
Hello? Brother Minghao?

418
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,580
Brother Minghao?

419
00:37:09,879 --> 00:37:11,579
Xieqing.

420
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,060
Are you upset with me?

421
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,159
I'm Xieyi.

422
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:21,739
Brother Minghao? Are you drunk?

423
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,079
Xieqing, where are you?

424
00:37:25,139 --> 00:37:29,719
Come back. Don't leave me.

425
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,799
Brother Minghao, are you all right?

426
00:37:37,799 --> 00:37:41,479
Why didn't you take me with you?

427
00:37:41,479 --> 00:37:43,719
Brother Minghao, don't do anything silly.

428
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,019
I'll...

429
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,320

430
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:08,619
 Sorry. The number you have dialed is currently unavailable.

431
00:38:35,659 --> 00:38:37,159
Brother Minghao.

432
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:38,859
Xieyi.

433
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,780
Xieqing...

434
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,239
Why isn't my Xieqing back yet?

435
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,520
Stop drinking.

436
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,939
Xieqing will be sad to know.

437
00:38:56,939 --> 00:39:01,759
What is the point of living without Xieqing?

438
00:39:05,739 --> 00:39:07,339
Xieyi.

439
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,360
Promise me

440
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,219
you won't leave me.

441
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,560
All right?

442
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,300
Brother Minghao. If you're upset, cry it out.

443
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,779
You'll feel much better.

444
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,700
Thank you.

445
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:59,679
This used to be your sister's favorite doll.

446
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:02,320
Now that she is gone,

447
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,860
I hope you can keep it.

448
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,118
As long as you're around,

449
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:10,880
it will never be lonely.

450
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:16,719
Xieyi.

451
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,559
I never thought that one day,

452
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:25,499
I would be able to hand that doll to you with my very own hands.

453
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:45,840
Xieyi. There's something that has been bothering me.

454
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,620
I don't know if I should tell you.

455
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:52,158
But for your sake, I think I have to tell you.

456
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:58,059
Before she went missing, Xieqing met up with Li Zeliang.

457
00:40:58,059 --> 00:40:59,860
What?

458
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:07,660
I don't know why she met him or what Li Zeliang told her.

459
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:10,099
Could you ask him about it?

460
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:12,939
Impossible.

461
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,719
A'Yan has been busy lately.

462
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:18,440
He was meeting a client that day. There's no way.

463
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,297
I have evidence.

464
00:41:20,297 --> 00:41:22,120
Hold on.

465
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,810

466

00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:57,710
♫  The price of growing up is like a pile of bargaining chip  ♫

493
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:01,660
♫  The wager is who can let go first  ♫

494
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:03,410
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

495
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:05,390
♫  Everything must be going well  ♫

496
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:09,460
♫  Life is not as complicated as I thought  ♫

497
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:13,910
♫  Silence is the best that I can do  ♫

498
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:16,850
♫  Whatever pain and suffering may come,  ♫

499
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:19,940
♫  I'm not afraid at all  ♫
