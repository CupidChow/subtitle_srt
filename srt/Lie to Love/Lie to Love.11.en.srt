Chu.

21
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,159
Today,

22
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,360
we're seated here in the same car.

23
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,759
That shows

24
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,639
that we're brought together by fate.

25
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,120
Mr. Ji.

26
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,280
Isn't this a private car
booked specially for me?

27
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,000
Why is he here?

28
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,360
I'm sorry, Ms. Shi.

29
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:35,960
We booked a private car

30
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,759
for Mr. Oscar a well.

31
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,319
But he requested this.

32
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,159
Why waste the money?

33
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,759
I'm saving money for your company.

34
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:44,400
Money isn't a problem for us.

35
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,439
You're right.

36
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,599
Mr. Ji.

37
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:51,159
Why is your boss so stingy?

38
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,280
He owns a big company,

39
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,280
but sent such a small car

40
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,919
to pick Ms. Shi up.

41
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,400
There's no place

42
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,520
for my Simba.

43
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,840
Actually, you can just

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,879
put Simba in the trunk.

45
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,199
No way.

46
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,360
It has claustrophobia.

Why aren't you talking?

50
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:17,599
I have some really good medications

51
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,879
for motion sickness with me.

52
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,960
Would you like to try it?

53
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,159
I won't feel carsick

54
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,560
if you sit in the front.

55
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,319
I can't do that.

56
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,039
I'll get dizzy if I sit in the front.

57
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,520
Look.

58
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,199
Do all bosses

59
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,400
like to sit in the back?

60
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,120
Are all rock and roll singers

61
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,400

62
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:37,520
No.

63

Not me.

64
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,560

Did anyone upset you?

66
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,680
I'm here for work,

67
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,280
not for vacation.

68
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,800

72
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:10,759
Are you kidding me?

73
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:11,879
What about me?

74
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,080
Look, Ms. Shi.

75
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,040
Does your company

76
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,639
not perform a background check
on your clients?

77
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,879
Don't you know

78
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,639
that the Romans love rock music?

79
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,279

80

to him.

161
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,879
Back then,

162
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:50,519
he even listened

163
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,439
to hard rock songs with us.

164
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,279
But he had a sudden change
in personality

165
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,439
and started playing this song every day

166

as a partner of Ocean,

239
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:43,759
I've been formally invited.

This is German medicine.

246
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,320
It's not available in the country.

00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,519

during the day?

262

264
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,399
has such poor soundproofing?

265
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,480
I should write a complaint letter.

266
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,200

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,759

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,480

277
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,320

283
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:36,000
It's a hoax.

284
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,159

What do I get?

295
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,399
Or I'll take a screenshot at once

296
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,360
and post it on Moments.

297
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,559

It's fine.

315
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,559

Thank you.

322
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,279
So

323
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:56,919
Li Ze Liang gave me his word

324
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,240
that if I helped him

325
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,279
with this auction,

326
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:00,559
he would give me

327
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,279
the evidence
of Chen Heng Sheng's wrongdoing.

328
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:04,759
As long as we can get Chen He Sheng,

329
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:05,600
there's no need to worry

330
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:06,639
about finding dirt on Huo Jian.

331
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,840
Li Ze Liang promised to help you?

332
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,759
That's right.

333
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,600

I believe him.

335
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,039
Eat up, or the food will turn cold.

336

Okay.

337
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,759
Mr. Xie, why didn't you

Mr. Li, what would you like to have?

344
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:40,519
Excuse me.

345
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,240
Mr. Xie, what are you having?

346
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:44,559
Well, Xie Yi

347
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:45,960
ordered this specially for me.

348
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,679
It's right up my alley.

349
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,080
Mr. Li, what would you like to order?

350
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:51,480
It's fine.

351
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:55,279
I'll share with Xie Yi.

352
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:13,799
Xie Yi.

353
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,559
How many times have I told you

354
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,480
not to take cold drinks
if you have a toothache?

355
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,720
What if it hurts even more?

356
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:20,360
Don't take cold drinks anymore.

357
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,080
Well, Mr. Xie, did you come to Yunfeng

358
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,679
for business or pleasure?

359
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:33,080
I'm representing Hengye Bank

360
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,080
to handle any legal affairs

361
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,480
related to the auction

362
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,759
and become

363
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,879
a courier guy for Xie Yi.

364
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,080
What's that?

365
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,679
This is a special medicine
for toothache.

366
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,480
I used to take it when I was in Germany.

367
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,360
Ming Hao asked a friend

368
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:55,919
to bring it back from abroad.

369
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,639
What's that?

370
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:01,440
Nothing.

371
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,399
Helping a friend to deliver it.

372
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:04,920
Xie Yi.

373
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,960
Go back to your room first.

374
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:07,799
I have something

375
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,079
to discuss in private with Mr. Xie.

376
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:15,799
All right.

377
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:19,880
Ming Hao.

378
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,160
I'll get going then.

379
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,039
Rest well.

380
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,279
Xie Yi.

381
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,480
Three times a day.

382
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,240
Don't forget.

383
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,640
Okay.

384
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,319
Xie Yi.

385
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,480
Wait for me in your room.

386
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:37,440
I'll be back soon.

387
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,480
Go on.

388
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,599
Mr. Li, feel free to ask me anything.

389
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:55,559
Don't stand on ceremony.

390
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:56,920
No consulting charges.

391
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:58,119
Mr. Xie.

392
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:00,039
Your concerns for Xie Yi

393
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,960
seem a little

394
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:01,839
out of line.

395
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,720
Xie Yi and I are families.

396
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:05,359
Xie Yi was previously attacked

397
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:07,440
and the perpetrator is still at large.

398
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,279
So

399
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,680
it sets my mind at rest

400
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:11,359
to be close to Xie Yi.

401
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,359
I've also said it before.

402
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,039
The person you should be
concerned about is Xie Qing.

403
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,640
As for Xie Yi,

404
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,119
I'll take care of her.

405
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:21,440
This is Xie Yi's first time

406
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,640
going on a long business trip

407
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:24,200
and it's a tough job.

408
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,519
Indeed, she needs someone
to look after her.

409
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,759
But...

410
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,079
you might not be the person
who knows her best.

411
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,440
After all, I've kept her company

412
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,079
in the last two years.

413
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,000
I know all about her preferences.

414
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,240
Like,

415
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:41,920
the kind of medicine that works best

416
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:43,960
when she has a toothache.

417
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,960
Besides, do you really believe

418
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,720
that you're capable

419
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,079
of taking better care of her than me?

420
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,519
I'm warning you.

421
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,359
Don't affect her

422
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:57,759
at work.

423
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:59,160
Otherwise,

424
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,000
I'll have to evict you.

425
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,519
I will.

426
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,799
You forgot something.

427
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:23,960
Ms. Shi.

428
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,079
Are we going

429
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,119
to enter Liang's room just like that?

430
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:27,200
I don't think it's a good idea.

431
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:28,759
Cut the crap.

432
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,599
It's all because

433
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:31,039
you dropped your phone on his balcony.

434
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,599
What do we do

435
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:33,359
if he's back now?

436
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:34,799
What are the odds of that?

437
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,440
Su Xie Yi.

438
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,039
Why are you back this late?

439
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,160
Didn't I tell you

440
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,240
to get back to your room early?

441
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,680
I went to the kiosk downstairs

442
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,039
and bought a bottle of water.

443
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:48,599
Didn't I tell you
not to take cold drinks?

444
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,559
What?

445
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:50,720
No more toothache?

446
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:53,599
I just took my medicine.

447
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,799
Ming Hao gave it to me.

448
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:55,839
Have you forgotten?

449
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:58,599
Su Xie Yi.

450
00:19:59,279 --> 00:19:59,680
Do you know

451
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,319
what's your status now?

452
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,640
How can you casually go out

453
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:03,960
and have a meal with another man?

454
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,640
Is that appropriate?

455
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:06,319
First.

456
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,759
I did it openly.

457
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,720
Second.

458
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:09,720
Since Ming Hao is here,

459
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,440
what's wrong if I eat with him?

460
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,759
It's perfectly fine.

461
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,039
Besides,

462
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:15,440
what's my status?

463
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,079
Excuse me.

464
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,559
We're only partners.

465
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:20,720
(Do you expect me)

466
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,480
(to stick with you all the time)

467
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,519
(and have no personal space?)

468
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:25,559
(Su Xie Yi.)

469
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,039
Are you feeling hard done by?

470
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,920
What's the matter?

471
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,240
Do you want

472
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,440
the whole world to know

473
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:34,000
that we're only putting up a show?

474
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,440
I'm talking to you.

475
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,920
Where are you looking at?

476
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,680
Liang, I'm sorry.

477
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:57,640
I didn't mean to do this.

478
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,119
I came to retrieve my phone.

479
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:04,839
I don't want

480
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,440
a fourth person to know about this.

481
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:12,640
Excuse me.

482
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,200
I accompany him here

483
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:19,400
to retrieve his phone.

484
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:23,279
I promise.

485
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,359
There'll be no fifth person

486
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:24,960
who knows about this.

487
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,279
Miss Su.

488
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:36,240
Are you happy now?

489
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,000
Now that Oscar knows,

490
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,920
the whole world will know.

491
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,600
(Toothache Medication)

492
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,319
What's that?

493
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:05,279
Nothing.

494
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:06,880
Helping a friend to deliver it.

495
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:21,640
So it's all just a pretense?

496
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,240
Yan.

497
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,319
You're awake.

498
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,519
I've ordered breakfast.

499
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,519
Come and have some.

500
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:43,599
Miss Su.

501
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:45,119
There's no one else here.

502
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:46,519
It's better if you just call me

503
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:47,119
Mr. Li.

504
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:49,200
Sure, Mr. Li.

505
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,119
Today is a sunny day.

506
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,240
I hope

507
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,359
you're in a good mood today.

508
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:54,759
Please enjoy your breakfast.

509
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,000
I'm not eating. Enjoy yourself.

510
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,119
I'm going to get changed.

511
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,519
Let's eat together!

512
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:04,000
Miss Su.

513
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,079
There's no need
to take such drastic action.

514
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,000
Listen up.

515
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:07,599
You were right.

516
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,440
There's no need

517
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,559
for us to stick together.

518
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:10,759
Since we're busy with work,

519
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:12,359
it's more efficient to work separately.

520
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:17,680
He sure is green with envy.

521
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:37,880
It's been a while, Mr. Roman.

522
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,720
That's right.

523
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,759
I've been looking forward to this.

524
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,880
Miss Su, the last few days
must have been so hard for you.

525
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:46,079
Not at all.

526
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:46,799
It's my honor

527
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,039
to be able to take part

528
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,119
in such a high-profile auction.

529
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,640
Miss Su.

530
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:53,000
My wife has been thinking

531
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,960
about the cocktails that you made.

532
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,079
I can bear witness

533
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:56,279
that you promised

534
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,160
to make her some nice cocktails.

535
00:23:58,759 --> 00:23:59,519
Not a problem.

536
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:00,480
If you feel like drinking,

537
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,559
feel free to come to me.

538
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,680
Sure.

539
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,119
Mr. Roman.

540
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,559
Ms. Shi is making the preparations

541
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,839
for the dinner tonight.

542
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,559
Well, good wine is a must.

543
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,680
I promise that you and your wife

544
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:11,680
will have a good time.

545
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,759
Allow me to introduce.

546
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:13,519
This is

547
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,680
Mr. Chen Heng Sheng,

548
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:15,839
the general manager of Yunfeng Hotel.

549
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:17,119
Nice to meet you.

550
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,079
Welcome.

551
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,599
Mr. Chen.

552
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,319
Mr. and Mrs. Roman

553
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:22,440
are wayworn after the long trip.

554
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,160
Take them to rest.

555
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:25,799
I'll see you at dinner.

556
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:26,759
Okay.

557
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:27,839
See you at dinner.

558
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Their room is ready.

559
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:30,640
This way, please.

560
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:31,599
Here.

561
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,079
I've been hearing good news

562
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:43,000
in the past few days.

563
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:45,599
Well done.

564
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,680
Thank you for your compliment, Uncle.

565
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:48,720
But

566
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,000
even until the very last moment,

567
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,079
I won't let my guard down.

568
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,079
See you tonight.

569
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,599
Stop looking already.

570
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:07,559
You...

571
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:08,880
Get the guest registration counter

572
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:09,799
set up.

573
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,000
It's done.

574
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:12,920
Set up the welcome area then.

575
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,240
It's done.

576
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:16,759
Go and find something else to do.

577
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,160
Like?

578
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,599
Figure it out yourself.

579
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,880
What about you?

580
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:24,519
I'll attend to some other matters.

581
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,279
This way, please, Mr. Huo.

582
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:45,720
Mr. Huo.

583
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:47,880
You're finally here.

584
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,960
The auction is about to begin.

585
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,599
What should we do next?

586
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:53,359
What's the matter?

587
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,799
Afraid you might lose your position?

588
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,839
I'm feeling worried in your stead.

589
00:25:58,519 --> 00:25:59,559
No matter what,

590
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:01,599
Li Ze Liang is Mr. Li Senior's son.

591
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,279
He keeps such a high profile.

592
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,079
What if

593
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,480
he manages to pull this off?

594
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,480
That will...

595
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,440
That will pose a threat to my position.

596
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,480
Of course.

597
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,480
The chairman's position

598
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,519
is re-elected every three years.

599
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,359
The re-election is drawing near.

600
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,599
That makes his intention

601
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:15,160
so obvious

602
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,240
for him to make an appearance now.

603
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,200
Are you afraid
that there'll be no one to protect you

604
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,759
once I'm removed from the position?

605
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,319
Well, you're my boss.

606
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,480
This kid is really something.

607
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,480
I didn't expect him

608
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:31,640
to be able to get this auction event.

609
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,759
Since he wants to fire the first shot,

610
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:37,039
let it blow up in his face then.

611
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:37,680
Right.

612
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,759
I thought the same.

613
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,200
But the problem now

614
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:41,319
is that if we want

615
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,519
to mess up

616
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,680
Li Ze Liang's auction

617
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,640
and not to draw suspicion

618
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:45,720
to ourselves

619
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,880
at the same time,

620
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,240
(Award Certificate)
that's going to be really tricky.

621
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:49,720
Indeed.

622
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:51,359
But

623
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:52,920
right now,

624
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,839
I have an extra pawn.

625
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:57,880
Su Xie Yi.

626
00:26:58,359 --> 00:26:59,440
Do you know

627
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:00,480
who her father is?

628
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:01,960
No.

629
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:04,640
Shen Zhi Hong.

630
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,960
Su Xie Yi is Shen Zhi Hong's daughter?

631
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:16,880
That doesn't make sense.

632
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,079
Why would she

633
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,240
be with Li Ze Liang then?

634
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,759
These two incidents,

635
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,000
the bankruptcy of Zhiwei Corporation,

636
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,640
and Shen Zhi Hong's suicide,

637
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,200
are connected to Ocean.

638
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,200
In other words,

639
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,000
Ocean is her enemy.

640
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,279
That's right.

641
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,599
Besides,

642
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,519
and now,

643
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:34,960
she's become the girlfriend
of her enemy.

644
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,519
Interesting, isn't it?

645
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,880
So

646
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,319
she gets close to Li Ze Liang

647
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,880
for revenge.

648
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,240
It doesn't matter what she thinks.

649
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,720
What matters

650
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:57,920
is what came to your mind

651
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,359
when you learned of her real identity.

652
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:01,480
Yi Fei would think the same.

653
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,319
So would everyone else

654
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:04,799
when they came to learn

655
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,720
of her real identity.

656
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:09,359
So

657
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:11,839
you're saying

658
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:13,400
that we have to expose

659
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,640
Su Xie Yi's identity?

660
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,240
But we need an opportunity
to pull that off.

661
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,519
Mrs. Roman is a big fan

662
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,200
of the cocktails that Su Xie Yi makes.

663
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:23,759
What's going to happen

664
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,000
if she gets poisoned

665
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:26,240
after drinking the cocktail

666
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:28,079
that Su Xie Yi makes?

667
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,759
That goes without saying.

668
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,440
It'll be a big scandal.

669
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:33,200
Also, not only

670
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,319
will it ruin

671
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:35,240
Li Ze Liang's auction,

672
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,519
the suspicion

673
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:38,160
will fall upon Su Xie Yi.

674
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:39,240
Mrs. Roman loves to

675
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,079
drink the Mojito

676
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,519
and Gin and Tonic that Su Xie Yi makes.

677
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,519
Whatever method of preparation,

678
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,000
these two cocktails will be garnished
with a slice of green lime.

679
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:50,079
You know what to do, right?

680
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:57,799
I don't want anyone

681
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,759
to know about this.

682
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,559
See to it yourself.

683
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,519
Okay.

684
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:16,960
So?

685
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,400
How are you enjoying your time here?

686
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:24,079
All thanks to you
for looking out for me.

687
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,279
After you get things done,

688
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,680
this position

689
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,880
will forever be yours.

690
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:35,880
Your son's career

691
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:38,359
will be smooth sailing as well.

692
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:44,559
I understand.

693
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,000
Take care.

694
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:49,599
Okay.

695
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:50,640
Okay.

696
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,200
Mr. Li, you're here.

697
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:52,880
Mr. He.

698
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:53,599
It's been a while.

699
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:54,319
Welcome

700
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,440
(Fujiade Auction Reception)
to the auction reception.

701
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:55,920
Sure.

702
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:57,039
Mr. Thomson.

703
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:57,799
Hi, Mr. Li.

704
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,079
Hi, it's been a while.

705
00:29:59,279 --> 00:29:59,640
Hi.

706
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:00,759
Hi.

707
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,799
This is my wife, Demi.

708
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,240
This is my girlfriend.

709
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,680
Miss Su Xie Yi.

710
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,640
Hi.

711
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,640
Mr. Miller.

712
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,640
It's been a while.

713
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,319
It's been a while.

714
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,400
Welcome

715
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:15,599
to the auction reception.

716
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:17,160
This is?

717
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,400
This is my girlfriend.

718
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:19,880
Miss Su Xie Yi.

719
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:21,880
Hi.

720
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,400
All right, Mr. Li.

721
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:24,880
That should be enough.

722
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:26,359
Didn't you say it would be

723
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:27,680
more efficient to work separately?

724
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:31,559
What? No more toothache?

725
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,000
The special medicine sure works wonders.

726
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:36,160
That's right.

727
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,079
I woke up this morning

728
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:38,880
and saw a few boxes of medications
in the living room.

729
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:40,359
So I gave it a try.

730
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:43,160
It actually worked.

731
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:44,599
I wonder who bought them.

732
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,880
Hi, Mr. Miller.

733
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,480
We just passed by him.

734
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,279
Hi, Mr. Thomson.

735
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:54,240
We passed by him a while ago.

736
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,319
Hi, sir.

737
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:28,599
This way, please.

738
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:29,559
Mr. Roman.

739
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,960
Mr. Li.

740
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:32,440
Good evening.

741
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,839
Good evening.

742
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,440
What a lively evening.

743
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:38,000
It looks like this auction

744
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,160
will surely be a success.

745
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:40,759
All thanks to you

746
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,240
for your great support.

747
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:42,880
Thank you.

748
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:43,640
Keep it up.

749
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:44,920
Keep it up.

750
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:46,160
Mr. Roman.

751
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:47,680
Let's have a drink

752
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,480
to celebrate it.

753
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,400
Sure.

754
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:53,839
I'm sorry.

755
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:55,519
Mrs. Roman, I've forgotten.

756
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,640
What's wrong?

757
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,279
How can you drink such wine?

758
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,359
If my memory serves me right,

759
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,680
someone still owes Mrs. Roman

760
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,839
a glass of cocktail.

761
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:04,079
Right?

762
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,119
That's right.

763
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:07,440
Mrs. Roman.

764
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,240
I'll prepare it for you

765
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:09,079
in a short while.

766
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:10,880
No rush.

767
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:13,119
Mr. Roman.

768
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,680
On behalf of Yunfeng Hotel,

769
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:17,559
a subsidiary of Ocean Group,

770
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:19,440
here are my best wishes in advance

771
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,039
that the auction
will be a great success.

772
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:21,720
Great.

773
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,240
May the auction be a great success.

774
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:32,759
Get moving.

775
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,519
Hurry up.
There's no more food out there.

776
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,960
(Huo Jian)
(Serve the dish.)

777
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,519
Why haven't you sent
the green limes over?

778
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,319
I'm on it now.

779
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,640
Hold on.

780
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,000
Later, remember

781
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,359
to tell the bartender that there is

782
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,200
a problem with the taste
of this batch of green limes.

783
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,119
So it can only be used for garnishing,

784
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:11,319
not for guests,

785
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,559
so as not to affect our reputation.

786
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,119
All right.

787
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:14,440
Get to it now.

788
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,400
Ms. Shi.

789
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:24,400
Hi.

790
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,870
(Fujiade Auction Reception)

791
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,119
I've been observing them all day.

792
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,880
Do you notice

793
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,599
that Liang does give Miss Su

794
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,240
special treatment?

795
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:43,839
Didn't you hear them yesterday?

796
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,400
They were saying the opposite.

797
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:47,880
Look at them

798
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:49,799
walking arm in arm.

799
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:50,880
Something is going on.

800
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,640
What do you know?

801
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:54,880
I do.

802
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:56,160
Of course, I know.

803
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,319
I'm a man.

804
00:33:57,759 --> 00:33:59,440
A man will surely
understand another man.

805
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,880
What kind of man

806
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:03,119
drinks milk every day?

807
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:08,599
Let me reiterate it again.

808
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,400
This is milk tea.

809
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,400
Ze Liang, I'll leave you be.

810
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,199
I'll prepare the cocktail
for Mrs. Roman.

811
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,960
Okay. Go on.

812
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Thank you.

813
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,400
Do girls

814
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:08,719
like to drink such beautiful wine?

815
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:11,239
We love to drink good wine.

816
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,400
I'll give it a try then.

817
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,480
Don't...

818
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,159
Hey, pretty.

819
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:15,000
Hi, handsome.

820
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,679
It's so awful.

821
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:20,880
I think

822
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:22,239
you shouldn't force it.

823
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:23,559
This cocktail I just made

824
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,159
is slightly stronger.

825
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,760
This will be of some use to me.

826
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:28,119
What is it used for?

827
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,599
I bet you don't know.

828
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,239
Look.

829
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,480
Anyone here

830
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:33,920
who knows the tricks

831
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:36,000
will use it to wipe the bracelets.

832
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,280
As for me,

833
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:38,719
I'll use it to clean my guitar pick

834
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,280
since I'm using it later.

835
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,360
Guitar pick?

836
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:42,280
That's right.

837
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,239
Miss Su.

838
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,360
Is my cocktail ready?

839
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:48,159
Mrs. Roman.

840
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,880
I'm sorry.

841
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,320
This is made for you?

842
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:54,400
I'm so sorry.

843
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,159
It's not Miss Su's fault.

844
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:57,760
I couldn't help myself.

845
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,599
It's okay.

846
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,599
I'll make you another glass.

847
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,559
Sure.

848
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,360
Well, I'll get going then.

849
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:07,159
I'm going to perform in a bit.

850
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:09,199
Thanks for the lime.

851
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:09,960
Off you go.

852
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,760
Oh, right, Miss Su.

853
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,880
I've been going around
in the last two days.

854
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:18,159
Could you make me

855
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:18,760
something light?

856
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:19,840
Sure.

857
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:21,760
I'll reduce the amount of alcohol.

858
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:24,400
This is quite an art.

859
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,599
If it's something stronger,

860
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,840
pair it with green limes.

861
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,920
But if it's something lighter,

862
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,039
pair it with yellow limes.

863
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,119
I believe in your taste.

864
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:44,800
It's done.

865
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:45,840
Give it a try.

866
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:47,000
Sure.

867
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:57,000
It looks like

868
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:58,360
the show is about to begin.

(What's wrong?)

896
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,320
(Why is he on the floor?)

897
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,039
Oscar.

898
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,000
Oscar.

899
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,599
Oscar.

900
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:55,320
Oscar, what's wrong?

901
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,639
Call an ambulance.

902
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,760
Take him to the backstage.

903
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,000
I'll take care of here.

904
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:06,719
Get up.

905
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,000
Sorry, ladies and gentlemen.

906
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:16,280
(As our live singer
is feeling under the weather,)

907
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,920
(the show)

908
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:19,039
(will end up.)

909
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:21,719
(Please don't panic.)

910
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:23,159
(Right now,)

911
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:23,960
(please follow our staff)

912
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:24,880
(to enjoy your meals.)

913
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,519
I'm sorry.

914
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:31,800
There was a slight hiccup.

915
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,559
It's being taken care of now.

916
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:34,480
Sorry for ruining the fun.

917
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:35,840
See you.

918
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,519
Okay.

919
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:37,320
- See you.
- See you.

920
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,360
See you.

921
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,079
Bye.

922
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:42,440
I saw that singer drinking

923
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,599
before he went on stage.

924
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,639
I think a lady gave him the drink.

925
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,159
Could something be wrong
with the drink?

926
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,079
Could it be the bartender's doing?

927
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:52,480
If so, this drink...

928
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,199
Don't be afraid.

929
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,800
I'm here.

930
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,880
There are rumors that the alcohol

931
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,199
that Oscar took may have been poisoned.

932
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:03,880
But I was the one who made the drink.

933
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,000
I have no idea

934
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,039
why it would turn out this way.

935
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,960
We have called the police.

936
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,800
They'll be here soon.

937
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:12,440
Don't worry.
They'll get to the bottom of things.

938
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,440
This happened in critical moments
as such.

939
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:16,400
It's definitely no accident.

940
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,000
Someone must be behind this.

941
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:20,320
Someone wanted

942
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:21,960
to use this poisoning incident

943
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:23,840
to take you and me down.

944
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,000
I was just wondering

945
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:28,360
if that was their intention,

946
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:29,559
Oscar wouldn't be

947
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,159
the perfect target.

948
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:32,639
The cocktail

949
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,559
that I made

950
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,960
was meant for Mrs. Roman.

951
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,599
That makes sense now.

952
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,679
If it was Mrs. Roman who got poisoned,

953
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,679
the auction would turn into

954
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:42,719
a big scandal.

955
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,719
How hateful.

956
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:49,970
(Mr. Roman)

957
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,639
Mr. Roman got hot under the collar now.

958
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,960
I have to appease him.

959
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,559
Xie Yi.

960
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:01,440
Think carefully.

961
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,199
See if there was any part

962
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,599
that we would easily overlook

963
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:06,119
or screw up.

964
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,679
Don't worry.

965
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,840

966
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:12,880
