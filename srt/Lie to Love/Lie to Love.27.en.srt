You didn't even get changed.

Here.

26
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,000
I said eat up.

27
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,360
I made it for you.

28
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:19,479

I won't tell you anything!

If you won't listen to me,

33
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:41,159
I'll make Xie Yi

come here and keep you company.

35
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:55,960
Very well.

36
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:57,680

What's going on?

42
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,079
I have no idea!

43
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,480
Everyone is busy putting out the fire!

44
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,160

Ms. Shi, you're finally here.

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,959
Something happened at Lantian Bay.

48
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,920
When was this?

49
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,639
Just now, the construction site called

50
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,879
and said the fire is under control.

51
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,360
Fortunately, no one was hurt.

52
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,680
Does Mr. Li know?

53
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,600
Mr. Li and Xie Yi have gone there.

56
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,319
Mr. Xie!

57
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,759
Something happened
at the Lantian Bay construction site.

58
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,000
Here, Ms. Shi. Have a seat.

59
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,600
Here.

60
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:23,800
I didn't expect things

61
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,160
to turn out this way.

62
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,759
The initial plan was for you

63
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,000
to expose this batch
of insulation materials

64
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:28,800
during the on-site inspection

65
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,040
by shareholders at the end of the month.

66
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,079
Now that things
have turned out this way,

67
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,120
I have no idea what to do as well.

68
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,079
The fire on the construction site

69
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,519
isn't just

70
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:38,959
Ocean's internal issue.

71
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,399
This will directly put Ocean

72
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:42,079
in the firing line.

73
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:43,720
That's right.

74
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,480
Ms. Shi.

75
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,240
Have you thought about this?

76
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,000
This might be God's will.

77
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:58,839
Think about it.

78
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,120
It was Xie Yi

79
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,319
who bought that batch of materials.

80
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,759
Now that there's a fire,

81
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,360
God is helping you

82
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,680
to win Li Ze Liang's heart back.

83
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,319
Mr. Li

84
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,040
has been blinded by his emotions.

85
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,319
You're the only one

86
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,560
who can show him the truth.

87
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,959
Now that this has happened,

88
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:18,759
why don't

89
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,639
we bring the plan forward?

90
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:24,639
All right.

91
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,279
Let's proceed

92
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,680
as we discussed then.

93
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,079
Next, they'll get to

94
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,240
that batch of insulation materials.

95
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,480
Use this opportunity

96
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,360
to point out Su Xie Yi's mistakes.

97
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,439
Let Mr. Li see the truth.

98
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,720
As to how to deal with this PR crisis,

99
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,839
I believe you can handle it.

100
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,920
Why would this happen?

101
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,680
Did you find out the cause of the fire?

102
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,759
Based on our preliminary assessment,

103
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,519
the overloaded ventilator

104
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,800
caused the circuit to catch fire

105
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,199
and ignite the insulation material

106
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,920
in the warehouse.

107
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,480
The ventilator?

108
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,000
Did you not know

109
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,120
the output of the ventilator

110
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,319
and the correct usage of it?

111
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,360
We use this kind of ventilator

112
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,800
at all our warehouse construction sites.

113
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:30,079
It's procured through proper channels.

114
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,240
By right, there shouldn't be a problem.

115
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,319
Even if it was overloaded,

116
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:35,160
only the circuit would catch fire.

117
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,519
It wouldn't burn

118
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,279
all the insulation materials
in the warehouse.

119
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,160
That said,

120
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,519
there is a problem with this batch

121
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,360
of insulation materials.

122
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,120
That's most likely the case.

123
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,560
Do a thorough investigation.

124
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:58,920
Before I return to the company,

125
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,800
I want to see
the detailed investigation report.

126
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:01,600
Yes.

127
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:03,639
Cease all operations for today.

128
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,160
Keep a lid on this.

129
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:05,959
Okay.

130
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:07,920

of the investigation are out?

134
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,039
After the fire broke out,

135
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,000
the police went to the scene

136
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,440
to conduct an investigation
and collect evidence.

137

147
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,440
Did you take a good look?

148
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,600
It's clearly written on the report

149
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,559
that this batch of insulation materials

150
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,240
did not comply

151
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,840
with the company's Class A standards.

152
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,720
All the materials in the warehouse

153
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,480
are of Class B extruded board.

154
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,960
But the strange thing

155
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:01,759
is that

156
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:02,679
it was stated as Class A

157
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,360
in the contract that you brought back.

158
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,279
On the day the materials arrived,

159
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,679
you personally inspected
and accepted them.

160
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,679
I did check that batch of materials.

161
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,679
The label

162
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:13,879
clearly stated Class A.

163
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,480
I wanted to believe you.

164
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,679
So after I got the report,

165
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,200
I contacted the manufacturer.

166
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:20,480
They said

167
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,600
the supplier

168
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,120
asked them to do this.

169
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,799
You were the one

170
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,440
who found this supplier.

171
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,039
Ms. Shi, are you suspecting me?

172
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,679
It's hard for me not to think that.

173
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,600
But why would I do that?

174
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,000
That's because

175
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:37,799
you're Shen Zhi Hong's daughter,

176
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,639
the owner of Zhiwei Corporation.

177
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,240
You suspected that Zhiwei's bankruptcy

178
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,440
had something to do with Ocean.

179
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,320
That is why

180
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,039
you approached Ze Liang,

181
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,039
got into Ocean

182
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:48,159
just to wait for the right time

183
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,120
to take Ocean down.

184
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:50,840
Right after Ocean

185
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,759
made a promise

186
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:52,720
to ensure the quality

187
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,240
of the Lantian Bay project,

188
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,519
this happened!

189
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,840
Su Xie Yi.

190
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,480
That's so cruel of you.

191
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:58,399
I did no such thing.

192
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:08,440
Xie Yi.

193
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,639
All I want to know now

194
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,480
is how did you come across

195
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,320
this supplier?

196
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,840
Ming Hao introduced him to me.

197
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:18,519
Xie Ming Hao?

198
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,919
I get it now.

199
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:30,919
Xie Yi.

200
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,720
You may step outside now.

201
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:48,919
We can't delay this any further.

202
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,080
The media wants an answer.

203
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,120
I have the press conference

204
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,159
scheduled for tomorrow.

205
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,279
Announce the outcome

206
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,000
of the investigation
right there and then.

207
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,720
I got it.

208
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,200
Look what happened now.

209
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,480
Are you still trying to protect her?

210
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,240
Ms. Shi.

211
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,159
Don't worry.

212
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,480
I'll make sure

213
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,120
it's impartially handled.

214
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,480
But think about it.

215
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
If we link

216
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,559
these two incidents together,

217
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,519
it doesn't seem very much
like an accident.

218
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,879
I suspect

219
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,399
that someone's using

220
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:22,120
Su Xie Yi

221
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,440
to take down Ocean.

222
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:25,600
Okay.

223
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:29,679
Let's hope you can find out the truth
as soon as possible.

224
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,120
I will.

225
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,320
You know what?

226
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,759
It turns out that Su Xie Yi
is the daughter of the owner of Zhiwei.

227
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,399
How did you know?

228
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:53,200
Just now,

229
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,600
I wanted to pass Ms. Shi a document.

230
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,960
When I got to the door,

231
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,120
I heard the news.

232
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:58,679
It gave me a shock
that I dared not enter.

233
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,120
The great revenge
by the daughter who went bankrupt.

234
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,279
This is a big deal.

235
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,000
It's a shame.

236
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,279
Mr. Li treats her so well.

237
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,320
She turns out to be so vicious.

238
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:15,039
Are you girls so free that you have time

239
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,440
to talk behind people's back

240
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,039
during working hours?

241
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,360
Ming Yue.

242
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,720
You have to be careful.

243
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,200
You're so tight

244
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,360
with Su Xie Yi.

245
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:24,879
Beware. She might make use of you.

246
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,879
You girls

247
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:30,279
often enjoyed the coffee
that Xie Yi bought you.

248
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:31,919
How could you say such a thing?

249
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:33,440
Ming Yue.

250
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,440
They don't mean that.

251
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:36,799
This series of events

252
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:37,840
do raise eyebrows.

253
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,120
Raise eyebrows?

254
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:41,679
Look.

255
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,679
Whatever you say,

256
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:45,000
I believe

257
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,879
that Xie Yi isn't that kind of person.

258
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,000
But you can't tell a book by its cover.

259
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,679
There's no telling

260
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,279
if she was behind this fire.

261
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,559
I...

262
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,679
Don't make unfounded accusations.

263
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,200
But Zhiwei does have a beef

264
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,159
with Ocean.

265
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,320
Besides, Xie...

266
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,919
Hi, Mr. Li.

267
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,679
We haven't even

268
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:08,000
gotten to the bottom of things.

269
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,799
I've said this before.

270
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:15,519
No gossiping

271
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,799
in the office.

272
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:19,279
If I hear anyone

273
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:20,240
talking about this

274
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,519
behind my back again,

275
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,120
I'll have to get her to leave Ocean.

276
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:39,679
Are you not suspicious of me?

277
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:50,080
I've always believed in you.

278
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,360
But...

279
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,720
I'll use my own way

280
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,799
to get to the bottom of things.

281
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,159
Thank you.

282
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:07,960
Xie Yi.

283
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,440
That day,

284
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:11,840
I was being mean.

285
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,559
I solemnly

286
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,440
apologize to you about Xie Qing.

287
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,080
Xie Yi.

288
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:22,440
You can punish me however you want.

289
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,440
But don't ignore me.

290
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,720
At crucial times like this,

291
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,440
the more we should communicate
with one another.

292
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,960
I'll always be waiting for you.

293
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:36,039
When

294
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,600
I find out the truth,

295
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,320
I'll come back.

296
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,039
The truth about everything.

297
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,857
(Since the fire accident
at Lantian Bay is exposed,)

298
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,970
(Ocean Group's stock price
has continued to fall.)

299
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:11,519
Ming Hao.

300
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,639
What brings you here?

301
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,639
There is a problem
with that batch of insulation materials.

302
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,200
Let's talk inside.

303
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,600
Mr. Li.

304
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:25,360
I've investigated the matter.

305
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:26,159
No one on the construction site

306
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:27,200
uses this medicine.

307
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,480
That said,

308
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,840
someone else entered the factory.

309
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:33,840
I've checked the security footage.

310
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,519
Many people went in
and out of the place.

311
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:36,559
All were in uniform.

312
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:37,720
We couldn't get a clear picture
of the faces.

313
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,399
There are so many warehouses
in the factory.

314
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:44,279
Almost all are equipped
with ventilators.

315
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,840
But why is it so coincidentally

316
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,039
that the warehouse

317
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,039
where the insulation materials were
got on fire?

318
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,679
Isn't that too much of a coincidence?

319
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:52,279
I, too, suspect

320
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,559
that someone deliberately
set it on fire.

321
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,621
After the incident,

322
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,200
this account by the name He Jiang Hua

323
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,360
immediately

324
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,000
released a video of the fire scene.

325
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:02,639
The fire was extinguished

326
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:03,399
in less than an hour

327
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,279
after it started.

328
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,880
Lantian Bay is in the suburbs.

329
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,640
Why is it so coincidental?

330
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,519
Didn't this little brat say

331
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:10,640
that he went on a trip?

332
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,359
Why would he be back so soon?

333
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:16,599
He seems to be involved
in both incidents.

334
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:18,400
This He Jiang Hua

335
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,839
is very important.

336
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:22,920
He often makes
unannounced visits everywhere.

337
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,279
It's not difficult for him

338
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,480
to sneak

339
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,960
into the factory and set a fire.

340
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,400
Just now, Ms. Su did tell me

341
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,400
that He Jiang Hua is using

342
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,279
the same rhinitis inhalation.

343
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,400
Why don't I ask him to come over?

344
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,480
We have no proof right now.

345
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:37,839
We can't go toe-to-toe with him.

346
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:41,680
Will he answer if you call him?

347
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,000
He might not answer my call.

348
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,359
But that doesn't mean

349
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,240
he won't answer other people's calls.

350
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:50,720
Those in the media industry like him

351
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,480
are only after scoops.

352
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,960
He's obsessed

353
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,599
with exposing Ocean, isn't he?

354
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:59,799
We can take advantage of that.

355
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:00,920
Understood.

356
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,700
(Hua)

357
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:15,119
Hi, Mr. He.

358
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,960
Who's this?

359
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:19,279
I'm a fan of yours.

360
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:20,720
I've been following your account

361
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:21,759
for a long time.

362
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,960
These days,

363
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,680
there aren't many conscientious people

364
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,079
with a great sense of responsibility

365
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,519
like you in the media industry.

366
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,039
I have great admiration for you.

367
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,599
Not at all.

368
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:31,720
But...

369
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,720
this is my number at work.

370
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,160
If there's nothing else,

371
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:36,480
enough with the chitchat.

372
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,160
Don't.

373
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:40,319
Why would I call you for nothing, right?

374
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,400
Well...

375
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:42,839
I am

376
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,359
the foreman at the Lantian Bay
construction site.

377
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:48,400
I feel so pumped

378
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,039
after seeing your report.

379
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:51,480
I happen

380
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,640
to have some

381
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,599
inside information about Lantian Bay.

382
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,240
I hope you can help to give us a voice.

383
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:00,000
Do you know

384
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:01,839
if they have

385
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,960
some other frauds?

386
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:06,039
It's not convenient
to talk over the phone.

387
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:07,640
We should set up a meeting place

388
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:09,519
and I'll bring you the evidence
and information

389
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,559
and show them to you.

390
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,359
Okay.

391
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,000
I'll find a place

392
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,720
and send you the location.

393
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:17,480
Okay.

394
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,920
I'll wait to hear from you.

395
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:23,440
He agreed to meet up.

396
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:25,799
Mr. Li.

397
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,599
The press conference is scheduled
for tomorrow.

398
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,559
If we can prove

399
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,480
that He Jiang Hua is the arsonist,

400
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:31,640
catching him

401
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,440
will give us a chance
to make a comeback.

402
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,759
I won't miss this opportunity.

403
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:46,319
Why would it turn out this way?

404
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,519
That supplier

405
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,519
has a good track record.

406
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,119
But I couldn't reach him now.

407
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,200
His phone has been turned off

408
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,720
and even his office is closed.

409
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,839
Can you find him?

410
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:56,720
All right.

411
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,240
I'll help to ask around.

412
00:19:58,839 --> 00:19:59,599
I'm counting on you.

413
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:00,759
I still have work to do.

414
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,720
I'll get going now.

415
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,799
Leaving so soon?

416
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,200
Ming Hao.

417
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,359
Have you been bringing lunch
to the office lately?

418
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,519
That's right.

419
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,720
I feel worn out these days.

420
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,680
I didn't want to order in.

421
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:23,119
I just wanted
to prepare the food myself.

422
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,839
Take care of yourself.

423
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,720
This is my sister's favorite.

424
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,079
That's right.

425
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,240
I don't know what else I can do.

426
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:32,799
Whenever I think of her,

427
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,440
I'll have some of her favorite foods.

428
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,200
It can help to ease

429
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,160
the pain of missing her.

430
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,880
I know it's hard to let go.

431
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,200
But still, we have to look forward.

432
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:47,960
Thank you.

433
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:50,440
Well, I'll get going then.

434
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,759
Let me know if you hear anything.

435
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:54,519
I'll walk you out.

436
00:20:59,079 --> 00:20:59,759
Just get back to your work.

437
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,680
Be safe.

438
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:04,160
Okay.

439
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:11,519
Hello?

440
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:12,519
What's wrong?

441
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:37,559
Hi, Mr. He.

442
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,480
I'm here.

443
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:39,960
Which private room are you in?

444
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,440
I'm in Songhe Hall.

445
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:43,119
Come alone.

446
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:45,279
Okay.

447
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:48,680
Mr. Li.

448
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:49,680
He's in Songhe Hall.

449
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:50,599
He specifically emphasized

450
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:51,799
that I should go alone.

451
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,960
Wait here for me.

452
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:56,160
I'll meet him.

453
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,720
I'll call you if there's anything.

454
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:29,880
Mr. Li.

455
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,400
You don't seem so surprised

456
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,359
to see me.

457
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:33,799
Likewise.

458
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,440
You aren't surprised to see me.

459
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,480
So my speculation was right.

460
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,519
Tell me about it.

461
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,000
Lantian Bay project

462
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:47,119
has a delicate nature.

463
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:50,000
I even gave my word

464
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:51,799
that there would be no frauds.

465
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:52,880
So

466
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:54,480
if anything goes wrong

467
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,480
with Lantian Bay project

468
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:56,440
at this very moment,

469
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,680
it will surely

470
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:59,480
hit Ocean hard and fast.

471
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,519
It was you who introduced Xie Yi

472
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:02,960
to that supplier.

473
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,880
You took advantage of the trust
that Xie Yi had in you.

474
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:06,799
Also,

475
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,359
you were too eager
to set things in motion

476
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,000
and set up a trap for her.

477
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,200
So

478
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,920
you must have instructed the supplier

479
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,960
to secretly swap
that batch of materials.

480
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:18,400
Then?

481
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:20,640
Based on the two discoveries

482
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,799
made by He Jiang Hua,

483
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,960
he seemed

484
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,759
to have known the exact time

485
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,279
and be the first

486
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,680
to expose the news.

487
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:30,759
It was so coincidental

488
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,119
as though he was the one
who set the fire.

489
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:36,119
If I'm right,

490
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,079
you're the one

491
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:39,039
behind all this.

492
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:45,279
Mr. Li is indeed very smart.

493
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,880
You're so quick to admit it.

494
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,200
That's right. It was my doing.

495
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:51,000
Very well.

496
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,519
I'll invite the media

497
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,519
and hold a press conference.

498
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:54,599
Make sure

499
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,799
you'll be there when it happens.

500
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,599
You're the key witness for me

501
00:23:58,799 --> 00:23:59,799
to set the record straight.

502
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:01,400
Don't worry, Mr. Li.

503
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,880
I'll surely be there.

504
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,319
But before that,

505
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,359
I have a little something

506
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:07,799
that might pique your interest.

507
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:18,079
(I did check that batch of materials.)

508
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:18,880
(The label)

509
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,079
(clearly stated Class A.)

510
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,880
I wanted to believe you.

511
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,039
So after I got the report,

512
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:25,519
I contacted the manufacturer.

513
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:26,640
(They said)

514
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:28,000
(the supplier)

515
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:29,160
(asked them to do this.)

516
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,839
Please verify the details.

517
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,519
If there's no issue,

518
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:32,519
we can proceed

519
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,599
to sign the contract.

520
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,079
There's no need to go through it.

521
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:38,640
The contract was prepared by Mr. Xie.

522
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,519
I trust him.

523
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,519
Besides, I've gone through

524
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:44,000
the electronic version
over a dozen times.

525
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,839
Let's just sign and stamp it.

526
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:53,799
(Miss Su.)

527
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,079
(Did you meet He Jiang Hua)

528
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,480
(in the restaurant the other day?)

529
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,559
(I did.)

530
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,039
But I thought

531
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,759
he was just an ordinary customer.

532
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,480
Miss Su.

533
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,519
Mr. He.

534
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,839
What a coincidence.
Did you come to buy books too?

535
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,640
That's right.

536
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,039
I travel a lot.

537
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,359
So I came to take a look around

538
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:11,240
at the bookstore near the hotel

539
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,960
and picked two books.

540
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,440
(This is all)

541
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,599
(directed at me.)

542
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:17,839
(It's like)

543
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,480
(someone's pulling the strings.)

544
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:24,960
Class B insulation boards

545
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,799
can also be used as insulation

546
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,759
for building exterior walls.

547
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:30,799
As to why the Class A insulation board

548
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,160
was not used

549
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,200
in accordance
with Ocean's previous standards,

550
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:37,160
it's all entirely my decision.

551
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:39,799
It has nothing to do with Ms. Su Xie Yi.

552
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,880
Li Ze Liang, stand right there!

553
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:52,119
Are you out of your mind?

554
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:54,200
Have you considered the consequences?

555
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,039
What do you think I should do?

556
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,440
Push all the blame

557
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,839
on Su Xie Yi?

558
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:07,839
Then, push her out

559
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:08,839
and let her come under fire

560
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:09,839
in order

561
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:10,920
to protect Ocean's reputation?

562
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,680
But this is clearly her fault.

563
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,480
It's the material

564
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,039
she bought

565
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:17,279
that caused the fire.

566
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:18,599
You did this for this woman

567
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:19,480
who's up to no good.

568
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,400
Is it worth it?

569
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:22,480
I'm the chairman of Ocean

570
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,240
and also the largest shareholder.

571
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,920
I'll be responsible

572
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,599
for the decision I make.

573
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,960
Li Ze Liang, let me remind you.

574
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:31,079
You might be the chairman.

575
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:31,960
But Ocean

576
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:33,559
doesn't belong to you alone.

577
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,599
I'm well aware of that.

578
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,960
You're a lost cause!

579
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,640
You'll regret your decision.

580
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:01,240
Why did you do that?

581
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:04,079
I told you

582
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,240
I would clear your name.

583
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,440
You're not clearing my name.

584
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,079
You apologizing lightly

585
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,000
will only make things harder
for yourself.

586
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,319
The die is cast.

587
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,119
There's no need to look into it
any further.

588
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,200
What have you gone through

589
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,880
to reclaim Ocean?

590
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,240
Have you forgotten all that?

591
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:28,759
What you said today

592
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,359
before the media

593
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,319
will cause Ocean's stock price
to plummet.

594
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,359
That's the business

595
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:34,920
that your father
had spent his lifetime building.

596
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:35,880
Su Xie Yi.

597
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:37,480
You're in no position

598
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,640
to teach me

599
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,799
what to say or do.

600
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,200
I have the right to decide

601
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:45,519
on how Ocean will deal with the problem.

602
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:49,480
Think about it.

603
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,000
There must be a reason behind all this.

604
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,480
You said it yourself.

605
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,720
What we need now

606
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,920
is to communicate

607
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,440
and solve the problem together.

608
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,920
I've given you the chance to do that.

609
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,119
But the ship has sailed.

610
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,020
(Board Chairman)

611
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:43,880
Mr. Li, don't worry.

612
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,200
I'll surely be there.

613
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:46,559
But before that,

614
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,599
I have a little something

615
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:49,240
that might pique your interest.

616
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:02,960
(Debit Card Account Statement)
It's all recorded in the statement.

617
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,279
The supplier

618
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:05,119
privately sent

619
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,200
a sum of money to Xie Yi.

620
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,359
Three million in total.

621
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,039
Mr. Xie, you sure are a professional.

622
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,359
What a flawless

623
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,039
frame job you have here.

624
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,839
But what can this statement

625
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,400
prove?

626
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,519
Xie Yi signed the contract
with the supplier.

627
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:24,440
The company has a backup copy.

628
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,359
It's written clearly on it.

629
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:27,559
I, too, have a copy

630
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:28,799
of the contract that you talked about.

631
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,400
(Class B3)

632
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,370
(Ocean Hotel Corporation)

633
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,519
Xie Ming Hao.

634
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,359
You forged the contract.

635
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:04,759
Don't you recognize
Xie Yi's handwriting?

636
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,319
But it's nothing difficult.

637
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,880
If necessary,

638
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,240
I can ask an authoritative organization

639
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:09,839
to analyze it.

640
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,000
That supplier is my friend.

641
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,599
He told me

642
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:16,440
that it was Xie Yi who instructed them

643
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,839
to sign this dual contract,

644
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:19,799
and she also specifically ordered

645
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,960
for the B3 extruded board

646
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,720
to be packed into
a Class A material package.

647
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,640
She asked for a colossal amount
of money.

648
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:26,599
Three million.

649
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:28,519
If necessary,

650
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:29,119
I can arrange for you

651
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,279
to meet with the supplier.

652
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:30,839
Of course.

653
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,000
They'll tell you

654
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,400
the same narrative.

655
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,160
You've bought

656
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,799
that supplier, right?

657
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:39,599
It's their words

658
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:40,599
against her.

659
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,799
I won't take their words for it.

660
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,680
I knew you would think this way.

661
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,400
So

662
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:45,480
I prepared

663
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,519
a small surprise for you.

664
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,519
(Miss Su.)

665
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,759
(I like this about you.)

666
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,440
(You dive just right in.)

667
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:55,519
(How about this?)

668
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,880
(I can give you)

669
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:58,759
(10 percent of the rebate.)

670
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,119
(Make it 20 percent.)

671
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:02,480
(Miss Su.)

672
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,279
(You asked us)

673
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:06,359
(to use B3 materials
to replace those of Class A)

674
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,960
(and we could make some money from it.)

675
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:10,200
(But the profit margin)

676
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,400
(isn't as much as you think.)

677
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:12,640
(Besides,)

678
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,839
(do you have any idea
how much 10 percent is?)

679
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:16,880
(It's about three million.)

680
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,119
(After all,)

681
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,599
(we're just trying to make a living.)

682
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:20,799
(All right.)

683
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:22,279
(I'll text you now.)

684
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:23,720
(I've received
your bank account number.)

685
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:25,039
(After the deal goes through,)

686
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,240
(I'll transfer the fee for the rebate)

687
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:27,200
(to the bank account number)

688
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,720
(that you provided.)

689
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,599
(Please accept this little gift.)

690
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:31,799
(Don't mention it.)

691
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:33,119
(It's nice working with you.)

692
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,319
Oh, right.

693
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,440
Let me

694
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:39,000
briefly explain it to you.

695
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:40,880
Three million meets

696
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,480
corresponding standards

697
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,160
of extremely large monetary amount.

698
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:44,599
Based on the amount

699
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,720
of remittance
from the supplier to Xie Yi,

700
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:47,880
the sentence should be
at least ten years

701
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,920
or even life imprisonment.

702
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:52,119
Now, I have the evidence, witness,

703
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:53,559
and Xie Yi's motive

704
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,480
for revenge.

705
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,640
Xie Ming Hao.

706
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,119
I never thought you would even do

707
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,960
something like this to Xie Yi.

708
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:04,759
Feeling heartache for her?

709
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,799
The choice is yours.

710
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:09,880
It's either you protect Xie Yi

711
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,799
and take the blame.

712
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:11,640
That

713
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,720
will cost Ocean its reputation

714
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:13,599
and lead to bankruptcy.

715
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,319
You know better.

716
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,839
Or you can rat Xie Yi out

717
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:18,039
and I'll hand over the evidence.

718
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,119
In that case,

719
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:20,240
I'm afraid

720
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:22,200
you can only visit her in jail.

721
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,000
The tug between power and love.

722
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,000
This has always been an eternal dilemma.

723
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,799
I'm really curious

724
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,640
as to how you will choose.

725
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:06,160
Since you've called

726
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:07,400
and asked me here,

727
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,720
you can just cut to the chase.

728
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,440
You must have heard what Yan said

729
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:14,880
at the press conference

730
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,160
today.

731
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:17,559
I was just beside him.

732
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:18,519
I heard him.

733
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:20,039
Well, do you know

734
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:21,319
the reason

735
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:22,000
he said that?

736
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:24,000
Miss Su, you're a smart person.

737
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,000
It shouldn't be hard to figure out

738
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:27,519
that Mr. Li said that

739
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:28,839
to protect you, right?

740
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,160
I know that.

741
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,559
But based on my understanding of him,

742
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,519
he isn't the kind to make a trade-off

743
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,680
and take the blame
without careful consideration.

744
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,279
It does strike me as a little odd.

745
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:40,039
After the fire accident at Lantian Bay,

746
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,039
Mr. Li was investigating the incident

747
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,119
and he even arranged a meeting
with He Jiang Hua.

748
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,519
Did he meet He Jiang Hua then?

749
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,839
No.

750
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,799
But he met someone else.

751
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,079
Who?

752
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,240
Xie Ming Hao.

753
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,039
Ming Hao?

754
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,839
Did they meet by chance?

755
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:01,319
No.

756
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,000
Mr. Li went into the private room

757
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,599
that He Jiang Hua booked.

758
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,599
Then, both of them walked out together.

759
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:11,920
He arranged a meeting with He Jiang Hua.

760
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,679
Why would Ming Hao

761
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,840
be in there?

762
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,280
From what I see,

763
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:18,239
it's all very clear now.

764
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,679
He Jiang Hua and Xie Ming Hao

765
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,679
are in it together.

766
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:21,760
Actually, Mr. Li

767
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,920
has long suspected him.

768
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,039
But I could tell

769
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,119
that he found it hard to talk to you

770
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,119
about certain things.

771
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:29,000
Miss Su.

772
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,480
Think about it calmly.

773
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,599
Who introduced the supplier to you?

774
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:33,760
If you didn't commit fraud

775
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,039
on the purchase
of this batch of materials,

776
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,920
who could it be?

777
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,519
Think deeper.

778
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:40,639
Mr. Li speculated that the fire
at the warehouse

779
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,639
was man-made

780
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,159
and he suspected
it was He Jiang Hua's doing,

781
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,320
so he asked him to meet up.

782
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,119
But the one who showed up
was Xie Ming Hao.

783
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,840
First, it's He Jiang Hua
and Xie Ming Hao.

784
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:50,639
Then, the supplier and Xie Ming Hao.

785
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,679
Don't you find it suspicious?

786
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:58,079
Well, what did he say

787
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,320
after he met Ming Hao?

788
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,000
I did ask him

789
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,519
when I sent him back.

790
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,000
But he didn't say anything.

791
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:04,880
But I could tell

792
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,599
he wasn't in good shape.

793
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,280
Initially, Mr. Li

794
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,280
was going to announce

795
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,880
the investigation results to the police

796
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:12,000
and the media

797
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,960
and suspected the possibility of arson.

798
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,280
But right before the reporters,

799
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:16,840
he totally changed his stance.

800
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:19,039
I think

801
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,599
this has something to do

802
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:21,840
with his private conversation
with Xie Ming Hao.

803
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,159
Mr. Ji, thank you

804
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:28,039
for telling me all this.

805
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,639
The opinions expressed

806
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:31,559
are solely my own.

807
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,719
I don't mean anything else.

808
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:34,119
Also, Mr. Li doesn't know

809
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:35,119
that you asked to see me.

810
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,159
Xie Qing.

811
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:51,880
If you were still alive,

812
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,159
I bet you wouldn't believe

813
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,639
that these things
are related to Ming Hao.

814
00:35:58,679 --> 00:35:59,239
Right?

815
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,360
Perhaps, I shouldn't have come back.

816
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:09,559
That way, Yan

817
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,039
wouldn't have gotten
into all these troubles.

818
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,360
And you would still be fine.

819
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:20,239
So many things have happened.

820
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:24,719
Tell me. What should I do?

821
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,360
(To my beloved sister, Xie Yi.)

822
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,880
(If you're reading this,)

823
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,880
(it means I have lost yet another bet.)

824
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,440
(All my life,)

825
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:06,280
(I've had so many regrets.)

826
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:09,039
(But my biggest regret)

827
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:10,559
(is not able)

828
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,280
(to find true love.)

829
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:14,599
(Xie Ming Hao doesn't love me.)

830
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,559
(He was just pretending)

831
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:17,840
(to love me.)

832
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:19,400
(He only treats me as a tool)

833
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:21,519
(for seeking revenge against Zhiwei.)

834
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:23,880
(Actually, the one he likes all along)

835
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:26,280
(is you.)

836
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,679
(In order to get you,)

837
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,599
(he would do whatever it takes.)

838
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,559
(He would go on
a revenge spree on anyone)

839
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,199
(who stopped him from loving you.)

840
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,239
(If you receive this doll)

841
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,960
(from Xie Ming Hao,)

842
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,360
(please stay away from him
because he must have)

843
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:41,960
(started to hatch a sinister plot)

844
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,159
(against you.)

845
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,639
(Also, please protect)

846
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:46,880
(your loved ones)

847
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,440
(and those who love you.)

848
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:51,559
(Xie Yi.)

849
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:53,119
(Weak as I am,)

850
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,679
(I have to confess)

851
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:56,599
(my crime to you.)

852
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,960
(I've made a huge mistake.)

853
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,000
(I'm responsible)

854
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,800
(for Zhiwei's bankruptcy.)

855
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,199
(So)

856
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:07,159
(I'll pay the price)

857
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,199
(for my mistake.)

858
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,000
(I don't expect)

859
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:11,599
(your forgiveness.)

860
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,880
(I just hope)

861
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,440
(you can live happily forever.)

862
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,639
(If there is an afterlife,)

863
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,599
(I hope)

864
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:22,840
(From your sister, Xie Qing)
(we can become real sisters.)

865
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,400
Drink some water.

866
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:08,000
Very good.

867
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:10,800
As long as you behave,

868
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,599
I promise

869
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,840
I'll still be nice to you

870
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,679
like I did.

871
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:16,559
Leave the container here
after you're done eating.

872
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,760
I'll collect it tomorrow.

873
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,320
How's Xie Yi?

874
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:27,239
Like I said,

875
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,239
if you do as I say,

876
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:30,360
she'll be fine.

877
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:31,800
I want to see her.

878
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,400
Can I?

879
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:36,440
Sure.

880
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,480
When?

881
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,679
Tomorrow, perhaps.

882
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:44,119
Or maybe next year.

883
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,840
After I take care of everything,

884
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:47,039
I'll let you two meet up.

885
