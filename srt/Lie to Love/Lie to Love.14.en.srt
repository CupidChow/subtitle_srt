Yes.

00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,319
You must be...

24
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,520
You must be the boss.

00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:23,919
Yes.

26
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:24,800
What would you like to get?

27
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,879
Well, sir.

28
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,159
Did a girl

29
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,840
sell you a bracelet yesterday?

30
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:30,919
Yes.

31
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:33,280
She said she'd redeem it one day.

32
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,360
May I have a look?

33
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,400
Sure.

34
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,879
Are you referring to this?

35
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,439
Yes, it is.

36
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,879
Well,

37
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,280
I am her friend.

38
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,199
Can you give it to me?

39
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,080
I paid 2,000 yuan for this.

40
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,360
So, why don't you

41
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,680
pay me 200 yuan as a safe-keeping fee?

42
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,639
No problem.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,840
Mr. Li, you're here too.

44
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,039
Mr. Xie.

45
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,080
The good hasn't left the counter.

46
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,319
It's not considered sold.

47
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,599
Sell the bracelet to me instead.

48
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,080
I've just

49
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,159
closed a deal with this gentleman.

50
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,400
He'd be paying 200 yuan extra.

51

Come on. Let me scan your code.

52
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,360
I'll pay 500 yuan extra.

53
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:12,360
Sir,

54
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:13,919
we must be fair

55
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,280
when doing business.

56
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:16,919
He came here first.

57
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:18,240
Come on.

58
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,879
I'll pay 1,000 yuan extra.

59
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,800
Isn't doing business

60
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,680
all about making money?

61
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,080
Here. Scan the code.

62
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,080
10,000 yuan.

63
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:30,800
You'll scan it.

64
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:31,800
15,000 yuan.

65
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,479
Here, scan it.

66
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,039
20,000 yuan.

67
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:33,400
You'll scan it.

68
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,439
40,000 yuan.

69
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:35,240
Scan it now.

70
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,199
The auction has started earlier.

71
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,919
Why am I not informed?

72
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:41,120
Xie Yi.

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'll redeem the bracelet myself.

74
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,680
Wait for me outside.

75
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,000
I'll wait for you outside.

76
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,840
Don't leave.

77
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:58,960
Are you going to pay?

78
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,479
Sir,

79
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,759
you still don't get it?

80
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,960
What did I tell you yesterday?

81
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,240
Yesterday, you...

82
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:11,960
"Sir,

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,840
my boyfriend

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,759
is in the first aid room now.

85
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,639
He needs some nutrition.

86
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,800
I don't have any money with me.

87
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,399
This bracelet was a gift from my dad."

88
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,680
That's what you said.

89
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:27,800
Yes.

90
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,759
Their lives

91
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:31,560
have been saved.

92
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,120
But

93
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,639
here,

94
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,120
they've been left with a sequela.

95
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:39,199
Are they fools?

96
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,800
Then, they've fooled me.

97
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:42,360
Yes,

98
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,680
they've fooled you.

99
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:44,879
Now,

100
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,040
I will keep my promise

101
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,800
and pay 200 yuan extra
to redeem this bracelet.

102
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,639
If you're not OK with that,

103
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:50,759
then you may keep it.

104
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,560
No, no.

105
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,279
I... I don't want to keep it.

106
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:52,839
Just take it away now.

107
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,360
I can't explain myself clearly

108
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,839
if I take women's stuff home.

109
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:55,879
Thank you, sir.

110
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,120

top corporate lawyer.

116
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:31,240
You wanted to spend 40,000 yuan
to redeem a bracelet.

117
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,680
How did you come up with this amount?

118
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,759
It's good that you've redeemed
the bracelet.

119

Let's go.

120
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,480
Xie Yi.

121
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,120
Why don't you take Mr. Li's car?

122
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,319
I have something

123
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,800
to discuss with Mr. Li.

124
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,759
Stay safe on the way back.

125
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:03,360
Go ahead.

126
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:11,040
Call me when you arrive at the hotel.

127
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,959
I reckon you know

128
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,399
that there's a mastermind

129
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,319
behind Chen Heng Sheng.

130
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,120
So?

131
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,000
This mastermind

132
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,120
arranged for Chen Heng Sheng

133
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,279
to use Xie Yi for the poisoning.

134
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,120
Have you thought about

135
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,000
his motive?

136
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,000
I know this better than you do.

137
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,639
Whether it was Lin Tai's surprise attack

138
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:43,959
or using poison

139
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,800
to sabotage the auction,

140
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,879
the real target had been you.

141
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,199
Xie Yi has been very lucky two times.

142
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:50,920
But what about the next time?

143
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,160
Have you thought of it?

144
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,800
Well, I'm responsible too.

145
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:00,600
If previously

146
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,079
I didn't allow Xie Yi to return home,

147
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,439
these incidents wouldn't have happened.

148
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,639
It looks like

149
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,839
you already have your own plan.

150
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,959
I will take Xie Yi

151
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,160
and leave this place
as soon as possible.

152
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
Will she go with you?

153
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,319
To be honest,

154
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,519
I can feel

155
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,720
your love for Xie Yi.

156
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,839
But considering the current situation,

157
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,720
we must make sensible decisions

158
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,780
instead of acting impetuously.

159
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,560
You care more about

160
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,279
Xie Yi's safety than me, don't you?

161
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,480
You're right.

162
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,480
Leaving

163
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,120
is indeed

164
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,439
the safest way for Xie Yi.

165
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:45,439
But

166
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,720
when everything is over,

167
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:49,920
I will bring her back myself.

168
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,250
(Dr. Wu)

169
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,440

00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,399
Hello, Dr. Zhu.

176
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:57,320
What?

177
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,240
Hello, Ming Hao.

178
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,240
Where are you?

179
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,200
I just parked my car.
I'll be heading upstairs.

180
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,799
Okay. I'll be there right away.

181
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,519
Xie Yi,

182
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,960
what's so urgent?

183
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,200
Ming Hao,

184
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,679
Dr. Zhu

185
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,480
just called me.

186
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,000
Why would Dr. Zhu call you?

187
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:23,759
He said

188
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:25,000
they required my signature

189
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,559
for my sister's discharge.

190
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,960
What's going on?

191
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,720
This is the situation.

192
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,799
Xie Qing's condition

193
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,919
has improved tremendously.

194
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,039
She often talks about you

195
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:36,720
and mention

196
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:37,600
her childhood.

197
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,000
When she knew that I'd take her

198
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,120
to Germany for recuperation,

199
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,879
she asked

200
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,000
whether you'd be there
to keep her company.

201
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,759
Initially, I didn't want you
to return there,

202
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,000
but the doctor said

203
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,559
they require the signature
of an immediate family member

204
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,120
for her discharge.

205
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,080
You do know

206
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,840
that Xie Qing's condition

207
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,840
isn't stable all along.

208
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,440
But she has finally gotten better.

209
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,039
She's more willing to accept

210
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:00,840
your company.

211
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,000
What do you think?

212
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,240
This is a rare opportunity.

213
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,879
I'd like to keep my sister company too.

214
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,240
But...

215
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:10,159
Xie Yi,

216
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,480
are you worried that Li Ze Liang

217
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:14,039
can't handle it alone?

218
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,039
I believe he can do it.

219
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:18,200
But

220
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,960
if I stay,

221
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,720
I can help him better.

222
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,960
We're certain

223
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,159
that Huo Jian has framed Zhiwei

224
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,279
and caused it to go bankrupt.

225
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,399
When you mentioned the bigger picture,

226
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,440
whose bigger picture
were you referring to?

227
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:32,399
Xie Yi,

228
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:34,519
Huo Jian

229
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,320
has seen through your identity.

230
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,759
What?

231
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,399
Listen to this recording,

232
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:44,559
and you'll understand everything.

233
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:46,320
Answer me.

234
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,240
Why did you go after Su Xie Yi?

235
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,519
Because

236
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,080
she was investigating Yunfeng's liquor.

237
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:57,720
Do you really believe this?

238
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,519
You poisoned

239
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,960
the liquor she made for Mrs. Roman.

240
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:04,039
Weren't you asking for trouble?

241
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:12,360
I admit

242
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,480
that the ultimate goal

243
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:19,720
of framing Su Xie Yi was to get to

244
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,720
Li Ze Liang.

245
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,200
Only by sabotaging the auction

246
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,240
would Li Ze Liang

247
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,440
lose his power in
Ocean's Board of Directors.

248
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,519
Then, why did you pick Su Xie Yi?

249
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:33,080
Mrs. Roman

250
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,360
likes the drinks she makes.

251
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:35,440
And she happens to be

252
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,639
Li Ze Liang's girlfriend.

253
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,679
And he is the designated partner

254
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,759
of the group's

255
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,039
auction event.

256
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:44,200
That's not right.

257
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,039
You need more than that

258
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,399
to justify your story.

259
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,240
You would need

260
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,480
a motive for her to do this.

261
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,279
Someone found

262
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:00,960
that Su Xie Yi is the daughter of

263
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,639
Shen Zhi Hong, Zhiwei's former boss.

264
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:12,240
Your identity has been exposed.

265
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:13,679
To put it more seriously,

266
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,320
you've become the thorn

267
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,919
Huo Jian must get rid of.

268
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,960
Then, all my efforts

269
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,240
are in vain.

270
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,919
I've been working so hard.

271
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,879
Yet, Huo Jian

272
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,960
is still at large.

273
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,600
Knowing my identity

274
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:29,320
shouldn't be the reason for me to leave.

275
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,960
First, Oscar was admitted
to the hospital due to food poisoning.

276
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,440
Then, Li Ze Liang encountered danger

277
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:36,759
when he saved you.

278
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:37,960
All these points

279
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,879
to Huo Jian's intention.

280
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:40,559
I know you.

281
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:43,200
You will never allow anyone
to keep taking risks

282
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:44,679
because of you.

283
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:46,559
That means

284
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,799
the longer I stay here,

285
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,080
the more danger Li Ze Liang
will encounter.

286
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:57,799
Huo Jian may even use me
as a bargaining chip

287
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,120
to threaten him.

288
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:00,559
Yes.

289
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,879
Is this what you've been discussing

290
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:04,840
with Li Ze Liang?

291
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:06,679
I could only tell you

292
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:07,879
that he didn't object 

293
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,720
my proposal

294
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:10,960
to take you abroad.

295
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,240
Don't worry.

296
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:15,440
You don't have to stay
in Ocean to deal with

297
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,279
Huo Jian.

298
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:18,919
I will continue
to investigate in secret.

299
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,120
After all,

300
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:21,919
if Huo Jian

301
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,799
takes on you again,

302
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,279
Li Ze Liang will definitely

303
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,639
fight against him till the end.

304
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,080
At that time,

305
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,840
things will get harder for you.

306
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:34,879
Ming Hao,

307
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,559
if I'm not wrong,

308
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:41,120
you've already booked

309
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,200
the flight tickets.

310
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:43,759
Yes.

311
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,440
We'll return to Shanghai
tomorrow morning.

312
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,240
We'll pick up your sister

313
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,000
and head to the airport.

314
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:53,879
Aren't you afraid

315
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,639
that I'll choose to stay?

316
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:57,519
I understand you well.

317
00:13:58,519 --> 00:13:59,240
I know you'll make

318
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,159
the right decision.

319
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,159
Maybe.

320
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,519
But before that,

321
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,879
there's one more thing I need to do.

322
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:15,559
It's a pleasure that Miss Su
asked to meet me.

323
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:16,960
Go ahead.

324
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:17,679
What's the matter?

325
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:19,879
Ms. Shi,

326
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,279
do you know how Ze Liang

327
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,679
injured his leg?

328
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,240
Why did you ask about this suddenly?

329
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:26,960
He told me

330
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:28,799
that he accidentally fell

331
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,799
when he was rock climbing

332
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:31,200
outdoor.

333
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,679
But at the hospital,

334
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,080
the doctor told me

335
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,919
that his injury didn't seem
to be caused by a fall.  

336
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:42,320
I'm sorry.

337
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,720
I was on a business trip two years ago.

338
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,639
When I returned,

339
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,039
he was already in the hospital.

340
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,120
The leg injury

341
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,879
is his taboo.

342
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:52,399
So, all these years,

343
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,559
I've never asked him,

344
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,519
and he's never talked about it.

345
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:01,039
I can tell

346
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,399
that you really care about him.

347
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:09,480
Actually, I've come today

348
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,320
to ask you

349
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,679
how you plan to deal with it

350
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:16,320
after experiencing these few dangers.

351
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:18,120
And how do you ensure the safety

352
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,320
of yourself and Ze Liang?

353
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,559
Miss Su,

354
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,639
I can do many things

355
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,279
that you can't.

356
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,200
I am the top management and shareholder

357
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:34,919
of Ocean Group.

358
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,360
And my dad's Hengye Bank

359
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,639
provides financial support

360
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:40,200
to Ocean Group.

361
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,000
Without Hengye's support,

362
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,120
this auction

363
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,399
would never see the light.

364
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,240
This is the reality.

365
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,120
Ms. Shi,

366
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,000
you're also advising me

367
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,960
to leave Ocean,

368
00:15:58,759 --> 00:15:59,360
right?

369
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,759
You like Ze Liang.

370
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,679
We're adults.

371
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,360
Right or wrong,

372
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:18,320
we know it well.

373
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,480
Sometimes, true love

374
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,519
is not about possessing

375
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:24,799
but letting go.

376
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,080
If you really care about Ze Liang,

377
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,679
I believe

378
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,360
you'll make the wisest decision.

379
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,279
I have something on.

380
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:36,519
I need to get going.

381
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,252
Thank you for your coffee.

382
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:54,919
You're back.

383
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,080
Just in time

384
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:02,879
to try my crab roe noodles.

385
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,279
Why are you still standing there?

386
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:14,400
Hurry up and wash your hands.

387
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,720
And eat the noodles.

388
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:16,960
Okay.

389
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,359
Why did you suddenly 

390
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:27,960
cook crab roe noodles in the hotel?

391
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,559
I passed by on the way back,

392
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:31,920
so I bought some.

393
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:33,720
What about you?

394
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,359
Where have you been?

395
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:36,680
Why did you come back so late?

396
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,799
I went...

397
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,279
I went to see Ming Hao.

398
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,039
Let's dig in.

399
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:58,480
Shouldn't we take a picture

400
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,759
of such beautiful noodles first?

401

Xie Yi,

402
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,559

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,720
If...

404
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:38,640
If you've made your decision,

405
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,240
I hope you two will leave tomorrow.

406
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,519
Huo Jian will be very busy tomorrow.

407
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:48,599
He won't have the energy to bother you.

408
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:49,720
After all,

409
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,279
I'm his biggest target.

410
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,160
What about you?

411
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,880
My identity is different from yours.

412
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,000
If he wants to take on me,

413
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:03,920
he has many things to weigh on.

414
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,680
He won't do anything harmful to me.

415
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:16,079
Eat.

416
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,240
I wish you a successful auction.

00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:17,279
Let's see how he'll deal with it.

517
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:53,000
Xie...

518
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,480
Chu Chu.

519
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,519
What's the matter?

520
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,440
The auction process is all set.

521
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,599
Before the opening,

522
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:11,400
you and Mr. Huo

523
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,599
will represent Yunfeng Hotel

524
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:14,000
and Ocean Group respectively
to give a speech.

525
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,160
Take a look. See if it's okay.

526
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:16,920
No need.

527
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,799
I trust you.

528
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:20,799
Just follow your plan.

529
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:21,680
Okay.

530
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,650
(Follow and Win a Voucher of Fifty Yuan)

531
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:01,720
(A must-see tree for couples
and the starry night sky went viral.)

532
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:32,000
Have some water.

533
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,039
When we return,

534
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,160
we'll first meet your sister.

535
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:38,039
If she's in good condition,

536
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,640
we'll depart immediately.

537
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,880
Just follow your plan.

538
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:50,640
Hello, Dr. Zhu.

539
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,559
How's Xie Qing?

540
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:54,720
Xie Qing is recovering well?

541
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,039
That's great.

542
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,000
We'll be coming tomorrow.

543
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:00,200
Thank you, Dr. Zhu.

544
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:04,160
Xie Qing is well.

545
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:06,960
The doctor said she's well-behaved
these two days.

546
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:08,839
She looks spirited.

547
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,440
That's good.

548
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:12,640
I've thought it through.

549
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,640
It's better for us to live

550
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:15,359
overseas.

551
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,279
In the future,

552
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,759
you, me, and Xie Qing,

553
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:20,680
the three of us,

554
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,839
will be just like in the past.

555
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:24,640
We'll never separate again.

556
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,039
Okay?

557
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,279
Keep warm.

558
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:45,599
I'll get you a cup of milk tea.

559
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,270
(Dr. Wu)

560
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:07,119
Hello, may I know who you are?

561
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,000
I saw many missed calls

562
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,400
from this number.

563
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:11,360
Dr. Wu,

564
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:13,000
nice to meet you.

565
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,079
I am Li Ze Liang's girlfriend.

566
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,239
Mr. Li has a girlfriend?

567
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,360
That's great.

568
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,599
Looks like he's recovering well.

569
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,599
No wonder

570
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,559
he contacts me less nowadays.

571
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:26,199
How can I help you?

572
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,559
I wanted to ask you

573
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:30,079
about the daily care for Yan's leg.

574
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,880
But I don't have to now.

575
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,119
Not everyone

576
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,079
can accept this reality.

577
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:40,400
You've misunderstood.

578
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:42,199
It's not because of his leg.

579
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:43,159
That's good then.

580
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,920
To save someone back then,

581
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:46,320
he was willing to lose his leg.

582
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:48,119
He's a good man.

583
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,119
What did you say?

584
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,440
To save someone,

585
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,519
his leg...

586
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,360
Yes.

587
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,559
That was two years ago.

588
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,199
While saving someone,

589
00:34:58,519 --> 00:34:59,440
he injured his leg.

590
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,880
Due to the rain and excessive bleeding,

591
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,800
his leg had been badly infected

592
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,480
when he arrived at the hospital.

593
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:06,599
We could only amputate his leg.

594
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,480
Unfortunately, the person
who committed suicide

595
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:15,840
couldn't be saved.

596
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:17,440
Mr. Li

597
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:19,320
has lost a leg for nothing.

598
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,679
(You know
that I like outdoor activities.)

599

(Sometimes, a minor accident)

600
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:28,239
can lead to unfortunate consequences.

601
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,800
That's strange.

602
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,079
The bone of his left leg is fine.

603
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:32,960
It doesn't look like an injury
induced by a fall.

Uncle.

627
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,840
Why are you here alone?

628
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:02,840
Where's Miss Su?

629
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,519
She's dealing with other tasks.

630
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,760
So she's not here at the moment.

631
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:09,880
The auction is about

632
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,920
to start.

633
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,199

you're unhappy?

636

It's not too late

637
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,400
to feel happy when the auction

638
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:19,440
has successfully ended.

639
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:23,800
Do you remember playing chess with me

640
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:25,559
when you were little?

641
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,000
Back then, I've taught you

642
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:30,920
not to be so eager to finish off
the chess pieces

643
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:32,920
in front of you.

644
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:35,920
I can already tell

645
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:38,199
what your next step is.

646
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:46,679
Then, how did you know

647

that I didn't see through

648
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:49,880
your next step?

Uncle,

650
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,760
I want

651
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,400
to show you something.

652
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:06,440
I wonder if you'd be interested.

653
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:09,260
What's so good about it

654
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,639
that it needs to be kept in secret?

655
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:13,960
Okay.

656
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:16,920
This way, Uncle.

all videos

660
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:51,239
must be uploaded immediately

661
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,320
to the company's official website.

662
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,840
Get it?

663
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,199
Yes.

664
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,159
Ms. Shi,

665
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:56,320
it's almost time.

666
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:57,320
Shall we start now？

667
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,199
Have you seen Mr. Huo and Mr. Li?

668
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,079
No.

669
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,159
Where are they?

670
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:33,960
Uncle,

671
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:36,360
I know you've been

672
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:37,559
keeping an eye on Ji Ying Song.

673
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:38,800
So,

674
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,960
when Ji Ying Song delivered the items
to the warehouse,

675
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,960
it was just a smokescreen.

676
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,440
I've arranged earlier

677
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:46,960
for the real items

678
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,119
to be delivered via another route.

679
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:49,199
Of course,

680
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:51,159
it includes

681
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:52,400
the items you bought

682
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:53,679
from Mr. Qin,

683
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,199
the owner of Pinxuan Art Gallery.

684
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,760
Those items you sent someone to burn off

685
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,280
were only garbage

686
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,960
taken from the storage.

687
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,719
I don't understand
what you are talking about.

688
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:10,880
But I really want to know

689
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,840
why Ocean Group's collections

690
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,599
are here.

691
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:19,280
You've indeed

692
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,360
personally bought
those artworks yourself.

693
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,280
You can recognize them at a glance.

694
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:25,960
These collections

695
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,960
look familiar to you, am I right?

696
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,119
As for

697
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:30,280
why they are here,

698
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:32,599
you should know it well.

699
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,000
I'm sorry.

700
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:38,159
I don't know it well.

701
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,280
Back then,

702
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,039
out of his trust in you,

703
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,119
my dad put you solely in charge

704
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,079
of the acquisition of artworks.

705
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:52,000
Tens of millions of expenses

706
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,039
have gone into your own pocket.

707
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,760
The remaining amount

708
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,960
is here.

709
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,079
Maybe

710
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,320
my dad died

711
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:09,840
because he'd seen through

712
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,920
