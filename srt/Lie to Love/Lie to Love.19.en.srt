19
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:08,400
Xie Yi.

20
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,520
I'd like

21
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,879
to talk to Mr. Xie in private.

22
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:13,919
Okay.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,080
Do take it while it's hot.

24
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,840
What happened between Huo Jian and I

25
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,199
has brought you harm.

26
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,120
Sorry about that.

27
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,120
I got injured because of Xiao Xiao.

28
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,800
I don't blame anyone for it.

29
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,400
So no need to apologize, Mr. Li.

30
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,360
However,

31
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,120
Mr. Xie.

32
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,560
Why did you

33
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,560
suddenly show up here?

34
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,039
I saw a video online

35
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,599
of Xie Yi saving Xiao Xiao.

36
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,919
I went and looked up

37
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,080
the address of the honey seller.

38
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:11,800
That's how I found this place.

39
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,960
You could have given us

40
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:17,240
a heads-up before you came.

41
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,759
This town isn't very big.

42
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,439
But I'm sure it took some effort

43
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,759
in locating us.

44
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,639
If I had told Xie Yi beforehand,

45
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,319
I doubt she would have let me come.

46
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,759
So when did you get here?

47
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,479
This morning.

48
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,560
The honey seller was nearby.

49
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,159
I haven't even had the chance to check

50
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,520
before the guy charged at me.

51
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,879
What?

52
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,719
Judging from your words,

53
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,560
it seems like

54
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,800
you are doubting me.

55
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:46,919
My uncle

56
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,879
used to be someone I trusted most.

57
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,599
Who would've thought

58
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,199
that he would

59
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,400
do such a cruel thing

60
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,840
to my father.

61
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,000
So,

62
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,080
I can't help but be warier.

63
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,719
Thank you, Mr. Xie,

64
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,639
for protecting Xiao Xiao.

65
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,801
I hope you don't take offense

66
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,479
at any inconveniences caused.

67
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,480
Sure. I'm a little tired.

68
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,240
I need to rest.

69
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,079
I'll excuse myself.

70
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,399
By right,

71
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:50,680
I shouldn't have revealed

72
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,439
Mr. Li's illness.

73
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,639
He's not in a clear state of mind.

74
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:53,560
I'd rather

75
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,480
you did not disturb him.

76
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,040
If he suffers any more shock,

77
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,879
his condition will get worse.

78
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,079
Alright.

79
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,240
Thanks, doctor.

80
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,079
It's no problem.

81
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,040
Are you okay?

82
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,199
Mr. Xie.

83
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,279
Do you know me?

84
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,199
My name is Liu Ah Wei.

85
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:38,639
I'm a window cleaner.

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,920
My daughter took the wrong medication

87
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,160
and it ruined her hearing.

88
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,399
You were the one

89
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,560
who provided legal aid.

90
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:46,360
Right.

91
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,839
Your daughter was treated by
a quack doctor for her fever

92
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,759
and it caused her hearing loss.

93
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,279
Yes.

94
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,040
Is there something you need?

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,600
Mr. Xie.

96
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,959
I have something here.

97
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,319
Can you take a look?

98
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,240
Should I tell the police?

99
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,079
Let me see.

100
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,240
Where did you get this?

101
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,079
I secretly recorded it.

102
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,399
I didn't do it on purpose.

103
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:16,360
I...

104
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,879
I took the video without thinking

105
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,560
while I was cleaning the window.

106
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:20,720
Has anyone else seen this?

107
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:21,600
No, no one.

108
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,720
I just took it.

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,120
I'm... I don't know what to do now.

110
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:26,839
I...

111
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,319
Should I report to the police?

112
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,680
Listen to me.

113
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,040
This man you recorded

114
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,160
is someone important.

115
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,680
If you tell the police

116
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,839
and word gets out,

117
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,839
I worry 

118
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,480
that you might be in danger.

119
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,439
I knew it would come to this.

120
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,759
Why did I get myself into such a mess?

121
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,120
Ah Wei.

122
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,959
If you trust me,

123
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,839
give me the video.

124
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,720
I'm a lawyer.

125
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,720
Let me handle

126
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,800
the matter.

127
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,600
Really?

128
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,040
Mr. Xie.

129
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,839
I saw on the news

130
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,120
that people who provide tips

131
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,199
are offered rewards.

132
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,560
My daughter is suffering
from hearing loss.

133
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,600
It's pretty expensive

134
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,079
to get a cochlear implant.

135
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:23,839
Alright.

136
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,360
Give me the video

137
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,160
and I'll give you the reward in advance.

138
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,319
This way

139
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,560
you should be free from danger.

140
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,000
You'll do that?

141
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,120
The passcode is the last six digits.

142
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:37,839
Keep it safe.

143
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,279
Mr. Xie.

144
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,279
You've done me a big favor.

145
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,639
Here you go.

146
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,639
Did you make a copy?

147
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,199
No.

148
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,720
Listen.

149
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:53,000
You need to leave this city right away.

150
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,759
Don't ever come back.

151
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,240
If they find out

152
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,920
your whereabouts,

153
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,040
your family

154
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,439
will be in danger too,

155
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,360
let alone you.

156
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:00,240
Okay.

157
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,759
I'll do as I'm told.

158
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,560
(Liu Ah Wei.)

159
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,160
(Didn't you say there was no copy?)

160
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:10,720
(You best)

161
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,959
(not have told anyone else this secret.)

162
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,759
(Otherwise, don't blame me
for being heartless.)

163
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:22,560
Come, eat some more.

164
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,519
Thanks.

165
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,839
Thanks, Xiao Xiao.

166
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:28,839
Thank you.

167
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,240
Sorry for troubling you.

168
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,840
Don't say that.

169
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,759
You got hurt

170
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,759
trying to save Xiao Xiao.

171
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,000
We should be taking care of you.

172
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,600
Here, have some more.

173
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,200
It's okay.

174
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,879
I can help myself.

175
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,919
Mom, I'm full.

176
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,440
I'm going out to play.

177
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,480
Don't stay out too late.

178
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,639
Your friends said

179
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,159
they'll pick you up tomorrow morning.

180
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,519
Madam Xia.

181
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,480
What does Ah Wei have

182
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:03,559
in that USB drive?

183
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,080
If only I knew.

184
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:09,559
Ah Wei never showed me.

185
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,039
I'm not good with computers,

186
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,240
so I really have no idea.

187
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,720
Does he have

188
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,720
anything else

189
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,000
like a memory drive?

190
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,720
That's the only one he left behind.

191
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,720
That's too bad.

192
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,120
Do you know

193
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,399
if he told any friends

194
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,600
about what it contained?

195
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,440
Forget friends.

196
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:32,159
Ah Wei

197
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,600
is a stubborn man.

198
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:34,919
He doesn't have many friends.

199
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,279
But one time he got a bit drunk

200
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,039
and said he came across

201
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,399
something that scared him.

202
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,159
When I asked him to tell me more,

203
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,240
he wouldn't say anything.

204
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,200
He was going to hit me.

205
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,039
He said we had to move.

206
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:47,519
That's why we moved here.

207
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,840
It's a new surrounding.

208
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,240
He hardly had any friends.

209
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:55,759
Here, dig in.

210
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:57,919
Thanks.

211
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,000
The soup has gotten cold.

212
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,399
Let me heat it up.

213
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:04,960
Thank you.

214
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,120
What's on your mind?

215
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,240
Nothing.

216
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,600
I just thought it's a pity

217
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,440
to let such a good chance slip.

218
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,360
Yan.

219
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,600
Do you think

220
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,080
we'll get another clue?

221
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,080
We will.

222
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:56,120
It's like rock climbing.

223
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:57,639
The closer we are to the goal,

224
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
the easier it is to fall.

225
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,720
But as long as the goal doesn't change

226
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:02,919
and you don't give up,

227
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,639
you will surely succeed.

228
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:09,480
Xie Yi.

229
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,279
Xiao Xiao.

230
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:14,960
Here.

231
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:15,919
Xiao Xiao.

232
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:18,120
Why did you suddenly come?

233
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,840
I have something for you.

234
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:22,919
What is it?

235
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,840
The thing you've been searching for.

236
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:44,919
Xiao Xiao.

237
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,480
Where did you get this?

238
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:50,039
When I learned that you wanted it

239
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,919
but Mom wouldn't give it to you,

240
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,519
I secretly put it away

241
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:54,759
to give it to you later.

242
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,120
Excuse me.

243
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,360
I'm grateful to you two

244
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,279
for saving Xiao Xiao.

245
00:11:58,679 --> 00:11:59,360
But you really

246
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,159
shouldn't try and get Xiao Xiao to talk.

247
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,399
The two of us

248
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,279
do not know anything about Ah Wei.

249
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:05,559
So please leave.

250
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,559
Xie Yi.

251
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,840
But Mom later changed her mind.

252
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,559
I didn't take it out

253
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,000
in case she scolded me for lying.

254
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
So this is the USB drive

255
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,720
your father left behind?

256
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:21,840
That's right.

257
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,039
Then why didn't you

258
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,159
give it to your mom this morning?

259
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,080
Xie Yi wanted me to tell Mom

260
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,720
not to show it.

261
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,759
But she insisted to.

262
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,840
So I made the decision

263
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,200
not to give it to Mom.

264
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:35,159
Aren't I smart?

265
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,279
Xiao Xiao.

266
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:37,720
What a smart girl you are.

267
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,039
Xiao Xiao.

268
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,279
You know what?

269
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,960
You've done something great.

270
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,480
Later, I'll buy you

271
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,279
lots and lots

272
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,879
of presents for your good work.

273
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:50,080
I don't need presents.

274
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,600
So long as you guys
come play with me often.

275
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:52,679
We will.

276
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,399
Okay.

277
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,559
I need to get home.

278
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,879
I'm out at this late hour.

279
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,159
My mom will be worried.

280
00:12:59,159 --> 00:12:59,559
Bye, Xie Yi.

281
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,279
Bye, Mr. Li.

282
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,480
Be safe on the way back.

283
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,519
Take care.

284
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,720
Thanks, Xiao Xiao!

285
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,720
Yan.

286
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:11,480
Looks like

287
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,480
miracles do happen

288
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,320
when you don't give up.

289
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,399
You're up, Mr. Xie.

290
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,600
Mr. Li asked me to come to pick you up.

291
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,759
I bet you haven't had breakfast.

292
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:34,639
Not yet.

293
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
Come, sit down and join me.

294
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,120
Can I?

295
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,200
Sure you can.

296
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,240
Don't mind if I do then.

297
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:42,320
Let me get you some congee.

298
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,399
No, no.

299
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm good with what's here.

300
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:45,840
Are you sure?

301
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,480
Yes.

302
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:51,879
Where is Xie Yi?

303
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,279
Miss Su and Mr. Li

304
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,759
already left last night.

305
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:58,600
What's the hurry?

306
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,759
I think they found new evidence.

307
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,080
What did you say?

308
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:04,840
What evidence?

309
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:07,519
What?

310
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,679
The good news came too suddenly.

311
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,519
I was caught by surprise.

312
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,639
So am I.

313
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:16,279
Right.

314
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,080
Why wasn't I told

315
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,039
about such good news earlier?

316
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,039
It's because

317
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,039
you went to sleep early last night.

318
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,799
I didn't want to disturb you.

319
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:24,080
You eat.

320
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:24,840
I've had my fill.

321
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,759
I'll wait for you in the car.

322
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:26,960
That was quick.

323
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:29,200
I can finish this in the car.

324
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,000
You take your time.

325
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:31,080
I won't be long.

326
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,420
(Ze Liang)

327
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:52,919
Hey, Ze Liang.

328
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,519
Are you back?

329
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,480
Chu Chu, I found

330
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,559
new evidence on Huo Jian's crime.

331
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,960
Bring your laptop
and meet me right away.

332
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,200
Okay.

333
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,720
Nice play. Good one.

334
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,320
Mr. Huo's play is always

335
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,200
fast and lethal.

336
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,879
Not at all.

337
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:17,120
We're all still learning.

338
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:18,919
Kang, water for you.

339
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:19,600
Thanks.

340
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,320
Anyway, Huo,

341
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:23,200
are you really going
to while away the time

342
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,919
just playing badminton?

343
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:26,320
Right.

344
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,000
All of us think

345
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,600
that you withdrew too hastily.

346
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:31,120
You've worked so hard
to build the foundation.

347
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,600
Are you ready to give it up so soon?

348
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,159
This position

349
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,200
will be Li Ze Liang's sooner or later.

350
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,639
That's true.

351
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,759
But passing the baton so soon

352
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,399
is a little hasty, no?

353
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:42,919
Ze Liang is very capable,

354
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,279
but he's just recovered

355
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,080
after all.

356
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,720
We are thinking
for the sake of the group.

357
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,240
Alright.

358
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,120
If that's what you all think,

359
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,559
I will give this matter

360
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:53,679
more time

361
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,000
to think through.

362
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:56,200
Come.

363
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:57,519
Who wants to play another round with me?

364
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:57,919
I'll play.

365
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,559
Allow me to play
a round with you, Uncle.

366
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,320
Ze Liang.

367
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,559
You listened.

368
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,519
I asked to meet you

369
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,559
and here you are.

370
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:14,679
This will be

371
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,000
the last time I play with you.

372
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,960
Surely I have to do my best.

373
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:29,399
Are you sure you can receive

374
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:30,200
my serve?

375
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:30,919
No.

376
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,240
The one serving today

377
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:34,600
will be me.

378
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,679
When a tree gets big,

379
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,440
it easily becomes a nest for termites.

380
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:41,639
But I didn't think

381
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,480
that the biggest termite

382
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,080
in a great big tree like Ocean

383
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:46,919
would be you, Uncle.

384
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,120
Over the years,

385
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,679
you've embezzled
a pretty hefty sum from Ocean

386
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,759
using your power.

387
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:00,039
You let Lin Tai carry out
real estate speculation.

388
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,360
I heard

389
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:03,840
the hotel's booking system

390
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,920
has some bugs.

391
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,920
Why are you so nervous?

392
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,279
You just have to do

393
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,480
what I told you to do well.

394
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,400
As for the booking system,

395
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,519
you can take your time with it.

396
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:19,839
You instructed Chen Heng Sheng
to sell fake liquor.

397
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:21,680
Yunfeng's liquor business

398
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,400
is our biggest cash inflow.

399
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,759
It's a stable source of income.

400
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:25,960
I will transfer

401
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,799
the latest profits
to the specified account.

402
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,279
Not only that.

403
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:31,240
You also used the group's name

404
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:33,599
to purchase certain art pieces

405
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,480
in bulk.

406
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,119
(And these art pieces)

407
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,759
(are actually)

408
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,640
(imitations for your personal gain.)

409
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,559
(My father)

410
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,400
(had given you full authority)

411
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:48,559
(in the procurement of art pieces)

412
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,440
(due to his utmost trust in you.)

413
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,200
Tens of millions of expenditure.

414
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:56,240
You probably pocketed 80 percent of it.

415
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:57,799
Ze Liang.

416
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,319
We have shareholders present.

417
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:01,039
Watch what you say.

418
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,640
We have already dealt

419
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:03,920
with Lin Tai and Chen Heng Sheng.

420
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:06,880
Those incidents
had nothing to do with me.

421
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:08,680
No need to get worked up, Uncle.

422
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:10,359
Or feel scared.

423
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:13,160
Regarding those art pieces,

424
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:14,640
I already know

425
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,720
where they are.

426
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,440
The rebate was all remitted

427
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:19,160
to a company named Kaixing.

428
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:23,200
Anyone wants to make a guess?

429
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:26,000
Who does this company belong to?

430
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,000
Huo Jian.

431
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,319
What is going on here?

432
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,640
I've never heard of this company.

433
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:36,920
No use denying, Uncle.

434
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:39,440
I've looked into

435
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:41,359
the company as well.

436
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:43,000
The legal representative

437
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,519
is none other than your secretary,

438
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:47,799
Yi Fei's younger brother.

439
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:55,680
Yi Fei.

440
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,440
What exactly is going on?

441
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:09,319
Yes.

442
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:10,839
The company's legal representative

443
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:11,880
is indeed my brother.

444
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:14,880
But I don't know

445
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,599
any of the details.

446
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:18,079
Miss Yi.

447
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:19,599
You need to wake up.

448
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:21,039
Do you know

449
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,160
who you're helping right now?

450
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:24,240
In his eyes,

451
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,720
you are no different

452
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:27,200
from Lin Tai and Chen Heng Sheng.

453
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:28,839
You're merely pawns

454
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,680
that can be sacrificed when needed.

455
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:32,480
Su Xie Yi!

456
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,079
Watch your words.

457
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,519
Slander is punishable by law!

458
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm done playing for the day.

459
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,559
Huo Jian.

460
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:48,119
You're the one
who should be punished by law.

461
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:51,359
You can deny all these accusations.

462
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,000
But you can't deny the fact 

463
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:55,119
that you killed my father.

464
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,359
What?

465
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,160
What do you mean?

466
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,519
Huo Jian.

467
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,240
What is he talking about?

468
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:35,279
You defrauded shares

469
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,400
from my father.

470
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:37,960
Premeditated murder.

471
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,559
We have the evidence.

472
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,039
How will you deny this?

473
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:43,599
Huo Jian.

474
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,440
Have you lost your mind?

475
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:47,240
You murdered someone?

476
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:49,720
Huo Jian.

477
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,160
I've called the police.

478
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:55,200
Looks like

479
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,119
there is no chance
to serve the shuttle after all.

480
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,000
The match between us

481
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,359
is over.

482
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,480
Yi Fei.

483
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,759
Kaixing's legal representative
is your brother.

484
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,960
As long as you keep quiet,

485
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:14,440
I will get your brother the best lawyer

486
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:15,519
to get him acquitted.

487
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:16,920
If I am arrested,

488
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,920
we will be done for.

489
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,279
Miss Yi.

490
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,279
I hope

491
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,440
you'll cooperate with the police.

492
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:25,640
You don't have to bear the accusations

493
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:26,960
that aren't meant for you.

494
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:27,960
Trust me.

495
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:29,920
You'll only be ruining yourself.

496
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:40,920
Huo Jian.

497
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,240
I can do anything for you.

498
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:49,640
I am also willing

499
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,799
to be the pawn you sacrifice.

500
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,200
But I just want to ask you one thing.

501
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,519
During our time together,

502
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,680
have you ever

503
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,640
been sincere with me?

504
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,480
Of course, I'm sincere about you.

505
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:07,440
I really love you.

506
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:08,720
It's true.

507
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,759
Yi Fei.

508
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:13,319
You just have to admit

509
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,440
that you were behind everything.

510
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:16,519
Just say 

511
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,599
that you had forced me

512
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:19,039
to kill Li Kuo Hai.

513
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,400
I promise you,

514
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,640
I'll be forever grateful to you.

515
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,319
I'll give you anything you want.

516
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:26,759
I'm begging you.

517
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:27,640
Yi Fei.

518
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:28,960
Just admit it.

519
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:30,160
Admit

520
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:30,839
that you did everything.

521
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,599
Only if...

522
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,240
Don't you know

523
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,279
what it is I want?

524
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,880
I've done so much for you.

525
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,039
And gratitude is all I got in return?

526
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:02,119
Okay.

527
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:05,960
I give in.

528
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,200
Yan.

529
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:25,519
To be honest,

530
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,200
I still feel like

531
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,440
I'm in a daze.

532
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,319
Everything

533
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,799
seems a bit unreal.

534
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,039
Why don't I help you discern

535
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,519
whether it is a dream or reality?

536
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,519
Did you feel it?

537
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,440
Xie Yi.

538
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:54,319
I actually have

539
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,839
another surprise for you.

540
00:23:58,319 --> 00:23:59,039
What is it?

541
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:05,000
Close your eyes first.

542
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:10,559
Are they close?

543
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:18,400
Why are you being so mysterious?

544
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:20,559
If it's not a nice surprise,

545
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,720
I'm going to hit you.

546
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,680
Open your eyes.

547
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,960
This is from back then.

548
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:35,880
When did you

549
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,079
get it?

550
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:39,799
I went as soon as

551
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,200
I could walk again.

552
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:43,000
Luckily it was still there.

553
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:54,039
So the big tree

554
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,279
did hear our conversation.

555
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,359
It kept it safe for us.

556
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:00,480
By the way, Yan.

557
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:04,359
Remember I told you

558
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:07,200
that Huo Jian mentioned something
about K of Spades

559
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,160
on the day he was arrested?

560
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:16,920
The one who made me sabotage Zhiwei

561
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:19,480
was K of Spades.

562
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,039
I know Huo Jian better than you.

563
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,279
He can't accept

564
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:03,640
that we are happy and content.

565
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:05,640
So

566
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,559
he deliberately sowed doubt.

567
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:09,559
Don't worry about it.

568
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,319
You're right.

569
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,200
We can't fall for this trap.

570
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,920
K of Spades?

571
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,599
Mr. Li.

572
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,119
Do you believe what Huo Jian said?

573
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:41,240
It's true

574
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,640
that the motive
for sabotaging Zhiwei is weak.

575
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,599
Huo Jian said it was K of Spades

576
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:47,799
that instructed him to target Zhiwei.

577
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,839
So does he

578
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,160
hold a grudge against Zhiwei?

579
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:54,960
But why did Huo Jian

580
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:55,960
listen to him?

581
00:26:58,359 --> 00:26:58,839
Right.

582
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,000
If K of Spades really existed,

583
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,279
who could it be?

584
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,720
(A once successful)

585
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,839
(legendary hotelier)

586
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,839
(turns out to be
an unscrupulous criminal.)

587
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:11,640
(There is much rejoicing
over his arrest.)

588
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:12,480
(Awaiting him)

589
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,799
(will be legal punishment.)

590
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,119
(As for the culprit's motive,)

591
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,200
(it is still being investigated.)

592
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:37,079
Hello, Ming Hao.

593
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,039
Hey, Xie Yi.

594
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,039
I just saw the news

595
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,359
of Huo Jian's arrest.

596
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,680
So I called you.

597
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:44,640
That's right.

598
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:45,839
We should

599
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,839
really celebrate the occasion.

600
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:48,200
By the way,

601
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,039
why are you already

602
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,319
back at work?

603
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:52,640
How is your injury?

604
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:53,519
It's fine.

605
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:54,519
Nothing serious.

606
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:56,160
Are you sure?

607
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,799
Yes, of course.

608
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,000
What's the matter?

609
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,000
It's nothing.

610
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:04,839
I stretched it

611
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,400
when putting something down.

612
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:07,920
Nothing serious, you say?

613
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:08,799
How about this?

614
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:10,640
I'll leave earlier from work

615
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:11,519
and pay you a visit.

616
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:12,720
Really?

617
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,400
Did you think I'm kidding?

618
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:16,759
What do you want to eat?

619
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:17,920
I can buy it on the way.

620
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:18,599
It's okay.

621
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,119
Just you coming is good enough for me.

622
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:21,160
See you later then.

623
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:21,880
See you.

624
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:30,680
Mr. Li.

625
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:31,880
If K of Spades

626
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:33,480
is still out there unchecked,

627
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:35,480
a ruthless guy like him

628
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,680
may pose a threat to Miss Su.

629
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:41,519
I need to get Xie Yi

630
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:42,440
to move in with me sooner.

631
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:46,920
Come in.

632
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:49,839
Xie Yi.

633
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:50,680
Miss Su.

634
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,039
You two chat.

635
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:58,000
Xie Yi.

636
00:28:59,039 --> 00:28:59,799
Why are you here?

637
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:00,759
Yan.

638
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:02,240
I have something to do.

639
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:03,640
Can I get off work earlier?

640
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,839
Ming Hao is injured, right?

641
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:06,759
I want to go

642
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:07,759
and see how he's recovering.

643
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,200
Okay, I'll go with you.

644
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,119
Okay.

645
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:16,240
Let's meet at the car in five minutes.

646
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:17,279
I'll get ready.

647
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:23,759
Xie Ming Hao.

648
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,400
Ming Hao.

649
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,079
You're here.

650
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,279
Come.

651
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,039
Sit.

652
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,720
I didn't know Mr. Li would be here too.

653
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,359
I only ordered Xie Yi's

654
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:47,519
favorite latte.

655
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,480
What would you like, Mr. Li?

656
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,799
I'm good, thanks.

657
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:53,200
Ming Hao.

658
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,079
Why did you go back to work so soon?

659
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:57,039
Your hand needs more time to heal.

660
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:57,920
It's not a big deal.

661
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:58,799
I'll be fine.

662
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:01,039
No matter how busy work gets,

663
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:02,519
health is always more important.

664
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:03,880
You should

665
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,920
take better care, Mr. Xie.

666
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:07,119
Xie Yi.

667
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,519
On the way here,

668
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,599
I noticed a fruit stall.

669
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,640
We should have brought something

670
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,039
for Mr. Xie.

671
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,039
Why don't you
go buy some fruits for him?

672
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,480
Okay.

673
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,319
You guys chat.

674
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,200
Did you come to thank me?

675
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,000
We left in a hurry the last time.

676
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:34,160
We didn't have time

677
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,640
to properly thank you.

678
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,839
Your arm got injured.

679
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:38,799
If you

680
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,079
need anything in the future,

681
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:40,759
don't hesitate to tell us.

682
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,279
The one thing I had plenty of

683
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,920
in the past two years
is taking care of others.

684
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,920
This bit of injury is nothing.

685
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,720
You've been taking care of Xie Qing

686
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,440
without fail.

687
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,200
It is truly admirable.

688
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:56,960
What I'm curious about is

689
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,599
whether your care for Xie Qing

690
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:00,440
stems from love

691
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:02,079
or responsibility.

692
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:06,880
I guess

693
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,960
you don't know our story.

694
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:10,640
The day I met her

695
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:12,880
was the day my life took a new turn.

696
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:14,279
That day after school,

697
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,160
I was surrounded by a group of bullies.

698
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:18,960
Out of nowhere,

699
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,359
this little girl

700
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,640
stepped in front of me.

701
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,359
Not only did she
reprimand the bullies,

702
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:25,799
she also blocked

703
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,039
the stones that were thrown at me.

704
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,720
She got hit square in the head

705
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,960
and bled a lot.

706
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,480
To make stitching easier,

707
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,920
the doctor shaved her head.

708
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:37,839
Not only was she not perturbed,

709
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:40,039
but she also comforted me.

710
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,640
She asked for my name.

711
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,079
She called me

712
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,079
Ming Hao.

713
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,319
That was the first time

714
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:50,200
anyone called my name so affectionately.

715
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,200
I will never forget it.

716
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,920
The way you two met

717
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:58,720
must have left

718
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,519
a deep impression.

719
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,000
That's right.

720
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:05,440
Later on,

721
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,119
Uncle Shen took pity on me

722
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:08,319
and decided to sponsor me.

723
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,079
He was a good man.

724
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:11,680
I'm indebted to him.

725
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:14,400
But what made me happier

726
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:16,920
was that I could see her every day.

727
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:19,240
I could be her dear Ming Hao

728
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:20,079
and not some orphan

729
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:21,279
that nobody wanted.

730
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,279
Not every kind of love

731
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:23,559
needs to be reciprocated.

732
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,000
The fact that she exists

733
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,720
is the biggest reciprocation for me.

734
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:31,200
I'm content as long as

735
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,319
she is with me.

736
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,920
Talking about Uncle Shen.

737
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,440
I'd like to ask you some things.

738
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,319
Back then, did Zhiwei Corporation,

739
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,200
or Uncle Shen

740
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,640
have any enemies?

741
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,680
Why are you asking me that?

742
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:50,519
You are Xie Qing's fiance.

743
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,079
As well as Zhiwei's appointed lawyer

744
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:53,200
at the time.

745
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:54,680
I thought perhaps

746
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,000
you knew some inside information.

747
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,079
Mr. Li.

748
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,400
Zhiwei has been annexed by you.

749
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,160
You should be more aware 

750
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,400
of the ins and outs of Zhiwei's

751
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,880
business connections.

752
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,920
What about outside of business?

753
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:10,559
I'm a lawyer.

754
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:12,880
Following professional
customs and ethics,

755
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:14,480
I only focus on the work.

756
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,160
I never delve into private affairs.

757
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,240
Could it be that Huo Jian

758
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:19,720
told you something else?

759
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,119
What are you two talking about?

760
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:24,680
You're smiling ear to ear.

761
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,759
It's nothing.

762
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,720
I suggested

763
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:29,960
that we visit Mr. Xie
more often when possible.

764
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,200
He's happy to hear it.

765
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,960
That's great.

766
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,839
I'll go order something for you.

767
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:51,960
Yan.

768
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,000
You never paid much attention

769
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,920
to Ming Hao before.

770
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,359
Why did you suddenly say

771
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,119
that you'd visit him more often?

772
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,039
No matter what,

773
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:01,680
he is your brother-in-law.

774
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:03,599
Now that we're together,

775
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:04,759
it's not right

776
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:06,960
to put you in
a difficult position between us.

777
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,960
Mr. Li's ability
to see the bigger picture

778
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,039
deserves recognition.

779
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,559
What did you two talk about?

780
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:14,760
Nothing much.

781
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,039
We just

782
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:18,000
made some small talk.

783
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,800
Ming Hao's injury hasn't fully healed.

784
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,639
Let's ask Ms. Shi

785
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,920
not to give him so much work from Ocean.

786
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,079
Don't worry.

787
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,000
Thank you, Mr. Li.

788
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:38,920
Xie Yi.

789
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,960
Why don't you pack your thing?

790
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:42,760
My place is ready for you.

791
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,039
I'd like...

792
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,280
I would like you to move in with me.

793
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:51,920
What?

794
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,159
Don't you want to?

795
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:55,440
But,

796
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,880
it's only appropriate
for boyfriend and girlfriend

797
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,920
to live together, right?

798
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:02,679
We are boyfriend and girlfriend.

799
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:05,920
Objectively speaking,

800
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,400
we are boyfriend and girlfriend.

801
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:11,239
But something

802
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,440
seems to be missing.

803
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,880
If that something is filled up,

804
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,480
we can then

805
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:19,800
officially be called a couple.

806
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:21,800
Xie Yi.

807
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,639
Point is,

808
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:24,840
I don't want to wait another day.

809
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:26,639
What's missing?

810
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:27,760
Just tell me.

811
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:29,639
You've waited two years.

812
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,400
Just a few days more won't hurt.

813
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,239
You'll know soon enough.

814
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:38,280
Where are you going?

815
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:39,480
Home.

816
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:41,880
I won't trouble Mr. Li to send me today.

817
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,039
A ball that has come to a stop

818
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,159
better not start moving again.

819
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,679
A marriage has to have a ceremony.

820
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:17,280
So a relationship has to have
a love confession.

821
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,400
Listen.

822
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,880
The girl

823
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:22,039
keeps her feelings
hidden deep inside her heart.

824
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,480
Just like the pearls

825
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,559
at the bottom of this glass.

826
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:27,000
The love confession

827
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,039
is the straw.

828
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:33,840
Stick it right into the heart.

829
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:34,719
That way,

830
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,920
she will share her love and sweetness

831
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,719
with you

832
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:40,119
without inhibitions.

833
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,840
So what should I do?

834
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,559
It's a good thing you came to me.

835
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,719
This place,

836
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,159
with the right lighting

837
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:50,280
and music,

838
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:52,000
makes for the most romantic setting.

839
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,440
I'm a pro at this.

840
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:54,760
Just leave it to me.

841
00:36:57,519 --> 00:36:58,320
How much time do you need

842
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,039
to set this place up?

843
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:01,519
Tomorrow night at 7:00.

844
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,679
Bring Xie Yi here

845
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,840
on time.

846
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:05,920
I can guarantee
that your love confession

847
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:07,800
will go off without a hitch.

848
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,599
Tell no one.

849
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:11,760
Okay.

850
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,119
Stop pretending.

851
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,159
Sit like that more

852
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:20,960
and you may never stand up again.

853
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:23,119
You better keep this a secret too.

854
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:24,800
Or else Chu Chu

855
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,800
won't send me soup anymore.

856
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,840
Sorry about before.

857
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,679
Now,

858
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,000
let me do something for you.

859
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:35,159
Have you ever confessed your feelings?

860
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,039
A love confession?

861
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:39,920
Never mind.

862
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,039
Forget I asked.

863
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:42,920
Do you not trust me

864
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,119
in this matter, Mr. Li?

865
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,159
How many relationships have you had?

866
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,719
There you have it.

867
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,140
♪I need you, I love you♪

868
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,780
♪I'll brave the waves for you♪

869
