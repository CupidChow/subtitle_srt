00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:25,100
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

3
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:33,550
♫  Still haunts me now and then in quiet nights  ♫

4
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:41,430
♫  And turn to face all the long lost times  ♫

5
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,270
♫  Brace the pain  ♫

6
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:51,210
♫  Let memories wake up from oceans deep  ♫

7
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,450
♫  No place to hide  ♫

8
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,650
♫  No way to run  ♫

9
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,820
♫  New dawn counts down  ♫

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,030
♫  I fight  ♫

11
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,010
♫  I cry  ♫

12
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,700
♫  I give up  ♫

13
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:15,710
♫  Memories forgotten, forsaken surround  ♫

14
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:24,130
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

15
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:33,070
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

16
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:40,950
♫  Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

17
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:49,620
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

18
00:01:49,620 --> 00:02:00,150

19
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,100

20
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,430

21
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,562

22
00:02:17,562 --> 00:02:19,159
Anybody here?

23
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,540
Yes.

24
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,639
You must be... You must be the boss.

25
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,080
Yes. What would you like to get?

26
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,300
Well, Sir. Did a girl sell you a bracelet yesterday?

27
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,579
Yes. She said she'd redeem it one day.

28
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:34,700
May I have a look?

29
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,500
Sure.

30
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,660
Are you referring to this?

31
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,360
Yes, it is.

32
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,419
Well, I am her friend.

33
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:44,680
Can you give it to me?

34
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,280
I paid 2,000 yuan for this.

35
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,099
So, why don't you pay me 200 yuan as a safe-keeping fee?

36
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:52,680
No problem.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,439
Director Li, you're here too.

38
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:00,239
Lawyer Xie.

39
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,759
The good hasn't left the counter. It's not considered sold.

40
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,520
Sell the bracelet to me instead.

41
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,500
I've just closed a deal with this gentleman.

42
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,879
He'd be paying 200 yuan extra.

43
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,899
- Come on. Let me scan your code. 
 - I'll pay 500 yuan extra.

44
00:03:11,899 --> 00:03:15,719
Sir, we must be fair when doing business.

45
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,919
He came here first.

46
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:20,468
Come on. I'll pay 1,000 yuan extra.

47
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,680
Isn't doing business all about making money?

48
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,240
Here. Scan the code.

49
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,039
- 10,000 yuan. 
 - You'll scan it.

50
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,080
15,000 yuan.

51
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,139
- Here, scan it. 
 - 20,000 yuan.

52
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:34,719
- You'll scan it. 
 - 40,000 yuan.

53
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,619
Scan it now.

54
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:38,479
The auction has started earlier.

55
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:40,519
Why am I not informed?

56
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:42,100
Xieyi.

57
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,599
I'll redeem the bracelet myself.

58
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,680
Wait for me outside.

59
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,060
I'll wait for you outside.

60
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,279
Don't leave. Are you going to pay?

61
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:01,559
Sir, you still don't get it?

62
00:04:01,559 --> 00:04:03,360
What did I tell you yesterday?

63
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,360
Yesterday, you...

64
00:04:11,339 --> 00:04:15,699
"Sir, my boyfriend is in the first aid room now.

65
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:17,836
He needs some nutrition.

66
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:21,106
I don't have any money with me.

67
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:24,791
This bracelet was a gift from my dad."

68
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,158
That's what you said.

69
00:04:27,158 --> 00:04:28,979
Yes.

70
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,279
Their lives have been saved.

71
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:34,279
But...

72
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,420
Here, they've been left with a sequela.

73
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,539
Are they fools?

74
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:42,079
Then, they've fooled me.

75
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:44,380
Yes, they've fooled you.

76
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,260
Now, I will keep my promise,

77
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,419
and pay 200 yuan extra to redeem this bracelet.

78
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:51,059
If you're not all right with that, then you may keep it.

79
00:04:51,059 --> 00:04:53,079
No, no. I... I don't want to keep it. Just take it away now.

80
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,320
I can't explain myself clearly if I take women's stuff home.

81
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,020
Thank you, Sir.

82
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,060
Scan this.

83
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,680

84
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,820
One is the Deputy General Manager of a public company.

85
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:29,319
Another is an experienced top corporate lawyer.

86
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:32,059
You wanted to spend 40,000 yuan to redeem a bracelet.

87
00:05:32,059 --> 00:05:34,680
How did you come up with this amount?

88
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,339
It's good that you've redeemed the bracelet.

89
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:38,900
Let's go.

90
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,640
Xieyi, why don't you take Director Li's car?

91
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,820
I have something to discuss with Director Li.

92
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,859
Stay safe on the way back.

93
00:06:02,859 --> 00:06:04,479
Go ahead.

94
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:12,040
Call me when you arrive at the hotel.

95
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,499
I reckon you know that there's a mastermind behind Chen Hengsheng.

96
00:06:27,499 --> 00:06:28,680
So?

97
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,000
This mastermind arranged for Chen Hengsheng to use Xieyi for the poisoning.

98
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,740
Have you thought about his motive?

99
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,000
I know this better than you do.

100
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,440
Whether it was Lin Tai's surprise attack or using poison to sabotage the auction,

101
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,979
the real target had been you.

102
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:50,079
Xieyi has been very lucky two times.

103
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,239
But what about the next time?

104
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:54,199
Have you thought of it?

105
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,200
Well, I'm responsible too.

106
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,958
If previously I didn't allow Xieyi to return home,

107
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,065
these incidents wouldn't have happened.

108
00:07:06,065 --> 00:07:10,239
It looks like you already have your own plan.

109
00:07:10,239 --> 00:07:12,900
I plan to take Xieyi and leave this place as soon as possible.

110
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,900
Will she go with you?

111
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,739
To be honest,

112
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:21,620
I can feel your love for Xieyi.

113
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:27,220
But considering the current situation, we must make sensible decisions instead of acting impetuously.

114
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,300
You care more about Xieyi's safety than me, don't you?

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,700
You're right.

116
00:07:38,739 --> 00:07:43,439
Leaving is indeed the safest way for Xieyi.

117
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,520
But when everything is over,

118
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,920
I will personally bring her back.

119
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,250

120
00:08:34,628 --> 00:08:40,260
 Hello. The number you've dialed is currently engaged. Please try again later.

121
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,679
Could it be the wrong number?

122
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:50,100

123
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,440
Hello, Dr. Zhu.

124
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:58,459
What?

125
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,619
Hello, Brother Minghao. Where are you?

126
00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:04,600
 I just parked my car. I'll be heading upstairs.

127
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,840
Okay. I'll be there right away.

128
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,700
Xieyi, what's so urgent?

129
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,279
Brother Minghao, Dr. Zhu just called me.

130
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,279
Why would Dr. Zhu call you?

131
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,039
He said they required my signature for my sister's discharge.

132
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,939
What's going on?

133
00:09:30,165 --> 00:09:33,580
This is the situation. Xieqing's condition has improved tremendously.

134
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,939
She often talks about you

135
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:38,279
and mention her childhood.

136
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:41,099
When she knew that I'd take her to Germany for recuperation,

137
00:09:41,099 --> 00:09:45,230
she asked whether you'd be there to keep her company.

138
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,084
Initially, I didn't want you to return there,

139
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:48,440
but the doctor said

140
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,419
they require the signature of an immediate family member for her discharge.

141
00:09:52,419 --> 00:09:57,099
You do know that Xieqing's condition isn't stable all along.

142
00:09:57,099 --> 00:09:59,340
But she has finally gotten better.

143
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,159
She's more willing to accept your company.

144
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,679
What do you think?

145
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:06,360
This is a rare opportunity.

146
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,399
I'd like to keep my sister company too.

147
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,640
But...

148
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:15,040
Xieyi, are you worried that Li Zeliang can't handle it alone?

149
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,639
I believe he can do it.

150
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:22,720
But if I stay, I can help him better.

151
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,119
We're certain that Huo Jian has framed Zhiwei and caused it to go bankrupt.

152
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,900
When you mention the bigger picture, whose bigger picture were you referring to?

153
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:38,019
Xieyi, Huo Jian has seen through your identity.

154
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:39,820
What?

155
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,859
Listen to this recording, and you'll understand everything.

156
00:10:45,859 --> 00:10:47,139
 Answer me.

157
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:48,979
 Why did you go after Su Xieyi?

158
00:10:48,979 --> 00:10:53,880
 Because she was investigating Yunfeng's liquor inventory.

159
00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:58,939
 Do you really believe this?

160
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:01,960
 You poisoned the liquor she made for Mrs. Roman.

161
00:11:02,859 --> 00:11:05,139
 Weren't you asking for trouble?

162
00:11:11,699 --> 00:11:13,499
 I admit

163
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,740
 that the ultimate goal

164
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:23,020
 of framing Su Xieyi was to get to Li Zeliang.

165
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:28,009
 Only by sabotaging the auction would Li Zeliang

166
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:29,960
 lose his power in Ocean's Board of Directors.

167
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,619
 Then, why did you pick Su Xieyi?

168
00:11:32,619 --> 00:11:34,679
 Mrs. Roman likes the drinks she makes.

169
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:37,639
 And she happens to be Li Zeliang's girlfriend.

170
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:42,999
 And he is the designated partner of the group's auction event.

171
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:45,240
 That's not right.

172
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,499
 You need more than that to justify your story.

173
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,480
 You would need a motive for her to do this.

174
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:01,849
 Someone found that Su Xieyi is the daughter of

175
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:05,619
 Shen Zhihong, Zhiwei's former boss.

176
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:12,579
Your identity has been exposed.

177
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:17,679
To put it more seriously, you've become the thorn Huo Jian must get rid of.

178
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:21,960
Then, all my efforts are in vain.

179
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,119
I've been working so hard.

180
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,180
Yet, Huo Jian is still at large.

181
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:30,479
Knowing my identity shouldn't be the reason for me to leave.

182
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,980
First, Oscar was admitted to the hospital due to food poisoning.

183
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,320
Then, Li Zeliang encountered danger when he saved you.

184
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,399
All of these points to Huo Jian's intention.

185
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:41,759
I know you.

186
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:45,699
You will never allow anyone to keep taking risks because of you.

187
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,716
That means

188
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,299
the longer I stay here,

189
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:54,880
the more danger Li Zeliang will encounter.

190
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,020
Huo Jian may even use me as a bargaining chip to threaten him.

191
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,659
Yes.

192
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:05,840
Is this what you've been discussing with Li Zeliang?

193
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,860
I could only tell you that he didn't object my proposal

194
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,860
to take you abroad.

195
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,159
Don't worry.

196
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,700
You don't have to stay in Ocean to deal with Huo Jian.

197
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,519
I will continue to investigate in secret.

198
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,419
After all, if Huo Jian takes on you again,

199
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:26,424
Li Zeliang will definitely fight against him till the end.

200
00:13:26,424 --> 00:13:30,740
At that time, things will get harder for you.

201
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:39,639
Brother Minghao, if I'm not wrong,

202
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:43,300
you've already booked the flight tickets.

203
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,820
Yes.

204
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,259
We'll return to Shanghai tomorrow morning.

205
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:51,120
We'll pick up your sister and head to the airport.

206
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,939
Aren't you afraid that I'll choose to stay?

207
00:13:56,939 --> 00:13:58,679
I understand you well.

208
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:01,120
I know you'll make the right decision.

209
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:04,359
Maybe.

210
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:09,919
But before that, there's one more thing I need to do.

211
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:16,459
It's a pleasure that Miss Su asked to meet me.

212
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:19,259
Go ahead. What's the matter?

213
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:24,240
Director Shi, do you know how Zeliang injured his leg?

214
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,019
Why did you ask about this suddenly?

215
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:30,299
He told me that he accidentally fell

216
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:32,379
when he was rock climbing outdoor.

217
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:35,940
But at the hospital, the doctor told me

218
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,919
that his injury didn't seem to be caused by a fall.

219
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:43,260
I'm sorry.

220
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,419
I was on a business trip two years ago.

221
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:48,100
When I returned, he was already in the hospital.

222
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,779
The leg injury is his taboo.

223
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:54,559
So, all these years, I've never asked him,

224
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,799
and he's never talked about it.

225
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:04,499
I can tell that you really care about him.

226
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:14,679
Actually, I've come today to ask you how you plan to deal with it

227
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:16,799
after experiencing these few dangers.

228
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:21,320
And how do you ensure the safety of yourself and Zeliang?

229
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:32,840
Miss Su, I can do many things that you can't.

230
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,779
I am the top management and shareholder of Ocean Group.

231
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:41,500
And my dad's Hengye Bank provides financial support to Ocean Group.

232
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:46,599
Without Hengye's support, this auction would never see the light.

233
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,240
This is the reality.

234
00:15:53,640 --> 00:16:00,440
Director Shi, you're also advising me to leave Ocean, right?

235
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,759
You like Zeliang.

236
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,279
We're adults.

237
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,700
Right or wrong, we know it well.

238
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:23,920
Sometimes, true love is not about possessing,

239
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,391
but letting go.

240
00:16:26,391 --> 00:16:29,180
If you really care about Zeliang,

241
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:33,360
I believe you'll make the wisest decision.

242
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,459
I have some work to get to. I need to get going.

243
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:39,180
Thank you for your coffee.

244
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,979
You're back.

245
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:03,979
Just in time to try my crab roe noodles.

246
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,880
Why are you still standing there? Hurry up and wash your hands.

247
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,405
And eat the noodles.

248
00:17:16,405 --> 00:17:17,919
Okay.

249
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,160
Why did you suddenly cook crab roe noodles in the hotel?

250
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,239
I passed by on the way back, so I bought some.

251
00:17:33,239 --> 00:17:34,680
What about you?

252
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,059
Where have you been? Why did you come back so late?

253
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:40,479
I went... I went to see Brother Minghao.

254
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,000
Let's dig in.

255
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:01,759
Shouldn't we take a picture of such beautiful noodles first?

256
00:18:28,939 --> 00:18:30,639
Xieyi,

257
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,560
Huo Jian is keeping an eye on you.

258
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,800
If...

259
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:39,719
you've made your decision,

260
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,240
I hope you two will leave tomorrow.

261
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,319
Huo Jian will be very busy tomorrow.

262
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:49,039
He won't have the energy to bother with you.

263
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,939
After all, I'm his biggest target.

264
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,940
What about you?

265
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,780
My identity is different from yours.

266
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,700
If he wants to take me on,

267
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,999
he has many things to weigh on.

268
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,740
He won't do anything harmful to me.

269
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:17,199
Eat.

270
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,280
I wish you a successful auction.

271
00:19:43,939 --> 00:19:45,090
I wish you a safe journey.

00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,899
I met you at the mountain peak two years ago.

281
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:20,680
If it weren't for what happened after that,

282

I'd have gone back to look for you.

This has always been the biggest regret in my heart.

333
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,780
 Li Zeliang, come here.

334
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,160
 This is mine. This is yours.

335
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,200
 We must make sure that we don't miss anything.

336
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,384
 Come on. To the next place.

337
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,960
 Wish you a successful auction.

338
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,019
 Wish you a safe journey.

339
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,170

340
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,540
Hello, Yingsong. Where are you?

341
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,920
Rest assured.

342
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,400
I'll deliver the items to the venue on time.

343
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:55,019
In today's auction, you are the rightful host.

344
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:58,199
How's that truckload of artworks?

345
00:29:58,199 --> 00:30:00,279
As instructed, I've taken care of it.

346
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,239
This is just great.

347
00:30:05,239 --> 00:30:09,000
If any issues occur due to unauthorized transportation of the hotel's artworks,

348
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,493
he must take full responsibility for it.

349
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:14,640
He wanted to bring you down.

350
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:18,179
Let's see how he'll deal with it.

351
00:30:52,419 --> 00:30:53,719
Xie...

352
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,460
Chuchu.

353
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,560
What's the matter?

354
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,980
The auction process is all set.

355
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,959
Before the opening, you and Chairman Huo will represent Yunfeng Hotel,

356
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:14,820
and Ocean Group respectively to give a speech.

357
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,400
Take a look. See if it's okay.

358
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,580
No need. I trust you.

359
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,240
Just follow your plan.

360
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,640
Okay.

361
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:01,720

362
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:33,059
Have some water.

363
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,039
When we return, we'll first visit your sister.

364
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,480
If she's in good condition, we'll depart immediately.

365
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,960
Just follow your plan.

366
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:51,740
Hello, Dr. Zhu.

367
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,580
How's Xieqing?

368
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,820
Xieqing is recovering well?

369
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,580
Great. That's great.

370
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,319
We'll be coming tomorrow.

371
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:01,319
Thank you, Dr. Zhu.

372
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:04,759
Xieqing is well.

373
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:07,659
The doctor said she's well-behaved these two days.

374
00:33:07,659 --> 00:33:09,739
She seems to be in good-spirit.

375
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,999
That's good.

376
00:33:11,999 --> 00:33:13,619
I've thought it through.

377
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:15,820
It's better for us to live overseas.

378
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:21,719
In the future, you, me, and Xieqing, the three of us,

379
00:33:21,719 --> 00:33:23,839
will be just like in the past.

380
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:27,040
We'll never separate again. Okay?

381
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,140
Keep warm.

382
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:46,599
I'll get you a cup of milk tea.

383
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,270

384
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:07,819
 Hello, may I know who you are?

385
00:34:07,819 --> 00:34:10,419
 I saw many missed calls from this number.

386
00:34:10,419 --> 00:34:14,119
 Dr. Wu, nice to meet you.

387
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,500
I am Li Zeliang's girlfriend.

388
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,779
Mr. Li has a girlfriend?

389
00:34:19,779 --> 00:34:21,159
That's great.

390
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,980
Looks like he's recovering well.

391
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,039
No wonder he contacts me less nowadays.

392
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:26,380
 How can I help you?

393
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:30,979
I wanted to ask you about the daily care for Yan's leg.

394
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,780
But I don't have to now.

395
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:39,079
 Not everyone can accept this reality.

396
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,139
You've misunderstood.

397
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:42,619
It's not because of his leg.

398
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:43,980
 That's good then.

399
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,120
 To save someone back then, he was willing to lose his leg.

400
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,420
 He's a good man.

401
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,120
What did you say?

402
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:53,789
To save someone, his leg...

403
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:55,259
Yes.

404
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,020
That was two years ago.

405
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:00,100
 While saving someone, he injured his leg.

406
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,179
 Due to the rain and excessive bleeding,

407
00:35:02,179 --> 00:35:05,819
 his leg had been badly infected when he arrived at the hospital.

408
00:35:05,819 --> 00:35:07,959
 We could only amputate his leg.

409
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,840
 Unfortunately, the person who committed suicide couldn't be saved.

410
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,320
 Mr. Li has lost a leg for nothing.

411
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,519
 You know that I like outdoor activities.

412
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:25,638
 Sometimes, a minor accident

413
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:28,739
 can lead to unfortunate consequences.

414
00:35:28,739 --> 00:35:30,440
 That's strange.

415
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,261
 The bone of his left leg is fine. It doesn't look like an injury induced by a fall.

416
00:35:33,261 --> 00:35:38,390
♫  I never knew I once lived in the dark  ♫

417
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:41,460
♫  Till you came around  ♫

418
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,400
♫  And now I can't live without your light  ♫

419
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,650
♫  I need to be where you are  ♫

420
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:54,850
♫  Listen to the stars  ♫

421
00:35:54,850 --> 00:36:00,230
♫  They tell me every night the stories of your past  ♫

422
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:04,100
♫  Then I'd have such wings  ♫

423
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,290
♫  To fly up to the sky  ♫

424
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:11,060
♫  Even if I'll melt away  ♫

425
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:15,970
♫  To give you love  ♫

426
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,119
Director He, it's a pleasure to have you here at our auction.

427
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:44,880
Yunfeng still needs your tremendous support in the future.

428
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,339
Sure.

429
00:37:46,339 --> 00:37:47,939
This way, please.

430
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:53,239
Mr. Miller, welcome.

431
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:54,699
This way, please.

432
00:37:55,659 --> 00:37:57,259
Zeliang.

433
00:37:58,099 --> 00:37:59,699
Uncle.

434
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,339
Why are you here alone?

435
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:03,339
Where's Miss Su?

436
00:38:03,339 --> 00:38:04,860
She's dealing with other tasks.

437
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,940
So she's not here at the moment.

438
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:11,580
The auction is about to start.

439
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,860
Why do you look like you're unhappy?

440
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:20,340
It's not too late to feel happy when the auction has successfully ended.

441
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:26,559
Do you remember playing chess with me when you were little?

442
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:29,300
Back then, I've taught you

443
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:34,120
not to be so eager to finish off the chess pieces in front of you.

444
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:37,083
I can already tell

445
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:39,199
what your next step is.

446
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:47,579
Then, how did you know

447
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:51,139
that I didn't see through your next step?

448
00:39:00,219 --> 00:39:05,219
Uncle, I want to show you something.

449
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:07,419
I wonder if you'd be interested.

450
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:11,587
What's so good about it that it needs to be kept in secret?

451
00:39:13,459 --> 00:39:14,959
Okay.

452
00:39:16,139 --> 00:39:18,139
This way, Uncle.

453
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:28,900

454
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:52,220
Xiao Bai, all videos must be uploaded immediately to the company's official website.

455
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,740
- Get it? 
 - Yes.

456
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:57,819
Director Shi, it's almost time. Shall we start now?

457
00:39:57,819 --> 00:39:59,999
Have you seen Chairman Huo and Director Li?

458
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,140
No.

459
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,959
Where are they?

460
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,180
Uncle, I know you've been keeping an eye on Ji Yingsong.

461
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:42,580
So, when Ji Yingsong delivered the items to the warehouse,

462
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,680
it was just a smokescreen.

463
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,280
I've arranged earlier

464
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,659
for the real items to be delivered via another route.

465
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:54,060
Of course, it includes the items you bought from Boss Qin,

466
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,980
the owner of Pinxuan Art Gallery.

467
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,860
Those items you sent someone to burn off

468
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:02,760
were only garbage taken from the storage.

469
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,779
I don't understand what you are talking about.

470
00:41:09,779 --> 00:41:11,940
But I really want to know

471
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,740
why Ocean Group's collections

472
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,499
are here.

473
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:21,800
You've indeed personally bought those artworks yourself.

474
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,080
You can recognize them at a glance.

475
00:41:24,939 --> 00:41:28,540
These collections look familiar to you, am I right?

476
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,080
As for why they are here,

477
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,599
you should know it well.

478
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:39,139
I'm sorry. I don't know it well.

479
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,479
Back then,

480
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,611
out of his trust in you,

481
00:41:45,611 --> 00:41:49,779
my dad put you solely in charge of the acquisition of artworks.

482
00:41:50,739 --> 00:41:53,406
Tens of millions of expenses

483
00:41:53,406 --> 00:41:55,959
have gone into your own pocket.

484
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,784
The remaining amount

485
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,900
is here.

486
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,980
Maybe

487
00:42:05,853 --> 00:42:08,620
my dad died

488
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:13,720
because he'd seen through your true colors.

489
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:21,160
♫  I need you, I love you  ♫

490
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,710
♫  I'll brave the waves for you  ♫

00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:28,100
♫  You don't have to be brave all the time  ♫

492
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:33,800
♫  Please believe that I am by your side  ♫

493
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:39,470
♫  Ever and after  ♫

494
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:51,740

495
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:59,840
♫  Halfway through the journey on the train,  ♫

496
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,660
♫  a new passenger takes a seat  ♫

497
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:07,990
♫  The bells on the platform are ringing  ♫

498
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:10,460
♫  I wave my hands to see the passengers off  ♫

499
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:14,190
♫  With a one-way ticket stub in your hand  ♫

500
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:17,810
♫  you've embarked on a journey to happiness  ♫

501
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:21,310
♫  I didn't save your contact information  ♫

502
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:24,570
♫  But in my heart, I secretly ask  ♫

503
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:26,520
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

504
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,400
♫  How's it going with him?  ♫

505
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,040
♫  I bet his temper is better than mine  ♫

506
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,890
♫  He's better at guessing your complicated thoughts  ♫

507
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:39,790
♫  Does he hold you when you're sad?  ♫

508
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:41,670
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

509
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:43,500
♫  Everything must be going well  ♫

510
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:47,530
♫  Do you want to hear what I haven't said?  ♫

511
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:54,920
♫  Do lyrics of love songs stir up your emotions and recall all of our memories?  ♫

512
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:59,220
♫  It doesn't seem to be difficult  ♫

513
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:27,390
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

514
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:29,140
♫  How's it going with him?  ♫

515
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:33,060
♫  You and fate have not given me an answer  ♫

516
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:37,010
♫  The price of growing up is like a pile of bargaining chip  ♫

517
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:40,710
♫  The wager is who can let go first  ♫

518
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,560
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

519
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,540
♫  Everything must be going well  ♫

520
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:48,710
♫  Life is not as complicated as I thought  ♫

521
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:53,060
♫  Silence is the best that I can do  ♫

522
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:56,100
♫  Whatever pain and suffering may come,  ♫

523
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,640
♫  I'm not afraid at all  ♫

524
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:09,660
