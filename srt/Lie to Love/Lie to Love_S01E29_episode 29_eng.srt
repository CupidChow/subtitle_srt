♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

20
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,279
 Little hedgehog. You're so cute.

21
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:29,919
 You look just like a hairy egg.

22
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,450

23
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:51,100
 Let's not see each other again.

24
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,779
 Don't contact me anymore.

25
00:02:53,779 --> 00:02:55,719
 From now on, we have nothing to do with each other.

26
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,960

27
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,620

28
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,640
 You wouldn't even look me in the eye when you said those things.

29
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,960
 I believe you have your own reasons.

30
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,179
 Could you tell Chestnut and me about it?

31
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:09,579
Xieqing. I'm here.

32
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,360
I'm having a terrible headache. Help me.

33
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,360
Headache?

34
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,099
What's the matter?

35
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:37,654
If you're having a headache, you should take medicine. Come on.

36
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,720
No, I feel like throwing up.

37
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,239
Super strong fever medication. It's very effective.

38
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:52,320
Here. No, I feel like throwing up.

39
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,080
Come on.

40
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,280
Do you want it to fry your brains? I'm saving your brains for a purpose.

41
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,842
When you recall the account number and password, I won't give a dime if you have a high fever.

42
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,840
Dropping the act already?

43
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:26,920
Trying to trick me into getting you out using the battered-body ruse?

44
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,920
Save it.

45
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,038
Are you even human?

46
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:34,700
So what if I am? And what if I'm not?

47
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,879
I came just to share some good news with you.

48
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,280
Xieyi broke up with Li Zeliang.

49
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,839
She's back by my side and she's going to be with me forever.

50
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,979
That's impossible.

51
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:51,199
Xieyi will never fall in love with you.

52
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,460
I know. But so what?

53
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,430
What matters is she pretends to fall head over heels in love with me.

54
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,290
Xieqing, you should know best.

55
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,660
Fake love is a kind of love too, isn't it?

56
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,680
I forgot to tell you.

57
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,959
It's all thanks to you.

58
00:06:13,179 --> 00:06:16,860
I told Xieyi that you're still alive. She wants to see you so badly.

59
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,900
That's why she broke up with Li Zeliang.

60
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,259
You used me to threaten her?

61
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:26,919
Xie Minghao. That's so shameless of you.

62
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,240
Xieqing. There's something that I want to ask you.

63
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,180
Did you leave a message to Xieyi or something?

64
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,160
How did she figure out that what happened to Zhiwei two years ago was related to me.

65
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,979
Also, she said that I've been controlling you.

66
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,180

67
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,320
From the looks of it, she has gotten her hands on it.

68
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,360
On what?

69
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:25,479
All thanks to you then.

70
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:28,680
You gave it to her yourself.

71
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,260
I'd given you a chance.

72
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,810
If you had the slightest bit of love for me,

73
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:41,039
Xieyi wouldn't have found out.

74
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:46,099
So what if she knows?

75
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:48,739
She still came back to me.

76
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,360
I'm going on a first date with Xieyi today. So I'm in a good mood.

77
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,119
As for the account number and password, I won't force you anymore.

78
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:59,820
I hope you'll recall it tomorrow.

79
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,399
You must be hungry.

80
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,819
Eat up. This is all the courtesy of your sister.

81
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:15,459
Enjoy.

82
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:22,659
Don't forget to get changed.

83
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:30,999
Xie Minghao, you scumbag!

84
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:32,539
What's the matter?

85
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:33,920
What's going on?

86
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,020
Did you have a fight?

87
00:08:37,297 --> 00:08:38,757
She's in one of her moods today.

88
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:41,718
That's how couples are. You'll fight now, but kiss and make up later on.

89
00:08:41,718 --> 00:08:44,419
- Just cheer her up will do. 
 - That's right.

90
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:50,619
Did you make this?

91
00:08:50,619 --> 00:08:52,530
Thank you.

92
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,930
You seem like someone who spoils your wife.

93
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,530
Did you just move in here?

94
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:58,799
Yes, we just moved in.

95
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:01,859
I live over there. If there's anything, just let me know.

96
00:09:01,859 --> 00:09:03,020
Sure.

97
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,860
So sorry for disturbing you.

98
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,559
It's okay. I'll get going then.

99
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,359
Okay.

100
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,500
Finish it. Make sure there are no leftovers.

101
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,579
Otherwise, don't think about seeing Xieyi again.

102
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,000
These clothes that I bought for you suit you well.

103
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,800
What do you think?

104
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,779
Xieyi. Let's grab a doll.

105
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,500
I don't like it.

106
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,940
But I remember you do.

107
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,840
Come on.

108
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,279
Which do you like? Pick one.

109
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,080
This.

110
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,460
Okay.

111
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:43,819
For you.

112
00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:45,619
Thank you.

113
00:10:45,619 --> 00:10:47,879
Do you remember the doll that Xieqing had?

114
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:50,500
It was meant for you.

115
00:10:51,099 --> 00:10:52,980
But too bad, Xieqing took it. No one will fight with you anymore.

116
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,139
No one will fight with you anymore. It's all yours now.

117
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:00,799
Today, I got to do a lot of things that I'd been wanted to do with you.

118
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:04,740
I'm really happy. Are you?

119
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,760
Xieyi. What are you looking at?

120
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,739
Brother Minghao.

121
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:17,120
There's a famous store in the mall that sells double skin milk.

122
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,040
Brother Minghao, buy one for me.

123
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,057
Okay. I'll get it for you right away.

124
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,759
I need time to get used to this.

125
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:29,420
Okay. I'll give you time.

126
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,459
Wait for me here. I'll be right back.

Is Xie Minghao using the fire incident in Lantian Bay to blackmail you?

141
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,960
The incident in Lantian Bay was my doing. You don't have to investigate it anymore.

142
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,000
Xieyi. What exactly are you afraid of?

143
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,339
Xie Minghao isn't a good person.

144
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:14,360
He has something to do with what happened to your dad and sister.

145
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,020
Give me some time.

146
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,420
The police will find the evidence soon.

147
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:22,259
I'm well aware of the kind of person he is.

148
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,917
But just now,

149
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:28,770
you deliberately sent Xie Minghao away. Right?

150
00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:32,420
I just didn't want the two of you to fight.

151

Xieyi.

152

You still worry about me. Right?

153
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,479
Don't flatter yourself.

154
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:46,960
Let go of me.

155
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,560
Don't move.

Xieyi.

Do you remember the polygraph game that we played?

160
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,620
You still love me.

♫  Listen to my heart  ♫

165
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:23,160
♫  If I can grow a piece of feather on every scar  ♫

166
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,840
♫  Then I'd have such wings  ♫

167
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,819
Xieyi. We've been through so much together.

168
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:32,257
I don't believe...

169
00:14:32,257 --> 00:14:34,877
I don't believe you'll fall for someone else that easily.

170
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:36,382
♫  To give you love  ♫

171
00:14:36,382 --> 00:14:39,142
You must be keeping something from me.

172
00:14:39,142 --> 00:14:41,560
Tell me, will you?

173
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,359
No matter what it is,

174
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:45,839
I'll weather the storm with you.

175
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,760
My sister...

176
00:14:50,762 --> 00:14:52,862
Li Zeliang!

177
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,759
You two have broken up!

178
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:00,019
Your conduct constitutes harassment! I can call the police!

179
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:16,100
Li Zeliang. If there's still a shred of conscience in you,

180
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,180
let go of Xieyi.

181
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:21,200
Li Zeliang.

182
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,579
We've broken up.

183
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:26,180
Stop bothering me.

184
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,799
I've broken up with Li Zeliang.

185
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:03,000
So when are you taking me to see my sister?

186
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,180
Let go of me!

187
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:13,939
Let go of me!

188
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,919
So only Li Zeliang can hug you?

189
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,760
Where's my sister's picture for today?

190
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,479
As a punishment, there's none.

191
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,799
Xie Minghao. You...

192
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:40,780
Don't think I don't know what you're up to.

193
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:44,279
You're trying to gather pictures of your sister to analyze her location, right?

194
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:45,720
Listen up.

195
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,041
I've edited all the photos. You won't get anything from it.

196
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,300
The more you can't forget Li Zeliang,

197
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,499
the more I'm going to double down on my efforts to take Ocean down!

198
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:57,020
Don't tell me you can't even pretend that you love me.

199
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,980
Oh, right. Something big is going down tomorrow.

200
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,839
Just wait for it.

201
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,160
It's a deal then. We'll buy that bag this weekend.

202
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,540
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

203
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,140
Oh, no! We have a situation here!

204
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:35,440
What's the matter? It's not like the world has come to an end. Don't sweat it.

205
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,659
Stop eating already.

206
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,360
The world has.

207
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,179
 Lately, Ocean has had a little bit of a setback,

208
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:50,319
 but our performance has always far exceeded our peers.

209
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,920
 The substantial shareholding disclosure by Zhengde and Diying

210
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,840
 shows the confidence that they have in Ocean's future development.

211
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,650
Well said! Well said, Chairman Li.

212
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,400
What brings you here, President Dai?

213
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,540
I heard you're holding a charity event around the area.

214
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,499
So I dropped by to show my support.

215
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:11,000
Besides, I'm part of Ocean now.

216
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,660
That makes us family. Come on!

217
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:16,680
Look.

218
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,939
Since we're a family, won't you give me a hug?

219
00:18:19,939 --> 00:18:22,739
It's very disheartening, you see.

220
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:30,200
 Ladies and gentlemen.

221
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,359
 This is a charity donation event for hearing impaired children.

222
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:37,039
 Please focus on today's theme.

223
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,039
 Next, let's have Mr. Li Zeliang make a donation to Zhenai Hospital

224
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,519
 on behalf of Ocean Hotel.

225
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:45,599
 This way, Chairman Li.

226
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,500
- Zeliang. 
 - Chairman Li.

227
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,939
- Zeliang. 
 - Chairman Li, are you okay? Can you stand?

228
00:18:50,939 --> 00:18:54,419
I heard you once broke your left leg!

229
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,079
On top of that, you're suffering from burnout lately.

230
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:01,859
Your health condition is worrisome.

231
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:03,620
If you're not feeling well,

232
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,140
you should just stay at home.

233
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,960
Stop taking pictures! All of you!

234
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:12,940
Everyone. Indeed, I injured my left leg.

235
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,319
But it's always been taken care of by a professional doctor.

236
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:20,300
It's nothing serious, nor will it affect the future development of Ocean.

237
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,440
President Dai. Thank you for your concern.

238
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,160
I hope with you joining us, it'll take us to new heights.

239
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,720
Of course. That's for sure.

240
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,120
Here.

241
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,680
Invite the higher-ups to the stage to take a group photo.

242
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,180
Let's have the hospital representatives on the stage take a photo. Welcome.

243
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,160

244
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:57,759
President Dai.

245
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:59,559
You can go down now.

246
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,960
Is your leg all right?

247
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,000
Chuchu.

248
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,200
Don't you think it's weird that Xieyi resigned?

249
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,412
Her leaving Ocean is the right thing to do.

250
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,000
What's the matter?

251
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,359
Even now, you're still concerned about her?

252
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:20,760
Are you aware of Ocean's situation now?

253
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,721
I bet you had an ulterior motive for putting her in charge

254
00:20:24,721 --> 00:20:27,103
of the Lantian Bay project all of a sudden.

255
00:20:27,103 --> 00:20:28,900
That's right.

256
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,540
I have no reason to hide it from you.

257
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:34,400
Before all this went down, I knew she was going to tinker with the purchase.

258
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,340
But I did that just to catch her in the act.

259
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,319
I didn't know it would turn into such a big deal.

260
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:41,659
Who told you that?

261
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:44,580
Xie Minghao, right?

262
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,119
Yes.

263
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:50,200
I did all this for Ocean's sake. I have a clear conscience.

264
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,480
Chuchu, I know everything you've done is for Ocean's sake,

265
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,680
but your method might not be the right one.

266
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,800
Take my advice. Stay away from Xie Minghao.

267
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,440
You don't even know him.

268
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,839
He and Dai Ziang are very tight now. Do you know that?

269
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:03,900
Do you know Su Xieyi then?

270
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,580
Everything she did was to avenge the Shen family.

271
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,680
She's the root cause for all that has happened!

272
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,160
She isn't worthy of your love.

273
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:23,699
Chuchu, I've said it before. Between us, we're just friends.

274
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,039
Xieyi has been tricked by Xie Minghao.

275
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:27,739
So have you.

276
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,439
Friends? Li Zeliang.

277
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,700
Is there a friend like me who's willing to rip her heart out for you?

278
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,940
Did you know that everyone started to avoid you after Zhengde suddenly boosted its stake?

279
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,879
I am the only one who is still by your side.

280
00:21:42,879 --> 00:21:46,140
I even begged my dad to help you.

281
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,720
If my method is wrong, I don't mind apologizing to you.

282
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,079
But everything I do is for your own good.

283
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,700
I don't need that from you.

284
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,500
When you're wrong, you're wrong.

285
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:08,099
So It's all my wishful thinking?

286
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,300
Listen carefully.

287
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:16,730
I don't need your sympathy or your apology.

288
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,800
Shi Chuchu.

289
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,800
All right.

290
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:27,140
Li Zeliang. Remember what you've said today.

291
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,499
Don't come begging me ever again.

292
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,960
Mr. Xie.

293
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,500
Here's another good news.

294
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,320
Li Zeliang and Shi Chuchu had a falling out.

295
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,280
Director Shi.

296
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,000
Why did you suddenly ask me out for sightseeing?

297
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,540
Zhengde and Diying Media boosted their stakes at the same time. Do you know that?

298
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,819
It's the talk of the town. Who doesn't know?

299
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:16,219
Why didn't you tell me that you're tight with President Dai?

300
00:23:16,219 --> 00:23:19,279
Between Zhengde and I, it's just normal business cooperation.

301
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:22,837
You should know better who's responsible for that batch of insulation boards.

302
00:23:22,837 --> 00:23:24,500
Besides, you saw it yourself.

303
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,718
Chairman Li has always had a problem with me.

304
00:23:26,718 --> 00:23:29,699
I'm no longer in charge of Ocean's important contracts.

305
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:33,219
I'm just a lawyer. I need to make a living.

306
00:23:33,219 --> 00:23:36,159
Well, what's the deal with President Dai?

307
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,720
President Dai is one who holds a grudge.

308
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,179
Previously, Chairman Li stole the deal with Fujiade from him.

309
00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:43,200
He's been holding a grudge since.

310
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,468
Now that Ocean is rife with scandals,

311
00:23:45,468 --> 00:23:47,419
he's not going to let such a good opportunity slip away.

312
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:51,779
Tomorrow, he plans to hold a shareholders meeting in Ocean to impeach Li Zeliang.

313
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,720
I won't let that happen.

314
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:10,100
Director Shi, I think this is a good opportunity for you.

315
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,039
Why is that?

316
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:14,837
I have heard about you and Li Zeliang.

317
00:24:14,837 --> 00:24:17,958
The fire in Lantian Bay was clearly Xieyi's fault.

318
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,837
He chose to protect her

319
00:24:19,837 --> 00:24:22,000
and hold you accountable instead.

320
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,920
After what he's done to you,

321
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,079
won't you feel disheartened?

322
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,759
I think tomorrow's shareholders' meeting is the best time for you to test him.

323
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:37,019
At that time, if he still refuses to beg you for help,

324
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:39,919
what else do you expect of him then?

325
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:47,700
Be it career or love, making a timely exit is the best choice.

326
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,760
Why are you looking at me like that?

327
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,759
Does it suddenly hit you that I'm the one who knows you best?

328
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,040
Actually, we're the same.

329
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:08,000
In love, we're the ones who need to be saved.

330
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,839
Thank you for your concern.

331
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,639
It's quite a nice view.

332
00:25:17,639 --> 00:25:19,780
You can come here more often.

333
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,740
 There's no trace of my sister living here.

334
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,560
 Where exactly is she?

335
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,570

336
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,400
- Hello? 
 -  Miss Su.

337
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,619
 Why did Mr. Li postpone the follow-up?

338
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:25,880
Follow-up?

339
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,119
 Mr. Li is suffering from osteomyelitis and it's serious.

340
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,459
 You have to take it seriously.

341
00:26:30,459 --> 00:26:31,920
What did you say?

342
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,219
 If it's not treated in time, osteomyelitis may become cancerous.

343
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:37,899
 Bring him to do a follow-up as soon as possible.

344
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,199
Understood.

345
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,180
Cancerous?

346
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:49,659
Oh, no. Our company's stock price keeps dropping.

347
00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:52,000
Isn't it evil of Zhengde to boost its stake now?

348
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,599
Chairman Li is nowhere to be seen. Should we run?

349
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:56,100
Come on! It's not like we're going to war.

350
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,279
Should we invite a master here to do prayers and get rid of bad luck?

351
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:01,259
You look like one to me. Why don't you perform the ceremony?

352
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,679
It's Xieyi. I'm sure she knows what's happening.

353
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:10,200
Hello, Mingyue.

354
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,000
 Hey, Xieyi. Where are you? Why haven't you been coming to work?

355
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,077
I have things to take care of.

356
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:18,600
By the way, where's Chairman Li? Is he in the office?

357
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,500
Don't you know? Zhengde and Diying have boosted their stakes

358
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,459
and they hold over 10 percent of Ocean shares.

359
00:27:23,459 --> 00:27:25,640
We're all worried sick and we can't get a hold of Chairman Li.

360
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,000
Can't get a hold of him?

361
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,560
He's not in the office anyway. Is he at home?

362
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,599
I have things to do. That's all for now.

363
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,699
 You can't meet or contact Li Zeliang anymore.

364
00:27:52,699 --> 00:27:56,419
 No WeChat, phone calls, or emails. Nothing.

365
00:27:56,419 --> 00:27:59,380
 Otherwise, you know what I would do to Xieqing and Li Zeliang, right?

366
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,359
Hello.

367
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:17,950
Xieyi, where are you?

368
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,839
Just taking a stroll outside.

369
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:24,139
Come with me to a party tonight.

370
00:28:24,139 --> 00:28:25,400
With whom?

371
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,140
You'll know when you get there.

372
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,000

373
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,559
You're really something.

374
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:56,519
I haven't even made you pay for standing me up the other day.

375
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:00,000
And now, you're making me drink with you during the day.

376
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,100
All right. Stop drinking.

377
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,559
You've had enough.

378
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,400
You merely had a fight with A'Liang. All right.

379
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,779
Right now, I'll give him a call and get him to come apologize to you.

380
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,480
I don't want to see him.

381
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,559
A'Liang has been under a lot of pressure lately.

382
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,539
After the fire in Lantian Bay, he had to make a public apology.

383
00:29:19,539 --> 00:29:22,939
It's normal to be in a bad mood. Be more understanding.

384
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,100
Understanding of him?

385
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,410
He's clearly being unprofessional.

386
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,540
You know what?

387
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,738
The fire in Lantian Bay happened

388
00:29:31,738 --> 00:29:35,640
because Su Xieyi bought a batch of low-quality insulation boards to avenge the Shen family.

389
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,019
Zeliang made a public apology to protect her.

390
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:40,890
Xieyi taking revenge? That's impossible!

391
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:44,340
Her feelings for A'Liang are real. There's no reason for her to take revenge.

392
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,980
Why are all of you taking her side?

393
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,999
Boring.

394
00:29:49,999 --> 00:29:52,079
- I'm leaving. 
 - Shi Chuchu, stand right there!

395
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:53,779
Shi Chuchu!

396
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,879
I went to visit Xieyi the other day.

397
00:29:56,879 --> 00:29:59,799
A'Liang just had a fight with her and she was very depressed.

398
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,519
So she told me what happened back then.

399
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:06,759
Zhiwei's bankruptcy had nothing to do with A'Liang.

400
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:11,359
It was all Shen Xieqing and Xie Minghao's doing.

401
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:18,559
What do you mean?

402
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:19,920
Make things clear.

403
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,900
I can do that.

404
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:31,859
Chuchu. I came to apologize to you.

405
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,080
I'm sorry.

406
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,919
I deliberately said those things in the afternoon for President Dai to hear.

407
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:54,499
 I don't need that from you.

408
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,020
 When you're wrong, you're wrong.

409
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:02,279
Lately, Dai Ziang and Xie Minghao have been very tight.

410
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:03,640
I've checked.

411
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:09,397
Zhengde and Diying's shareholders are Dai Ziang and Xie Minghao.

412
00:31:09,397 --> 00:31:11,600
Judging from today's situation,

413
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,300
their motives are simple, which is to acquire Ocean.

414
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,079
Xie Minghao is Diying's shareholder?

415
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:23,959
Not only that. Before Shen Xieqing went missing, she met up with me.

416
00:31:23,959 --> 00:31:28,119
She admitted that Zhiwei's funding hole was related to her.

417
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:32,599
In terms of the contract, this thing had to be done through Xie Minghao.

418
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,359
He's Shen Xieqing's fiance.

419
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:39,259
So I surmise that these things must have something to do with him.

420
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:42,920
I've explained everything to the police.

421
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,880
On top of that, have you considered the fact that perhaps, the timing of the disclosure

422
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,597
of the project proposals weren't after we decided to go through with the project

423
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:54,869
but before?

424
00:31:54,869 --> 00:32:01,078
And during that time, only Xie Minghao fits the criteria to do that.

425
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,320
 Actually, there are two options available for Ocean.

426
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,138
 First, set up hotels overseas. Second, build local projects.

427
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:15,499
 As expected of our ace commercial lawyer. You sure know a lot.

428
00:32:15,499 --> 00:32:17,820
 I'm responsible for commercial projects.

429
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,780
 If I don't even know these,

430
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,990
 it means I haven't been doing my job.

431
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,690
 The transaction hasn't even gone through.

432
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:26,750
 If you make a deal out of this, it won't do any harm to Xieyi.

433
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:31,099
 I know how you feel. But we have to be patient.

434
00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:35,120
 It will only work if you report her after the transaction goes through.

435
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,699
The logic behind all this turmoil is pretty obvious now.

436
00:32:38,699 --> 00:32:42,279
From the story leaked out by He Jianghua to the fire in Lantian Bay,

437
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:45,379
they're the ones responsible for all that.

438
00:32:45,379 --> 00:32:49,219
Their motives are simple. They want to suppress Ocean's stock price

439
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:53,670
and then, take the opportunity to buy Ocean shares.

440
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:56,430
I've been fooled by Xie Minghao all this time.

441
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,750
Even today, he was still trying to fool me.

442
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:00,780
I was too impulsive.

443
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:06,140
Chuchu, it's not your fault. Xie Minghao is too cunning.

444
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,359
Now that Ocean is in trouble, you, of all people, are more worried.

445
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:13,080
It's my fault for being insensitive.

446
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,919
That's enough. Don't just keep apologizing to one another.

447
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:20,839
Right now, it's the time we join hands and fight against the enemy.

448
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:25,600
A'Liang. You already have a plan in mind, right?

449
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,759
Don't bother. After the shareholding disclosure, Dai Ziang will surely force me to step down.

450
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:32,920
At that time, I'll need all nine directors to vote by show of hands.

451
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,480
Lately, Dai Ziang is tight with a few of them. So...

452
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,820
Chuchu, your vote will be especially critical.

453
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:42,819
I think Xie Minghao will try to rope you in.

454
00:33:42,819 --> 00:33:43,920
That's right.

455
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,480
He already did.

456
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,100
But don't worry. This time, I'm not going to take their side.

457
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:53,939
No. On the contrary, I think you should support him.

458
00:33:53,939 --> 00:33:55,660
Why?

459
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,759
I've long been a thorn in Dai Ziang and Xie Minghao's sides.

460
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:03,440
If I don't step down, they'll only double down their efforts to take Ocean down.

461
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,020
Why don't I take evasive action?

462
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:10,259
Dai Ziang is the kind to let his guard down once he gets carried away.

463
00:34:10,259 --> 00:34:13,597
Besides, given Dai Ziang's capability,

464
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,880
he couldn't possibly come up with that many funds to buy Ocean's equity.

465
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,800
He has always been known for being aggressive and vicious.

466
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,710
If I'm right,

467
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:27,000
he is likely to pledge his equity in Zhengde.

468
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,200
Got it. His aggressiveness is his weak point that gives us an edge over him.

469
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,719
If we can find evidence of him behind the Lantian Bay incident,

470
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,840
then it will backfire on Zhengde, and its stock price will plummet.

471
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:42,590
At that time, he'll surely sell Ocean's shares that he just bought to save Zhengde.

472
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:47,040
If luck isn't on his side, there'll be forced liquidation of his pledged equity.

473
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,600
Then, he'll end up empty-handed.

474
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:55,360
Wow, incredible!

475
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,500
Such a wonderful business war. Director Shi and Chairman Li.

476
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,700
How can I just sit by and watch? It's too exciting.

477
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:07,250
So? Do you want to play us a rock song to liven things up?

478
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:10,800
Zhengde's pledged equity is just your speculation.

479
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,990
We need to verify it first.

480
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:15,370
Besides, this is huge.

481
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:17,700
You'll need my help to ask around.

482
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:23,150
This time, Hou Xiaodong could be of help.

483
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:26,290
After all, his dad is a fund industry giant.

484
00:35:26,299 --> 00:35:29,520
Madam. I haven't been home in years.

485
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,740
That's why you should go home.

486
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,660
Chuchu.

487
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,960
Spare him.

488
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:42,239
Xiaodong chose to be a rock singer to avoid inheriting his family business.

489
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:44,839
A'Liang, you're such a loyal friend.

490
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:49,920
So Since my buddy is in trouble, how can I sit by and do nothing?

491
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:04,640
President Dai. The reason I helped was solely for my own reputation.

492
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,000
I shall not accept money that... I shouldn't.

493
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,840
What do you mean by that? It's what you deserved.

494
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,300
Here, I'll put it in for you. Here. Don't stand on ceremony.

495
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,280
No, President Dai. I really can't take it.

496
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,780
This kind of thing can't happen again.

497
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:22,370
You chief editor have quite some character.

498
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:24,480
- Acting noble, huh? 
 - No.

499
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,460
Fine. Go home and think about it.

500
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:34,200
President Dai. Well... I shall get going then.

501
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:49,979
Miss Su. Lawyer Xie. President Dai is waiting for you inside.

502
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:01,620

503
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:08,187
Give me your phone. I don't want anyone to interrupt my private party.

504
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,880
Satisfied?

505
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:22,710
Yes, she just went inside.

506
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:25,000
She was with Xie Minghao.

507
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,159
Keep an eye on them.

508
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:28,759
Okay.

509
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,820
Hello, Mr. Li. Hold on. I just saw someone.

510
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,040
-  Who?  
 - He Jianghua.

511
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,639
Follow him.

512
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:40,975
Let me know where you are later. I'm coming over now.

513
00:37:40,975 --> 00:37:42,260
Okay.

514
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:46,099
Come on. Welcome.

515
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:48,199
Finally, you brought your girlfriend along.

516
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,899
Hi, President Dai.

517
00:37:49,899 --> 00:37:51,700
Hi.

518
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,440
Have we met somewhere before?

519
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,820
The crab roe noodles restaurant. You're getting prettier.

520
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:03,600
President Dai. Tomorrow is the day for us boosting our stakes. How about celebrating it?

521
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,880
That's right. I've prepared the wine.

522
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,370
It's all thanks to Miss Su. You have to drink this.

523
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,980
If it hadn't been for you,

524
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,970
it wouldn't be that easy for us to become Ocean's shareholders.

525
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:15,420
Here. Cheers.

526
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,150
President Dai is an outstanding person.

527
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:21,030
It's an honor for Ocean to have you as its shareholder.

528
00:38:21,737 --> 00:38:25,280
Is it? But what I want isn't to be just the shareholder.

529
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,190
Tomorrow, we're attending Ocean's board meeting.

530
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:32,170
At that time, Li Zeliang won't be able to keep his position.

531
00:38:32,177 --> 00:38:35,859
Here. Cheers. Miss Su.

532
00:38:35,859 --> 00:38:38,470

533
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:48,739
Mr. Li. He's inside.

534
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:54,219
Okay. Wait outside for me.

535
00:38:54,219 --> 00:38:55,739
Okay.

536
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,640
Li Zeliang. What brings you here?

537
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,119
Well, you stood me up the other day.

538
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:22,877
I came here today to have a chat with you, Chief Editor He.

539
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,459
I don't think we have anything to talk about.

540
00:39:27,459 --> 00:39:29,059
Really?

541
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:36,257
I would like to ask you something regarding the fire in Lantian Bay.

542
00:39:36,257 --> 00:39:41,890
Look, the directors aren't happy with a lot of things that Li Zeliang did.

543
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:44,090
The board has nine members.

544
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,320
I've roped three of them over.

545
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,819
Me included, we have four votes on our side.

546
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:54,319
The most important now is Shi Chuchu's vote.

547
00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:58,240
She has had a fall out with Li Zeliang.

548
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,039
On top of that, I've messed with her mind.

549
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:02,679
So it's not going to be a problem.

550
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:03,840
Nice!

551
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,159
The thought of the situation that Li Zeliang will be in tomorrow

552
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:10,440
just makes me feel so good.

553
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,479
I can't help but shake it.

554
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,200
Li Zeliang.

555
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:27,160
Brother Minghao. How about a dance?

556
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,360
Yes!

557
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,519
Nice!

558
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:30,960
That's a good suggestion.

559
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,400
I found something on the construction site in Lantian Bay.

560
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,099
Mr. He. Take a look.
