=Episode 5=

19
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,120
I'm here

20
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,240
mainly

21
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,159
to apologize to you.

22
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,400
I shouldn't have doubted you.

23
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,360
Actually,

24
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,520
I already recognized you

25
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,560
from the first day we met.

26
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,400
But when I knew

27
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,719
you lost your memories,

28
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,319
I was worried you would forget about me

29
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,400
and I was scared I would
behave recklessly.

30
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,120
So

31
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,039
I couldn't tell you the truth,

32
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:43,280
which led to testing you.

33
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,439
But I'm here

34
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,280
to tell you

35
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,120
that I'm certain

36
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,439
you're still the same girl I knew.

37
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,120
Mr. Li,

38
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,879
I've given it thought.

39
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,879
About me being the girl

40
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,840
you've met,

41
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,680
I'm going to let that pass.

42
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,719
After all,

43
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,439
we need to move forward.

44
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,800
Even if

45
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,639
I was involved with you in the past,

46
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,080
but I'm sure it wasn't a pleasant one

47
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,719
judging from how you were resisting me.

48
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,159
Since it wasn't a pleasant one,

49
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,599
why bring trouble to yourself?

50
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:29,240
So

51
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,840
I've decided to stop

52
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,360
thinking about the past.

53
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,599
Okay.

54
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,039
Since you're not willing to remember

55
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,520
the past,

56
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,039
you can consider

57
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,319
we're getting to know each other again.

58
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:47,520
Am I right?

59
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,400
You may be my subordinate.

60
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:51,680
Don't tell me

61
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,240
we can't

62
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,800
be friends again.

63
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,400
What are you doing?

64
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,800
Didn't you say to be friends?

65
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,120
Is there a need to sit so close, then?

66
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,639
I live here.

67
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,439
I'm used to sitting here.

68
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,040
Fine.

69
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:38,319
Miss Su,

70
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:41,680
the design and furnishings

71
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,040
of your house

72
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,480
bring a sense of nostalgia.

73
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,680
Why would a young

74
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,240
and fashionable lady like you

75
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,399
choose to live

76
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,399
in a house like this?

77
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,959
(There he goes again.)

78
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,240
My dad left his house for me.

79
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,199
I lived here when I was a kid.

80
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,560
He bought

81
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,399
all the furniture in this house.

82
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,759
So I want to keep it the same.

83
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,879
I see.

84
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:09,959
By the way,

85
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,720
do you still remember

86
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,399
how you lost your memories?

87
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,399
I know

88
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,920
some friends from the medical industry.

89
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,439
They might be able to help.

90
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,839
I said it was an accident.

91
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,319
As for the details,

92
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,959
I don't remember

93
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,680
and I don't want to remember.

94
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,720
Do you remember

95
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:33,079
I've given you a business card

96
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,439
with my contact details?

97
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:38,079
Haven't you thought

98
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:40,160
of contacting me for the past two years?

99
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:46,279
I'm sorry.

100
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,720
I don't remember about this.

101
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,519
If you think

102
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,839
I'm lying to you,

103
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,279
there's nothing I can do.

104
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,680
You are lying to me.

105
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,279
What?

106
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:01,800
I see you have a coffee machine.

107
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:08,399
All right.

108
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,199
If you want to have some coffee,

109
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,079
I can brew a cup for you.

110
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:13,920
Okay.

111
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,360
After you finish your coffee,

112
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,000
please leave my house.

113
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,120
Okay.

114
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,770
(Involved in corporate fraud, Chairman
Shen Zhi Hong committed suicide)

115
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,199
Your coffee is here.

116
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:12,480
Thank you.

117
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,079
It tastes good.

118
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,759
The good thing about coffee

119
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,560
is you'll feel more awake
after drinking it.

120
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:29,759
That way, you won't get lost

121
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:30,959
when you go home.

122
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,680
Okay.

123
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,319
Thank you, Miss Su.

124
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,160
I'll get going, then.

125
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,000
I won't see you off.

126
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,600
Take good care of the coat.

127
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:56,720
Thank you, Mr. Li.

128
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,399
It's the current season's
limited edition.

129
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,600
It suits you.

130
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,920
Remember to wear it tomorrow.

131
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,000
Okay, Mr. Li.

132
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,360
I'm leaving now.

133
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,160
Mr. Li, see you.

134
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,600
See you.

135
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,519
He must be up to no good

136
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,319
for giving me the coat.

137
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,639
Could he have

138
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,079
installed something in my house?

139
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,280
(My greatest wish is to go to the top
of the mountain to see the sunrise.)

140
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:22,679
(My dad had always)

141
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:24,279
wanted to watch the sunrise here.

142
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,200
But he was busy working all the time.

143
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:27,960
That's why

144
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,399
I come here secretly

145
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,080
to snap a picture of the sunrise

146
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,120
and give it to him

147
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,919
as a birthday present.

148
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,240
He'll love it.

149
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:42,799
Xie Ming Hao

150
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,519
was Zhiwei's commercial lawyer.

151
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,159
No wonder they know each other.

152
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,559
Mr. Li,

153
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:48,799
do you think Miss Su

154
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,639
is related to Zhiwei?

155
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,480
It's possible.

156
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:53,480
Will she

157
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,039
get in the way of our plan?

158
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,639
Keep an eye on her.

159
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,519
Okay.

160
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:01,919
Mr. Li,

161
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:02,799
Uncle Bai

162
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,039
knows a lot about Zhiwei, right?

163
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,759
You can ask him tomorrow.

164
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:12,840
Good morning.

165
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:13,639
Morning.

166
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:17,840
Morning.

167
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,679
Morning.

168
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,159
Wait a minute.

169
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:22,559
Wait.

170
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,879
I'm so sorry.

171
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,320
I'm sorry.

172
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,399
Your clothes

173
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,480
look pretty.

174
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:38,519
Thank you.

175
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,559
How does it feel to have an admirer?

176
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,440
What?

177
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:44,879
I saw

178
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,799
someone carrying these clothes

179
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:48,519
into the office.

180
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:49,240
So

181
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,759
are you going to admit it

182
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,000
or let me expose you?

183
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,399
What nonsense are you talking about?

184
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,480
If I'm not mistaken,

185
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:00,879
he must be Mr. Li's

186
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,440
driver,

187
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,360
Ji Ying Song.

188
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:06,399
Bingo!

189
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,759
Is there no one else you can think of?

190
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:09,600
Driver?

191
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,960
What driver?

192
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:12,919
This little lady

193
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,399
has an admirer.

194
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:17,000
We can see

195
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,360
Miss Su Xie Yi

196
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,080
usually keeps a poker face.

197
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,320
But

198
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:23,639
she's passionate deep down.

199
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,799
You're chattering instead of

200
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:28,960
getting changed during work time.

201
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,600
Do you want to get fired?

202
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,919
We'll have a meeting

203
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
in the meeting room in five minutes.

204
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,480
- Yes.
- Yes.

205
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,440
I've read the bidding plan

206
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,960
of the Fujiade Auction.

207
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,600
Yunfeng Hotel

208
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,799
is Ocean's new signature hotel.

209
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,039
Its advantages

210
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,399
are not reflected

211
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,360
in the plan at all.

212
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,039
Redo it.

213
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:12,039
I'll give you one day.

214
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,080
Other than that,

215
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,759
the sales of the minibar

216
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,360
have been decreasing.

217
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,519
Why?

218
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,120
Su Xie Yi,

219
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:26,159
what do you think?

220
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:29,960
I've looked into it.

221
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,480
There was no decrease

222
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,960
in the sales of the minibar.

223
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,320
But...

224
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:37,360
the guest's single consumption

225
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,440
is not high.

226
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,000
It only meets the minimum cost.

227
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,919
This is exactly

228
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:43,000
what I want you to know.

229
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,960
One expensive product

230
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:47,120
can increase the overall performance.

231
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,120
I don't care

232
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,080
what methods you're going to use.

233
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,399
I want you to sell the bar's

234
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:53,720
expensive champagne and red wine!

235
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:54,840
Also,

236
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,440
the minibar snack sales

237
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,879
are terrible.

238
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,039
The types of snacks

239
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,200
are too outdated now.

240
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,279
Can't you

241
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,200
survey the market

242
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,399
to find new products?

243
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:05,240
It must be salty,

244
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,639
so the alcohol can sell.

245
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,080
Stop trying to pass off

246
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,240
with dessert and wafers.

247
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:12,080
Find something more interesting,

248
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,840
understand?

249
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,879
Yes.

250
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:18,919
Su Xie Yi.

251
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,159
I'll leave the market research

252
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:22,480
to you.

253
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:24,080
Okay.

254
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:43,550
(Control Room, No Admittance.
No Smoking)

255
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:44,159
Uncle Bai.

256
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:45,919
You're here.

257
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:46,879
Sit.

258
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,559
This watch

259
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,519
has been with Mr. Li Senior for decades.

260
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,720
It's as old

261
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,399
as me.

262
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:08,559
I won't be useful anymore.

263
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,039
People are nostalgic.

264
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,279
I disagree with that.

265
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:17,519
Only those who cherish relationships

266
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:18,720
are like that.

267
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:28,519
Uncle Bai,

268
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,360
were you the one

269
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:33,039
who set up the deal

270
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,039
between my dad and Zhiwei?

271
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,840
It was decades ago.

272
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:39,320
At that time,

273
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,200
we were still a small company.

274
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,960
So what do you want to know?

275
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,240
Well, here is the thing.

276
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,399
Do you recall

277
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:57,759
any of Zhiwei's top management

278
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:58,879
or anyone

279
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:00,240
related to Zhiwei

280
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:02,120
with the last name Su?

281
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:06,799
I can't recall any for a moment there.

282
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:09,960
How about anyone

283
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,399
related to Shen Zhi Hong?

284
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,840
Shen Zhi Hong's wife.

285
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,840
His wife's last name is Su.

286
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,960
But

287
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,720
she passed away from illness

288
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,519
more than ten years ago.

289
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,320
(They have)

290
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,960
(a daughter.)

291
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,440
(But they took her)

292
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,399
(to live abroad a long time ago.)

293
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,159
(Is his daughter's name Su Xie Yi?)

294
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,240
(I think so.)

295
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,440
(Su Xie Yi,)

296
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,639
(you came to Ocean)

297
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,039
(to investigate)

298
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,320
(your dad's cause of death.)

299
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:23,399
It's lunchtime.

300
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:26,679
Someone owes me a meal.

301
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,919
When?

302
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,879
It was on the day

303
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,600
of Ms. Shi's welcoming party.

304
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,559
You were gone

305
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,879
and came back.

306
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,080
You even asked me to keep it a secret.

307
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:37,879
Have you forgotten?

308
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:40,039
Ah, I remember now.

309
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:42,240
Okay, I'll treat you today.

310
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:43,440
Let's go.

311
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,100
(Ocean Hotel Corporation)

312
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,910
(Clear your plate starts from me)
I said I'm treating you a meal.

313
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,279
Why are we eating at the cafeteria?

314
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,240
I'm someone

315
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,360
with principle.

316
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:54,279
A driver is pursuing you.

317
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,600
I'm not going to empty your pocket.

318
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:56,440
If an executive

319
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,279
likes you someday,

320
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,159
it won't be too late
to treat me to a big meal, then.

321
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,399
You got it all wrong.

322
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,119
See that?

323
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:14,160
Fine,

324
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,440
I get it.

325
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,240
If I were you,

326
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,680
I'd not be willing to admit it too.

327
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:19,920
Just eat.

328
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:25,240
By the way,

329
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:26,279
I've watched

330
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,680
Yunfeng Hotel's promotional video today.

331
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,759
It was done very well.

332
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,039
Of course.

333
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,480
We spent a lot on it.

334
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,559
It's going to be

335
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,400
Ocean Hotel Corporation's new image.

336
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,160
It's such a great project.

337
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:38,160
The person in charge

338
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,519
must be capable.

339
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,240
Do you mean Chen Heng Sheng?

340
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,839
Do you mean Chen Heng Sheng?

341
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,599
He is a legend.

342
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:48,240
When it comes to luck,

343
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,799
no one can beat him.

344
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,880
How come?

345
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,039
You might not believe it if I tell you.

346
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,799
He was only

347
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,440
Mr. Li's assistant two years ago.

348
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:58,920
For these two years,

349
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,920
he suddenly

350
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:02,000
became Yunfeng Hotel's general manager.

351
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,720
If it was in ancient times,

352
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,200
he had been promoted
three ranks at one go.

353
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,960
I see.

354
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:11,440
Yes.

355
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:13,480
I'm still sorting out Hengye Bank's

356
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,240
cocktail party list for the day
after tomorrow.

357
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:17,599
He is also invited.

358
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,799
I suddenly remembered

359
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,599
I need to send an urgent email.

360
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:25,799
I'll get back to work first.

361
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:26,880
Okay.

362
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,759
I'll treat you to a big meal
some other day.

363
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,920
Bye-bye.

364
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:41,960
You're pretty obsessed.

365
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:54,079
Let me clean it for you.

366
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,759
Stop!

367
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,799
I'll do it myself.

368
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,839
I'm here

369
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:04,680
to tell you one thing.

370
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,440
You can't solve

371
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,519
some gaps

372
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,359
with haute couture.

373
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,220
(Invitation to Year-End Reward Meeting)

374
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,620
(Ocean Hotel Corporation)

375
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,350
(Chen Heng Sheng,
Yunfeng Hotel person in charge)

376
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,799
Do the clothes fit you?

377
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,559
Yes.

378
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:23,279
What's wrong with him?

379
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,559
Did he come here

380
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,839
just to ask that one question?

381
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:27,400
What does that mean?

382
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:31,039
I even answered him.

383
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,319
There's something wrong with me too.

384
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:38,480
Why do you want to see me?

385
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,200
Can't I have a chat with you?

386
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,799
I mean...

387
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:45,400
you have

388
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,119
never come to work before.

389
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:48,519
Not only are you coming now,

390
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:50,079
you even come early.

391
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,319
Why is that, Mr. Li?

392
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,319
I thought you always wanted me

393
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,599
to come to work.

394
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,400
So you'll be attending

395
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,160
the cocktail party
the day after tomorrow, right?

396
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:02,519
You know

397
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,160
I'm never interested
in parties like these.

398
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,519
What are you doing?

399
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,880
It's work.

400
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:13,839
You won't forget it this way.

401
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:16,920
Fine.

402
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,359
After you come back,

403
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:20,400
we haven't had a proper catch-up.

404
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,559
Let's meet at the usual place tonight.

405
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:23,880
Okay.

406
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:24,920
My treat.

407
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,559
I happen to

408
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:34,839
have something to tell you.

409
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,960
What is it?

410
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:39,200
I'll tell you tonight.

411
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:42,839
See you tonight.

412
00:21:57,799 --> 00:21:58,519
When do you think

413
00:21:59,039 --> 00:21:59,920
we can attend

414
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,599
such a high-end cocktail party?

415
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,599
If it's like you said,

416
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:05,519
it's good to have the right guy.

417
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,079
Thanks.

418
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:10,359
Just perform well.

419
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:12,000
If Ms. Shi is satisfied,

420
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:14,400
she might take us along.

421
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,279
Ms. Shi?

422
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:17,000
Yes.

423
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:18,079
Her family

424
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:19,319
owns Hengye Bank.

425
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:20,519
It's also our company's

426
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,599
important partner.

427
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:22,240
When they were

428
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,359
organizing events,

429
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:25,000
some of us were asked to help out.

430
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,240
But speaking of which,

431
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,960
Ms. Shi asked you

432
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:33,160
to do market research on snacks.

433
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:34,960
I find it

434
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:36,599
a waste of your talent.

435
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,680
Not at all.

436
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,119
Details determine one's
success or failure.

437
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:41,319
I think Ms. Shi

438
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:42,480
is right.

439
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,920
So I must

440
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,000
do my job seriously.

441
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,240
Where are you going?

442
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,960
Going back to work.

443
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,039
You really know what you're doing.

444
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:53,640
If this goes on,

445
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:56,000
Ms. Shi will take you
to the cocktail party sooner or later.

446
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,119
Listen.

447
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:58,519
Anyone you can attract

448
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,559
at the cocktail party

449
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,079
is better than that driver.

450
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:11,720
Oh, right.

451
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,440
The employee handbook states

452
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,319
that new employees
have a free night's stay

453
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:16,359
at the hotel.

454
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,039
Is it true?

455
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:18,079
Of course.

456
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,680
You can let me have it
if you don't use it.

457
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,559
Or are you...

458
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:22,559
Are you

459
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:23,480
going to spend the night
with that driver?

460
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,519
Stop it right there.

461
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:26,359
My house is far from here.

462
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:27,640
I need to work overtime,

463
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,440
so I won't be going home.

464
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,960
Everything is for efficiency.

465
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:41,420
(Deputy General Manager)

466
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,480
Mr. Li,

467
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:07,400
other than having lunch

468
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:08,640
with Gong Ming Yue,

469
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,559
Miss Su had been busy working.

470
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:10,200
She made

471
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:11,480
no contact with Huo Jian.

472
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:12,960
You can stop watching her.

473
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,559
I already know her identity.

474
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,400
Uncle Bai sent a message and said

475
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,680
she booked a room at the hotel.

476
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:20,839
She booked a room?

477
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:23,720
What room?

478
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:26,680
A double room.

479
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,680
Uncle Bai also said

480
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,759
he saw some man get in.

481
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:31,839
Who?

482
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:33,200
Not only one.

483
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:35,759
Countless men are going in
and out of the room.

484
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,400
Room number?

485
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,839
0308.

486
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,359
Coming!

487
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:45,559
Mr. Li?

488
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:46,480
You...

489
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,000
Hello,

490
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,480
did you call for FlashEx?

491
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,079
Yes.

492
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,279
Please show me your Flash code.

493
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:50,920
Thanks.

494
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:53,839
Here you go.

495
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,720
Thank you.

496
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,279
Why are you here?

497
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,759
What are you doing here?

498
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,200
I'm working.

499
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:11,160
All by yourself?

500
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:13,240
Two.

501
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,640
You're alone.

502
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:16,240
Why didn't you go home

503
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:17,559
and book a hotel room here?

504
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,599
Instead of going home after work,

505
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:20,359
why do you care
if I booked a hotel room?

506
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:22,400
You're an employee
of the General Manager's Office.

507
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:24,240
You should take care of your reputation.

508
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,480
Can't an employee

509
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,559
stay

510
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:27,720
at their company's hotel?

511
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,119
That's not what I meant.

512
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:39,480
Are those men here

513
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:41,039
to deliver all these?

514
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:42,400
What else?

515
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,599
Did you think

516
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:49,079
I booked a hotel room

517
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:50,599
to sleep with someone?

518
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:51,960
Wait.

519
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:53,960
How did you know I'm here?

520
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,599
- I...
- Are you...

521
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,960
Are you going to say you happened
to pass by,

522
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:00,839
or are you testing me

523
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:01,799
and investigating me again?

524
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:06,480
I...

525
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:09,119
(But)

526
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:10,759
she died from illness

527
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,559
more than ten years ago.

528
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,400
She had a daughter

529
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,519
with Shen Zhi Hong.

530
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,799
(The child is really pitiful.)

531
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,440
(She lived with her mom abroad)

532
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,640
(since young.)

533
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,960
(She has lost her father)

534
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,799
(and no one to lean on now.)

535
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:37,839
Mr. Li,

536
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,799
are you okay?

537
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:50,079
I'm fine.

538
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:57,279
Let's go.

539
00:26:58,359 --> 00:26:59,839
I'll book another room for you.

540
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,759
As expected from you.

541
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,200
You can get a room

542
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,880
just like that.

543
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,119
Did you only have snacks
for dinner tonight?

544
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:19,039
Yes.

545
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,640
That's a task

546
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,960
Ms. Shi assigned to me.

547
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:22,359
Do you want to help me?

548
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,000
I don't know anything about snacks.

549
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,720
I should order some food for you.

550
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,039
You don't know snacks,

551
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,839
but you know Ms. Shi.

552
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:36,279
Everyone here knows

553
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,319
about your relationship.

554
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,599
You're old friends

555
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:41,519
and a match made in heaven
in everyone's eyes.

556
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,240
You're new here,

557
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,440
so you might not know this.

558
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,039
Nothing is going on between
Chu Chu and me.

559
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:48,039
Mr. Li,

560
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:49,240
you don't have to

561
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:51,160
explain this matter to me.

562
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,720
Have some.

563
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:01,000
(It's the invitation
to Hengye Bank's cocktail party.)

564
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,039
(I don't have to spare any effort
to look for it at all.)

565
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,480
Miss Su,

566
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:07,960
how long have you lived in Germany?

567
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:10,200
I have lived there since I was young.

568
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:11,839
I lived with my mom.

569
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,720
But...

570
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,279
I graduated

571
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,559
alone there afterward.

572
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:21,200
(I must find ways)

573
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,880
(to get a hold of his invitation.)

574
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,519
You must have felt lonely

575
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,240
being in a foreign country alone.

576
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:29,599
Lonely?

577
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,640
Loneliness comes

578
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,960
after luxury in life.

579
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,160
If a person

580
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:36,799
works seven days a week

581
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,160
and is too busy to make a living,

582
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,519
he won't have the time to feel lonely.

583
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:41,720
So

584
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,759
loneliness is a rich person's disease.

585
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:46,720
That's enough.

586
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:48,880
Stop eating these.

587
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:50,319
It may be for work.

588
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,079
But it's not good for your health

589
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,640
to eat like this.

590
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,519
(This guy)

591
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,200
(doesn't have any good intentions)

592
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,279
(every time he pretends
to care about me.)

593
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,160
(Just look at him.)

594
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,240
(After you passed out from drinking,)

595
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:04,119
(I'm going to take the invitation.)

596
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,119
Mr. Li,

597
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,319
if you really

598
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:09,640
sympathize with your employees,

599
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:10,920
why don't you

600
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,079
accompany me to relax for a bit?

601
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:13,759
How about we have some alcohol?

602
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,359
My work has been giving me

603
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:16,640
a lot of pressure lately.

604
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,720
What do you think?

605
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,319
Sure.

606
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,440
All right.

607
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:29,920
Mr. Li,

608
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,079
let's drink until we drop.

609
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,160
Here, cheers!

610
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:44,759
Mr. Li,

611
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,240
I get drunk easily.

612
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,359
Besides,

613
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:48,279
it's dangerous

614
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:49,440
for a woman

615
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:51,200
to get drunk outside.

616
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,160
Don't worry.

617
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:58,440
I won't let you drink a lot

618
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:00,640
or let you be in danger.

619
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:28,359
Mr. Li,

620
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,200
are you okay?

621
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:36,319
Miss Su,

622
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:37,400
do you have anything you like

623
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,839
or perhaps

624
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:42,000
any wishes?

625
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:43,480
You can tell me.

626
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:45,720
Maybe I can help you fulfill it.

627
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:49,720
(Seriously? He's already drunk?)

628
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,920
(Can you give me your invitation card?)

629
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:01,319
You want this?

630
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,440
I can give it to you if you want it.

631
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,400
I don't want it.

632
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,000
What am I going to do with this?

633
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,759
I can't eat it.

634
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:15,759
You're right.

635
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,759
Tell me after you've thought about it.

636
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:21,160
I'm sorry.

637
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:22,599
I have plans.

638
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,880
So I'll get going first.

639
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,119
Mr. Li,

640
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,680
drink one more glass.

641
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:32,640
It's a waste of this liquor.

642
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:35,039
You can drink

643
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:36,279
anything from the bar.

644
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,559
Just put it on my tab.

645
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,440
I'll pay for it.

646
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:40,720
Also,

647
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,440
when you work overtime in the future,

648
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,720
let me know.

649
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,319
I'll keep

650
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,480
this room vacant for you.

651
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,920
You can stay anytime you want.

652
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,559
Mr. Li, goodbye.

653
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,400
What's wrong with him?

654
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:05,839
How come the gentler he is,

655
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:07,799
the more afraid I am?

656
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,279
Ms. Shi,

657
00:32:11,774 --> 00:32:12,415
I've already completed

658
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,310
(GM's Office Regular Meeting)
the survey

659
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:14,759
on snacks in the market

660
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,200
as you've asked.

661
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,680
That's fast.

662
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,720
I don't dare to slack off.

663
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,119
If I can complete it a day earlier,

664
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:21,920
the sales volume

665
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,160
can increase a day earlier.

666
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,000
These snacks are my recommendations.

667
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:29,200
I also have

668
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,799
the online reviews and a report

669
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,960
on my personal experience

670
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,799
during the taste test.

671
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:41,160
Well done.

672
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:42,720
You're really efficient.

673
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:44,799
I happen

674
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:46,799
to have a decision to inform you.

675
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:49,359
From tomorrow on,

676
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,240
you don't have to come to work anymore.

677
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,440
You're fired.

678
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:03,279
Why?

679
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:05,880
Sorry about that.

680
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,440
Your compensation

681
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,359
will be paid accordingly
to the employee agreement.

682
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,480
You can work at another company.

683
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,160
I'll write a recommendation letter
for you.

684
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:14,200
Don't worry.

685
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:16,200
It won't be worse than Ocean.

686
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,000
May I know the reason?

687
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,440
No reason.

688
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:23,319
It's my personal decision.

689
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:24,640
All right.

690
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:25,559
The meeting is over.

691
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:44,079
It's because of Mr. Li, right?

692
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:47,920
You like Mr. Li.

693
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,640
I don't think it concerns you.

694
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:56,000
You can leave now.

695
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:56,759
I have a meeting

696
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:57,839
with Mr. Huo later.

697
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,119
If this is the reason,

698
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,279
it does concern me.

699
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:05,279
Miss Su,

700
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,000
let me repeat this.

701
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,320
You're fired.

702
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:09,679
Please get out.

703
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,599
Who are you firing?

704
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,039
Mr. Huo.

705
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:15,960
Mr. Huo.

706
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,639
Chu Chu,

707
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,480
this isn't your way of doing things.

708
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:23,760
Whose idea was it?

709
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,239
The General Manager's Office
is fully staffed now.

710
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:31,159
It's the procedure of terminating those
who performed poorly, that's all.

711
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:32,679
Okay.

712
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,519
But

713
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:35,960
I do admire

714
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,400
Miss Su's capabilities.

715
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:38,679
How about this?

716
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:40,360
On my side,

717
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:41,480
Yi Fei happens

718
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,719
to need an assistant.

719
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,119
Transfer her to my office first,

720
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,480
okay?

721
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,920
Since you asked,

722
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,239
of course, it's okay.

723
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:53,159
By the way,

724
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,280
I've received the invitation

725
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,239
to Hengye Bank's cocktail party.

726
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,719
Thank your dad for me.

727
00:34:58,159 --> 00:34:59,320
I'll be there tomorrow.

728
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:13,639
What's going on?

729
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,440
I want to know too.

730
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:26,800
(Shi Chu Chu)
(I failed.)

731
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:29,519
(Huo Jian kept Su Xie Yi.)

732
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:36,360
You're finally here.

733
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:37,280
Here.

734
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,519
Didn't you say you wanted
to tell me something?

735
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:41,760
Do you know Su Xie Yi,

736
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:43,119
your subordinate?

737
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:46,760
Fire her.

738
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,840
Are you kidding? Why?

739
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,800
I'm curious too.

740
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:53,679
What's your relationship

741
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,280
with her?

742
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:58,239
No relationship at all.

743
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,440
In any case,

744
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:01,639
I don't want to see her

745
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,239
at Ocean anymore.

746
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,360
I still need a reason, right?

747
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:09,320
What about poor performance?

748
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:12,000
She's the most outstanding

749
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:13,880
among the newcomers.

750
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:15,119
I can't take

751
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,599
this reason.

752
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,039
Just consider

753
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:23,719
doing me a favor, then.

754
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,599
I have my own principle.

755
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,000
I can't fire

756
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:28,599
an innocent employee

757
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:29,960
for no reason at all.

758
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:34,239
She has already

759
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:35,599
disrupted my work arrangement.

760
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,840
I can only tell you this.

761
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,480
If she continues working at Ocean,

762
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,480
I won't come to work anymore.

763
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:44,719
You're making it sound so serious.

764
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:46,880
Liang

765
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,679
must have his reason for doing this.

766
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,679
Besides,

767
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,079
no one can change

768
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:52,800
the decision he has made.

769
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,320
I'll leave it to you.

770
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:10,199
It'll be the first

771
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,360
and the last.

772
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:24,599
What's wrong, Mr. Li?

773
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,599
Huo Jian transferred Su Xie Yi
to his office.

774
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,480
It seems we have to carry out
our plan earlier.

775
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:31,880
Will Miss Su

776
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,239
be in danger?

777
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:36,920
To be honest,

778
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:37,960
I don't know why

779
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,360
you made that decision.

780
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:41,960
Can't you see?

781
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:44,039
Firing Su Xie Yi

782
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:45,559
is Li Ze Liang's order.

783
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,280
Since you think Li Ze Liang

784
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,360
arranged Su Xie Yi to work
at the General Manager's Office

785
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:53,679
to go against you,

786
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,920
wouldn't it better for her to leave?

787
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,840
That's the weird part.

788
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,199
She was transferred there

789
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,079
and here.

790
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:07,679
Now, he wants to fire her.

791
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:09,719
It's indeed weird.

792
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,400
Given the fact that Mr. Lin

793
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,159
and her sneaked into the Archive,

794
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,199
if your assumption is right,

795
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,360
that means Li Ze Liang

796
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,719
wants to use Zhiwei Corporation

797
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,119
through Su Xie Yi

798
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:21,119
to go against you.

799
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,840
But everything

800
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,960
is just our assumption.

801
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:24,920
See this?

802
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:27,320
No matter what kind of fish

803
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,480
you keep watching for a few days,

804
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:31,119
you'll naturally see

805
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,599
what's wrong with it.

806
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,880
Shi Chu Chu wanted to fire you,

807
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,880
but Huo Jian kept you?

808
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:43,159
Yes.

809
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:45,119
Isn't that interesting?

810
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:49,280
Have you thought of the reason?

811
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,760
As for the specifics,

812
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,159
I don't know.

813
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:54,280
But there's one thing I'm certain of.

814
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:56,480
Huo Jian is showing

815
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,440
his power.

816
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,679
Don't you find

817
00:38:58,679 --> 00:38:59,480
yourself

818
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:00,920
falling

819
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,039
into a game?

820
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,480
The outcome is more important to me.

821
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:07,920
To have Huo Jian think highly of me

822
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,320
might give me more advantage

823
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,360
for my investigation.

824
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,679
Xie Yi,

825
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,440
it doesn't matter if it's Li Ze Liang

826
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,000
or anyone from Ocean.

827
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,159
They could do that to Zhiwei.

828
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,159
If they find out

829
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:19,039
your identity,

830
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:20,119
can't you imagine

831
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:21,400
the consequences?

832
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:29,840
Ming Hao,

833
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,320
I came here

834
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:35,239
to ask a favor from you.

835
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,440
I want to attend

836
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,039
Hengye Bank's cocktail party.

837
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:40,559
Your law firm

838
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:42,000
is also their partner.

839
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:43,559
I'm sure they invited you

840
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,199
to their thank-you reception, right?

841
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:47,280
I know

842
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,639
you've always been very
opposed to my plan.

843
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,519
So I wouldn't have come to you

844
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,119
if I had no choice.

845
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,519
But this is important to me.

846
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,159
I need to find someone.

847
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:02,199
Who's that?

848
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,360
Chen Heng Sheng.

849
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,480
He's also on the invitation list

850
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,639
of Hengye Bank this time.

851
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,760
Two years ago,

852
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:11,920
he was the manager
of the Food and Beverage Department.

853
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:13,920
He was the one who signed the contract.

854
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:15,960
He must know something.

855
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:16,880
Xie Yi,

856
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:20,239
you can't back out

857
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,719
once you start on some things.

858
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,519
But you still have a chance
to back out now.

859
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,760
I know that.

860
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,320
But I don't want to stop now.

861
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,519
Perhaps you can try

862
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,880
to let go of your hatred

863
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:37,519
and relax a bit.

864
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,400
You're still young

865
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:41,079
and there are many paths you can take.

866
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,000
But the opportunity
is right in front of me.

867
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,360
I'm not willing

868
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,599
to give it up.

869
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:46,960
Ming Hao,

870
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,880
please help me with this once.

871
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:51,480
I promise

872
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:53,480
I'll stop after I'm done investigating

873
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,800
Chen Heng Sheng.

874
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,960
You'll need to promise me

875
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:00,320
not to do anything reckless tomorrow.

876
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:01,880
Okay,

877
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:03,320
I promise.

878
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:04,679
Thank you, Ming Hao.

879
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,960
Since you're sure

880
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,199
of Miss Su's identity,

881
00:41:58,519 --> 00:41:59,400
don't you think

882
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,880
it's better to reveal it to her?

883
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:04,079
You don't know her.

884
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,000
If I tell her the truth,

885
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,079
she'll go

886
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,559
straight to Huo Jian.

887
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:12,639
Are you worried about her safety?

888
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,440
I'm worried

889
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,079
it'll alert Huo Jian

890
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,719
and ruin my plan.

891
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,199
The day

892
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,199
my dad passed away two years ago,

893
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,480
the security cameras at the hospital
happened to be out of order.

894
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,000
But my dad clearly

895
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,760
told me over the phone

896
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,559
that he would only give

897
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:39,880
one percent of the shares to Huo Jian.

898
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,840
But when I came back,

899
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:44,440
there was

900
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,079
ten percent of the shares
in the agreement.

901
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,920
There are too many

902
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,679
questionable things in here.

903
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,760
Even if he's the biggest suspect,

904
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,199
but we have

905
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:57,519
no direct evidence, after all.

906
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:00,760
So

907
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,960
I don't want to alert Huo Jian just yet.

908
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,559
Mr. Li,

909
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:09,599
what do we do now?

910
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:11,639
Huo Jian keeps Miss Su by his side

911
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:13,079
must be because he wants to
look into her.

912
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:14,400
Huo Jian

913
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,480
is suspecting Su Xie Yi now

914
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,280
because she's

915
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,559
close to me.

916
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:21,199
So

917
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,199
he won't do anything reckless to her.

918
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:25,880
It's just

919
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,880
that Su Xie Yi still doesn't know

920
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,719
how terrible the enemy

921
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,920
she has to face is.
