2
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:24,900
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

3
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:33,450
♫  Still haunts me now and then in quiet nights  ♫

4
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:41,330
♫  And turn to face all the long lost times  ♫

5
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,370
♫  Brace the pain  ♫

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:51,210
♫  Let memories wake up from oceans deep  ♫

7
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,250
♫  No place to hide  ♫

8
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,450
♫  No way to run  ♫

9
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,820
♫  New dawn counts down  ♫

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,030
♫  I fight  ♫

11
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,010
♫  I cry  ♫

12
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,700
♫  I give up  ♫

13
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:15,710
♫  Memories forgotten, forsaken surround  ♫

14
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:24,030
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

15
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:32,470
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

16
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:40,850
♫  Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

17
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:49,550
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

18
00:01:49,550 --> 00:02:00,150

19
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,950

20
00:02:03,779 --> 00:02:06,490
Each person votes once.

21
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,519
No one can vote twice. Go!

22
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:11,960
This is a no-brainer.

23
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,999
Any projects that Director Shi works on never fail.

24
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:19,319
Director Shi is as good be it in terms of family background and appearance.

25
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,020
I heard that Director Shi and Director Li had known each other since their school days.

26
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,639
That makes them childhood sweethearts.

27
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,319
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

28
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:30,619
Catch a tiger by the toe.

29
00:02:30,619 --> 00:02:34,480
Director Li is not only a man, but also a businessman.

30
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,740
Hengye Bank is Ocean's financial backer.

31
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,120
Does none of you believe in love?

32
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,439
Who do you bet on then?

33
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:44,119
I bet on...

34
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:46,819
Director Shi.

35
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,419
I heard that everyone voted for you.

36
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,859
Is it?

37
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:57,840
It looks like you girls don't have enough workload.

38
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,199
We were just killing time during lunch.

39
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:03,039
But I think this is what everyone wants.

40
00:03:04,779 --> 00:03:05,879
Okay. Got it.

41
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,779
Get back to work.

42
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,739
Hello.

43
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:33,940
I'm the guest who reserved table 28 tonight.

44
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:39,519
Could you help to take out the stored wine and decant it before the meal?

45
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,580
Thank you.

46
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,170

47
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:14,160
 These are the documents for two contracts. I need a copy of each.

48
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,500
- Also... 
 - Brother Minghao.

49
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,080
Xieyi.

50
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,399
What brings you here?

51
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,199
Have a seat.

52
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,020
You bought me milk tea the other day, but I left without saying goodbye.

53
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:34,040
Here's a token of apology.

54
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,160
Forget it.

55
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,439
If you don't want to go, don't.

56
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,220
But if the same thing happens again, two cups of milk tea won't cut it.

57
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,178
Brother Minghao, I would like to ask you something.

58
00:04:48,178 --> 00:04:52,060
How is the crime of murder defined in the law?

59
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,600
Why do you ask?

60
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,720
Didn't you say it yourself?

61
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,680
A’Yan suspected that foul play was involved in his father's death.

62
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,439
So he's been secretly investigating it.

63
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:04,380
Huo Jian happens to be the prime suspect.

64
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,580
The main condition is that this person has a clear behavior of depriving others of their lives.

65
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,199
The second thing is to have key evidence to prove this.

66
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,439
Does Li Zeliang have any new discoveries?

67
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,480
Not yet.

68
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:22,215
But I believe no one can out run the long arm of the law.

69
00:05:22,215 --> 00:05:26,059
All right. If you need my help, be sure to tell me.

70
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,000
Your sister is making a good recovery.

71
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,800
I'm thinking of taking her out tomorrow, and we can have a meal together.

72
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,079
Sure.

73
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:37,479
Come to my place then. My sister hasn't been there.

74
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:41,959
All right. Do what you have to tomorrow. I'll take care of this.

75
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,459
A moment, please.

76
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,080
Look, I've listed down the grocery list for tomorrow.

77
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,659
I've prepared your favorite, steamed fish head with chopped pepper and crab roe pot.

78
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:59,880

79
00:06:03,179 --> 00:06:06,560
Brother Minghao. Thank you.

80
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,349
You and my sister have been there by my side,

81
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:13,520
and it makes me feel like my family is still with me.

82
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,540
Companion works both ways.

83
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:22,439
I feel happy with you and Xieqing by my side.

84
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,740
 You said that I like Zeliang.

85
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,380
 You were right.

86
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,920
 So I want to tell you that from this moment onward,

87
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,659
 I'll officially be competing with you.

88
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,639
If there was someone better pursuing you when you and my sister

89
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:48,539
had just started seeing each other, would you waver?

90
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,400
Did you think I had no suitor all these years?

91
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,116
If I've decided on something, I wouldn't change my mind.

92
00:06:57,116 --> 00:07:00,570
Xieyi. Someday, you'll understand

93
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:04,450
that in this world, there's unforgettable true love.

94
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,060
I thought the same too.

95
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,839
See if there's anything else to add.

96
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:19,659
Oh, right. My sister likes sweet and sour pork.

97
00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:21,759
Add it to the list.

98
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:48,560
Why is it just you?

99
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:52,099
Where's your dad?

100
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,759
My dad can't make it today.

101
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,539
Did something came up?

102
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,659
I drove here. I'll pass on the wine.

103
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:13,439
Actually, my dad already told me to reschedule dinner.

104
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:16,580
But still, I want to bring you here

105
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:21,300
because I want to give myself a chance to fight for things.

106
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:23,779
What's the matter, Chuchu?

107
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,200
Why are you acting strange today?

108
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:43,299
Since I was a kid, I would always make the best possible preparation in whatever I do.

109
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:46,081
That's because I never fight a battle that I can't win.

110
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,980
I'm afraid of failure.

111
00:08:52,859 --> 00:08:55,320
But there's one thing

112
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,900
that I have no absolute confidence in

113
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:01,740
despite years of preparation

114
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,400
which is to confess to you.

115
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,820
All this time,

116
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:17,480
I've always been the one standing in the center of the stage, bathed in a glowing light.

117
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,540
Whatever it is,

118
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,180
as long as I fight for it, I can surely get my hands on it.

119
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:30,379
But it was only until I met you that I realized for the first time what it felt like

120
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:36,339
to stand in the audience and look up at the person who's standing in the light.

121
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,627
To have someone to look up to and miss dearly

122
00:09:41,627 --> 00:09:44,540
is such a happy and beautiful thing.

123
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,699
Back then,

124
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,299
I transferred to that high school because of you.

125
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:01,660
Because of you, I chose to study Hotel Management.

126
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:04,408
And because of you,

127
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:08,879
I joined the music club and sat in front of the drum set.

128
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,360
But in a twist of fate, you ended up joining the Mountaineering Club.

129
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:30,380
Actually, I've done so much more than these for you.

130
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,940
I thought there was no reason for me to tell you any of this.

131
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:40,459
As long as I stayed by your side, you would know how I feel.

132
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,999
But it was until I met Su Xieyi,

133
00:10:45,619 --> 00:10:47,639
I realized

134
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,940
I might be wrong.

135
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:55,760
I know you feel differently about her.

136
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,190
But still,

137
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,360
I just want to get an answer for my years of love.

138
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,579
Li Zeliang.

139
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,379
I like you.

140
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,219
Chestnut.

141
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,039
Chestnut.

142
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:40,280
If I compete with Director Shi, who do you think will win?

143
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,780
What?

144
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,000
She's out of my league?

145
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:52,520
That's very honest of you.

146
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,399
Actually, Chuchu isn't that bad.

147
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,140
She's also quite competitive.

148
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,240
Forget it.

149
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,279
It's better if she isn't.

150
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:08,540
Chestnut, let me ask you this.

151
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,659
Has he mentioned me to you in the past two years?

152
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:14,920
He calls you Chestnut.

153
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,520
Does he think of me every time he says your name?

154
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,879
It's so late now.

155
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:32,020
Why isn't he back yet?

156
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:38,119
Forget it.

157
00:12:38,119 --> 00:12:40,919
Things like this require one to have self-consciousness.

158
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:43,279
Let's see when he'll come back.

159
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,119
Right?

160
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:53,360
Now that's more like it.

161
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,619
Brother Ji, it's you.

162
00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:02,139
Miss Su, Is Mr. Li here?

163
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:04,399
He's having dinner with Director Shi.

164
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,799
What's matter?

165
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:08,819
No big deal. Get some rest.

166
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,039
What could it be?

167
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:16,820
He wouldn't tell me.

168
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,880
That's weird.

169
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:39,939
 I know. Although you have been deliberately keeping a distance from me,

170
00:13:39,939 --> 00:13:44,960
 I can still vaguely sense your feelings for me.

171
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:49,599
 How should I put it?

172
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:55,499
 I think love is the most mysterious thing in the world.

173
00:13:55,499 --> 00:13:59,059
 It doesn't allow us to make any presuppositions.

174
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:02,572
 It's like before I reach the top of the mountain,

175
00:14:02,572 --> 00:14:07,460
 I never believed in love at first sight or predestined love.

176
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,452
 But just when I reached the mountain top,

177
00:14:10,452 --> 00:14:12,869
 and when I met Su Xieyi,

178
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:17,359
 it suddenly hit me that all these cold words

179
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,579
 actually have their own true meaning.

180
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,199
 I know. You've always been very competitive,

181
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,200
 and you only set your sights on what's ahead of you.

182
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,640
 There aren't many people who can be ahead of you.

183
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,200
 Or I should say,

184
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:45,100
 I was the only one you could see.

185
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:53,118
 But it's precisely because of that, you have missed out on many other things.

186
00:14:53,118 --> 00:14:54,639
 But...

187
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,739
 I believe it's all because you haven't reached

188
00:15:00,739 --> 00:15:03,459
 the mountain top that belongs to you.

189
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:09,359
 One day, when you finally reach the top of your mountain,

190
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,798
 you might come to realize

191
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:16,459
 that the person you are looking for has already been there waiting for you.

192
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,230
♫  Circle of love  ♫

193
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,850
♫  I don't know how to win your heart  ♫

194
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,899
♫  I don't know how to be the one for you  ♫

195
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:37,620
 So that means that I have finally gotten an accurate answer.

196
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:43,679
 If I had confessed to you earlier,

197
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,720
 would the answer turn out differently?

198
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,259
♫  Before my heart comes apart  ♫

199
00:15:50,259 --> 00:15:56,699
  As I said, there's no room for presupposition in love.

200
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,999
 I agree.

201
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:06,300
 So I don't intend to take back my confession.

202
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,220
 I'll continue to like you.

203
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:14,539
 After all, right up until the last moment, none of us can predict the outcome.

204
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,620
 Here.

205
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,239
 No matter what,

206
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,199
 at least, we're still friends and colleagues.

216
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,960
A'Liang, you're finally here.

217
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,699
At this hour, why isn't there anyone here?

218
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:23,400
For your sake, I closed early.

219
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,480
Oscar. What have you got up your sleeve?

220
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,939
Don't get so surprised or scream after I tell you about it.

221
00:17:29,939 --> 00:17:34,031
Actually, ever since Lin Tai told me about Spider,

222
00:17:34,032 --> 00:17:38,619
as your buddy, I wanted to do my part.

223
00:17:38,619 --> 00:17:41,299
So you've been secretly investigating it?

224
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,960
But most importantly, I've really found him.

225
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,379
Where is he?

226
00:17:47,379 --> 00:17:50,460
In this city, hiding from his creditors.

227
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,340
Here?

228
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:54,839
Are you sure it's him?

229
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:57,160
I've contacted him and verified it.

230
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,400
Also, it matches all his information.

231
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,620
This is the contact number he used to call me. Call him.

232
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,280
Hello?

233
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,480
Is this Liu A'Wei?

234
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,060
 Yes, are you looking for me?

235
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,460
Yes.

236
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,400
Where are you?

237
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,820
I only contacted you because of the reward.

238
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,419
How much can you give me?

239
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:23,079
How much do you want?

240
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:25,119
-  Fifty thousand.  
 - Okay.

241
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:27,319
I want cash. Give it to me in person.

242
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:28,959
 Sure.

243
00:18:30,219 --> 00:18:31,960
Hold on.

244
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,900
I lost some money in gambling these two years and went into hiding.

245
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,319
Are you here to collect debts?

246
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,319
Don't worry. Take it easy.

247
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:45,279
I just want to ask you a few questions.

248
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:46,640
Bring the cash, and you can ask me in person.

249
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,759
 Okay.

250
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,319
 All right. Stop to talk nonsense.

251
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:50,839
 I'll send you the location in a bit.

252
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,599
Bring the money here within an hour.

253
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:54,459
Remember. Come alone.

254
00:18:54,459 --> 00:18:58,100
If you dare to play tricks, don't think about getting in touch with me anymore.

255
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,860
Okay. I promise.

256
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,280
A'Liang, are you really planning to go in alone?

257
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,579
What's the matter? Are you worried that he's going to eat me?

258
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,279
I'm the one who needs his help.

259
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:33,580
Let's play by his rules.

260
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,080
Okay.

261
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,980
Hello.

262
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,319
I've arrived.

263
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,519
Are you alone?

264
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:50,259
 Of course. Just me.

265
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:51,799
Did you bring the money?

266
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:52,880
Yes.

267
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,559
 Go straight after entering the gate.

268
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:58,419
 There is a yellow cleaning truck.

269
00:19:58,419 --> 00:19:59,999
 Wait for me by that truck.

270
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,660
Be careful.

271
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,699
Is A'Liang going to be all right going in there alone?

272
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:14,470

273
00:22:13,179 --> 00:22:15,059
A'Liang, watch out!

274
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,840
I've heard from him.

275
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,580
It's been taken care of.

276
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:31,980
I'm afraid he'll be crippled for good now.

277
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,620
This time, he has to be bedridden for at least a year.

278
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,740
Why must he force my hand?

279
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,339
Tonight, you can have a good night's sleep.

280
00:22:43,219 --> 00:22:44,919
Off to bed.

281
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,559
 Firewood, has it been taken care of?

282
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:52,880
 Yes. I'm going to lie low for a bit in my hometown.

283
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,459
 Okay. Be careful.

284
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,039
Hi, Brother Ji.

285
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:07,340
 Mr. Li is injured.

286
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:10,279
What? Zeliang is hurt?

287
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,400
Shi Chuchu just called.

288
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,120
She said Li Zeliang had gone home to recuperate.

289
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,919
Gone home?

290
00:23:26,219 --> 00:23:27,619
Let's pay him a visit.

291
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,559
Where's A’Yan?

292
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,880
How is he? What's going on?

293
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,699
A'Liang ran into a local thug last night and got beaten.

294
00:23:39,699 --> 00:23:41,619
He's resting in his room now.

295
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:42,759
I'll check on him.

296
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:44,820
Miss Su, I know you're worried.

297
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:48,139
The doctor is inside now. Let's not go in there for now.

298
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:53,859
Director Shi. Didn't A’Yan have dinner with you last night?

299
00:23:53,859 --> 00:23:56,120
Why would things turn out this way?

300
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,759
I have no idea.

301
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:00,419
He was fine when we left.

302
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,160
Chairman Huo.

303
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,100
I came to pay Zeliang a visit.

304
00:24:18,379 --> 00:24:19,820
You're all here.

305
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,419
I came as soon as I heard.

306
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,720
Ji Yingsong.

307
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,320
Zeliang is injured. Why isn't he taken to the hospital?

308
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,540
Chairman Huo, Mr. Li suffered a vicious attack last night.

309
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,140
It's obvious that they came for Mr. Li.

310
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,859
The assailant hasn't been caught.

311
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:36,000
There's no telling if they'll come back again.

312
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,640
There are too many people in the hospital.

313
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,759
It's safer to find a private doctor that we're familiar with.

314
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:42,680
Who's that assailant? Have you identified him?

315
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,820
There was no surveillance camera, and Mr. Li has been unconscious.

316
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,820
No lead so far.

317
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,960
This is so careless of you!

318
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,859
How could you let Zeliang walk around on the street alone so late at night?

319
00:24:55,859 --> 00:24:59,639
He'd get into danger running into those local thugs.

320
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,139
Where's he now?

321
00:25:02,139 --> 00:25:03,979
In his room.

322
00:25:03,979 --> 00:25:06,700
Chairman Huo. Chairman Huo!

323
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,200
Why did you come in?

324
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,100
A'Yan.

325
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:16,200
Dr. Wu. You're here.

326
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,559
How is his condition?

327
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:20,920
Injury-wise, it's under control now.

328
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,000
But he's still in a coma.

329
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,020
We'll keep him under observation after he regains consciousness.

330
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,200
Well, I shall take my leave and come back tomorrow.

331
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,600
All right.

332
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,560
Also, keep in mind. If he wakes up, be sure to contact me.

333
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,220
Dr. Wu, I'll walk you out.

334
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,219
A’Yan. You're going to be fine.

335
00:25:51,219 --> 00:25:53,400
I'm sure you'll wake up.

336
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,440
Why is Zeliang injured in the face too?

337
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,660
He scraped it when he fell over.

338
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,159
Is it?

339
00:26:05,699 --> 00:26:09,680
If his face is disfigured, that's going to be a problem.

340
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,980
Let me take a look.

341
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,600
Chairman Huo.

342
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:32,739
Miss Su. If my nephew's face is disfigured for real,

343
00:26:32,739 --> 00:26:34,439
what are you going to do?

344
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:37,060
No matter what becomes of A'Yan,

345
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,860
I'll never leave him.

346
00:26:47,979 --> 00:26:52,319
With you guys here to take care of Zeliang, I feel at ease now.

347
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,960
I believe he'll recover soon.

348
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,738
There are still some works to attend to at the office.

349
00:26:59,738 --> 00:27:01,079
I'll get going now.

350
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:05,440
Whatever happens, feel free to contact me.

351
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,040
Chairman Huo.

352
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:29,060
Leaving just like that?

353
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,140
I won't be of any help here anyway.

354
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,820
Forgive me for being blunt.

355
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,659
Does this have anything to do with you?

356
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:43,000
You made a sudden announcement of you're stepping down during the meeting.

357
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,860
Shortly after, Zeliang got beaten.

358
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:48,860
I don't know what happened between you two.

359
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,699
But I have my suspicion of you.

360
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:57,339
I don't blame you. Things happened one after another.

361
00:27:57,339 --> 00:27:59,740
Indeed, it's pretty coincidental.

362
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,379
Look, Chuchu. You've misunderstood.

363
00:28:02,379 --> 00:28:06,119
I watched Zeliang grow up.

364
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,520
Right now,

365
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,419
he's also my only family.

366
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:13,359
I love him dearly.

367
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:17,959
Who do you think would do this to him?

368
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,100
We'll inevitably make enemies in the business world.

369
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:26,400
Zeliang even won the tender to the auction event from Zhengde Hotel.

370
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,679
Perhaps, they're holding a grudge.

371
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:34,380
I've spoken out of turn.

372
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,380
Forgive me for that.

373
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:43,519
Chuchu. I know you care deeply about Zeliang.

374
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:48,700
I promise. If I know who's behind this,

375
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,720
I'm not going to spare that person.

376
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,820
Me too.

377
00:29:18,613 --> 00:29:21,540
How was it? Is Li Zeliang really hurt?

378
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,119
I guess he is.

379
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:25,340
Judging from Su Xieyi and Shi Chuchu's expressions,

380
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,459
it doesn't seem like they were faking it.

381
00:29:27,459 --> 00:29:30,959
But continue to keep an eye on them.

382
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:32,500
Okay.

383
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,340
A'Yan.

384
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:51,779
There are still a lot of things that we haven't done together.

385
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,699
And we were going to take down Huo Jian together.

386
00:29:55,699 --> 00:29:59,019
You said you would protect me.

387
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:02,859
You can't go back on your words.

388
00:30:14,459 --> 00:30:16,299
Miss Su.

389
00:30:17,459 --> 00:30:21,319
There's something that I would like to discuss with you.

390
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:24,080
Zeliang is still in a coma now.

391
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,939
He can't continue to just stay at home.

392
00:30:26,939 --> 00:30:29,579
We should send him to the hospital as soon as possible.

393
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,200
You're right.

394
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,920
I'll contact Dr. Wu right away.

395
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,820
Mr. Li, Huo Jian has left.

396
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,400
But Yi Fei is still keeping watch outside.

397
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,480
What are you talking about?

398
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,680
Help me remove the gauze.

399
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,240
It's smothering me.

400
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,159
A'Yan.

401
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,280
What's going on?

402
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,519
 I want cash. Give it to me in person.

403
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,019
 Sure.

404
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,440
 Oh, right. I happen to be in the store right now.

405
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,200
 I happen to be in the store right now.

406
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,880
 Should I bring some stationery for your son too?

407
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,000
 That little brat is a disappointment. No need for that.

408
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,240
 Is it?

409
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,720
 All right. Stop talking nonsense.

410
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,359
 I'll send you the location in a bit.

411
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:33,240
 Bring the money here within an hour.

412
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,839
Yingsong.

413
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:38,139
I just contacted a person who claimed to be Liu A'Wei.

414
00:31:38,139 --> 00:31:39,599
He said he's in Shanghai.

415
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:40,680
 That's impossible.

416
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,279
 I was going to see you to update you on the new lead on Liu A'Wei.

417
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:45,540
 Tell me.

418
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,540
 There is a small vendor in Yun'an who knows Liu A'Wei.

419
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,640
 He often buys alcoholic beverages from him.

420
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,439
 According to him, Liu A'Wei has been in poor health since six months ago.

421
00:31:54,439 --> 00:31:57,139
 Impossible for him to be so full of energy and be in Shanghai?

422
00:31:57,139 --> 00:31:59,540
 I knew it.

423
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:03,480
 This guy doesn't even know that Liu A'Wei doesn't have a son.

424
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,000
 Something's fishy here.

425
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,920
 What's your plan?

426
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,100
 He initiated contact with me.

427
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:12,680
 I'm curious what he is really up to.

428
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,419
 Why don't you meet him?

429
00:32:14,419 --> 00:32:16,020
 He gave me an address.

430
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,559
 Come over now.

431
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:22,639
 Let's give him a surprise attack, and catch him off guard.

432
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:24,719
 Okay.

433
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,160
 A'Liang, watch out!

434
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:52,839
 A'Liang, it looks like you and Ji have planned this.

435
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:54,539
 Did we scare you?

436
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,079

437
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:11,739
 Mr. Li. Indeed, someone else is behind this.

438
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,300
 It's a trap.

439
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,400
 I'm sure this is Huo Jian's doing.

440
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,859
 It looks like my investigation of Spider has gotten under his skin.

441
00:33:19,859 --> 00:33:21,739
 What do we do with this guy?

442
00:33:21,739 --> 00:33:23,260
 Let's play along.

443
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,120
 Reply to his text message.

444
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,520
 Okay.

445
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,800
 Dude, password.

446
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,480
 Password.

447
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:42,919
 Thank you.

448
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:45,459
So you didn't get hurt?

449
00:33:45,459 --> 00:33:46,959
That's right.

450
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:48,820
All thanks to Dr. Wu.

451
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,079
Too bad that thug got away.

452
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:54,240
I've gone through the phone of that thug who tried to assault you,

453
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,599
and found other evidence between his conversation with Huo Jian.

454
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:59,340
So this proves that our speculation was right.

455
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,939
Very well.

456
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:02,680
We'll still proceed as planned.

457
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,200
Oscar.

458
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,680
- You're up. 
 - Okay.

459
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,705
Aren't you going to help me with the gauze?

460
00:34:12,705 --> 00:34:15,140
Brother Ji is here, isn't it?

461
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,923
Brother Ji is a clumsy person.

462
00:34:16,923 --> 00:34:18,680
You have delicate hands.

463
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:23,222
Besides, I'm playing A'Liang now.

464
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,879
I'm going to get changed.

465
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,480
What's the matter?

466
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,359
Still mad?

467
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:57,479
You liar. Why didn't you tell me earlier?

468
00:34:57,479 --> 00:34:59,840
You got me so worried.

469
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,400
I can't help it.

470
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,800
This is the only way to fool Huo Jian.

471
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:11,940
Look. I'm fine, aren't I?

472
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:15,119
You were just lying in there and didn't make a sound.

473
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,639
Did you intend to watch me make a fool of myself?

474
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:22,620
My dear Xieyi.

475
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:28,219
Each and every single word that you said is deeply etched in my heart.

476
00:35:28,219 --> 00:35:30,280
I couldn't help but feel touched.

477
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,460
How would I possibly make fun of you?

478
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:38,759
- It's done. 
 - Thank you.

479
00:35:40,499 --> 00:35:44,880
Coming up next is to wrap my good-looking face.

480
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,580
Stop the nonsense.

481
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,099
Sit tight.

482
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,200
Oh, right, Brother Ji.

483
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,380
Is Zeliang planning to do something in secret?

484
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,840
Mr. Li has something important to do.

485
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,519
So he's having Oscar disguised as him to throw Huo Jian off the trail.

486
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:09,760
What Mr. Li needs now is time.

487
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,260
So, the later Huo Jian finds out, the better.

488
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,563
Also, if Huo Jian learns that Mr. Li is fine,

489
00:36:15,564 --> 00:36:18,784
who knows if he'll continue to orchestrate something else?

490
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,980
Are you going as well?

491
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,440
Huo Jian is always keeping tabs on me.

492
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,919
I can only stay here to make this whole thing more believable.

493
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:29,960
Also, Director Shi, do come by and pay him a visit often.

494
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,400
Huo Jian knows that you care about Mr. Li.

495
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,840
If you don't come,

496
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,500
it'll seem very suspicious.

497
00:36:37,879 --> 00:36:40,219
Okay. I know what to do.

498
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:47,119
From what you've said, this Firewood guy is sent by Huo Jian.

499
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,680
Director Shi. You can stop wrapping now.

500
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,380
Oscar has turned into an egg.

501
00:36:58,129 --> 00:37:02,020
Chuchu. Come and visit me often.

502
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,760
So you have found the whereabouts of Spider?

503
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,339
Yes.

504
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:08,960
So I have to set out at once before Huo Jian catches on.

505
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,119
- A'Yan. I'll come with you. 
 - Xieyi.

506
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,080
- Xieyi. 
 - Don't try to make excuses and leave me behind.

507
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,019
Have you forgotten our promise?

508
00:37:18,019 --> 00:37:20,139
No matter what happens, we'll face it together.

509
00:37:20,139 --> 00:37:23,719
What if I get into danger after you leave me here alone?

510
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,939
Okay. I promise you.

511
00:37:31,759 --> 00:37:35,100
Oh, right. How do we get out?

512
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:39,239
I heard from Brother Ji that Yi Fei has been keeping watch outside.

513
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:42,839
Let me ask you.

514
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:45,500
After Oscar and Chuchu paid me a visit,

515
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,380
they would have to leave, right?

516
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:52,179
Are you saying that we disguise as Oscar and Chuchu,

517
00:37:52,179 --> 00:37:54,219
and openly walk out of here?

518
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:58,480
Since Oscar can pretend to be me,

519
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,380
why can't I pretend to be Oscar then?

520
00:38:07,339 --> 00:38:08,839
Rock.

521
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,000
Food is almost ready.

522
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,199
Hello, Xieyi. Where are you now?

523
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,640
Hi, Brother Minghao.

524
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,980
Sorry. Zeliang and I will be away on an urgent business trip.

525
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,880
I won't be coming back to have dinner with you and Xieqing.

526
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,419
What's so urgent?

527
00:39:10,419 --> 00:39:13,019
It wasn't easy for me to take Xieqing out of the hospital.

528
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:16,259
Do you remember the things that I consulted you about?

529
00:39:16,259 --> 00:39:19,619
This time, we can find strong evidence to take Huo Jian down.

530
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:21,840
So I have to go.

531
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,659
Xieyi, it's dangerous for you to do this.

532
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:28,199
Don't worry. I'll protect myself.

533
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,079
Take a look at the map.

534
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,220
Hi, Lawyer Xie.

535
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,239
 I'm with Xieyi now.

536
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:49,280
No matter what happens, I'll surely keep her safe.

537
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,980
Li Zeliang.

538
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,319
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

539
00:39:53,319 --> 00:39:54,900
Yes.

540
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:59,055
If you really love her, you shouldn't let her get mixed up in this again.

541
00:39:59,055 --> 00:40:00,599
Lawyer Xie.

542
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:03,160
Xieyi is an adult.

543
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,819
She has her own free will.

544
00:40:05,819 --> 00:40:10,559
Neither you nor I have the right to make decisions for her.

545
00:40:11,139 --> 00:40:13,640
I know Xieyi's characters very well.

546
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,980
She is righteous and kind.

547
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,679
 She always repays other people's kindness with even more kindness.

548
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:21,940
Had she not known you injured your leg trying to save Uncle Shen,

549
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,480
 she would have been out of the picture by now.

550
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,500
She only came back because she felt guilty for her dad.

551
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,300
 Li Zeliang.

552
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:34,019
Did you really think she did all this for you?

553
00:40:36,979 --> 00:40:39,419
A'Yan, we should go now.

554
00:40:41,979 --> 00:40:46,880
Lawyer Xie. Whatever it is you have to say, we can talk in person when I return.

555
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,160
I'll surely bring Xieyi back safely.

556
00:41:00,619 --> 00:41:02,020
I've checked.

557
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:06,320
The vendor that revealed the information to Brother Ji is located about 400 km  (246 miles)  away.

558
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,179
If we drive fast, we'll be there this afternoon.

559
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:15,520
What's wrong? Is something troubling you?

560
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:22,320
Nothing. Xieyi. Why don't I drive?

561
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,940
It's okay. You can take over if I feel tired.

562
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,360
Okay.

563
00:41:32,139 --> 00:41:34,240
Come on. Let's get in the car.

564
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,159
Where are you going?

565
00:41:55,999 --> 00:41:58,639
Look, you're all dirty already.

566
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:00,899
Does it hurt?

567
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:06,400
Behave yourself. Be a good girl.

568
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,600
Be a good girl.

569
00:42:11,819 --> 00:42:12,780
Be a good girl.

570
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,700
She's not being a good girl,

571
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,820
and she wants to be set free.

572
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:19,000
But don't worry.

573
00:42:19,459 --> 00:42:23,900
I'll ensure that she'll stay by our side forever.
