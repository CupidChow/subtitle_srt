Wait for me.

I'll put down the luggage.

(Board Chairman)

22
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,000
Your seat

23
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,240
is so comfortable.

24
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:10,960
Do you like it?

25
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,680
You can have this office

26
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,630
if you like it.

27
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,910
(Chairman)

28
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:15,800
I'll take the office upstairs.

29
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,479
I don't think this is suitable.

30
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,599
Why not?

31
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,800
I'm the current chairman.

32
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,080
And you're my executive secretary.

33
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,439
It's perfectly reasonable

34
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,680
for you to have your own office.

35
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,080
People will think

36
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,439
that you're giving me special treatment.

37
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,319
I am giving you special treatment.

38
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,360
So what?

39
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:36,840
Do you think they can
do something about it?

40
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,439
I appreciate your intention.

41
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,479
I still like

42
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,639
my original position better.

43
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:45,560
If not,

44
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,360
you won't be able to see me
when you raise your head.

45
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,159
I can look downwards.

46
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:50,719
You...

47
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:53,719
Enough.

48
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:54,680
I'm here

49
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,039
to talk about business.

50
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:57,560
I came back

51
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,520
to join the Lantian Bay project.

52
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:00,599
Chu Chu is

53
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:02,520
in charge of the Lantian Bay project.

54
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,360
That's great.

55
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,479
I can learn more

56
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,520
from Ms. Shi.

57
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,360
Really?

58
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:10,319
Come in.

59
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:21,920
Miss Su, you're back.

60
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,040
Ms. Shi,

61
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,079
it's been a while.

62
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,480
I'll leave the room if you need

63
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,680
to speak with Mr. Li.

64
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:36,199
Have a seat.

65
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,240
What's the matter?

66
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:44,519
It's like this.

67
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,199
The Lantian Bay project

68
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,560
is progressing at full speed.

69
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,720
We need to purchase some
construction materials urgently.

70
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,360
Please take a look.

71
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:56,040
I'll leave that

72
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,000
to you.

73
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,000
I believe in you.

74
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,040
By the way,

75
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,759
the commercial dispute

76
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,040
that Huo Jian had left for the company,

77
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,839
is Mr. Xie handling it right now?

78
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:08,839
Of course.

79
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,519
He's our corporate lawyer.

80
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:12,439
It's like this.

81
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:13,759
For these cases,

82
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,040
I wish to deal with them myself.

83
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,720
You don't need to pass them to Mr. Xie.

84
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,759
What do you mean by this?

85
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,399
I think these cases

86
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,319
are pretty important.

87
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,720
That's precisely why

88
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,480
I need to handle them myself.

89
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,160
It's better this way.

90
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,000
By the way, Chu Chu,

91
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,920
Xie Yi wishes to join

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
the Lantian Bay project.

93
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,000
Please lead her

94
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:39,920
and help her out.

95
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,360
She does intend

96
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,000
to learn from you.

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,800
Since Miss Su wants to learn,

98
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,720
I will oblige.

99
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:51,959
But Chairman Li,

100
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:54,000
please don't blame me
for being too strict on her.

101
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,120
See you.

102
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,240
Come in.

103
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,800
Ms. Shi,

104
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,639
I've read the details

105
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,040
of the Lantian Bay project.

106
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,959
Just tell me

107
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,240
if you need me to do anything.

108
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,120
It's the end of the year now.

109
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,959
We haven't decided the kind of gift

110
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,920
we should give to our partners.

111
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,000
You can go and
pick several kinds of gifts.

112
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,639
But...

113
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,040
The gifts represent

114
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,199
Chairman Li's image
to his partners.

115
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,879
You're his girlfriend.

116
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:47,839
It's most suitable

117
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,040
for you to complete this task.

118
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,600
You know this as well.

119
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,199
I wish to contribute

120
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,319
to the Lantian Bay project.

121
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,879
Miss Su, since you're

122
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,360
truly interested

123
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,720
in the Lantian Bay project,

124
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,319
you should learn from me.

125
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:03,879
Take it one step at a time.

126
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,000
Is there anything else?

127
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,000
Ms. Shi,

128
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,199
I've always admired you

129
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,519
and respected you.

130
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,199
I believe that you're

131
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,120
a fair person.

132
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,000
Maybe it's my misconception,

133
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,560
but I think

134
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,000
you always had a grudge against me.

135
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,519
You can tell me
if there's anything on your mind.

136
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,319
You're the daughter
of Shen Zhi Hong, right?

137
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:36,839
That's right.

138
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,600
So you admit

139
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,040
that you hid your identity on purpose,

140
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,240
approached Ze Liang
and infiltrated Ocean Hotel

141
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,480
for Zhiwei Corporation

142
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,920
and your father's sake, right?

143
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,160
I admit it,

144
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,279
that was the case at the start.

145
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,480
But this is over.

146
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,279
Huo Jian has been arrested.

147
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,160
And now,

148
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,199
I'm staying in Ocean Hotel

149
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,480
for a simple reason.

150
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:58,160
It's because I love the hotel industry.

151
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,839
And I wish to help Yan.

152
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:02,680
Is that it?

153
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:03,959
That's it.

154
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,399
You can ask Yan if you don't believe me.

155
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,360
He knows about it as well.

156
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,800
I did ask Ze Liang about it before.

157
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,680
But love makes people blind.

158
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,639
So I wish to give you

159
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,399
some reminders.

160
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,199
I don't care

161
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,360
what you're thinking,

162
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,279
but if you dare to hurt Ze Liang

163
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,399
and Ocean Hotel,

164
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,399
I will never let you off.

165
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,000
Ms. Shi,

166
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,720
I know you detested

167
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:34,759
my relationship with Yan.

168
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,519
Indeed.

169
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:39,080
Hengye Bank,
which belongs to your father,

170
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,200
has always been an important financial
support for Ocean Hotel.

171
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:43,799
You're very capable as well.

172
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,360
As for me,

173
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,679
I know I lose to you

174
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,639
in many aspects.

175
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,639
But Yan and I

176
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:51,639
have too many similar life experiences.

177
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,639
That's why

178
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:54,320
we understand each other better.

179
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,519
That's why

180
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,000
we're deeply in love.

181
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,759
Very good.

182
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:02,679
Love

183
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,120
is more than just fancy words.

184
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,799
You better perform in work.

185
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,559
(Su Xie Yi,)

186
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,799
(Ocean Hotel is everything to Ze Liang.)

187
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,759
(I can't let you ruin it for him.)

188
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,080
(I will reveal your true colors,)

189
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,840
(no matter what I have to do.)

190
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,320
Xie Qing,

191
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,080
time to take your medicine.

192
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:43,879
Where am I?

193
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,639
I'm very scared.

194
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,600
I wish to go home.

195
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:49,840
Where do you want to go?

196
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,759
I wish to go home,

197
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,840
my own home.

198
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:57,879
Don't you like staying here

199
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:58,840
together with me?

200
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,480
From today onward,

201
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:13,639
this will be your new home.

202
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,039
Only by staying here

203
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,639
and staying by my side

204
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,320
will you be safe.

205
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,000
Xie Qing,

206
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,320
did you remember anything?

207
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:26,279
For example,

208
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:27,639
the bank account?

209
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I don't know.

210
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,559
I don't know!

211
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:32,480
I don't know!

212
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:33,720
I don't know!

213
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:34,399
It's fine.

214
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,840
It's fine.

215
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:36,600
You can stop thinking.

216
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,799
You should take your medicine first.

217
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,679
I don't want to.

218
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,559
Be a good girl.

219
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,519
You can have your mung bean cakes
after taking your medicine.

220
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,600
Come.

221
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,159
Take your medicine.

222
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:56,320
Xie Qing,

223
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,240
you shouldn't have spoken
without thinking.

224
00:10:58,679 --> 00:10:59,960
If you do remember anything,

225
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,240
you must tell me first,

226
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:03,759
okay?

227
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,080
Come.

228
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,670
(Xie Yi)

229
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:24,919
Xie Yi?

230
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,159
Hello, Ming Hao.

231
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,679
How's Xie Qing?

232
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,480
Xie Qing's emotions are still unstable.

233
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:30,720
I plan to find her

234
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,120
a better sanatorium.

235
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:33,759
Is it that serious?

236
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,559
I'll visit her after work then.

237
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,480
No need for that.

238
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,000
She suffered a huge shock yesterday.

239
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:38,919
The doctor said

240
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,679
she needed to rest and recuperate
for the time being.

241
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:41,879
No one should visit her.

242
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:42,960
How about this?

243
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,320
You can come and visit her
after some time.

244
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:45,919
I don't want her to
suffer another shock.

245
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:46,759
Alright.

246
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:47,840
You must contact me

247
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,879
if anything happens.

248
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,039
Don't worry.

249
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,159
Xie Yi,

250
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:58,600
are you done with your call?

251
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,080
Come and join us.

252
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,159
Coming.

253
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:10,279
Xie Yi,

254
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,519
what's on your mind?
You look distracted.

255
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,919
Nothing.

256
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,080
By the way,

257
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,440
how were you guys doing

258
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,639
when I was on leave?

259
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,919
Let's drop the topic.

260
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,960
Our company wanted

261
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,159
to proceed with the Lantian Bay project.

262
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:23,919
We were busy every day.

263
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,679
Not only do we have
to work overtime every day,

264
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:28,240
we had to attend meetings

265
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,879
from morning until night.

266
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,039
It must've been tough on you guys.

267
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:34,159
Eat up, okay?

268
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,000
It's my treat.

269
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:37,679
I was waiting for that,

270
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,879
lady boss.

271
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:39,720
Let's dig in.

272
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:45,960
I heard that you went for
a tooth extraction.

273
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,720
Everyone said that extracting your tooth
could make your face look smaller.

274
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:50,320
And your face...

275
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,399
I think it did become smaller.

276
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,240
I wish to extract
my wisdom tooth as well.

277
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:57,480
But I have none.

278
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,240
Stop teasing me.

279
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,559
Isn't it great that you don't have one?

280
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,120
Hello?

281
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:10,720
Okay.

282
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,240
Stop eating.

283
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:13,879
Clean up the table.

284
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:14,960
Our higher-ups want us
to attend another meeting.

285
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:16,639
Let's go.

286
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,399
Xie Yi,

287
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:20,639
please pack the food for us.

288
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,639
We haven't had our fill yet.

289
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:22,879
Understood.

290
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:23,559
Go now.

291
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:24,360
Okay, thank you.

292
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,039
Let's go.

293
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,080
Goodbye.

294
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:26,879
Goodbye.

295
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:27,639
Goodbye.

296
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:34,919
Waiter,

297
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:35,799
please pack the food for me.

298
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,159
Excuse me, sir.

299
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,679
If you're not a customer,

300
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:56,159
you're not allowed
to take pictures here.

301
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,000
Why haven't I heard of

302
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,279
that rule before?

303
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,240
Why can't I take pictures of the place?

304
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:01,240
Are you trying

305
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,279
to infringe my personal right?

306
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:03,639
This is the rule here.

307
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,480
Besides,

308
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,240
how did you know

309
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,399
that I'm not a customer?

310
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:07,759
Are you looking down on me?

311
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,200
Call your manager here.

312
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:10,200
I want to complain about you.

313
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,000
Hold this for me.

314
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,120
Excuse me, sir.

315
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:21,120
How should I address you?

316
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:22,360
My surname is He.

317
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,080
Are you the manager?

318
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,200
Hello, Mr. He.

319
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:26,919
I'm Su Xie Yi

320
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,720
from the chairman's office.

321
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,159
You did misunderstand

322
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,679
our employee just now.

323
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:32,399
This rule

324
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:34,159
was implemented not long ago.

325
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,000
But please listen to my explanation.

326
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,480
The dining environment here

327
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,639
is great.

328
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,720
At first,

329
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,360
it became popular

330
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,799
because people took pictures of it.

331
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:43,399
More and more influencers

332
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:44,799
and freeloaders

333
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,480
came all the way here to take pictures.

334
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,799
It has impacted our business seriously

335
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:51,080
and affected our customers'
dining experience.

336
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:52,480
I'm sure you don't want

337
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:53,799
random people

338
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,360
to take pictures around you

339
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,519
when you're eating.

340
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,960
That's why this rule was implemented

341
00:14:59,279 --> 00:14:59,759
to protect

342
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:01,399
our customers' rights.

343
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,960
Miss Su, I'm glad that you explained it

344
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,720
to me in that manner.

345
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,679
I'm not an unreasonable

346
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:05,679
person.

347
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,519
If you don't mind,

348
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:08,840
let me take the pictures for you.

349
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,440
Okay.

350
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,919
Sorry about that. I have rhinitis.

351
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,120
(No. 9 Steak House)

352
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,639
Mr. Li,

353
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:34,240
I've investigated the background
of Yunxiao Fishery's owner.

354
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,639
His name is Tang Zheng.

355
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,279
He had never done any kind of business

356
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,919
before he established this company.

357
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,960
His hobby is fishing.

358
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,679
His past work experiences

359
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,720
have nothing
to do with fisheries at all.

360
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,360
He sounds unreliable.

361
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,200
Where is he?

362
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:49,159
This person is as slippery as a catfish.

363
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:50,240
He went overseas

364
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,120
after his company went bankrupt.

365
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,559
I have no idea where he is.

366
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:55,120
Did you find any other clues?

367
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,000
Oh, yeah.

368
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:00,000
This is Qin.

369
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,919
He worked for

370
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:02,720
Yunxiao Fishery before.

371
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,320
Because of his love for fishing,

372
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:05,919
he was quite close to Tang Zheng.

373
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,039
Let's try

374
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,559
to find this Qin first.

375
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,240
Okay.

376
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,559
Mr. Dai!

377
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,559
Hurry! Please come in!

378
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,000
Let me introduce him. This is Mr. Xie.

379
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,519
Mr. Xie.

380
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:25,120
Hello.

381
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,600
This is

382
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,879
my secret trump card.

383
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,120
He's the chief editor of Hotel World,

384
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,360
Mr. He Jiang Hua.

385
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:32,159
Mr. He, today...

386
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,080
I did everything according to your plan.

387
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,080
I've met them

388
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,039
and I've taken pictures of them.

389
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,600
I knew we could rely on you.

390
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,320
Mr. Dai,

391
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,600
you'd made a great move.

392
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,159
Of course.

393
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,679
Come. How about this?

394
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:45,600
Let us have a toast

395
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,240
to prepare for
the exciting show tomorrow.

396
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:47,720
Cheers!

397
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:48,480
- Come.
- Cheers!

398
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,519
Come! Cheers!

399
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,150
(Shi Chu Chu)

400
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:52,399
Cheers!

401
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,159
Ms. Shi.

402
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,519
Mr. Xie.

403
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,120
I called you out at this late hour.

404
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:04,200
I'm not troubling you, am I?

405
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,240
Not at all.

406
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,480
Ms. Shi, it's my pleasure

407
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:07,599
for you to treat me to a drink.

408
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,920
So you just finished drinking?

409
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:17,920
I entertained several clients today.

410
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,720
Ms. Shi, your call

411
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,119
actually saved me.

412
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,359
So Ms. Shi, what do you need from me?

413
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,119
Nothing.

414
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:28,599
The Lantian Bay project

415
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,319
is proceeding smoothly,

416
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:30,559
and I have to thank you for that.

417
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,880
That's why I wish to treat you
to a drink.

418
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:33,720
Come.

419
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,279
Now that the project

420
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,359
is proceeding smoothly,

421
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:54,640
Su Xie Yi wishes to join the project.

422
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,839
Ze Liang wants me

423
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,920
to lead her as well.

424
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:58,200
Mr. Xie,

425
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:59,319
do you have any suggestions?

426
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,279
After all, you know her better.

427
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,759
Su Xie Yi?

428
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:04,920
She's not suitable for it.

429
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:06,039
But why?

430
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,640
Is it because of her ability
and experience?

431
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,119
Su Xie Yi is very intelligent.

432
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,440
It isn't as simple as you think.

433
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,079
Why are you saying that?

434
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,480
No, you see,

435
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:28,680
the Lantian Bay project

436
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:29,559
is too important.

437
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,519
Mr. Xie,

438
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,200
there's no need for you
to hide it any longer.

439
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:36,599
Actually,

440
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,759
I've asked Su Xie Yi about it before.

441
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,319
She admitted

442
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,200
that she first joined Ocean Hotel

443
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:42,119
in order

444
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,319
to investigate the incident
with Zhiwei Corporation.

445
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,000
She said so herself?

446
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:46,119
That's right.

447
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:47,920
She even said

448
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:49,440
that she's working for Ocean Hotel
right now

449
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,799
because of her passion for the industry.

450
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,200
At first, I was wondering

451
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:55,279
if I could

452
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:56,640
truly believe her words.

453
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,119
But your attitude

454
00:18:58,279 --> 00:18:59,519
has given me the answer I needed.

455
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:00,480
Plus,

456
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,240
you don't suggest I use her.

457
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,359
Is this a friendly reminder?

458
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,799
Ms. Shi,

459
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:14,079
we're friends.

460
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:14,880
Can you not...

461
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,400
Can you not make things
difficult for me?

462
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,400
We're friends indeed.

463
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,160
But I hope we can become

464
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:23,240
close friends.

465
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:24,799
I wish to know

466
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,680
if Su Xie Yi has any ulterior motives

467
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:29,680
for staying with Ocean Hotel?

468
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:32,920
When Su Xie Yi wants to do something,

469
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,680
she'll do it somehow.

470
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,440
Do you know

471
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,839
how she managed to become

472
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,319
the Deputy General Manager's Secretary
back then?

473
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:46,799
Lin Tai?

474
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,599
She was the one behind that incident?

475
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:52,119
Sorry, Ms. Shi.

476
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,559
Miss Su.

477
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,480
Mr. He?

478
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,720
What a coincidence.
Are you here to buy books as well?

479
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:41,519
That's right.

480
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:43,000
I often go on business trips.

481
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:44,200
That's why I visit

482
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:45,319
the bookstores near the hotel.

483
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:47,119
I can buy some books as well.

484
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:48,319
Miss Su,

485
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,039
what are you buying?

486
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:52,759
I've been learning
how to make soups lately.

487
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:54,160
I wanted to buy some cookbooks.

488
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,079
Soup?

489
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:58,440
Taking soup before meals

490
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,079
works better than medicine.

491
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:02,519
Soups are great.

492
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:04,000
You see, Miss Su,

493
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:06,119
in Guangzhou, they have old fire soup.

494
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:07,640
In Fujian, they have
Buddha's temptation.

495
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,279
In Jiangzhe, they have
bamboo shoot and salted pork soup.

496
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,519
In this world,

497
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,759
there are plenty of great soups.

498
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,640
Miss Su, I wonder

499
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,880
what kind of soup you like?

500
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:18,160
Mr. He, seems like you're very
knowledgeable when it comes to soup.

501
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,720
Do you have any recommendations?

502
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:22,559
Miss Su, it depends on

503
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,400
who the soup is meant for.

504
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,799
It's meant for my boyfriend.

505
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,759
I suggest old fire soup then.

506
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,480
Managing a relationship

507
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,599
is just like making old fire soup.

508
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,839
You need to cook it for a long time.

509
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,839
Because of that,

510
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:41,480
old fire soup is...

511
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:42,160
Please wait.

512
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:43,079
Let me jot it down.

513
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:46,599
Miss Su,

514
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:48,559
the word stew

515
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,440
means to cook slowly in liquid
in a closed dish.

516
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,400
So,

517
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:53,400
the pot meant for making soups
is very important.

518
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,920
It's best if you use an aged clay pot.

519
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,400
The soup you make

520
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:59,759
is not just food
that can fill up your tummy,

521
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,119
it's also a way
of expressing your affection.

522
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,759
So a soup

523
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:05,160
is more than just a soup.

524
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,599
Miss Su, it represents

525
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,799
your love as well.

526
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:10,480
Mr. He, your words

527
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,519
just gave more meaning
to the soup making.

528
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,519
Making soup

529
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,319
is a type of attitude towards life.

530
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:17,799
Old fire soup

531
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,359
has the nutrition of a tonic

532
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,720
and the taste of a savory soup.

533
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,559
So you won't go wrong

534
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:23,640
if you follow my recommendations.

535
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,599
Thank you, Mr. He.

536
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,079
You've done me a great favor.

537
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:28,039
My hobby

538
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,599
is eating and playing.

539
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:32,359
Miss Su, if you don't mind,

540
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:34,359
why don't you add me as a friend?

541
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,160
It'll be more convenient for us
to contact each other in the future.

542
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,119
Sure.

543
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,559
The soup you make

544
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,680
is not just food

545
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:56,200
that can fill up your tummy,

546
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,240
it's also a way of

547
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,400
expressing your affection.

548
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,079
So a soup is more than just a soup.

549
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:04,880
It represents your love as well.

550
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,759
So that's the case.

551
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:15,960
It smells nice.

552
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:19,799
Were you referring to the soup or me?

553
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:21,839
Both.

554
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,599
On account of your sweet words,

555
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,119
I'll let you have a try.

556
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,920
I mean the soup.

557
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,160
Why did you kiss me?

558
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:46,839
Xie Yi,

559
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:49,240
let me ask you.

560
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,880
If...

561
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,079
I'm saying if,

562
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,279
a person who's important

563
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:57,559
to you

564
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,079
has done something to hurt you,

565
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,640
what will you do?

566
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,559
Of course, I won't forgive him.

567
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:06,759
Didn't you hear of this before?

568
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:09,480
Love well, whip well.

569
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:11,480
Wait.

570
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:13,160
Li Ze Liang,

571
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,319
why did you ask me that?

572
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:17,680
Speak.

573
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,839
Did you do something bad

574
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,000
behind my back?

575
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,160
I didn't.

576
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,640
Really?

577
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:24,640
Really.

578
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,599
Come here.

579
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,480
Raise your arms.

580
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,440
I'm going to see if you're lying.

581
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:36,000
If you lie to me,

582
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,160
your heartbeat will betray you.

583
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:41,799
Ask me then.

584
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,440
Who's the woman you love the most?

585
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,240
Su Xie Yi.

586
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
In the future, no matter what it is,

587
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,319
you won't deceive me,

588
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:52,240
am I right?

589
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,759
As long as I know the truth behind them,

590
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,319
I won't deceive you.

591
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,400
So,

592
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,839
do you want a son

593
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,240
or a daughter?

594
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,440
I want both.

595
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,559
Strange.

596
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:13,920
Your heartbeat is getting faster.

597
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:16,000
Speak.

598
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,160
Did you lie to me?

599
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:18,920
I'm sure you want a daughter.

600
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:20,279
Everyone wants

601
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,359
another little lover.

602
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:26,920
I did lie to you.

603
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:29,799
It's because I want more than
just two children.

604
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:31,799
I want enough children

605
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:32,440
to form a football team.

606
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,160
You're so greedy.

607
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:36,000
- I'm not that free.
- Sit properly.

608
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,759
We don't need to rush.

609
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:41,559
Let's take our time.

610
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:43,960
Let's start with

611
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,480
the goalkeeper.

612
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:48,640
After that, we can give birth

613
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,599
to the strikers,

614
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,880
the defensive midfielders,

615
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,319
and the left midfielders.

616
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:57,640
After that, we'll...

617
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,240
If not, a basketball team works as well.

618
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,680
(Ms. Shi,)

619
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:03,200
(this morning, someone
published an article)

620
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,359
(anonymously.)

621
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,039
(It mentioned)

622
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:07,279
(Huo Jian selling fake wine and artwork)

623
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,559
(when he was)

624
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:10,039
(the chairman.)

625
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:11,480
(And in the article,)

626
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,160
(the Lantian Bay project was
mentioned specifically.)

627
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:14,559
(He said he has)

628
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,640
(the project cost estimation list
of the Lantian Bay project.)

629
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,359
(From the list,)

630
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,279
(it states)

631
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,559
(that our company plans to use
artificial hot water)

632
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,839
(instead of hot spring water)

633
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:22,960
(to gain maximum profit.)

634
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,960
(And he condemns us)

635
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:26,759
(for deceiving the consumers.)

636
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:28,119
Xie Yi,

637
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,440
let's go.

638
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:31,319
Yan,

639
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:32,400
we're in trouble.

640
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,279
Currently, our industry

641
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:37,480
and the public have known about this.

642
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,400
The group's share price is plummeting.

643
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,839
Now, the shareholders

644
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,200
are debating whether

645
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:43,920
to acknowledge the news.

646
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:46,920
We have to acknowledge it.

647
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,400
If we tell one lie,

648
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:50,880
we need to create more lies

649
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,799
to compensate for them.

650
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,920
In the end, it'll only ruin

651
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,880
our company's image and trust.

652
00:26:58,319 --> 00:26:59,440
That's what I thought as well.

653
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,519
Plenty of press is outside our company.

654
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,160
We need to come out

655
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,119
with a PR solution as soon as possible.

656
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,680
The best solution

657
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:07,799
is to prevent it

658
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:08,759
before it happens.

659
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,039
As for the fake wine,

660
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,599
we've corrected it internally.

661
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:16,839
As for the clients

662
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:18,240
(Fake Wine Client List)
who had bought those fake wines,

663
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:19,440
I've listed them down

664
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,079
and contacted them.

665
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:22,680
Although we've only

666
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,400
compensated some of the clients
just yet,

667
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,880
this is enough

668
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,720
to prove our sincerity.

669
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,319
With this compensation list,

670
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,160
I hope

671
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:38,359
it can at least produce
some positive effects.

672
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,839
But the main point

673
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,559
isn't the fake wine and artwork.

674
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,400
It's the Lantian Bay project.

675
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,240
This project is vital

676
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:47,920
to Ocean Hotel.

677
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:49,240
I know that.

678
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:51,920
I will think of a way to clarify it.

679
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,200
Ms. Shi,

680
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:54,759
please arrange for a press conference.

681
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:55,799
Okay.

682
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,839
There's one more thing.

683
00:27:58,279 --> 00:27:59,319
He Jiang Hua said

684
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:00,559
an anonymous person

685
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,799
leaked the news to him.

686
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:04,000
The information that was leaked
was accurate and detailed.

687
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,599
Does that mean

688
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,640
we have a spy among us?

689
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,759
That's possible.

690
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:13,960
After the press conference,

691
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,960
I wish to hold an internal review.

692
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:17,599
I must find out

693
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:18,720
the identity of the person

694
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,039
who leaked the information.

695
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:21,000
Okay.

696
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,599
Let me assist you.

697
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:31,599
It's done.

698
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,480
Later, I'll ask the
Housekeeping Department

699
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:37,359
to send you an air purifier.

700
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,319
I noticed

701
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:39,319
that your nose was irritated.

702
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,519
If I wish to provide him with clues,

703
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,839
first, I need to know who he is.

704
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,400
Speaking of which,

705
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:50,440
Miss Su,

706
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:51,680
you met He Jiang Hua

707
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:53,079
in the hotel, right?

708
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:55,319
I did meet him before.

709
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:57,039
But I only regarded

710
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,160
him as an ordinary customer.

711
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,759
And everything I did,

712
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:02,039
I did it to protect the company's image.

713
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:04,039
Ms. Shi, are you suspecting me?

714
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,799
I'm taking the matter on its merits.

715
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:06,599
I'm just analyzing the situation.

716
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,519
You don't need to be anxious
and refute my statement.

717
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:09,599
Alright.

718
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,799
Chu Chu,

719
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:13,559
I believe

720
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:14,920
this is a misunderstanding.

721
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:16,440
Our current priority

722
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:17,960
is to hold a press conference

723
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,440
and clarify

724
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,880
that Huo Jian was
behind the old proposal.

725
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,400
At the same time, we need to
announce our new proposal.

726
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:23,799
Okay.

727
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,200
I'll go and prepare now.

728
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,200
Yan,

729
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:34,920
I really met him by pure coincidence

730
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,200
on that day.

731
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:38,119
I didn't know

732
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,160
his true identity.

733
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:43,240
Don't take it to heart.

734
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:45,119
People are talking about this.

735
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:46,160
Ms. Shi,

736
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:47,680
she's under huge pressure as well.

737
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,359
I believe in you.

738
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:54,599
I will resolve this.

739
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:58,640
(Hello, Mr. He.)

740
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,720
(I'm Su Xie Yi,)

741
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:01,480
(the friend you added
in the bookstore last time.)

742
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,960
(Are you free to talk right now?)

743
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:18,240
(Mr. He,)

744
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,759
(I saw what you wrote online.)

745
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,400
(There are many misunderstandings.)

746
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,240
(I hope I have the chance)

747
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:23,759
(to explain the situation
to you personally.)

748
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,240
(If you're too busy to meet up with me,)

749
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:25,960
(I hope)

750
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,240
(we can communicate
through the phone for now.)

751
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,670
(He Jiang Hua)

752
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:54,359
This is amazing.

753
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:56,359
The press conference has produced
immediate results.

754
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,079
The share price of Ocean Hotel
has been stabilized.

755
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:01,599
But,

756
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,640
we just initiated

757
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,680
the Lantian Bay project,

758
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,559
and someone leaked
this news to the press.

759
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,720
Don't you think

760
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,079
it's too much of a coincidence?

761
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:10,920
Precisely.

762
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,640
But that He Jiang Hua said

763
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,599
someone tipped him off

764
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,839
anonymously.

765
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,799
Who do you think that person is?

766
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:18,480
An anonymous tip-off?

767
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,319
Who cares?

768
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,559
If we find out his identity,

769
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,039
he'll be fired.

770
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,720
What an ingrate.

771
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:26,480
I can't understand why.

772
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,400
Very good.

773
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:38,920
Strike while the iron is hot,

774
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,160
we should publish the articles

775
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:41,160
that we had prepared before.

776
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:43,039
That's right.

777
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,279
We need to try our best

778
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,200
to reverse public opinion.

779
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,000
Alright, that's it.

780
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:55,190
(Vice-chairman)

781
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,400
(Jessica: Ms. Shi,)

782
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,550
(Who tipped off He Jiang Hua?)
(check the post)

783
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,400
(RT tipped off He Jiang Hua)
(on the forum.)

784
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,319
(This is huge.)

785
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:00,839
(These people are too free.)

786
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,200
(They have too much free time
on their hands.)

787
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:03,759
(What has it got to do with me?)

788
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,119
(I'm just concerned about the validity)

789
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:06,400
(of the content.)

790
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:08,079
(Ocean Hotel has always been)

791
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:08,920
(my favorite hotel.)

792
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,759
(This is so disappointing.)

793
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,680
(I'm an avid reader)

794
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:13,599
(of Hotel World.)

795
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:15,559
(The chief editor, He Jiang Hua,
is a man of great taste.)

796
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,759
(I've been following him
on his social accounts.)

797
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:17,680
(That's right.)

798
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,680
(I saw him)

799
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,519
(in the bookstore last time.)

800
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,079
(Back then, he was chatting)

801
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:21,920
(with a beautiful girl.)

802
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I did meet him before.

803
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,759
But I thought

804
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,440
he was just an ordinary customer.

805
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,519
And everything I did,

806
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,799
I did it to protect the company's image.

807
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,079
Ms. Shi, are you suspecting me?

808
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:43,839
Xie Yi.

809
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:46,559
Yan.

810
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,680
You're back?

811
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:48,920
How's the situation?

812
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:50,519
I had called the shareholders

813
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:51,400
just now.

814
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:53,200
Everyone is satisfied

815
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,599
with the result of the press conference.

816
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:56,759
That's good to hear.

817
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,079
Su Xie Yi,

818
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:04,279
when will you stop pretending?

819
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,079
Ms. Shi,

820
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,839
I can explain this.

821
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,240
Explain what?

822
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:13,319
Explain why you leaked our information

823
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:14,920
to He Jiang Hua?

824
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:29,640
Since there are pictures of you and him,

825
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:31,160
there's no way for you to deny it.

826
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,200
Calm down for now.

827
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:43,559
Let's return to our office.

828
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,720
We can clarify any misunderstandings

829
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,160
over there.

830
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,519
No need for that.

831
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:48,839
Let's make things clear

832
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,079
right now.

833
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:52,759
Fine.

834
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:53,960
Speak.

835
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:56,440
That day, I went to buy some
soup cookbooks.

836
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,960
I did meet He Jiang Hua

837
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,039
coincidentally.

838
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:01,079
He is very knowledgeable
when it comes to soup.

839
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:02,160
That's why

840
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,039
I asked him some questions.

841
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,160
You meet him by accident twice in a row?

842
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,359
What a coincidence indeed.

843
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:07,680
Why would you check your phone

844
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,039
if you only asked him questions?

845
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,159
Or, were you

846
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,760
trying to leak our secrets?

847
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,920
We were just adding each other
on social media.

848
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:14,639
Fine then.

849
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,400
Call him right now

850
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:18,239
and ask him to prove your innocence.

851
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,220
(He Jiang Hua)

852
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,400
I have tried to contact him
since this morning.

853
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,800
But he hasn't replied yet.

854
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:47,599
That means you have no witness
to prove your innocence.

855
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,280
I think the so-called

856
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,239
"adding each other on social media"

857
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:50,760
is a story

858
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,039
you came up with.

859
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,000
Mr. Shi.

860
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:53,920
Chairman Li,

861
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,239
I, Shi Chu Chu,

862
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,599
do not mess around.

863
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,880
He Jiang Hua said

864
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,440
someone approached him and
tipped him off

865
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,280
about our company.

866
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,559
That means the person

867
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:02,480
must exist.

868
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,239
Now, we have evidence

869
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,199
that Su Xie Yi had met him

870
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,360
in private.

871
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,360
And,

872
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:09,599
the proposal for
the Lantian Bay project,

873
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,360
you left it at home, right?

874
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:12,320
That means

875
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,840
no one else has the chance

876
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:14,760
to make contact with it,

877
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,719
except for Su Xie Yi.

878
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:17,360
With those two points,

879
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,159
the truth has been proved.

880
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,280
Ms. Shi,

881
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,199
I've already explained it to you.

882
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,400
We just had an exchange

883
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,440
about soups.

884
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,400
I even made notes of his suggestions.

885
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,199
If you don't believe me,

886
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,039
I can show it to you.

887
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,559
Besides that,

888
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:32,159
we didn't talk about anything else.

889
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:33,679
Su Xie Yi,

890
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:34,800
do you even believe

891
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,880
in your own words?

892
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:37,920
Ms. Shi,

893
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,840
I believe in Xie Yi.

894
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,719
That night,

895
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,800
Xie Yi did buy some soup cookbooks

896
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,760
and studied them at home.

897
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,800
I've read her notes as well.

898
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:03,920
I can testify

899
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,320
for her.

900
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,760
What about the proposal
for the Lantian Bay project?

901
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,400
Can you be sure that
she hasn't seen it before?

902
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:14,119
Yes.

903
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:17,400
Although you didn't see it,

904
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,480
that doesn't mean it didn't happen.

905
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,920
Now, there's no evidence

906
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,000
to prove her innocence.

907
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,599
But you have no evidence

908
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,159
to prove that it's Su Xie Yi.

909
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,159
Am I right?

910
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,159
Ze Liang,

911
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:29,280
both you and I know

912
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,320
why Su Xie Yi joined Ocean Hotel
in the first place.

913
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:31,199
Ms. Shi!

914
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,079
Don't you think

915
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:34,840
there are many points of doubt

916
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,119
in this case?

917
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:39,039
Fine.

918
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,199
If you don't want me to say it here,

919
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:41,599
I'll keep quiet.

920
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,400
But I hope you can be sober.

921
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:43,960
This is not the time

922
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,960
for you to act emotionally.

923
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,480
I'm very sober.

924
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:47,639
Let me ask you this.

925
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:49,159
Why did He Jiang Hua

926
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:51,119
meet Su Xie Yi twice in a row?

927
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,320
And why did

928
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,840
he mention that someone tipped him off

929
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,559
deliberately?

930
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,559
And at this timing,

931
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:58,639
why would someone post pictures

932
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:00,320
of them seeing each other online?

933
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:01,960
And it was a clear shot as well.

934
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,000
When you add everything together,

935
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:06,280
don't you think

936
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,280
someone is trying to frame her?

937
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,880
You're just trying

938
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,840
to cover up for her.

939
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:11,760
Ms. Shi,

940
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:14,639
this is not the time for you
to be emotional.

941
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:15,880
If this took place in the past,

942
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,360
I'm sure you could

943
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,079
reveal the truth

944
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:20,360
behind the points of doubt.

945
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,000
Now, it's my problem?

946
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,559
Fine.

947
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,159
I do need to calm down.

948
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,960
I've been too exhausted lately.

949
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:32,800
I need to take a long break.

950
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:37,320
You want evidence, right?

951
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,719
I'll find them eventually.

952
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,440
Yan.

953
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,920
Let's talk in the office.

954
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:53,880
Yan,

955
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,280
I did read the proposal

956
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,159
for the Lantian Bay project.

957
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,920
Why did you deny it just now?

958
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,360
It's because I trust you.

959
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:03,800
I don't want people

960
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,119
to slander or suspect you.

961
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:08,960
You don't suspect me at all?

962
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:13,679
Xie Yi.

963
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,159
If we can't even

964
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,760
trust each other on this matter,

965
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:19,400
how can we spend the rest
of our life together?
