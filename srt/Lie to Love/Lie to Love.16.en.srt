No one can vote twice.

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,520
Go!

22
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:11,759
This is a no-brainer.

23
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,599
Any projects

24
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,759
that Ms. Shi works on

25
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,199
- never fail.
- That's right.

26
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,599
Ms. Shi

27
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,280
is as good

28
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,199
be it in terms of family background
and appearance.

29
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,560
I heard that Ms. Shi and Mr. Li

30
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:21,879
had known each other

31
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,719
since their school days.

32
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,319
That makes them childhood sweethearts.

33
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,080
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

34

Catch a tiger by the toe.

35
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,759
Mr. Li is not only a man

36
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,479
but also a businessman.

37
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,800
Hengye Bank

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,280
is Ocean's financial backer.

39
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,960
Does none of you believe in love?

40
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,080
Who do you bet on then?

41
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:43,719
I bet on...

42
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:45,800
Ms. Shi.

43
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,199
I heard

44
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,439
that everyone

45
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,719
voted for you.

46
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:54,960
Is it?

47
00:02:56,037 --> 00:02:56,678
It looks like

48
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,520
you girls don't have enough workload.

49
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,800
We were just killing time

50
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,919
during lunch.

51
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:00,639
But I think

52
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,039
this is what everyone wants.

53
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:05,639
Okay. Got it.

54
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:06,520
Get back to work.

55
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:29,719
Hello.

56
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,639
I'm the guest

57
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,240
who reserved table 28 tonight.

58
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,039
Could you help

59
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,719
to take out the stored wine

60
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,520
and decant it before the meal?

61
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,639
Thank you.

(Haotian Law Firm)

63
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,159
(These are the documents
for two contracts.)

64
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,280
(I need a copy of each.)

65
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,800

67
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,319
Xie Yi.

68
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,240
What brings you here?

69
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,199
Have a seat.

70
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,399
You bought me milk tea the other day,

71
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,040
but I left without saying goodbye.

72
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:33,040
Here's a token of apology.

73
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,839
Forget it.

74
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,079
If you don't want to go,

75
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:36,959
don't.

76
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,639
But if the same thing happens again,

77
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:39,240
two cups of milk tea

78
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,720
won't cut it.

79
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,600
Ming Hao.

80
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:47,199
I would like to ask you something.

81
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,040
How is the crime of murder

82
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:51,160
defined in the law?

83
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,800
Why do you ask?

84
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,519
Didn't you say it yourself?

85
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,480
Yan suspected

86
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,399
that foul play was involved
in his father's death.

87
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,199
So he's been secretly investigating it.

88
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,399
Huo Jian

89
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,120
happens to be the prime suspect.

90
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,680
The main condition

91
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:06,480
is that this person

92
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,319
has a clear behavior
of depriving others of their lives.

93
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,560
The second thing

94
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,560
is to have key evidence

95
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:11,759
to prove this.

96
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,079
Does Li Ze Liang

97
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,439
have any new discoveries?

98
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,120
Not yet.

99
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,839
But I believe

100
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:21,160
no one can't out run
the long arm of the law.

101
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:22,920
All right.

102
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,319
If you need my help,

103
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,600
be sure to tell me.

104
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,600
Your sister

105
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:29,879
is making a good recovery.

106
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,560
I'm thinking of taking her out tomorrow

107
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,319
and we can have a meal together.

108
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,639
Sure.

109
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,040
Come to my place then.

110
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,240
My sister hasn't been there.

111
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,079
All right.

112
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,519
Do what you have to tomorrow.

113
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,199
I'll take care of this.

114
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:42,720
A moment, please.

115
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,480
Look, I've listed down the grocery list

116
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,439
for tomorrow.

117
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,279
I've prepared your favorite,

118
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:56,480
steamed fish head with chopped pepper

119
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:57,800
and crab roe pot.

120
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,800
(Steamed Fish Head with Chopped Pepper,
Crab Roe Pot)

121
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,120
Ming Hao.

122
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,040
Thank you.

123
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,240
You and my sister

124
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,000
have been there by my side,

125
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,639
and it makes me feel

126
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,319
like my family is still with me.

127
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,040
Companion works both ways.

128
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,319
I feel happy

129
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,000
with you

130
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,839
and Xie Qing by my side.

131
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,040
You said that I liked Ze Liang.

132
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,560
You were right.

133
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,720
So I want to tell you

134
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,399
that from today onward,

135
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,759
I'll officially be competing with you.

136
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,439
If there was someone better

137
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,839
pursuing you

138
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,439
when you and my sister

139
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,839
had just started seeing each other,

140
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,439
would you waver?

141
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,199
Did you think I had no suitor

142
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,800
all these years?

143
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,920
If I've decided on something,

144
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,199
I wouldn't change my mind.

145
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,000
Xie Yi.

146
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,279
Someday, you'll understand

147
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,639
that in this world,

148
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,839
there's unforgettable true love.

149
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,360
I thought the same too.

150
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:12,879
See

151
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,000
if there's anything else to add.

152
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:17,360
Oh, right.

153
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,480
My sister likes sweet and sour pork.

154
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,040
Add it to the list.

155
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,560
Why is it just you?

156
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,079
Where's your dad?

157
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,959
My dad can't make it today.

158
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,639
Did something

159
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:59,639
came up?

160
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:03,560
I drove here.

161
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,759
I'll pass on the wine.

162
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,720
Actually,

163
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,120
my dad already told me

164
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,439
to reschedule dinner.

165
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,680
But still, I want to bring you here

166
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,240
because I want to give myself

167
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,279
a chance to fight for things.

168
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:23,279
What's the matter, Chu Chu?

169
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,200
Why are you acting strange today?

170
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,120
Since I was a kid,

171
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,480
I would always

172
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,679
make the best possible preparation
in whatever I do.

173
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,080
That's because

174
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,320
I never fight a battle that I can't win.

175
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,080
I'm afraid of failure.

176
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:54,320
But there's one thing

177
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,200
that I have no absolute confidence in

178
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:01,240
despite years of preparation

179
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,600
which is to confess to you.

180
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,200
All this time,

181
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,559
I've always been the one
standing in the center of the stage,

182
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,799
bathed in a glowing light.

183
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,840
Whatever it is,

184
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,000
as long as I fight for it,

185
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,480
I can surely get my hands on it.

186
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,519
But it was only until I met you

187
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,879
that I realized for the first time

188
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,600
what it felt like

189
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,480
to stand in the audience

190
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,720
and look up at the person
who's standing in the light.

191
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,759
To have someone to look up to

192
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,559
and miss dearly

193
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:43,840
is such a happy and beautiful thing.

194
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,720
Back then,

195
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,150
I transferred to that high school

196
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,630
(Building Rock Music Club)
because of you.

197
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:58,960
Because of you,

198
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,759
I chose to study Hotel Management.

199
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:03,960
And because of you,

200
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,039
I joined the music club

201
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,879
and sat in front of the drum set.

202
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:10,799
But in a twist of fate,

203
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,720
you ended up joining
the Mountaineering Club.

204
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:24,480
Actually,

205
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,480
I've done so much more than these

206
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,480
for you.

207
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,480
I thought

208
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:32,679
there was no reason

209
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:34,240
for me to tell you any of this.

210
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:36,279
As long

211
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:37,720
as I stayed by your side,

212
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:39,759
you would know how I feel.

213
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,399
But it was until I met Su Xie Yi,

214
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,639
I realized

215
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,240
I might be wrong.

216
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,679
I know

217
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,960
you feel differently about her.

218
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,600
But still,

219
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,200
I just want to get an answer

220
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,240
for my years of love.

221
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,679
Li Ze Liang.

222
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:12,679
I like you.

223
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,519
Chestnut.

224
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,799
Chestnut.

225
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,200
If I compete with Ms. Shi,

226
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,480
who do you think will win?

227
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,919
What?

228
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,440
She's

229
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,200
out of my league?

230
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,720
That's very honest of you.

231
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:55,159
Actually, Chu Chu

232
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,120
isn't that bad.

233
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,159
She's also

234
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,240
quite competitive.

235
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:01,679
Forget it.

236
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,679
It's better if she isn't.

237
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,840
Chestnut, let me ask you this.

238
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,759
Has he mentioned me to you

239
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:11,759
in the past two years?

240
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,639
He calls you Chestnut.

241
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,639
Does he think of me

242
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:16,519
every time

243
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,720
he says your name?

244
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,639
It's so late now.

245
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,120
Why isn't he back yet?

246
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:37,279
Forget it.

247
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,840
Things like this

248
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,279
require one to have self-consciousness.

249
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,279
Let's see when he'll come back.

250
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,519
Right?

251
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,360
Now that's more like it.

252
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,200
Ji?

253
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,120
It's you.

254
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,279
Miss Su.

255
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,799
Is Mr. Li here?

256
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,000
He's having dinner

257
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,080
with Ms. Shi.

258
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,399
What's matter?

259
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:06,759
No big deal.

260
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,120
Get some rest.

261
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,679
What could it be?

262
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:16,200
He wouldn't tell me.

263
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,080
That's weird.

264
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:34,600
I know.

265
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,120
Although you have been deliberately

266
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,240
keeping a distance from me,

267
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,960
I can still vaguely sense

268
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,600
your feelings for me.

269
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:48,759
How should I put it?

270
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,399
I think

271
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:53,399
love is the most mysterious thing

272
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:54,600
in the world.

273
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,120
It doesn't allow us

274
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:58,159
to make any presuppositions.

275
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,120
It's like

276
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,200
before I reach the top of the mountain,

277
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,639
I never believed

278
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:04,799
love at first sight

279
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,360
or predestined love.

280
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,200
But just when

281
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,799
I reached the mountain top,

282
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,200
and when I met Su Xie Yi,

283
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,559
it suddenly hit me

284
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,759
that all these cold words

285
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,840
actually

286
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,279
have their own true meaning.

287
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,120
I know.

288
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,360
You've always been very competitive,

289
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:34,519
and you only set your sights
on what's ahead of you.

290
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,679
There aren't many people

291
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,519
who can be ahead of you.

292
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,480
Or I should say,

293
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:44,200
I was the only one you could see.

294
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,759
But it's precisely because of that,

295
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,159
you have missed out

296
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,639
on many other things.

297
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:53,919
But...

298
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,039
I believe

299
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,559
it's all because you haven't reached

300
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:01,279
the mountain top

301
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,759
that belongs to you.

302
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,759
One day,

303
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,200
when you finally

304
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,759
reach the top of your mountain,

305
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:11,159
you might come to realize

306
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:12,879
that the person you are looking for

307
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:15,559
has already been there waiting for you.

Oscar.

348
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,200
What have you

349
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,200
got up your sleeve?

350
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,480
Don't get so surprised

351
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,559
or scream

352
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,759
after I tell you about it.

353
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:30,680
Actually,

354
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,160
ever since Lin Tai

355
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,880
told me about Spider,

356
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,440
as your buddy,

357
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:37,319
I wanted to do my part.

358
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,079
So you've been secretly

359
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,599
investigating it?

360
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,680
But most importantly,

361
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,400
I've really found him.

362
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,839
Where is he?

363
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:48,680
In this city.

364
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,960
Hiding from his creditors.

365
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:51,640
Here?

366
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:54,599
Are you sure it's him?

367
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:55,759
I've contacted him

368
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,680
and verified it.

369
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,359
Also, it matches

370
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,359
all his information.

371
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,440
This is the contact number

372
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,680
he used to call me.

373
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,839
Call him.

374
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,319
Hello?

375
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,200
Is this Liu Ah Wei?

376
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,720
Yes, are you looking for me?

377
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,799
Yes.

378
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,160
Where are you?

379
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
I only contacted you

380
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:19,400
because of the reward.

381
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,039
How much can you give me?

382
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:22,640
How much do you want?

383
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:23,559
Fifty thousand.

384
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:24,680
Okay.

385
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,920
I want cash. Give it to me in person.

386
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:28,359
Sure.

387
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:31,160
Hold on.

388
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,519
I lost some money in gambling
these two years

389
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:38,279
and went into hiding.

390
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,920
Are you here to collect debts?

391
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,000
Don't worry.

392
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:42,440
Take it easy.

393
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:44,960
I just want to ask you a few questions.

394
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:46,400
Bring the cash,
and you can ask me in person.

395
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,319
Okay.

396
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,960
All right. Cut the crap.

397
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:50,599
I'll send you the location in a bit.

398
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,160
Bring the money here within an hour.

399
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:54,119
Remember. Come alone.

400
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:55,720
If you dare to play tricks,

401
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,440
don't think about getting in touch
with me anymore.

402
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:58,599
Okay.

403
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,000
I promise.

404
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:19,880
Liang.

405
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,200
Are you

406
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,599
really planning to go in alone?

407
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,440
What's the matter?

408
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,920
Are you worried 
that he's going to eat me?

409
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,039
I'm the one who needs his help.

410
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:32,880
Let's play by his rules.

411
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,400
Okay.

412
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,279
Hello.

413
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,799
I've arrived.

414
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,440
Are you alone?

415
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:49,559
Of course. Just me.

416
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,039
Did you bring the money?

417
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:52,319
Yes.

418
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,759
Go straight after entering the gate.

419
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,519
There is a yellow cleaning truck.

420
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,799
Wait for me by that truck.

421
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
Be careful.

422
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,039
Is Liang going to be all right

423
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,599
going in there alone?

424
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,470
(Cleaning Truck)

425
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:14,559
Liang, watch out!

426
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,119
I've heard from him.

427
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,880
It's been taken care of.

428
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:28,880
I'm afraid

429
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:31,119
he'll be crippled for good now.

430
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,039
This time, he has to be bedridden

431
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,200
for at least a year.

432
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,440
Why must he

433
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,440
force my hand?

434
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,759
Tonight,

435
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:41,279
you can have a good night's sleep.

436
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:43,920
Off to bed.

437
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,400
(It's been taken care of...)
(Firewood, has it been taken care of?)

438
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:50,119
(Yes.)

439
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,519
(I'm going to lie low for a bit
in my hometown.)

440
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,359
(Okay. Be careful.)

441
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,599
Hi, Ji.

442
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:06,960
Mr. Li is injured.

443
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,039
What?

444
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:09,599
Ze Liang is hurt?

445
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,119
Shi Chu Chu just called.

446
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,880
She said Li Ze Liang had gone home
to recuperate.

447
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,119
Gone home?

448
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:26,920
Let's pay him a visit.

449
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:33,880
Where's Yan?

450
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:35,400
How is he?

451
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,680
What's going on?

452
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,160
Liang ran into a local thug last night

453
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,359
and got beaten.

454
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:41,119
He's resting in his room now.

455
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:42,240
I'll check on him.

456
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:43,519
Miss Su.

457
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,440
I know you're worried.

458
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,799
The doctor is inside now.

459
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:47,440
Let's not go in there for now.

460
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:50,960
Ms. Shi.

461
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:52,079
Didn't Yan

462
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,319
have dinner with you last night?

463
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,920
Why would things turn out this way?

464
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:57,000
I have no idea.

465
00:23:57,759 --> 00:23:59,519
He was fine when we left.

466
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,519
Mr. Huo.

467
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,400
I came to pay Ze Liang a visit.

468
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:19,000
You're all here.

469
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,400
I came

470
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:21,759
as soon as I heard.

471
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:23,240
Ji Ying Song.

472
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,720
Ze Liang is injured.

473
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,240
Why isn't he taken to the hospital?

474
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:26,880
Mr. Huo.

475
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:27,839
Mr. Li

476
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:29,079
suffered a vicious attack last night.

477
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,279
It's obvious

478
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,000
that they came for Mr. Li.

479
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,559
The assailant hasn't been caught.

480
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:34,519
There's no telling

481
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,880
if they'll come back again.

482
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,440
There are too many people
in the hospital.

483
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,599
It's safer

484
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,400
to find a private doctor
that we're familiar with.

485
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:41,359
Who's that assailant?

486
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,279
Have you identified him?

487
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,559
There was no surveillance camera,

488
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,400
and Mr. Li has been unconscious.

489
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,920
No lead so far.

490
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,640
This is so careless of you!

491
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,200
How could you let Ze Liang

492
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,359
walk around on the street alone

493
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:55,000
so late at night?

494
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:57,200
He'd get into danger

495
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,039
running into those local thugs.

496
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:01,680
Where's he now?

497
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,119
In his room.

498
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:04,599
Mr. Huo.

499
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,200
Mr. Huo.

500
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,200
Why did you come in?

501
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:10,920
Yan.

502
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,640
Dr. Wu.

503
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,720
You're here.

504
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,440
How...

505
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:17,200
is his condition?

506
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:20,559
Injury-wise, it's under control now.

507
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,720
But he's still in a coma.

508
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,279
We'll keep him under observation

509
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:25,920
after he regains consciousness.

510
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:27,799
Well, I shall take my leave

511
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:28,920
and come back tomorrow.

512
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,880
All right.

513
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:31,400
Also, keep in mind.

514
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,680
If he wakes up,

515
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,960
be sure to contact me.

516
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,400
Dr. Wu, I'll walk you out.

517
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,319
Yan.

518
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:50,799
You're going to be fine.

519
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:53,000
I'm sure you'll wake up.

520
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,640
Why is Ze Liang injured in the face too?

521
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:58,960
He scraped it when he fell over.

522
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,279
Is it?

523
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:07,160
If his face is disfigured,

524
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:08,680
that's going to be a problem.

525
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,519
Let me take a look.

526
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,000
Mr. Huo.

527
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,279
Miss Su.

528
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,039
If my nephew's face

529
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:32,000
is disfigured for real,

530
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,839
what are you going to do?

531
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:36,359
No matter what becomes of Yan,

532
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,160
I'll never leave him.

533
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:50,000
With you guys here
to take care of Ze Liang,

534
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,519
I feel at ease now.

535
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,160
I believe he'll recover soon.

536
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,960
There are still some works

537
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,720
to attend to at the office.

538
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:00,920
I'll get going now.

539
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,480
Whatever happens,

540
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,440
feel free to contact me.

541
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,160
Mr. Huo.

542
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,160
Leaving just like that?

543
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:31,480
I won't

544
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,759
be of any help here anyway.

545
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,720
Forgive me for being blunt.

546
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:38,359
Does this have anything to do with you?

547
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,000
You made a sudden announcement

548
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,839
of you stepping down during the meeting.

549
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,680
Shortly after, Ze Liang got beaten.

550
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,960
I don't know

551
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:46,799
what happened

552
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,920
between you two.

553
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,799
But I have my suspicion of you.

554
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,559
I don't blame you.

555
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,880
Things happened one after another.

556
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,880
Indeed, it's pretty coincidental.

557
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,720
Look, Cu Chu.

558
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,079
You've misunderstood.

559
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,319
I watched

560
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:05,519
Ze Liang grow up.

561
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,720
Right now,

562
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,000
he's also my only family.

563
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:12,920
I love him dearly.

564
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,920
Who do you think

565
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:17,759
would do this to him?

566
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,279
We'll inevitably make enemies

567
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,720
in the business world.

568
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,720
Ze Liang even won the tender

569
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,079
to the auction event
from Zhengde Hotel.

570
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,720
Perhaps,

571
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,400
they're holding a grudge.

572
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:33,480
I've spoken out of turn.

573
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:35,680
Forgive me for that.

574
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:40,279
Chu Chu.

575
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,079
I know you care deeply about Ze Liang.

576
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:44,559
I promise.

577
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,799
If I know

578
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:47,519
who's behind this,

579
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,000
I'm not going to spare that person.

580
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:51,920
Me too.

581
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:19,160
How was it?

582
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:21,039
Is Li Ze Liang really hurt?

583
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,799
I guess he is.

584
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:23,839
Judging from Su Xie Yi

585
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,119
and Shi Chu Chu's expressions,

586
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,480
it doesn't seem like
they were faking it.

587
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:28,400
But

588
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:30,319
continue to keep an eye on them.

589
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,680
Okay.

590
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,480
Yan.

591
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,200
There are still a lot of things

592
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,079
that we haven't done together.

593
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,599
And we were going
to take down Huo Jian together.

594
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,319
You said you would protect me.

595
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:01,759
You can't go back on your words.

596
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:15,599
Miss Su.

597
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:18,119
There's something

598
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:20,319
that I would like to discuss with you.

599
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,440
Ze Liang is still in a coma now.

600
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,039
He can't continue to just stay at home.

601
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:29,079
We should send him to the hospital
as soon as possible.

602
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,359
You're right.

603
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,799
I'll contact Dr. Wu right away.

604
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,400
Mr. Li.

605
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:37,519
Huo Jian has left.

606
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,920
But Yi Fei
is still keeping watch outside.

607
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,319
What are you talking about?

608
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,440
Help me remove the gauze.

609
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,759
It's smothering me.

610
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,359
Yan.

611
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,640
What...

612
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:04,680
What's going on?

613
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,079
I want cash. Give it to me in person.

614
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:16,359
Sure.

615
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,240
Oh, right.

616
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,720
I happen to be in the store right now.

617
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,519
Should I bring some stationery

618
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:24,400
for your son too?

619
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,680
That little brat is a disappointment.

620
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,559
No need for that.

621
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,759
Is it?

622
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,319
All right. Cut the crap.

623
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,039
I'll send you the location in a bit.

624
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:32,920
Bring the money here within an hour.

625
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,039
Ying Song.

626
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:35,960
I just contacted a person

627
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,799
who claimed to be Liu Ah Wei.

628
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:39,279
He said he's in Shanghai.

629
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:40,359
That's impossible.

630
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,680
I was going to see you

631
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,359
to update you

632
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,759
on the new lead on Liu Ah Wei.

633
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:45,000
Tell me.

634
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,759
There is a small vendor in Yun'an

635
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,079
who knows Liu Ah Wei.

636
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,480
He often

637
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,440
buys alcoholic beverages from him.

638
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,640
According to him,

639
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,759
Liu Ah Wei has been in a poor health

640
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,279
since six months ago.

641
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,559
How could he possibly
be so full of energy

642
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:56,680
and show up in Shanghai?

643
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,440
I knew it.

644
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,160
This guy doesn't even know

645
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:02,279
that Liu Ah Wei

646
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,160
doesn't have a son.

647
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,640
Something's fishy here.

648
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,279
What's your plan?

649
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,480
He initiated contact with me.

650
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,279
I'm curious

651
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:12,279
what he is really up to.

652
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,000
Why don't you meet him?

653
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:15,640
He gave me an address.

654
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,160
Come over now.

655
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:18,759
Let's give him

656
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,839
a surprise attack
and catch him off guard.

657
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:23,880
Okay.

658
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,160
Liang, watch out!

659
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,599
Liang.

660
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,079
It looks like you and Ji

661
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:51,559
have planned this.

662
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:53,599
Did we scare you?

663
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,570
(Firewood, has it been taken care of?)

664
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:09,720
Mr. Li.

665
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:11,440
Indeed, someone else is behind this.

666
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,480
It's a trap.

667
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,000
I'm sure this is Huo Jian's doing.

668
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,119
It looks like my investigation on Spider

669
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,359
has gotten under his skin.

670
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:21,039
What do we do with this guy?

671
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,880
Let's play along.

672
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,480
Reply to his text message.

673
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,680
Okay.

674
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,000
Dude, password.

675
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:36,680
Password.

676
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:41,480
Thank you.

677
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:45,000
So you didn't get hurt?

678
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:46,079
That's right.

679
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,720
All thanks to Dr. Wu.

680
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,119
Too bad that thug

681
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:50,920
got away.

682
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:52,519
I've gone through the phone

683
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,240
of that thug who tried to assault you

684
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,559
and found other evidence

685
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,400
between his conversation with Huo Jian.

686
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:57,279
So this proves

687
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,960
that our speculation was right.

688
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,039
Very well.

689
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:02,240
We'll still proceed as planned.

690
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,519
Oscar.

691
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:04,680
You're up.

692
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,400
Okay.

693
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,320
Aren't you going to help me
with the gauze?

694
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,440
Ji is here, isn't it?

695
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,880
Ji is a clumsy person.

696
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:17,920
You have delicate hands.

697
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:19,440
Besides,

698
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,320
I'm playing Liang now.

699
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,079
I'm going to get changed.

700
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,639
What's the matter?

701
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:53,400
Still mad?

702
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,320
You liar.

703
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,239
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

704
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,840
You got me so worried.

705
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,840
I can't help it.

706
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,280
This is the only way

707
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,920
to fool Huo Jian.

708
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:09,039
Look.

709
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:11,400
I'm fine, aren't I?

710
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,159
You were just lying in there

711
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,760
and didn't make a sound.

712
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,760
Did you intend to watch me
make a fool of myself?

713
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:21,920
My dear Xie Yi.

714
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:24,079
Each and every single word

715
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,519
that you said

716
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,519
is deeply etched in my heart.

717
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,800
I couldn't help but feel touched.

718
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,559
How would I possibly make fun of you?

719
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:37,119
It's done.

720
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,159
Thank you.

721
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:41,599
Coming up next

722
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,519
is to wrap my good-looking face.

723
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,639
Cut the crap.

724
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:47,599
Sit tight.

725
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,400
Oh, right, Ji.

726
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:00,320
Is Ze Liang

727
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:02,239
planning to do something in secret?

728
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,039
Mr. Li

729
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:04,480
has something important to do.

730
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,079
So he's having Oscar disguised as him

731
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,239
to throw Huo Jian off the trail.

732
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:08,199
What Mr. Li needs now

733
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,559
is time.

734
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,360
So

735
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:12,119
the later Huo Jian finds out,
the better.

736
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,639
Also, if Huo Jian learns

737
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,360
that Mr. Li is fine,

738
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:16,440
who knows

739
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:17,960
if he'll continue
to orchestrate something else?

740
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,559
Are you going as well?

741
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,119
Huo Jian is always keeping tabs on me.

742
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,280
I can only stay here

743
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,280
to make this whole thing
more believable.

744
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:27,800
Also, Ms. Shi,

745
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,800
do come by and pay him a visit often.

746
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,559
Huo Jian knows

747
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,079
that you care about Mr. Li.

748
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,840
If you don't come,

749
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:36,000
it'll seem very suspicious.

750
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:38,400
Okay.

751
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:39,760
I know what to do.

752
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,280
From what you've said,

753
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:44,079
this Firewood guy

754
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,119
is sent by Huo Jian.

755
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,599
Ms. Shi.

756
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,159
You can stop wrapping now.

757
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:53,280
Oscar has turned into an egg.

758
00:36:58,039 --> 00:36:58,679
Chu Chu.

759
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,320
Come and visit me often.

760
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,320
So you have found

761
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:03,559
the whereabouts of Spider?

762
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,480
Yes.

763
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:05,719
So

764
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,000
I have to set out at once

765
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:08,360
before Huo Jian catches on.

766
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,440
Yan.

767
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,159
I'll come with you.

768
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:12,840
Xie Yi.

769
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,360
Don't try to make excuses

770
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,239
and leave me behind.

771
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,920
Have you forgotten our promise?

772
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:18,800
No matter what happens,

773
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,639
we'll face it together.

774
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,320
What if I get into danger

775
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:23,119
after you leave me here alone?

776
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,400
Okay.

777
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:30,079
I promise you.

778
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:32,239
Oh, right.

779
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,559
How do we get out?

780
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,360
I heard from Ji

781
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:38,239
that Yi Fei
has been keeping watch outside.

782
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:41,800
Let me ask you.

783
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,239
After Oscar and Chu Chu

784
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,199
paid me a visit,

785
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,679
they would have to leave, right?

786
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,800
Are you saying

787
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,360
that we disguise as Oscar

788
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,840
and Chu Chu

789
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,360
and openly walk out of here?

790
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:55,639
Since Oscar

791
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,280
can pretend to be me,

792
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,480
why

793
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:00,960
can't I

794
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:02,559
pretend to be Oscar then?

795
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:08,239
Rock.

796
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,800
Food is almost ready.

797
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,280
Hello, Xie Yi.

798
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:57,320
Where are you now?

799
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,840
Hi, Ming Hao.

800
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:02,880
Sorry.

801
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,719
Ze Liang and I will be away

802
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,760
on an urgent business trip.

803
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,639
I won't be coming back

804
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,079
to have dinner with you and Xie Qing.

805
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,199
What's so urgent?

806
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:11,039
It wasn't easy for me

807
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,719
to take Xie Qing out of the hospital.

808
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,519
Do you remember the things

809
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:15,519
that I consulted you about?

810
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:18,159
This time, we can find strong evidence

811
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,199
to take Huo Jian down.

812
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:20,840
So I have to go.

813
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,599
Xie Yi.

814
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:24,440
It's dangerous for you to do this.

815
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:25,400
Don't worry.

816
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,199
I'll protect myself.

817
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,079
Take a look at the map.

818
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,320
Hi, Mr. Xie.

819
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:44,679
I'm with Xie Yi now.

820
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:46,599
No matter what happens,

821
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,559
I'll surely

822
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,719
keep her safe.

823
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,119
Li Ze Liang.

824
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:52,559
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

825
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:54,400
Yes.

826
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,159
If you really love her,

827
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:57,079
you shouldn't let her

828
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,320
get mixed up in this again.

829
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,039
Mr. Xie.

830
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:02,360
Xie Yi is an adult.

831
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:05,119
She has her own free will.

832
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:07,159
Neither you nor I

833
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,480
have the right

834
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,159
to make decisions for her.

835
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:12,840
I know Xie Yi's characters very well.

836
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:15,519
She's kind and will fight for justice.

837
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,119
Even if it's just a small favor
done to her,

838
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,400
she'll not hesitate to return it.

839
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:19,800
Had she not known you injured your leg

840
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,519
for trying to save Uncle Shen,

841
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,880
she would have been

842
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:24,079
out of the picture by now.

843
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,320
She only came back

844
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:26,760
because she felt guilty for her dad.

845
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,280
Li Ze Liang.

846
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,599
Did you really think

847
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,159
she did all this

848
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,519
for you?

849
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:38,719
Liang, we should go now.

850
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:42,679
Mr. Xie.

851
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,199
Whatever it is you have to say,

852
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,199
we can talk in person when I return.

853
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,760
I'll surely

854
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,760
bring Xie Yi back safely.

855
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:01,239
I've checked.

856
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,039
The small vendor

857
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:04,559
that revealed the information to Ji

858
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,119
is located about 400 km away.

859
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:06,920
If we drive fast,

860
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:08,039
we'll be there this afternoon.

861
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:12,920
What's wrong?

862
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,480
Is something troubling you?

863
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:18,800
Nothing.

864
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:19,960
Xie Yi.

865
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,639
Why don't I drive?

866
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,679
It's okay.

867
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,760
You can take over if I feel tired.

868
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,800
Okay.

869
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:33,440
Come on. Let's get in the car.

870
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,159
Where are you going?

871
00:41:56,199 --> 00:41:57,400
Look, you're all dirty already.

872
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,199
Does it hurt?

Be a good girl.

Be a good girl.

877
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,760
She's not being a good girl,

878
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,760
and she wants to be set free.

879
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,159
But don't worry.
