00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:25,000
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,410
♫  Still haunts me now and then in quiet nights  ♫

4
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:41,330
♫  And turn to face all the long lost times  ♫

5
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,370
♫  Brace the pain  ♫

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:51,210
♫  Let memories wake up from oceans deep  ♫

♫  No place to hide  ♫

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,450
♫  No way to run  ♫

♫  New dawn counts down  ♫

00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,830
♫  I fight  ♫

00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,010
♫  I cry  ♫

12
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,700
♫  I give up  ♫

00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:15,610
♫  Memories forgotten, forsaken surround  ♫

14
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:24,030
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

15
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:32,470
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

16
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:40,850
♫  Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

17
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:49,650
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

18
00:01:49,650 --> 00:02:00,150

19
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,280

20
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,719
 Mr. Li, good thing you had me follow Miss Su.

21
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,719
 Indeed, someone is on her tail.

22
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,960
Where is she now?

23
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,320
Don't worry. Miss Su and Lawyer Xie are on their way back to the city.

24
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,080
-  She's safe now.  
 - You mean Xie Minghao?

25
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,159
 That's right.

26
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:18,719
Did you get a clear view of the person who's following her?

27
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,439
 He was wearing a mask. I couldn't get a good look. Should I investigate it?

28
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,659
It's fine. It's probably Huo Jian's guy.

29
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:36,200
Xie Minghao?

30
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,200
Xieyi, you staying in the hotel isn't a long-term solution.

31
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,139
I'll find you a new place.

32
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:47,240
You can move in after you return from your business trip.

33
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,240
Thanks, Brother Minghao.

34
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,020
It's hard enough having to take care of my sister. Don't worry about me.

35
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,599
Why are you being such a stranger?

36
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,860
Uncle Shen had supported me. He was like a father to me.

37
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,760
Even without Xieqing, I should take care of you too.

38
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,940
Is there anything urgent?

39
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,819
It's Li Zeliang.

40
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:23,840
He told me to return to the hotel before dark.

41
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:28,339
For a fake boyfriend, he seems so immersed in his role.

42
00:03:28,339 --> 00:03:30,360
He's only doing it for my own good.

43
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,400
Besides, if he hadn't helped me with Secretary Lin's incident,

44
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,640
who knows what would have happened?

45
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,479
That's right. I should really thank him for that.

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,559
Brother Minghao, thanks for giving me a ride.

47
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:02,260
I'll get going now.

48
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,660
Go on.

49
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,880
Slow down. Don't run so fast.

50
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,879
I know!

51
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:25,539
Director Li, we meet again.

52
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:30,500
Lawyer Xie, thank you for bringing my girlfriend home.

53
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,419
But next time, just give me a call will do.

54
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:36,459
There's no need to trouble you.

55
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:45,700
Director Li, you and I both know Xieyi is just your girlfriend in name.

56
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,979
Even so, that still makes her my girlfriend.

57
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:52,819
Just like you. You're her brother-in-law only in name.

58
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,620
That still makes you her brother-in-law.

59
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,659
Director Li, Xieyi is going on a business trip to Yunfeng.

60
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:06,840
I hope the incidents like the one with Secretary Lin won't happen again.

61
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,099
If anything happens to Xieyi, I'm not going to let the matter drop.

62
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:12,879
Don't worry.

63
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,160
Xieyi is my special assistant and also my girlfriend.

64
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,879
I'll take good care of her.

65
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,479
Let's hope so.

66
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,060
These are photos taken from today.

67
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,380
Why does this girl look so familiar?

68
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,140
Her name is Shen Xieqing.

69
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,420
That guy is called Xie Minghao.

70
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,220
That's right. It's her.

71
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,580
Shen Zhihong's daughter.

72
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,620
If so, it's not surprising that Xie Minghao shows up here.

73
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,840
They were previously engaged.

74
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,380
I've looked into it.

75
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:12,140
Shen Xieqing was admitted to the hospital because of a mental disorder.

76
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,559
She disappeared after Zhiwei went bankrupt two years ago.

77
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:20,279
And now, she shows up out of nowhere.

78
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,419
Su Xieyi even went to see her.

79
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,979
Keep digging.

80
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:32,040
Make sure you get to the bottom of things.

81
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:38,539
This is a counterfeit painting. Please discard it for me.

82
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,140
Mr. Li, it took me a lot of effort to find the co-worker he used to work with.

83
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:51,419
I found out from him that Liu A'Wei engaged in such a dangerous job entirely for his daughter.

84
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:53,880
His daughter has a hearing impairment.

85
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,419
- Is it? 
 - That's right.

86
00:06:56,419 --> 00:07:01,939
According to his co-worker, he has been talking about a hospital that specializes in this type of surgery.

87
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:05,339
But the surgery and the cochlear implant require a lot of money.

88
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:07,779
He's been worrying about how to pay off the medical bills.

89
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:09,700
Did you find out the name of this hospital?

90
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,400
Yes. He kept talking about it to his co-worker. So he remembers the name.

91
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,460
But he disappeared after that. So we have no idea if the surgery was done.

92
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:24,319
Perhaps we should stop looking.

93
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,800
You mean...

94
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,559
Huo Jian has been looking for so long, but he didn't find him.

95
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:35,519
It shows that the hope of finding him is very slim.

96
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,820
We can change our method.

97
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,739
Like starting with the cochlear implant surgery.

98
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:43,739
Are you saying that he really did take his daughter to have this surgery?

99
00:07:43,739 --> 00:07:46,160
At least, there's a possibility.

100
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,959
If so, where did he get the money for it?

101
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:51,800
I did ask around. This surgery and cochlear implant require hundreds of thousands.

102
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,299
Imported ones will be even more expensive.

103
00:07:54,299 --> 00:07:58,060
What if Liu A'Wei suddenly has the money to get this surgery done for his daughter?

104
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:02,440
In that case, his disappearance will make sense now.

105
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,160
Could it be possible that he saw something,

106
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,970
and used it as a bargaining chip to extort money?

107
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:11,060
That will require some digging before we can be certain.

108
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,760
Understood.

109
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,320
Yingsong, how about this? Get in touch with that hospital.

110
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,480
I'm willing to donate a sum of money to them to set up a special fund

111
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,160
to help children who go to the hospital for cochlear surgery,

112
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,680
especially those families with bad financial conditions.

113
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,720
That's great.

114
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,040
Not only can we do our part to help those children,

115
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,659
but we can also find out if Liu A'Wei did take his daughter there to have the surgery done.

116
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:38,640
Remember. Don't make the donation in Ocean's name or my name.

117
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,420
Understood.

118
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:50,980

119
00:09:01,473 --> 00:09:04,499
Hi, Director Li. I'm Li Fei, Mr. Chen's special assistant.

120
00:09:04,499 --> 00:09:08,620
We just received news that you would arrive earlier. Mr. Chen will be right here.

121
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,520
How about this? Get someone to deliver the luggage to the room.

122
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,279
We're going to look around.

123
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,979
All right.

124
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,919
 Xieyi, stand here. Don't move. I'll hold it for you, all right?

125
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,719
 Okay.

126
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,080
 Xieqing, be careful.

127
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,600
 I know. Don't move.

128
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,200
 Sister, you're awesome!

129
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:18,240
This place is well laid out.

130
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:23,450
When the building was built, my dad personally designed the landscape.

131
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,300
He had a great love for flowers and trees.

132
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,470
So the plants here were selected with care.

133
00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:32,420
Indeed, Uncle Shen had a really great taste.

134
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,739
Fortunately, this place wasn't demolished during the renovation of the Yunfeng Hotel.

135
00:10:36,739 --> 00:10:39,459
If not, we wouldn't get to see this now.

136
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,160
 The wines at Yunfeng have always been our major source of earnings.

137
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,280
 The proceeds are highly stable.

138
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:57,579
What's the matter?

139
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Have a drink with me.

140
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,400
Isn't it a little early for a drink now?

141
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,420
Let's pick one bottle.

142
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,580
This.

143
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,280
Director Li.

144
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,880
General Manager Chen.

145
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,200
Welcome.

146
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,420
Why didn't you tell me that you were coming earlier?

147
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,120
We didn't even prepare for the welcome ceremony.

148
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,159
Speaking of which, that was the reason why I didn't want to give prior notice.

149
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,559
Understood.

150
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:40,379
We're just chilling out here and having a drink.

151
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:42,079
Miss Su.

152
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,460
You sure have a unique taste.

153
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,399
That bottle of wine you picked is indeed a good wine.

154
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:54,840
But unfortunately, it's a bad vintage.

155
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,220
So it tastes slightly inferior.

156
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:03,100
I think given Director Li's status, you'll be more particular about this.

157
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,000
Besides, this is the first time the two of you have come here.

158
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,659
We should prepare better wines for you.

159
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:11,300
It's okay, General Manager Chen.

160
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,679
We're just having a casual drink to quench our thirst.

161
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,859
Even so, Director Li is different from other people.

162
00:12:20,859 --> 00:12:22,759
Isn't it, Director Li?

163
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,559
You're right, General Manager Chen.

164
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:30,840
Indeed, this bottle of wine isn't of the best vintage.

165
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,440
Never mind.

166
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,779
How about this?

167
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:38,440
I'll get you two a good wine as a welcoming reception.

168
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,940
It's okay.

169
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,039
We're here for work.

170
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:46,739
I want to hold a meeting at once. General Manager Chen, please see to it.

171
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,100
You sure are a man of action, Director Li.

172
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,179
All right then. I'll leave you two alone. I'll get them to prepare it at once.

173
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:54,820
Go on.

174
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,940
Everyone.

175
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,940
You must have heard some stories about me.

176
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,219
Those rumors aren't fake, but they aren't entirely true.

177
00:13:18,219 --> 00:13:23,180
For some reason, I didn't involve myself too much in the group's operation.

178
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,279
But this is different.

179
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,759
I came to Yunfeng to host Fujiade Auction.

180
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:32,800
It's a must to make it a success.

181
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,639
Yunfeng is a subsidiary of Ocean.

182
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:42,240
The success of this auction will directly affect Ocean's reputation.

183
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,359
Should anything go wrong,

184
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:50,100
I wouldn't be able to protect any of you even as the deputy general manager of Ocean.

185
00:13:51,499 --> 00:13:55,699
Of course. With your help and support,

186
00:13:55,699 --> 00:14:00,159
I believe this auction will be a success.

187
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:06,039
After all, no one knows Yunfeng better than you.

188
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:14,879
So I don't care how you did things back then or whose order you took.

189
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:21,080
I hope from this moment on you'll understand what you should do

190
00:14:21,979 --> 00:14:23,839
and whose order you should follow.

191
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,340
Any objection?

192
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,399
 No.

193
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,999
Very well.

194
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:37,659
The brochure in front of you is the introduction to the lot in this auction.

195
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:40,339
Go back and study it.

196
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,899
All right.

197
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:50,320
If there's nothing else, I won't keep you any longer.

198
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,020
Dismissed.

199
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,360
Here, this way, please.

200
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:01,380
I was fortunate enough to witness the romantic moments between Director Li and Miss Su at the reception.

201
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,159
It makes people green with envy.

202
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:08,499
So I specially prepared this honeymoon suite for the two of you.

203
00:15:08,499 --> 00:15:11,059
I hope you'll like it.

204
00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:15,759
Xieyi. Look how thoughtful General Manager Chen is.

205
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,200
Thank you, General Manager Chen.

206
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,379
It's my duty.

207
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:20,499
Well, I shall leave you be.

208
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:22,720
Call me if you need anything.

209
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,679
- This way. 
 - Thank you, General Manager Chen.

210
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:26,860
- Come on. 
 - Let's go.

211
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:37,759
Chen Hengsheng is a sly old fox.

212
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,279
Honeymoon suite, huh?

213
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,559
He's obviously trying to feel us out.

214
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,599
Don't say that. He's quite thoughtful.

215
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:48,600
Look, this bed is so beautifully prepared.

216
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,940
I couldn't bring myself to lie down on it.

217
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:56,799
What are you doing?  
 - The reason they put us in a room

218
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:01,659
is to find out if we're a real couple or a fake one.

219
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:04,759
Then, they'll use housekeeping as the pretext to look for evidence.

220
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:07,039
Good thing I came prepared.

221
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,759
I want this room to be filled with the breath of love.

222
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,639
Brilliant.

223
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,899
Done!

224
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,840
I'm used to sleeping in a big bed since I was a kid.

225
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,270
You have to let me take the bed.

226
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,440
Well, I've never slept on a sofa. You need to learn to yield.

227
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,979
- But I'm a girl. 
 - Men and women are equal.

228
00:16:46,979 --> 00:16:50,220
How about this? Whoever touches the bed first wins.

229
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,240
Spin around three times before we start.

230
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,540
Mr. Li. You'll lose for sure.

231
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,919
We'll see.

232
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:58,520
Don't peek.

233
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,659
The one who peeks is an alpaca. 
 ♫  Is emanating its fragrance  ♫

234
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:03,320
Are you okay?

235
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,100
I'm fine. You should just worry about yourself.

236
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:13,450
Look at you. Don't get so competitive.

237
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,710
Keep your arms straight.

238
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,580
Walk slowly.

239
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:24,120
Don't knock yourself out before you reach the bed.

240
00:17:25,219 --> 00:17:31,140
♫  I'll Waltz and tell you  ♫

241
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,560
♫  Because you're my angel  ♫

242
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,610
♫  Baby, I love you  ♫

243
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,330
♫  I feel you, I need you  ♫

244
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:44,450
♫  I want to be happy because of you  ♫

245
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,280
♫  Like soda and lemon  ♫

246
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,219
♫  I can't stop bubbling  ♫

247
00:17:49,219 --> 00:17:51,561
- Sorry. 
 - Sorry.

248
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,880
♫  Baby, I love you  ♫

249
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,390
♫  I feel you, I need you  ♫

250
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:03,510
♫  I want to be happy because of you  ♫

251
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,490
♫  I secretly blindfolded you  ♫

252
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:08,390
♫  I'll tell you where I am  ♫

253
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:12,930
♫  It's just you and I, forever  ♫

254
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,030
♫  Baby, I love you  ♫

255
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,670
♫  I feel you, I need you  ♫

256
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:21,820
♫  I want to be happy because of you  ♫

257
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,710
I won! I'll sleep on the bed tonight!

258
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:27,680
♫  I'll tell you where I am  ♫

259
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:33,119
♫  It's just you and I, forever  ♫

260
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:36,620
All right then. You take the bed, and I'll take the couch.

261
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:46,520
We didn't even receive any notice, and they showed up all of a sudden.

262
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,060
So I didn't get to swap the wine in time.

263
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,880
But I have had all the wine removed from the shelves. They probably won't find out anything.

264
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,599
Don't throw yourself off the game.

265
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,039
The reason Li Zeliang came is for the auction.

266
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:03,680
Everyone in the company has their eyes set on him.

267
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,060
He won't create unnecessary problems.

268
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,700
What worries me is the girl beside him, Su Xieyi.

269
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,440
She's quite smart. You should guard against her.

270
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,359
Yes.

271
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:19,079
She almost got me into trouble today.

272
00:19:19,699 --> 00:19:21,160
Don't forget.

273
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,180
They are the guests. You're the host.

274
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,920
 Wait to hear from me on our next course of action.

275
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:31,799
Since they are here, we have to show them great hospitality.

276
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,839
All right. I'm on it right now.

277
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,620

278
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:02,200
Can you lend me the pen?

279
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,499
Why?

280
00:20:03,499 --> 00:20:05,419
To write on the invitation cards.

281
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,720
Haven't all the invitation cards been printed?

282
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:12,389
It's too stylized. I want to include some handwritten wishes.

283
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:15,000
Good thinking.

284
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,040
But how's your handwriting? Is it okay?

285
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,077
If I had no confidence to even do this,

286
00:20:20,077 --> 00:20:24,119
how would I dare to become Mr. Li's assistant?

287
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:26,859
Give it to me.

288
00:20:32,219 --> 00:20:34,740
This pen is...

289
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,790
It was a gift from my dad the year I was enrolled at the college.

290
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:44,339
But speaking of which, people rarely write with pens now.

291
00:20:44,339 --> 00:20:47,359
What's the matter? You don't believe me?

292
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:51,420
You can test me. You talk, and I'll write.

293
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,160
Sure.

294
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,560
Come on.

295
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:00,900
I'll talk, and you write.

296
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,859
"I want to live with you."

297
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:08,850

298
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,739
"Enjoying endless dusk,

299
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:16,240
and hearing endless bell chimes

300
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,920
in a small town."

301
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,962
"I want to relive 'the romantic kiss with you

302
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,941
under the stars with you'."

303
00:21:48,259 --> 00:21:51,059
Do you still remember

304
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:55,453
the night we spent together under the tree

305
00:21:55,453 --> 00:21:59,019
two years ago?

306
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,740
No.

307
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:13,959
No?

308
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,240
How could you forget?

309
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,940
Hold on.

310
00:22:23,952 --> 00:22:26,140
- Where are you going? 
 - Wait for me.

311
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,039
What are you doing?

312
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,739
Let me ask you.

313
00:22:36,739 --> 00:22:40,660
Two years ago, what was your first impression of me?

314
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,060
First impression?

315
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:47,079
My heart was racing.

316
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:51,300
We were hanging on the cliff. Whose heart wouldn't be racing?

317
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,859
You?

318
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,980
It was different for me.

319
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,039
Were you not afraid?

320
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,559
I fell in love.

321
00:23:13,739 --> 00:23:16,379
To be honest, in the past two years or so,

322
00:23:16,379 --> 00:23:20,740
I often recalled what happened that night.

323
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,343
It was like playing a movie.

324
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,990
Right now, I still remember that evening,

325
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:33,270
the starry sky,

326
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:38,119
and also your smile under the starry sky.

327
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,080
You described everything in vivid detail.

328
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:03,359
It's been two years already.

329
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:07,479
After some time, you might come to realize

330
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:13,479
that it was just an insignificant moment over the course of our lives.

331
00:24:13,479 --> 00:24:18,440
But sometimes, a moment might be short,

332
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,680
but it's long enough to illuminate a lifetime.

333
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:50,499
You know what?

334
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,800
To me,

335
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:58,720
that night was such a moment.

336
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,450
♫  I need you, I love you  ♫

337
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:11,250
♫  I'll brave the waves for you  ♫

338
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:14,730
♫  You don't have to be brave all the time  ♫

339
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:19,760
♫  Please believe that I am by your side  ♫

340
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,300
♫  To embrace the fragility right in front of your eyes  ♫

341
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:27,860
♫  And hug you at the moment you feel like crying  ♫

342
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,140
♫  Ever and after  ♫

343
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,979
What are you doing?

344
00:25:55,979 --> 00:25:58,590
I... I...

345
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,260
I'm having a toothache.

346
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,639
Su Xieyi. Calm down.

347
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:12,420
Calm down.

348
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,619
Did he just confess to me?

349
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:20,960
Why did I run out of there?

350
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,739
Would he see that as a rejection?

351
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,540
Too sloppy.

352
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:51,259
He was so handsome.

353
00:26:51,259 --> 00:26:53,380
Truly handsome.

354
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,200
Su Xieyi. What are you doing?

355
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,380
Have you forgotten the reason you're here?

356
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,800
You came here to find Chen Hengsheng, not to find a partner.

357
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,839
 Su Xieyi. Su Xieyi.

358
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:13,779
No more toothache? Who are you talking to?

359
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:16,340
N-Nothing.

360
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,720
I'm using the washroom.

361
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:24,159
What's taking you so long?

362
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,119
I'm feeling sleepy already.

363
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:28,780
I'm going to wash up and go to bed.

364
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,480
So many excuses.

365
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:47,119
Hello?

366
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:50,819
Mr. Li, I've contacted the hospital.

367
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:52,440
How did they respond?

368
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,920
The hospital is happy with our charity proposal

369
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,960
because there are indeed too many families in need of funding.

370
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,640
That's great.

371
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,119
It's a good thing to be able to help more people in need.

372
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:05,599
Yes.

373
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:09,580
It's even better if we can get a few leads on Liu A'Wei.

374
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,259
You need to speed things up.

375
00:28:11,259 --> 00:28:12,759
Okay.

376
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,559
Chestnut, enjoy.

377
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:41,879
 Here's your coffee.

378
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:45,619
Miss Su, this is the sales table for the hotel's food and beverages.

379
00:28:45,619 --> 00:28:47,480
You may have a look.

380
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:51,219
The Auction Banquet is also a top priority.

381
00:28:51,219 --> 00:28:54,559
We need to pay attention to the food, and beverages served.

382
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,240
The sales table is a good reference.

383
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,240
You're right.

384
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,640

385
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:05,450

386
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,720
 You sure have a unique taste.

387
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,680
 That bottle of wine you picked is indeed a good wine.

388
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:17,319
 But unfortunately, it's a bad vintage.

389
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:22,020
Can I take this and show it to Director Li?

390
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,559
I'm sorry, Miss Su. This is internal information.

391
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,248
If Director Li wants to see it,

392
00:29:26,248 --> 00:29:29,234
I'll personally send it over for him to have a look.

393
00:29:34,178 --> 00:29:37,119
It's okay. I'll get some tissues.

394
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:48,659
Riesling is the best-selling wine in your hotel,

395
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:50,019
but you don't have it here?

396
00:29:50,019 --> 00:29:51,960
Yes, it is currently out of stock.

397
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,720
But I saw it in the lobby bar yesterday.

398
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,119
I'm not sure about that.

399
00:29:58,419 --> 00:29:59,919
Thank you.

400
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,380

401
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,100
 That's weird.

402
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,410
 Why can't I find the wine that I saw in the lobby bar?

403
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:26,279
I'm sorry, General Manager Chen.

404
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:29,679
Be careful.

405
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,079
- Is this the last box? 
 - Yes.

406
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:37,519
Remember. Be sure to clean it up.

407
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,039
Remember to lock the wine cellar before you leave.

408
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:43,309
- Yes, I understand. 
 - As for you, take two days off.

409
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:44,599
Thank you, General Manager Chen.

410
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:46,199
Go on.

411
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,760
Use the passage for freight handling. You hear me?

412
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,699
Okay, I get it.

413
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,960

414
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:06,100
General Manager Chen, you're here.

415
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,899
Miss Su, what are you doing here?

416
00:33:10,899 --> 00:33:14,920
I heard that Yunfeng's wine cellar contains a lot of good wines.

417
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,319
How can I not pay a visit?

418
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:21,559
We're honored by your visit, Miss Su.

419
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:24,519
But I wonder what kind of wine you'd like.

420
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:25,839
How about this?

421
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:30,519
I'll send someone to deliver the best wine to your room.

422
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,459
Pick a bottle of wine for Miss Su.

423
00:33:33,459 --> 00:33:34,680
Make sure it's the best.

424
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,780
- Send it over to Miss Su's room. 
 - Okay, I'll do it right away.

425
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,550
Hold on.

426
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:45,440
I heard that Yunfeng's best-selling white wine is called Riesling.

427
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,119
But I couldn't find it.

428
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:49,959
Why don't you lead the way?

429
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:51,400
We do have it.

430
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,119
But the price of the wine is awfully high.

431
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:56,599
So we rarely restock it.

432
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:00,000
It's out of stock now.

433
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,240
Well, what's in the box that you're holding?

434
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,019
No, Miss Su!

435
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,620
Didn't you say it was out of stock?

436
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,401
I must have remembered it wrong.

437
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,780
I'll take this then. Thank you.

438
00:34:31,939 --> 00:34:33,679
What do you mean by this?

439
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,679
Miss Su, don't get me wrong.

440
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,679
I think there is no need to bother you

441
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:42,359
with things like selecting a bottle of wine, right?

442
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:44,239
You're a busy man.

443
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,760
There's no need to trouble you with such a trivial matter.

444
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,320
Don't say that.

445
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,139
Given your status, you don't have to personally see to this.

446
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:57,199
Besides, no matter how busy I am, nothing is more important

447
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:00,060
than attending to Director Li.

448
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:04,159
I think I should personally pick a bottle of wine for you,

449
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:07,100
and have it delivered to your room later.

450
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,880
It's just a bottle of wine.

451
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,619
Are you such a miserly man?

452
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:20,560
Do you not trust me, the general manager of Yunfeng?

453
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,760
Xieyi.

454
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,919
What's taking you so long?

455
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:34,219
Director Li.

456
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:37,719
General Manager Chen, you're here as well.

457
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:41,779
Director Li, I was recommending the wine to Miss Su earlier.

458
00:35:41,779 --> 00:35:43,239
Come.

459
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:45,959
What wine?

460
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,540
I picked a bottle of wine.

461
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,539
But General Manager Chen doesn't seem to be willing to give it to me.

462
00:35:51,539 --> 00:35:52,639
Is it?

463
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:54,719
Don't get me wrong, Miss Su.

464
00:35:54,719 --> 00:36:00,480
But since Director Li is here, I'll just come clean with you.

465
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,459
This wine is indeed Yunfeng's best-selling wine.

466
00:36:04,459 --> 00:36:08,280
But there's a problem with our temperature control for this batch of wine.

467
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,480
So, the taste isn't as great.

468
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,960
I was thinking that I can't serve such a wine to Director Li.

469
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,760
So I was telling Miss Su earlier that I came to pick another type of wine,

470
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,599
and have it delivered to you later.

471
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:22,299
Okay.

472
00:36:23,059 --> 00:36:24,659
Let me see.

473
00:36:29,539 --> 00:36:31,274
Mr. Li! You...

474
00:36:31,274 --> 00:36:34,160
- Director Li, are you all right? 
 - I'm fine.

475
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:39,099
Didn't General Manager Chen say that the taste wasn't as great?

476
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:44,160
How about this? General Manager Chen, send a bottle of the finest wine to my room later.

477
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,699
Sure.

478
00:36:46,499 --> 00:36:48,099
Let's go.

479
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:12,219
You did that on purpose earlier. Why?

480
00:37:17,179 --> 00:37:19,380
What did you promise me?

481
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:26,139
This wine is my dad's favorite brand.

482
00:37:26,139 --> 00:37:28,880
I remember the logo on it very clearly.

483
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,940
As compared to the wine we saw in the wine cellar,

484
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:35,720
I'm positive that those were counterfeit wines.

485
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:37,840
So?

486
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:41,860
It means Chen Hengsheng is selling counterfeit wines.

487
00:37:43,659 --> 00:37:46,100
Chen Hengsheng is the General Manager of Yunfeng.

488
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,360
He has a well-established foundation in Yunfeng.

489
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,519
The preparation of the Fujiade Auction requires all the manpower,

490
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,879
and material resources of Yunfeng.

491
00:37:53,879 --> 00:37:57,065
No one is a better candidate than him for the time being.

492
00:37:57,065 --> 00:38:00,979
I know. I just wanted to find the dirt on him.

493
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:03,760
I told you I would continue to investigate Zhiwei.

494
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,559
And you promised you wouldn't interfere.

495
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:11,839
I know. But right now, the present is more important.

496
00:38:11,859 --> 00:38:14,440
The auction is very important to me.

497
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,960
The whole company has its eyes set on me.

498
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,679
I can't mess things up.

499
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:20,239
Are we going to just let things slide?

500
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:22,480
Of course not.

501
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,780
See for yourself.

502
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,440
For over a year, the police have been secretly investigating Chen Hengsheng.

503
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,320
I'm trying my best to provide evidence, and work with the police.

504
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,960
Is the evidence sufficient?

505
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,190
- That's right. 
 - This is great.

506
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:50,050
So, to catch the thief red-handed, the police are waiting for the right time.

507
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:55,000
This auction is the best opportunity.

508
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,480
I can't give it to you just yet.

509
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,820
When can you give it to me then?

510
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:09,119
After the auction is over, Cheng Hengsheng is going to be brought to justice.

511
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:13,820
The police will give you the answers to all your questions.

512
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,900
As for now, just relax and do your part as my assistant.

513
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,159
Leave the rest to me.

514
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:23,220
Promise?

515
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,720
Yes.

516
00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:32,119
All right. It's a deal then.

517
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,920
Nice working with you.

518
00:40:03,419 --> 00:40:06,639
I've managed to find out Su Xieyi's true identity.

519
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:10,760
She's actually the youngest daughter of Shen Zhihong, the chairman of Zhiwei Corporation.

520
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,280
She used her mother's last name and went abroad when she was ten.

521
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,800
So, not many people know her.

522
00:40:20,499 --> 00:40:22,979
So she's Shen Zhihong's daughter?

523
00:40:22,979 --> 00:40:25,700
That explains why she wanted to dig up the files on Zhiwei.

524
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:28,340
From the looks of it, her intention of getting into Ocean is pretty clear now,

525
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:31,760
which is to investigate the bankruptcy of Zhiwei.

526
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,139
But why is she with Li Zeliang?

527
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:43,559
The daughter of a bankrupt family suddenly showed up next to the enemy,

528
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:46,260
and became his girlfriend.

529
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:49,539
Don't you find that odd?

530
00:40:49,539 --> 00:40:52,120
Could she be seeking revenge?

531
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,579
It doesn't matter what she thinks.

532
00:40:54,579 --> 00:40:58,180
What matters is that her identity as Shen Zhihong's daughter

533
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,860
can be used to our advantage.

534
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:04,599
So you want to make use of that.

535
00:41:05,499 --> 00:41:10,920
Su Xieyi may just be the perfect pawn.

536
00:41:17,953 --> 00:41:20,960
There are only four waiters at the auction reception.

537
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,780
Not enough. We need to double the manpower.

538
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:26,840
There's not much variety for the pastries. Make it more lavish.

539
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,240
Okay.

540
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:31,220
How is it, Xieyi?

541
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:34,440
The preparations for the auction reception are basically ready.

542
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,320
Tomorrow, Chairman Huo will accompany the Romans to Yunfeng.

543
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,440
The invited guests will be arriving soon after.

544
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,639
Miss Su is very capable.

545
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:46,223
Everything is arranged in an orderly manner.

546
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:51,660
That's right. After the auction, I'll have to reward you.

547
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:54,699
General Manager Chen, be my witness.

548
00:41:54,699 --> 00:41:56,320
Of course.

549
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,920
It's been hard on you too, General Manager Chen.

550
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,439
Thank you for your support.

551
00:41:59,439 --> 00:42:02,459
Don't say that. Should you have any requests, don't hesitate to tell us.

552
00:42:02,459 --> 00:42:05,820
We'll do our best to cater to your needs.

553
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,220
All right.

554
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,820
I'll leave you be then.

555
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,273
I'm going to check up on the progress of the banquet.

556
00:42:12,273 --> 00:42:14,877
Director Li, I have to say.

557
00:42:14,877 --> 00:42:18,459
You have found yourself a really good partner.

558
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,179
Thank you for your hard work.

559
00:42:23,179 --> 00:42:24,856
This is nothing.

560
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,220
All right. Excuse me.

561
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:35,380
After the auction is over, don't forget what you promised me.

562
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,080
Don't worry.

563
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:40,345
Oh, right. As for the opening of the reception,

564
00:42:40,345 --> 00:42:43,380
you said that you've invited a very talented rock singer.

565
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,642
Which celebrity is that?

566
00:42:45,642 --> 00:42:46,979
You'll know when he gets here.

567
00:42:46,979 --> 00:42:50,480
Where is he now? He needs to rehearse in advance.

568
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:55,684
He should be here soon.

569
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,180
♫  Baby, I love you  ♫

570
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,880
♫  I feel you, I need you  ♫

571
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:06,990
♫  I want to be happy because of you  ♫

572
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:08,720
♫  I secretly blindfolded you  ♫

573
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,810
♫  I'll tell you where I am  ♫

574
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:17,310
♫  It's just you and I, forever  ♫

575
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:31,940

576
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:42,190
♫  Halfway through the journey on the train,  ♫

577
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:46,010
♫  a new passenger takes a seat  ♫

578
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:50,240
♫  The bells on the platform are ringing  ♫

579
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,710
♫  I wave my hands to see the passengers off  ♫

580
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:56,440
♫  With a one-way ticket stub in your hand  ♫

583
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,720
♫  But in my heart, I secretly ask  ♫

584
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,870
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

585

♫  How's it going with him?  ♫

586
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:14,260
♫  I bet his temper is better than mine  ♫

587
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:18,240
♫  He's better at guessing your complicated thoughts  ♫

588
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,140
♫  Does he hold you when you're sad?  ♫

589
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:24,020
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

590
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:25,750
♫  Everything must be going well  ♫

591
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:29,780
♫  Do you want to hear what I haven't said?  ♫

592
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:37,270
♫  Do lyrics of love songs stir up your emotions and recall all of our memories?  ♫

593
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:41,270
♫  It doesn't seem to be difficult  ♫

594
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:09,740
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

♫  How's it going with him?  ♫

596
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:15,390
♫  You and fate have not given me an answer  ♫

597
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:19,310
♫  The price of growing up is like a pile of bargaining chip  ♫

598
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:23,160
♫  The wager is who can let go first  ♫

599
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,910
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:26,890
♫  Everything must be going well  ♫

♫  Life is not as complicated as I thought  ♫

602
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:35,210
♫  Silence is the best that I can do  ♫

603
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:38,450
♫  Whatever pain and suffering may come,  ♫

604
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:41,990
♫  I'm not afraid at all  ♫

605
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:51,910
