00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:15,540

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:25,000
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,500
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

4
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:41,400
♫  And turn to face all the long lost times  ♫

5
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,400
♫  Brace the pain  ♫

6
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:51,200
♫  Let memories wake up from oceans deep  ♫

7
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,300
♫  No place to hide  ♫

8
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,400
♫  No way to run  ♫

9
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,800
♫  New dawn counts down  ♫

10
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,000
♫  I fight  ♫

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,100
♫  I cry  ♫

12
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,800
♫  I give up  ♫

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:15,600
♫  Memories forgotten, forsaken surround  ♫

14
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:24,000
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,400
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

16
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:40,900
♫  Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

17
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:49,700
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

18
00:01:49,700 --> 00:02:00,100

19
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,900

20
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,500
 This is strange.

21
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,600
Why would Huo Jian invite you to a badminton game? He knows you are...

22
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,800

23
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,070
Worthless fools!

24
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,100
The result from your Housekeeping Department is worse than dull.

25
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,000
How am I supposed to explain this to the shareholders?

26
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,600
I've been saving your neck for your father,

27
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,600
but you have learned nothing from your mistake.

28
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,500
You keep making the same mistakes!

29
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,900
I don't want to see you again.

30
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,300

31
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,400
- Mister, I'm terribly sorry. 
 - What's wrong with you people?

32
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,000
I booked a room at your official website. Now you're telling me there's someone in my room?

33
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,100
Outrageous! I was sleeping in my room when someone came knocking on the door.

34
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,700
I opened up, and he said it is his room. Do your job! Two customers can't have the same room–

35
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,300
I'm terribly sorry. I am in charge of the Housekeeping Department, the deputy general manager's secretary.

36
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,800
My surname is Lin. Regarding your accommodation, I can resolve it.

37
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,400
Again.

38
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,000
Chairman Huo, we will do better this time.

39
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,700
Silence!

40
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,000
Reflect on your mistakes.

41
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,600
Zeliang, how many times have I told you?

42
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,500
Stay away from alcohol and games.

43
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,500
Now, you can't even catch the ball I pass.

44
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,600
You don't even act like the deputy general manager.

45
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,000
Mr. Li, let's stop.

46
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,300
I'm fine.

47
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Uncle, since you're in the mood for a game today,

48
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,300
I can't let myself be the spoilsport.

49
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,100
Uncle, don't worry. I'll be fine.

50
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,030

51
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,000

52
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,500
Secretary Lin, how did it go?

53
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,500
Come to my office.

54
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,500
I told you we are in peak season.

55
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,900
I told you to reserve all the rooms.

56
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,600
Why did you allow online bookings?

57
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:52,100
 But I was worried if the rooms of an entire floor weren't available to be booked online, it'd be too suspicious.

58
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,500
What are you worried about? I'm in charge of this matter.

59
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,400
Do you know how much money a room can make during the entire peak season?

60
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,800
Yes, so what should we do next?

61
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,900
It's not too big of an issue.

62
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:10,000
The customer who booked a room on our website didn't get his room, so he's very upset right now.

63
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,200
 I'll apologize to the customer later.

64
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,400
 I'll be more careful next time.

65
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:21,500
I was told that Li would be back soon. You need to be more careful.

66
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,300
I will.

67
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,900
Mr. Li, let's call it a day.

68
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,200
Zeliang.

69
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,800
You might think my way is too stern,

70
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,200
but it wasn't easy for your father to build this company.

71
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,080
It took him over 20 years to nurture Ocean Hotels from a no-name company

72
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,300
to the giant firm it is today.

73
00:07:54,500 --> 00:08:01,300
So remember, Ocean Hotels belongs to the Li family, not the Huo family.

74
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,800
I am merely a steward taking care of it.

75
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,900
This responsibility will eventually become yours to bear.

76
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,700
You're right, Uncle.

77
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,200
Chairman Huo, we need your signature on this document.

78
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,000
Clean up the mess.

79
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,500
Come with me to the headquarters.

80
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,800
Okay.

81
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,600
 Return to your work and delete all the contact records and documents.

82
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
 Yes.

83
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,200
Go on.

84
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,700
Are you looking for someone?

85
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,700
Hello, I'm here for the interview, but I can't seem to find my way there.

86
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,200
Is this the place?

87
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,700

88
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,800
Follow this path and turn left in the Pantry. Then go to the second floor.

89
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,570
Thanks.

90
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,600

91
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,200
May I take a seat here?

92
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,100
Welcome, Chairman Huo.

93
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,600
Chairman Huo, you're finally back.

94
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,800
Secretary Lin, Li Zeliang has returned to our company.

95
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,600
Chairman Huo, I assure you I will keep an eye on that boy.

96
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,700
You'll get all the updates firsthand.

97
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,200
From what I heard,

98
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,800
the booking system of our hotel has run into some issues.

99
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,000
Are you aware of the matter?

100
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,200
I'm resolving it as we speak.

101
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,700
Why do you look so nervous?

102
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:56,000
Just make sure you carry out my orders.

103
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,800
As for the booking system, take your time with it.

104
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,600
I understand.

105
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,000
Go on.

106
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,800
Yes.

107
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,800
Why do you choose to bring that kid from the Li family back now?

108
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,600
A worthless prince is still a prince nonetheless.

109
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,000
Many of the shareholders are elders of the Li family.

110
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,300
As soon as they learned Li Ze Liang's condition had improved,

111
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,600
they've been asking for him to come back to work.

112
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,700
I was told they planned to leave Yunfeng in his care.

113
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,600
Director Li,

114
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,400
this is the Housekeeping Department's sales report for the past six months.

115
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,500
You have just returned to work, so it's better to have a grasp of the company.

116
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,600
Leave it on the desk. I'll read it later.

117
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,800
I was told the Housekeeping Department had received many complaints.

118
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,000
What is going on?

119
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,400
It's said that the booking system ran into some problems,

120
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,200
but it could also be some errors from the Housekeeping Department.

121
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,400
It could also be some errors from the Networking Department.

122
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,100
Is that so? Are the problems resolved?

123
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,200
We reported it to Chairman Huo.

124
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,800
If there's nothing, I should get back to my work.

125
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,070

126
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,190
Yunfeng Hotel was built on the foundation of Zhiwei Building

127
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,000
and expanded upon it.

128
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,200
Li Zeliang has been in charge of the Zhiwei Building project.

129
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,200
It's normal if people view it that way.

130
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,000
If you hadn't made him hand over the project years ago,

131
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,600
Yunfeng Hotel wouldn't even exist.

132
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,000
I told you time and time again.

133
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,800
Do not bring up the past.

134
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,600
I'm doing this

135
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,600
because I have my reasons.

136
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,400
I brought Li Zeling back

137
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,800
and assigned him a position in the company

138
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:22,000
because I want those elders to shut up.

139
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,200
Furthermore, putting him where I can see him

140
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,300
makes our work a lot easier.

141
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,800
You're right.

142
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:58,000

143
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,600

144
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,900

145
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,200
 I'm living in the house you lived in when you first came to Shanghai.

146
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,500
 You once told me

147
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:05,700
 you moved all the furniture from the old house here.

148
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,200
 Now, I'm back to this house,

149
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,800
 but you've left me forever.

150
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000

151
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,700
Mr. Li, Dr. Wu just called. Your new prescription is ready.

152
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,400
I can go get it anytime.

153
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,200
He advised you to have one or two massages every week.

154
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,760
Have you considered letting Secretary Lin, the secretary...

155
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,800
He can stay for now.

156
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,000
Very well.

157
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,600
 Are we going to the usual place?

158
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,300
 Yes.

159
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,598
Welcome, Director Li.

160
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,600
- Here's the wine you reserved. 
 - Thanks.

161
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,000
Where is Oscar?

162
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,200
He has a performance.

163
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,600
He actually got a job.

164
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
What a miracle.

165
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,400
 Dad, I will investigate

166
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
 everyone who was connected to him.

167
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,400
 I will find the contract that framed you.

168
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,900

169
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,758
 As your new chairman for Ocean Hotels,

170
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,600
 I will lead Ocean Hotels to even greater heights!

171
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,970

172
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,800
 He showed up.

173
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,600

174
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,300
I can still drink!

175
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,400
Forget it.

176
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,100
Be careful.

177
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
I need more wine.

178
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,000
♫  I don't know how to win your heart  ♫

179
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
♫  I don't know how to be the one for you  ♫

180
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
♫  To be good enough for you  ♫

181
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,200
♫  But you're just like a distant star  ♫

182
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,000
♫  Looking so close but yet so far  ♫

183
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,800
♫  I need to stop, I need to give you up  ♫

184
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,600
♫  Before my heart comes apart  ♫

185
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,200
Hello, Miss. May I take your order?

186
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,100
- I'll have a mocktail. 
 - Sure, in a moment.

187
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:18,300
♫  In your circle of love  ♫

188
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,890
Where have you been?

189
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,100
Excuse me. I think you mistake me for someone.

190
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,800
Sorry, Handsome. Where is the restroom?

191
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,400
Over there.

192
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,600
Thanks a lot, Handsome.

193
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,500
Friend, do you know who that woman is?

194
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,300
Sorry, I don't know her.

195
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,600
Then why did you hug her?

196
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,200
She is my wife.

197
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,800
She's drunk and asked for directions to the restroom.

198
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,100
You're not getting away after hugging my girl!

199
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,000
Sorry.

200
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,800
What are you staring at?

201
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:47,000
Did you just fall in love or something? What? Are you two ignoring me?

202
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,800
Is she your girlfriend?

203
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,370
She's a pretty one.

204
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:58,700
Let's have a drink together, then I'll let this slide. How does that sound?

205
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,600
Excuse me, I have no idea who he is.

206
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,500
Besides, it was your girl who hugged him first.

207
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:11,400
Sticking up for your boyfriend? You're quite a talker for a girl.

208
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,800
I bet you can hold your drink.

209
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,100
Show some respect.

210
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,200
What now?

211
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,500
Do you want a fight?

212
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,200
Go!

213
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,460
Where are you going?

214
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,400
Wait! Where are you going?

215
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,000
That woman used pepper spray on me! I'll make her pay!

216
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,700
See?

217
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,700
He's a living example of having the brawn but not the brain.

218
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,500
What are you staring at?

219
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,300
Were you the girl from back then?

220
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,600
Back then? What do you mean?

221
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,600
My memory is bad. I've forgotten a lot of things.

222
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,200
Do you like camping?

223
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,100
Have you watched a sunrise from the mountaintop?

224
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:10,200
Watching a sunrise is too childish. It's not my cup of tea.

225
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,200
It's more practical to just sleep soundly in bed.

226
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,000
Camping is out of the question.

227
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,600
What? Is this how you pick up girls?

228
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,300
You can at least be more creative.

229
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,000
Take off your clothes.

230
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,000
I need to borrow them.

231
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,200
Thanks.

232
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,600

(T/N: used for Alzheimer's disease and rheumatoid arthritis)

233
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,200
Are you going to watch me get changed?

234
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,500
Sorry.

235
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,200
I'll pay for your shirt.

236
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,800
It's 85, 62, and 86.

237
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,300
What is that?

238
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,600
It's my measurements. Aren't you buying me a new shirt?

239
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:13,400
Well... I saw a bottle of pills inside the car.

240
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,900
Are you not feeling well?

241
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,400
 Yes. I have dissociative amnesia.

242
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,900
 I ran into some bad situations a few years ago. I'm still recovering.

243
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,500
How are you doing?

244
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,100
 There are many things I can't remember.

245
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,900
 However, after giving it some thought,

246
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,600
 I forgot a lot of unpleasant memories as well.

247
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,800
 That makes me feel much better.

248
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,000
Here.

249
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,900
I doubt they are coming back.

250
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,800
What? Are you feeling attached to this place?

251
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,200
Seeing you're a handsome one,

252
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,700
I could give you a free ride home.

253
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,000
Never mind.

254
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,200
This is my business card.

255
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,000
Thank you for helping me out just now.

256
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000

257
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,600
Ocean Hotels?

258
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,100
What's wrong?

259
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,000
I majored in hotel management.

260
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,200
Ocean Hotels is the first choice in my job hunting. It's the Number One.

261
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,000
Consider this an IOU you gave me.

262
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,600
Wait.

263
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,500
May I know your name?

264
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,200
Su Xieyi.

265
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,800

266
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,800
 Let go!

267
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,100
 Don't let go!

268
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,800
 Hang on tight to me!

269
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,200
 Don't be afraid.

270
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,200
 I'll pull you up. Hang in there.

271
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,000
 One,

272
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,800
 two,

273
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,500
 three!

274
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,300
 Hurry!

275
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:55,000

276
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,700
 Can you read this? It says "Rock Climbing Peak."

277
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,000
 This is the famous rock-climbing spot for the enthusiasts.

278
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,400
 Were you out of your mind?

279
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,800
 Why did you poke around with the stick?

280
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,000
 Who would poke a man off the cliff with a stick?

281
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,600
 Speaking of yourself.

282
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,200
 Look over here.

283
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,900
 What does it say?

284
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,500
 "Beware of wild hogs."

285
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,600
 Is there some kind of fetish among the rock-climbing enthusiasts?

286
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,500
 Do you love a spot where wild hogs are around?

287
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,700
 You mistook me for a wild hog.

288
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,900
 What's wrong?

289
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 It's nothing. I get a toothache when I get angry.

290
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,200
 I have some painkillers. You can have some.

291
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,600
 Never mind.

292
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,200
 It'll get better in a while.

293
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,700
 Are you sure?

294
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:56,700
 Well... Although it was your fault for almost dragging me down from the cliff,

295
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,100
 I poked you with the stick, so we are even now.

296
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,500
 We should steer clear of each other from now on.

297
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,300
 Steering clear of each other?

298
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,000
 What's wrong?

299
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,200
 There is something under the blanket.

300
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,300
 Stay still.

301
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,800
 Be careful. It could be a rat.

302
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:39,500
 It's not a rat. It's a small hedgehog.

303
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,400
 See? Isn't it cute?

304
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,700
 A hedgehog! It's so adorable!

305
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,300
 Don't touch it!

306
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,700
 Does it hurt?

307
00:32:58,490 --> 00:32:59,600
 I'm all right.

308
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,500
 Put a band-aid on it.

309
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,400
 Disinfect it. Come on.

310
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,100
 It's done.

311
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,400
 - Thanks. 
 - Don't mention it.

312
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 Little hedgehog, you're so cute.

313
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,200
 You look like a spiky little ball.

314
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,000
 Why are you here all by yourself?

315
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,300
 Why are you here camping by yourself?

316
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,600
 I just came back to China, so I don't have many friends.

317
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,000
 Are you cold?

318
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,200
 The night can be freezing up here.

319
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,600
 Maybe you could stay with me.

320
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,900
 Maybe I could keep your company.

321
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,500
 Don't get me wrong.

322
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:03,400
 You just mentioned there were a lot of wild hogs, dingos,

323
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,700
 and even snakes in the area.

324
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,300
 Of course, I hope we're safe here.

325
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,100
 It's up to you.

326
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,600
 See you.

327
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,500
 Do you know the "Shoot the Star Trail"?

328
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,900
 Certainly.

329
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,800
 Allow me to introduce myself, I'm Li Zeliang.

330
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,300
 What about you?

331
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,600
 You can call me Xiao Yi.

332
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,300
Su Xieyi...

333
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,900
Xiao Yi...

334
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,500
- Hello? 
 - Hello.

335
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,200
Miss? Where are you?

336
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,400
Are you coming back or not?

337
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,600
Don't worry. I'll wire you the payment.

338
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,720

339
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,620

340
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,200

341
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,100
 Hello? Uncle Gong?

342
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,700
 Hello? Your father is in trouble!

343
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,700
 I didn't catch that.

344
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,000
 Your father is in trouble!

345
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,400
 Where is he now?

346
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,400
 At Huo Jian's place!

347
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,700
 The patient has been diagnosed with dissociative amnesia.

348
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,800
 She will selectively forget certain parts of her life.

349
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,600
 During her rehab, the family must pay close attention to her mental health.

350
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,500
 Li Zeliang.

351
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,600
 Which one is the real you?

352
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,300
Chestnut, do you remember you once startled Xiao Yi a few years ago?

353
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,200

354
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,100
Are you hungry?

355
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,700
Do you want some food?

356
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,200
All you care about is eating.

357
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,600
Fine.

358
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,200
You can eat all you want.

359
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:56,000
♫  I need you, I love you  ♫

360
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,800
♫  I'll brave the waves for you  ♫

361
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,100
♫  Don't need to act tough.  ♫

362
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:09,000
♫  Believe me I'll be by your side  ♫

363
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,600
♫  Ever and after  ♫

364
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:24,000

365
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,800
♫  Halfway through the journey on the train,  ♫

366
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,600
♫  a new passenger takes a seat  ♫

367
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,800
♫  The bells on the platform are ringing  ♫

368
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,200
♫  I wave my hands to see the passengers off  ♫

369
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,000
♫  With a one-way ticket stub in your hand  ♫

370
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,800
♫  you've embarked on a journey to happiness  ♫

371
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,200
♫  I didn't save your contact information  ♫

372
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,400
♫  But in my heart, I secretly ask  ♫

373
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,400
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

374
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,200
♫  How's it going with him?  ♫

375
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,000
♫  I bet his temper is better than mine  ♫

376
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,800
♫  He's better at guessing your complicated thoughts  ♫

377
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,600
♫  Does he hold you when you're sad?  ♫

378
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,600
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

379
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,500
♫  Everything must be going well  ♫

380
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,400
♫  Do you want to hear what I haven't said?  ♫

381
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:29,800
♫  Do lyrics of love songs stir up your emotions and recall all of our memories?  ♫

382
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,200
♫  It doesn't seem to be difficult  ♫

383
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,300
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

384
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,200
♫  How's it going with him?  ♫

385
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,900
♫  You and fate have not given me an answer  ♫

386
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:11,800
♫  The price of growing up is like a pile of bargaining chip  ♫

387
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,600
♫  The wager is who can let go first  ♫

388
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,600
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

389
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,400
♫  Everything must be going well  ♫

390
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,700
♫  Life is not as complicated as I thought  ♫

391
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:27,800
♫  Silence is the best that I can do  ♫

392
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,000
♫  Whatever pain and suffering may come,  ♫

393
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
♫  I'm not afraid at all  ♫

394
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:44,520
