00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000

2
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:25,200
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

3
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:33,600
♫  Still haunts me now and then in quiet nights  ♫

4
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:41,500
♫  And turn to face all the long lost times  ♫

5
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,300
♫  Brace the pain  ♫

6
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:51,200
♫  Let memories wake up from oceans deep  ♫

7
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,400
♫  No place to hide  ♫

8
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,400
♫  No way to run  ♫

9
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,900
♫  New dawn counts down  ♫

10
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,000
♫  I fight  ♫

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,100
♫  I cry  ♫

12
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,200
♫  I give up  ♫

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:15,800
♫  Memories forgotten, forsaken surround  ♫

14
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:24,200
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

15
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:32,600
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

16
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:41,000
♫  Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:50,000
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,200

19
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,900

20
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,500
Here, your coffee.

21
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,900
Thanks.

22
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,300
Mingyue, your coffee.

23
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,000
Thanks.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,600
Xiao Shu, have some coffee.

25
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,000
Thanks.

26
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,900
Mei, your coffee.

27
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,300
Thank you.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,600
So who told you to do that?

29
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,300
What do you mean whom?

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,600
The coffee.

31
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,200
I just started here.

32
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,000
Buying everyone coffee is normal, isn't it?

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,560
What I'm saying is that this office may look harmonious,

34
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,200
but it's full of landmines.

35
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:54,160
Even though you're just being courteous here,

36
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,500
some sensitive people might think that you're boot-licking.

37
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,300
I see.

38
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,900
Oh, right, I need to ask you something.

39
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,000
This is a completed contract left by the previous secretary.

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,479
How should I deal with it?

41
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:12,300
Should I shred it or...

42
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,500
This contract is not due for discarding, so you should keep it in the archive.

43
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,700
Archive?

44
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,000
I thought people just kept a digital copy nowadays.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,500
Why do we have an archive here?

46
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,400
You see, in this office, we have a rule that all contracts should have a soft copy,

47
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,500
but the original copy will also be kept until it's deemed fit to be discarded away.

48
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,200
Just in case. Understand?

49
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,200
The badge to enter the archive must be in the possession of someone important.

50
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,700
Check this out.

51
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,800

52
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,100
Welcome to the archive.

53
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,300
These are all hard copies.

54
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:11,800
If Director Li needs to consult any document or contract, let me know.

55
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,520
I'll keep a record before passing the document to you.

56
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,400
So every contract is kept here?

57
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,500
Yes. Although we will eventually store them in our computers,

58
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,600
the contracts from the last five years are not ready to be disposed of now.

59
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,700
We can't leave everything in the Legal Department either. It'll clog things up.

60
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,600
Look. This row is for the contracts from the last five years.

61
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,300

62
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,400
What are you looking for?

63
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,000
I was thinking about how you have access to somewhere important like this.

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,200
- You must be very capable. 
 - Of course.

65
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,500
Let's go. Let's go.

66
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,600
Are you still looking at your phone? We have a meeting soon.

67
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,700
All right. I know.

68
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,600
Hurry up.

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,400
Sorry.

70
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,200
I'm so sorry.

71
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,600
Sorry. Perhaps I can clean your shirt right now?

72
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
It's fine.

73
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,000
Watch where you go next time.

74
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,500
Mr. Li, the clothes are here.

75
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,900
Thanks.

76
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,600
Are they for a client?

77
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,200
No.

78
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,900
I stained my friend's clothes earlier on.

79
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,900
I promised to clean it for her.

80
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,100
Mr. Li, I notice that you smile more often now.

81
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,800
Do I?

82
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,200
No. More precisely, you never smiled.

83
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,400
Isn't smiling a kind of disguise?

84
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,500
Right.

85
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,000
You're so right.

86
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:28,400
Yingsong, shouldn't you focus on the task I gave you?

87
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,300
Do you have nothing to do now?

88
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,500
I'll go back to my work now.

89
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,000
Wait.

90
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,900
Bring Su Xieyi here.

91
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,400
Okay.

92
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,000
I'll smile as much as I like.

93
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,600
Come in.

94
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,200
Mr. Li, are you looking for me?

95
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:12,900
As my personal assistant, I need to brief you about some of my habits.

96
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,300
I am a germophobe.

97
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:21,500
I want you to clean my office the first thing when you start your day.

98
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,900
Look.

99
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,000
The desk is dirty.

100
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,600
Dust is all over the cup lid.

101
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,300
This is bad.

102
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:34,000
Miss Su, I expect you to give me a spotless working environment.

103
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,500
Sorry, Mr. Li.

104
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,500
I will let the janitor do it.

105
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,900
This is not within my job scope.

106
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,800
Well, it's not compulsory.

107
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,000
You don't need to do this.

108
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,800
But making me coffee should be fine, right?

109
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,000
Mr. Li. Sorry.

110
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,200
I will do my job, but anything outside my job

111
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,800
will depend on my free time and on my mood.

112
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,600
Su Xieyi, mind your manner.

113
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,900
This is my office, not your house.

114
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,300
I am your boss.

115
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,100
Choose your words wisely when you're talking to your boss.

116
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:18,200
Mr. Li, you play an important role here.

117
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,500
You're like the pillar of Ocean Hotel.

118
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,000
As a newcomer, I still lack the experience to fill this position.

119
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,900
Therefore, I should probably head back to the General Manager's Office to learn from my seniors.

120
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:34,099
Su Xieyi, remember what you said yesterday?

121
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:37,300
You said you wanted to work hard and stay here.

122
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,000
Yes, I did say I'd work hard to stay in Ocean Hotel.

123
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,900
But I didn't say I had to stay by your side, Director Li.

124
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
Okay.

125
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,500
Brilliant.

126
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,100
I like people who acknowledge their strengths and weaknesses.

127
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Hello, is this HR?

128
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,500
Su Xieyi is not suitable to be my assistant.

129
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,600
I don't need her in my office anymore.

130
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,300
Thanks, Director Li.

131
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,400
I'll leave then.

132
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
Darn you, Su Xieyi.

133
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,200

134
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,200
Hi, Chuchu.

135
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,900
I'm back.

136
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,000
 You must have worked very hard.

137
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,600
We haven't seen each other for two months and that's all you got?

138
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,000
 Show some sincerity, at least.

139
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,700
How can I show my sincerity then?

140
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,300
Wait for me in the office.

141
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,200
I'll be there soon.

142
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:03,459
All right. I'll be waiting for you.

143
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:05,059
Director Shi, are we heading to your home?

144
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:07,160
- No, to Ocean Hotel. 
 - Okay.

145
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:14,659

146
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:19,179
If a woman could be like Director Shi, it'd be perfect.

147
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:23,159
She has the look, the family background, the mannerism, and the career.

148
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:24,959
She aced in all of them.

149
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,559
I heard she's the heiress of Hengye Bank?

150
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,020
Yes.

151
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:35,740
Hengye Bank is the main investor of our company.

152
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,300
Back then, when Director Li was executing the mergers and acquisitions with Zhiwei,

153
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,380
the Shi Family gave their full support.

154
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,410
Just so you know, when Director Shi is here,

155
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,320
walk forward and show your enthusiasm.

156
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,960
Yes, Sister Mingyue. Thank you for the tips.

157
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,779
Have this fruit juice. Here.

158
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:58,799
You're so sweet.

159
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:01,420
Why? You... No... Tissue paper, please.

160
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,620
Here.

161
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,079
Look.

162
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:07,500
I'm all drenched now. What should I do?

163
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,100
There's a hand dryer in the toilet.

164
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,280
I'll dry it then. So clumsy.

165
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,340
Director Shi will be here soon.

166
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,960
A heartfelt welcome to Director Shi.

167
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,200

168
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,800
Thank you.

169
00:11:52,619 --> 00:11:55,080
- Where's Su Xieyi? - I don't know.

170
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:02,050

171
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,170

172
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,450

173
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,620

174
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,220

175
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,850

176
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,200

Chen Hengsheng?

177
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,840
 Not Li Zeliang?

178
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,950

179
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,020

180
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:41,559
Chuchu, you have contributed a lot to Ocean Hotel.

181
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:48,019
The initial goal we set was to strike five partnership deals with five 5-star hotels.

182
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:51,250
But Miss Shi signed with eight 5-star hotels,

183
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,950
and they are all the best hotels in their respective region.

184
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,719
It's also thanks to the company for trusting me and for giving me their support.

185
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:06,619
That's how I could finish this mission successfully.

186
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:08,980
Chuchu. Knowing your talent,

187
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,419
keeping you in the General Manager's Office is a gross injustice.

188
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:14,359
We should let you expand our business to the foreign market.

189
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:16,619
Yes. If Director Shi is leading us,

190
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:21,480
I believe it won't be long until Ocean Hotel gets on the international stage.

191
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,720
I appreciate your faith in me

192
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,279
but instead of being assigned to the Marketing Department,

193
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:29,799
I'd rather stay here to be with my family.

194
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,419
Well said.

195
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:33,379
Family always comes first.

196
00:17:33,379 --> 00:17:35,860
Also, how fares Mrs. Shi?

197
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,359
I haven't seen him in a long time.

198
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,720
My father is doing great.

199
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,840
- Thank you for your concern. 
 - Good.

200
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:47,479
Where's Zeliang?

201
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:50,359
That man... Today is the occasion to celebrate your return.

202
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:52,319
How can he be absent?

203
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:54,839
He said he'd wait for me in his office.

204
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,520
Oh?

205
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:01,100
Chairman Huo, it's still office hours now.

206
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,939
Let's make it brief so everyone can resume working soon.

207
00:18:04,939 --> 00:18:06,000
Okay.

208
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,900
You're the star today. You decide.

209
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,200
Go back to your work now.

210
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,480
Where's my badge?

211
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,519
I put it here.

212
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:33,219
Where's my badge?

213
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,260
Xieyi, where were you just now?

214
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,500
The celebration is over. Where were you?

215
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
I had some work to do just now.

216
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,620
I went to deliver something.

217
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,320
Director Shi has come back, and you still shirk on your duty?

218
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,839
Don't tell anyone.

219
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:59,300
I'll buy you a meal.

220
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:02,500
Smart.

221
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,980
Have you seen my badge?

222
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,100
I put it here just now. I can't find it anywhere.

223
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:11,499
Where did I put it?

224
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,459
Isn't it here?

225
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:19,340
It was on the floor. Did you look underneath?

226
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:22,699
I did.

227
00:19:22,699 --> 00:19:23,880
Thanks.

228
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,860
I was so scared.

229
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:28,879
Where are you going?

230
00:19:29,499 --> 00:19:32,559
To buy some water. Do you want some?

231
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,619
No, thanks.

232
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,800

233
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,039
Chairman.

234
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,759
You're the assistant who came to Zeliang

235
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:03,759
last night to ask him to sign some documents?

236
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:04,860
Yes.

237
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,199
You have a good memory, Sir.

238
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:11,800
It was so late, but he still asked you to work nonetheless.

239
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,000
It's rare to see him so dedicated to his work.

240
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,340
It's mainly due to my lack of experience.

241
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,420
I overlooked something during the day

242
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:25,060
so I had to bother Director Li at night.

243
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:31,340
My nephew's house is like a fort.

244
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,100
He never allows any outsider in.

245
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,900
But last night, he let you in.

246
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,760
It seems like you're very special to him.

247
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,459
I'm new here, so I'm not familiar with everything.

248
00:20:41,459 --> 00:20:43,300
It seems like I made a mistake.

249
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,680
I will take note of it now.

250
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:51,400
Miss Su, are you interested in working under me?

251
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,340
What?

252
00:20:54,300 --> 00:21:00,119
I was just thinking that you're so hardworking and responsible.

253
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:04,240
I admire... people like you.

254
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,619
You flatter me, Chairman.

255
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:09,300
I'm still new.

256
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,919
I'm lacking in many aspects.

257
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:12,979
I need more training.

258
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:16,480
I still have work to do. I should head back.

259
00:21:29,699 --> 00:21:32,980
Su Xieyi. She was diagnosed with dissociative amnesia two years ago.

260
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,960
She was then treated in Germany.

261
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,020
What's fishy is that any info about her in China has been erased.

262
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,480
I'm not sure if it's because she's not been in China for a long time,

263
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,119
or if someone tinkered with her info.

264
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:48,620
I just can't find anything or anyone that can tell us more about her.

265
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:53,339
Also, I noticed that she snuck into the archive just now.

266
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,200

267
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:02,700
 She flipped through the contract we signed with Zhiwei back then.

268
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,699
Amnesia?

269
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:08,559
Zhiwei?

270
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,420
Interesting.

271
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:16,980
Chuchu? You're here.

272
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,060
Where were you?

273
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,340
Didn't you say you'd meet me in the office?

274
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,699
I paid Uncle Bai a visit.

275
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:31,960
Sorry, Miss Chuchu, for not being able to attend your welcome party.

276
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,460
Come on. We've been friends for many years.

277
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:38,119
If I hold you accountable for every mistake, I'll have high blood pressure now.

278
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:40,620
Oh, I brought you a present.

279
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,380
Swedish delicacies. Only for you.

280
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,739
Thanks.

281
00:23:47,739 --> 00:23:52,019
Haven't I told you not to bring me souvenirs every time you travel?

282
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:55,839
But I have also told you that whenever I visit a city or a country,

283
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:59,580
I will bring you a souvenir.

284
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:01,759
Right.

285
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:05,079
Ever since you graduated from the university,

286
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:07,079
you have never broken that promise.

287
00:24:07,699 --> 00:24:11,979
I gave you my word, so I'll do my best to uphold it.

288
00:24:23,259 --> 00:24:25,359
Mingyue, why are you standing there?

289
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:27,219
Good timing, Xieyi.

290
00:24:27,219 --> 00:24:28,919
This is the Earl Grey tea that Director Shi loves the most.

291
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:30,799
I have added the milk and the sugar.

292
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,279
- You can bring this to her. 
 - Why me?

293
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,440
Offering tea to these two important people is a rare chance.

294
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,540
Take this.

295
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,060
Why would you hand this opportunity to me?

296
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:44,019
When Director Li entered the office, he was sulking.

297
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:46,819
- So I– 
 - So you want me to do it?

298
00:24:47,499 --> 00:24:50,479
Aren't you Director Li's personal assistant? Time to prove yourself.

299
00:24:50,479 --> 00:24:52,219
I already quit.

300
00:24:52,219 --> 00:24:53,939
HR hasn't approved.

301
00:24:53,939 --> 00:24:56,599
Here. Take this.

302
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:58,199
Take it.

303
00:25:00,219 --> 00:25:01,919
Go.

304
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,380
Good luck.

305
00:25:08,219 --> 00:25:10,760
Director Li. Director Shi.

306
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,079
New staff from the General Manager's Office?

307
00:25:16,699 --> 00:25:19,219
I'm Director Li's temporary assistant.

308
00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:22,160
Former temporary assistant.

309
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,659
Miss Su, we only worked together for less than two days.

310
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:27,559
Please use the appropriate term.

311
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,259
Sure.

312
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,799
You can leave now.

313
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,939
I just want to serve tea to my superior.

314
00:25:38,939 --> 00:25:41,699
But I'm not your superior, am I?

315
00:25:41,699 --> 00:25:43,959
I'm referring to Director Shi.

316
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:59,199
Hi, Director Shi. I'm Su Xieyi.

317
00:25:59,199 --> 00:26:01,419
I just started in the General Manager's Office.

318
00:26:01,419 --> 00:26:04,219
Nice to meet you.

319
00:26:04,219 --> 00:26:06,280
Thanks, Director Shi.

320
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,860
If there's nothing else, I'll leave then.

321
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,820
Enjoy.

322
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,220
Okay.

323
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,020
It's just a new staff.

324
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,520
How did she cross you?

325
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,659
Her existence crossed me.

326
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:28,380
When did you learn to throw a tantrum?

327
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,820
Yes, Yingsong?

328
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:51,300
 Mr. Li, I have some updates regarding the task you gave me.

329
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,000
Wait for me.

330
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:57,999
Chuchu, Yingsong wants to talk to me.

331
00:26:57,999 --> 00:26:59,459
Give me a moment.

332
00:26:59,459 --> 00:27:00,859
Okay.

333
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:04,719
Enjoy the tea.

334
00:27:04,719 --> 00:27:07,180
- Come back soon. 
 - Okay.

335
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,860
So what is it?

336
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:20,819
Xie Minghao has returned. He has founded a Law Firm.

337
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:22,380
Is that so?

338
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,359
Great.

339
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,540
Do you wish to meet him?

340
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,820
Yes.

341
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:32,000
I want to meet everyone who contacted my father before he passed away.

342
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,720
When?

343
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,959
- Now. 
 - Okay.

344
00:28:13,699 --> 00:28:17,639
Acting cool and aloof, but you still prepared a secret gift for me.

345
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:30,739
 Returning your clothes.

346
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,620
 Sorry, I have an emergency.

347
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,980
 Let's hang out again next time.

348
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,319
This is the place, Mr. Li.

349
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:03,619
Wait for me in the parking lot.

350
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:21,399
Lawyer Xie, there's a Mr. Li waiting for you inside.

351
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:23,280
Mr. Li?

352
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,919
Okay, I got.

353
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:26,519
All right.

354
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,480
Pardon me for asking.

355
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,350
You are...

356
00:29:53,979 --> 00:29:56,540
The son of Li Kuohai, Li Zeliang.

357
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,319
The son of an old friend.

358
00:29:58,319 --> 00:29:59,919
Come, have a seat.

359
00:30:04,979 --> 00:30:09,580
Mr. Xie, sorry for the sudden visit, but I have something to ask you.

360
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,000
Go ahead.

361
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,100
The day when my dad passed away, were you in the hospital?

362
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,900
Did you meet him?

363
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,980
It's more like I arrived after he passed away.

364
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,580
Don't get me wrong.

365
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,620
I'm not suspecting you of anything.

366
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,930
I know when you arrived,

367
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:30,599
my father had been pronounced dead.

368
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:35,780
Yes. I was representing Zhiwei to negotiate the partnership deal with him.

369
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:40,580
Unfortunately, when I arrived, Elder Li has already passed away.

370
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:44,680
Mr. Xie, I just want to know when you arrived at the hospital,

371
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,979
did you see something or someone noteworthy?

372
00:30:48,979 --> 00:30:52,540
When I arrived, I just saw doctors hustling around.

373
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:57,059
Other than that, nothing out of the ordinary.

374
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:12,500

375
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:17,499
Are you doubting the cause of death of your late father?

376
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,299
This is my business card.

377
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:26,699
What I'm after isn't important.

378
00:31:26,699 --> 00:31:32,399
If you can recall something important, please get in contact.

379
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,079
Thank you for your time.

380
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:39,160
I know your consultation fee is expensive,

381
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,440
but don't worry, I will pay you.

382
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,940
No need. I can't help you much, so I feel guilty charging you.

383
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:48,459
If you ever need any legal aid, feel free to come to me.

384
00:31:48,459 --> 00:31:50,799
I shall not bother you further then.

385
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:55,360
- Have a safe trip. 
 - See you.

386
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,019
- Okay. 
 - Here, please.

387
00:32:18,139 --> 00:32:19,699

Li Zeliang took the elevator.

388
00:32:19,699 --> 00:32:22,019
 Stay alert if you have arrived.

389
00:32:38,979 --> 00:32:41,300
Thank God you sent me that message.

390
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,399
Why did he come here?

391
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,960
He came to ask about his father.

392
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,759
Did you meet his father?

393
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:54,540
Zhiwei and Ocean Hotel are longtime partners.

394
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,660
You were overseas, so you wouldn't know.

395
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,379
What about you? Why did you come to me today?

396
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,659
I found Zhiwei's contract from back then.

397
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:13,519
The one who signed with Zhiwei wasn't Li Zeliang.

398
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,059
Besides, he was with me the day the contract was signed.

399
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,620
So he didn't do it?

400
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,940
Does that mean you can stop now?

401
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:26,960
But when my father jumped from the building, he was on the rooftop too.

402
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,480
Even if he didn't do it,

403
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,119
that doesn't mean Ocean Hotel's name has been cleared.

404
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:35,200
The one who signed the contract was Chen Hengsheng.

405
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,800
I will find this man.

406
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:45,660
You're right, Mr. Li. It's her.

407
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,459
She came to see Lawyer Xie.

408
00:33:58,459 --> 00:34:00,440
Why did she avoid me then?

409
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,599
Miss Su might hide more things than we imagined.

410
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,579
How many secrets does she harbor?

411
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:17,219
Mr. Li.

412
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,400
Follow her.

413
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:30,970

414
00:34:40,459 --> 00:34:42,099
Tell me now.

415
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:44,220
How long have you been staring at me?

416
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:49,470
If possible, I wish my eyes could be spared from this unsightly mess.

417
00:34:54,999 --> 00:34:57,840
No need to look around. A'Liang didn't come.

418
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,220
But will he?

419
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:02,860
If you're looking for him, why don't you call him?

420
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:06,820
I ask you that because I don't want to call him.

421
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:10,960
Then you're just wasting your time here.

422
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,520
It's unnecessary.

423
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,780
Hou Xiaodong.

424
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,500
If you have the time, read more books.

425
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,239
Don't use my real name here.

426
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:24,400
Call me Oscar.

427
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:30,300
Also, do I need to have a degree to talk to you now?

428
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,879
Whatever. I'm too lazy to deal with you. Bye.

429
00:35:33,879 --> 00:35:35,020
You're just going to leave now?

430
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,780
Or what?

431
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:39,079
Sit here while you drink your milk?

432
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:41,740
Shi Chuchu. It's milk tea.

433
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,220
I love tea with milk in it.

434
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,200
Not just milk.

435
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:50,079
I think you're a terrible drunk, and that's why you don't dare to drink.

436
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,059
Bring it on then.

437
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,559
I know what you want.

438
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:03,600
You want to get me drunk and fish info out of me.

439
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,439
Zeliang and you are close.

440
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:07,519
I know you won't snitch on him.

441
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:08,860
I'm glad you know.

442
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,979
So does he have someone he likes?

443
00:36:10,979 --> 00:36:12,700
Spare me, please.

444
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,760
There are so many girls in Ocean Hotel.

445
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,520
It's not outlandish to imagine him falling in love with one.

446
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,920
So that girl works in Ocean Hotel.

447
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,679
That's your speculation.

448
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:24,960
I didn't tell you that.

449
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,239
What does she look like?

450
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:28,139
I've never met her.

451
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,939
I'm serious!

452
00:36:35,419 --> 00:36:40,740
But as the Stage Prince, A'Liang just had to give me

453
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,519
a rough description and I could already deduce

454
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:46,939
what she looked like precisely.

455
00:36:46,939 --> 00:36:48,600
Tell me then.

456
00:36:50,539 --> 00:36:56,159
I can tell you very confidently that you have a rival now.

457
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:01,939
She knows her tricks and she knows how to act

458
00:37:01,939 --> 00:37:03,919
to evoke the protective urges from a man.

459
00:37:03,919 --> 00:37:08,459
And most importantly, A'Liang fell in love with her at first sight.

460
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:14,239
So, all in all, she's at least 90 out of 100.

461
00:37:22,919 --> 00:37:25,059
I might have embellished it a bit.

462
00:37:25,059 --> 00:37:26,260
Don't take it personally.

463
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:29,180
I still have a show to prepare for.

464
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,000
Enjoy the drink.

465
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,739
It's on me.

466
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:14,760
 No one is following me?

467
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,900

468
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,079
 Open the door. I know you're inside.

469
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,879
 Su Xieyi.

470
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,800
 Su Xieyi, I can hear you.

471
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,239
 I know you're inside.

472
00:39:21,699 --> 00:39:23,020
Director Li.

473
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,690
What took you so long?

474
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,020
I was listening to music.

475
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:31,100
I thought I was hallucinating.

476
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,740
It's late now. How can I help?

477
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,080
- I– 
 - Wait.

478
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,180
How do you know where I live?

479
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,900
You know where I live.

480
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,240
How can I not know where my assistant lives?

481
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,059
But I'm not your assistant anymore.

482
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:50,100
But you're still my employee.

483
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,760
It's my first time here.

484
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,740
No coffee for your guest?

485
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,480
We don't have coffee here.

486
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,359
Tea will do too.

487
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,980
Mr. Li, why did you come to my place?

488
00:40:12,259 --> 00:40:14,639
I told you I'd return your clothes.

489
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:23,779
Miss Su, your place is well renovated.

490
00:40:25,579 --> 00:40:27,739
This is my bedroom.

491
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:31,660
This too.

492
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,219
We can talk in the living room.

493
00:40:34,219 --> 00:40:35,719
Sure.

494
00:40:39,399 --> 00:40:41,779
- This drawing is interesting. 
 - Don't touch it.

495
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,100
It's expensive.

496
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,980
Fine. I won't touch it.

497
00:40:56,139 --> 00:40:58,300
Do you wear wigs too?

498
00:40:58,939 --> 00:41:00,979
I love to change my style. Why?

499
00:41:00,979 --> 00:41:03,220
Wearing a wig is like putting on fake eyelashes.

500
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,320
What's wrong with that?

501
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:10,100
It doesn't suit your face.

502
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,039
This outfit looks familiar.

503
00:41:24,479 --> 00:41:26,540
When you went to the broadcasting room in Ocean Hotel

504
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:31,480
to play Secretary Lin's video, weren't you wearing this outfit?

505
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,659
Why? Are you keeping it as a souvenir?

506
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:37,860
Are you done? Mr. Li,

507
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:41,320
it's late now. I need to rest.

508
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,300
All right.

509
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:52,100
Actually, I came to visit you today

510
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:56,139
to apologize.

511
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,739
I shouldn't have doubted you.

512
00:42:02,739 --> 00:42:04,419
In fact,

513
00:42:05,019 --> 00:42:09,460
the first day we met, I recognized you straight away.

514
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:14,590
♫  I need you, I love you  ♫

515
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:18,250
♫  I'll brave the waves for you  ♫

516
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:21,620
♫  You don't have to be brave all the time  ♫

517
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:27,570
♫  Please believe that I am by your side  ♫

518
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:33,900
♫  Ever and after  ♫

519
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:44,870

520
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,350
♫  Halfway through the journey on the train,  ♫

521
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:57,170
♫  a new passenger takes a seat  ♫

522
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:01,400
♫  The bells on the platform are ringing  ♫

523
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,870
♫  I wave my hands to see the passengers off  ♫

524
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:07,600
♫  With a one-way ticket stub in your hand  ♫

525
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:11,320
♫  you've embarked on a journey to happiness  ♫

526
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,720
♫  I didn't save your contact information  ♫

527
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,880
♫  But in my heart, I secretly ask  ♫

528
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,930
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

529
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,710
♫  How's it going with him?  ♫

530
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:25,520
♫  I bet his temper is better than mine  ♫

531
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,400
♫  He's better at guessing your complicated thoughts  ♫

532
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,200
♫  Does he hold you when you're sad?  ♫

533
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,080
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

534
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,010
♫  Everything must be going well  ♫

535
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:40,940
♫  Do you want to hear what I haven't said?  ♫

536
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:48,530
♫  Do lyrics of love songs stir up your emotions and recall all of our memories?  ♫

537
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:53,160
♫  It doesn't seem to be difficult  ♫

538
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:20,800
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

539
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,740
♫  How's it going with him?  ♫

540
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:26,250
♫  You and fate have not given me an answer  ♫

541
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:30,370
♫  The price of growing up is like a pile of bargaining chip  ♫

542
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:34,120
♫  The wager is who can let go first  ♫

543
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,070
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

544
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:37,950
♫  Everything must be going well  ♫

545
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:42,200
♫  Life is not as complicated as I thought  ♫

546
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,370
♫  Silence is the best that I can do  ♫

547
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:49,610
♫  Whatever pain and suffering may come,  ♫

548
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:53,050
♫  I'm not afraid at all  ♫

549
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:03,170
