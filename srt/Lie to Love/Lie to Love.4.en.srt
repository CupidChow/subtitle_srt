19
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,319
Here, your coffee.

20
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,159
Thanks.

21
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,319
Ming Yue.

22
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,240
Your coffee.

23
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,280
Thanks.

24
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,759
Shu, have some coffee.

25
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,360
Thanks.

26
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,639
Mei, your coffee.

27
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,599
Thank you.

28
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:27,680
So

29
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:29,599
who told you to do that?

30
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,240
What do you mean who?

31
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,280
The coffee.

32
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:38,199
I just started here.

33
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,000
Buying everyone coffee is normal,
isn't it?

34
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,159
What I'm saying is

35
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:41,759
that this office

36
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,560
may look harmonious

37
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,599
but it's

38
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,159
full of landmines.

39
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,840
Even though you're just

40
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,960
being courteous here,

41
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,159
some

42
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,080
sensitive people

43
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,080
might think

44
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,000
that you're boot-licking.

45
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,680
I see.

46
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,199
Oh.

47
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,240
I need to

48
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,439
ask you something.

49
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:05,879
This is a completed contract

50
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,840
left by the previous secretary.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,360
How should I deal with it?

52
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:11,800
Should I shred it or...

53
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,560
This contract

54
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,280
is not due for discardment

55
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,159
so you should keep it in the archive.

56
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,759
Archive?

57
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,599
I thought people just keep
a digital copy nowadays.

58
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:22,680
Why

59
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,280
do we have an archive here?

60
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,639
You see,

61
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,159
in this office, we have a rule

62
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,159
that all contracts

63
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,400
should have a soft copy

64
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,960
but the original copy

65
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,759
will also be kept until it's deemed fit

66
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:34,039
to be discarded away.

67
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,719
Just in case.

68
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,479
Got it?

69
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,080
The badge to enter the archive

70
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:41,719
must be in the possession

71
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:42,680
of someone important.

72
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,919
Check this out.

73
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,850
(Gong Ming Yue)

74
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:01,159
Welcome

75
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,919
to the archive.

76
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:06,039
These are all hard copies.

77
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,080
If Mr. Li

78
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,240
needs to consult

79
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,000
any document

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,680
or contract,

81
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:11,599
let me know.

82
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,719
I'll keep a record

83
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,000
before passing the document to you.

84
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,680
So every contract

85
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,800
is kept here?

86
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes.

87
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:19,680
Although

88
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,360
we will eventually store them
in our computers,

89
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,519
the contracts from the last five years

90
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,399
are not ready to be disposed of now.

91
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,079
We can't leave everything

92
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,319
at the legal department either.

93
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,480
It'll clog things up.

94
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,199
Look.

95
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,360
This row is for the contracts

96
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,279
from the last five years.

97
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,870
(Ocean Hotel Corporation)

98
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,720
What are you looking at?

99
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,480
I was thinking

100
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,199
about how you have access

101
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,839
to somewhere important like this.

102
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,720
You must be very capable.

103
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,959
Of course.

104
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:55,680
Let's go.

105
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,720
Let's go.

106
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,600
Still looking at your phone?

107
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,680
We have a meeting soon.

108
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,680
All right. I know.

109
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,720
Hurry up.

110
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,040
Sorry.

111
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,639
I'm so sorry.

112
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:22,879
Sorry.

113
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,439
Perhaps I can clean your shirt

114
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,920
right now?

115
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,600
It's fine.

116
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,160
Watch where you go next time.

117
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,759
Mr. Li, the clothes are here.

118
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:45,920
Thanks.

119
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,480
Are they for a client?

120
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,720
No.

121
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,160
I stained my friend's

122
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,160
clothes earlier on.

123
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,240
I promised to clean it for her.

124
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:00,800
Mr. Li.

125
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,000
I notice

126
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,680
that you smile more often now.

127
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,319
Do I?

128
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,439
No.

129
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,279
More precisely,

130
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,959
you never smiled.

131
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,600
Isn't smiling a kind of

132
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:15,480
disguise?

133
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,240
Right.

134
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,279
You're so right.

135
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,680
Ying Song,

136
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,800
shouldn't you

137
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
focus on the task

138
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:28,079
I gave you?

139
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,879
You have nothing to do now?

140
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,360
I'll go back to my work now.

141
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,120
Wait.

142
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,000
Bring Su Xie Yi here.

143
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,720
Okay.

144
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,279
I'll smile as much as I like.

145
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,600
Come in.

146
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,639
Mr. Li.

147
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:06,879
Are you looking for me?

148
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,000
As my personal assistant,

149
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,439
I need to brief you

150
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,800
about some of my habits.

151
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,120
I

152
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,839
am a germophobe.

153
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,839
I want you

154
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:18,639
to clean my office

155
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,360
the first thing
when you start your day.

156
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,399
Look.

157
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,600
The desk is dirty.

158
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,360
Dust is all over the cup lid.

159
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,680
This is bad.

160
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,519
Miss Su, I expect you

161
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,680
to give me

162
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,800
a spotless working environment.

163
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,800
Sorry, Mr. Li.

164
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,000
I will

165
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,000
let the janitor do it.

166
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:40,920
This is not

167
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,040
within my job scope.

168
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,600
Well, it's not compulsory.

169
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,040
You don't need to do this.

170
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,199
But making me coffee should be fine,
right?

171
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,399
Mr. Li.

172
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
Sorry.

173
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,000
I will do my job

174
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,920
but anything outside of my job

175
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,600
will depend on my free time
and on my mood.

176
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,959
Su Xie Yi,

177
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,040
mind your

178
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,439
manner.

179
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,800
This is my office,

180
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,759
not your house.

181
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,079
I am your boss.

182
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,480
Choose your words wisely

183
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,839
when you're talking to your boss.

184
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,079
Mr. Li.

185
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,120
You play an important

186
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,160
role here.

187
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:20,160
You're like the pillar of Ocean Hotel.

188
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,439
As a newcomer,

189
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,639
I still lack experience

190
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,399
to fill this position.

191
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,839
Therefore, I should probably head back
to the General Manager's Office

192
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,519
to learn

193
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,199
from my seniors.

194
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,200
Su Xie Yi.

195
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,919
Remember what you said yesterday?

196
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,480
You said you wanted to work hard

197
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:37,000
and stay here.

198
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,120
Yes,

199
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,600
I did say I'd work hard

200
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,720
to stay in Ocean Hotel.

201
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,279
But I didn't say I had to stay

202
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,679
by your side, Mr. Li.

203
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:48,279
Okay.

204
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,720
Brilliant.

205
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:51,759
I like people

206
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,320
who acknowledge
their strengths and weaknesses.

207
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,679
Hello, is this HR?

208
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,200
Su Xie Yi is not suitable

209
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,159
to be my assistant.

210
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,519
I don't need her

211
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,519
in my office anymore.

212
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,039
Thanks, Mr. Li.

213
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,679
I'll leave then.

214
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,320
Darn you, Su Xie Yi.

215
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,200
(Chu Chu)

216
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:45,919
Hi, Chu Chu.

217
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,360
I'm back.

218
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:48,759
You must have worked very hard.

219
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,120
We haven't seen each other
for two months

220
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,559
and that's all you got?

221
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,919
Show some sincerity, at least.

222
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,399
How can I show my sincerity then?

223
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:59,000
Wait for me in the office.

224
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,279
I'll be there soon.

225
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:03,200
All right. I'll be waiting for you.

226
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,879
Miss Shi, are we heading to your home?

227
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:05,879
No, to Ocean Hotel.

228
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,320
Okay.

229
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:14,000
(International; China: Hong Kong,
Macao, and Taiwan Arrival)

230
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:17,240
If a woman can be like Miss Shi,

231
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,879
it'll be perfect.

232
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,320
She has the look, the family background,

233
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:22,840
the mannerism, and the career.

234
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:24,559
She aced in all of them.

235
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,120
I heard

236
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:30,240
she's the heiress of Hengye Bank?

237
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:31,679
Yes.

238
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,759
Hengye Bank

239
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:34,360
is the main investor

240
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,639
of our company.

241
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,320
Back then when Mr. Li

242
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,159
was executing the mergers
and acquisitions with Zhiwei,

243
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,320
the Shi Family

244
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,679
gave their full support.

245
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,759
Just so you know,

246
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,240
when Miss Shi is here,

247
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,879
walk forward

248
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,200
and show your enthusiasm.

249
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,120
Yes, Ming Yue.

250
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,600
Thank you for the tips.

251
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,240
Have this fruit juice.

252
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:56,159
Here.

253
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,039
You're so sweet.

254
00:10:58,799 --> 00:10:59,720
Why? You...

255
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,159
No... Tissue paper, please.

256
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,159
Here.

257
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,879
Look.

258
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,799
I'm all drenched now.

259
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,759
What should I do?

260
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,879
There's a hand dryer in the toilet.

261
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,240
I'll dry it then.

262
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,279
So clumsy.

263
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,440
Miss Shi will be here soon.

264
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,960
A heartfelt welcome to Miss Shi.

265
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,200
(Welcome back, Miss Shi!)

266
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,759

You have contributed

(Welcome back, Miss Shi!)
a lot to Ocean Hotel.

285
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,039
The initial goal

286
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,519
we set

287
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,879
is to strike

288
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,519
five partnership deals with

289
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:47,559
five 5-star hotels.

290
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,919
But Miss Shi

291
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,000
signed with eight 5-star hotels

292
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,399
and they are all

293
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:53,919
the best hotels
in their respective region.

294
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,799
It's also thanks to the company
for trusting me

295
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:03,600
and for giving me their support.

296
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:04,559
That's how I could finish

297
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,279
this mission successfully.

298
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:07,200
Chu Chu.

299
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,720
Knowing your talent,

300
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,960
keeping you
in the General Manager's Office

301
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,160
is a gross injustice.

302
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,680
We should let you

303
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,000
expand our business
to the foreign market.

304
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:14,880
Yes.

305

If Miss Shi is leading us,

306
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:17,119
I believe

307
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,799
it won't be long until Ocean Hotel

308
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,799
gets on the international stage.

309
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,160
I appreciate your faith in me

but instead of being assigned
to the marketing department,

311

I'd rather stay here

313
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:30,680

Thank you for your concern.

320
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,640
Good.

321
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:46,759

is the occasion
to celebrate your return.

How can he be absent?

326
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:54,200
He said he'd wait for me in his office.

327

Let's make it brief

331

so that everyone

332
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:04,559
can resume working soon.

You're the star today.

335
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,079
You decide.

336
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,200
Go back to your work now.

337
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,480
Where's my badge?

338
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,519

342
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,000
The celebration is over. Where were you?

343
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,200
I had some work to do just now.

344
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,519
I went to deliver something.

345
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:51,799
Miss Shi has come back

346
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,079
and you still shirk on your duty?

347
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,319
Don't tell anyone.

348
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:58,200
I'll buy you a meal.

349
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:01,200
Smart.

350
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,640
Have you seen my badge?

351
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,920
I put it here just now.

352
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,200
I can't find it anywhere.

353
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:10,680
Where did I put it?

354
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,759
Isn't it here?

355
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:18,440
It was on the floor.
Did you look underneath?

356
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:21,599
I did.

357
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:23,519
Thanks.

358
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,160
I was so scared.

359
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:28,000
Where are you going?

360
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:31,359
To buy some water. Do you want some?

361
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:33,440
No, thanks.

362
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,800
(Chen Heng Sheng)

363
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,440
Chairman.

364
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,240
You're the assistant
who came to Ze Liang

365
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:03,279
last night to ask him
to sign some documents?

366
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:04,640
Yes.

367
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,599
You have a good memory, sir.

368
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:08,960
It was so late

369
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:11,000
but he still asked you
to work nonetheless.

370
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,480
It's rare to see him

371
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,640
so dedicated to his work.

372
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,079
It's mainly

373
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,720
due to my lack of experience.

374
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,359
I overlooked something during the day

375
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:22,400
so I had to

376
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,119
bother Mr. Li at night.

377
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,000
My nephew's house

378
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,079
is like

379
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,079
a fort.

380
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,920
He never allows any outsider in.

381
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,599
But last night,

382
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,400
he let you in.

383
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,319
It seems like
you're very special to him.

384
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,880
I'm new here so I'm not familiar
with everything.

385
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:42,799
It seems like I made a mistake.

386
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,400
I will take note of it now.

387
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:46,319
Miss Su.

388
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,720
Are you interested

389
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:50,759
in working under me?

390
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,000
What?

391
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,440
I was just thinking

392
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,319
that you're so hardworking

393
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,559
and responsible.

394
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:01,240
I admire

395
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:03,359
people like you.

396
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,519
You flatter me, Chairman.

397
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,799
I'm still new.

398
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,799
I'm lacking in many aspects.

399
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:12,160
I need more training.

400
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:14,480
I still have work to do.

401
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,480
I should head back.

402
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:31,000
Su Xie Yi.

403
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,119
She was diagnosed with

404
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:33,079
dissociative amnesia two years ago.

405
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:34,680
She was then treated in Germany.

406
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,079
What's fishy is

407
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
that any info about her in China

408
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,559
has been erased.

409
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,079
I'm not sure if it's because

410
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:42,440
she's not been in China for a long time

411
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,759
or if someone tinkered with her info.

412
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:46,160
I just can't find anything

413
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,759
or anyone

414
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:48,279
that can tell us more about her.

415
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,759
Also,

416
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,039
I noticed

417
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,079
that she snuck
into the archive just now.

418
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,200
(Archives Management System)

419
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:00,519
She flipped through the contract

420
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:01,599
we signed with Zhiwei back then.

421
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:04,680
Amnesia?

422
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:07,519
Zhiwei?

423
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,720
Interesting.

424
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:14,880
Chu Chu?

425
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,119
You're here.

426
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,440
Where were you?

427
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:19,839
Didn't you say

428
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:21,119
you'd meet me in the office?

429
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,799
I paid Uncle Bai a visit.

430
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:27,400
Sorry,

431
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,559
Miss Chu,

432
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,759
for not being able to attend
your welcome party.

433
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:32,599
Come on.

434
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,319
We've been friends for many years.

435
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:35,640
If I hold you accountable
for every mistake,

436
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:37,079
I'll have high blood pressure now.

437
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:40,440
Oh, I brought you a present.

438
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,400
Swedish delicacies.

439
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,599
Only for you.

440
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,599
Thanks.

441
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:49,440
Haven't I told you

442
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:50,119
not to

443
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:51,519
bring me souvenirs
every time you travel?

444
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:53,599
But I have also told you

445
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,799
that whenever
I visit a city or a country,

446
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:57,200
I will

447
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,680
bring you a souvenir.

448
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:01,359
Right.

449
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:04,920
Ever since you graduated
from the university,

450
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:06,279
you have never broken that promise.

451
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:09,039
I gave you my word

452
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,079
so I'll do my best to uphold it.

453
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:25,160
Ming Yue, why are you standing there?

454
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:27,119
Good timing, Xie Yi.

455
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:27,759
This is

456
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,920
the Earl Grey tea
that Miss Shi loves the most.

457
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:30,519
I have added the milk and the sugar.

458
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:31,680
You can bring this to her.

459
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:33,200
Why me?

460
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,839
Offering tea
to these two important people

461
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,119
is a rare chance.

462
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,200
Take this.

463
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,880
Why would you hand this

464
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:39,960
opportunity to me?

465
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,079
When Mr. Li entered

466
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,400
the office,

467
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:43,920
he was sulking.

468
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:44,680
So I...

469
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:46,319
So you want me to do it.

470
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:49,039
Aren't you Mr. Li's personal assistant?

471
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,319
Time to prove yourself.

472
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,880
I already quit.

473
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:53,720
HR hasn't approved.

474
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:55,599
Come. Take this.

475
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:57,440
Take it.

476
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,079
Go.

477
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,880
Good luck.

478
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:08,839
Mr. Li.

479
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,240
Miss Shi.

480
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,279
New staff
from the General Manager's Office?

481
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,319
I'm Mr. Li's temporary assistant.

482
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:21,839
Ex-temporary assistant.

483
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,079
Miss Su.

484
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:24,480
We only worked together

485
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,519
for less than two days.

486
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,079
Please use the appropriate term.

487
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:28,359
Sure.

488
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,039
You can leave now.

489
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:37,640
I just want to serve tea

490
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:38,759
to my superior.

491
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,799
But I'm not your superior, am I?

492
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:43,359
I'm referring to Miss Shi.

493
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,400
Hi, Miss Shi.

494
00:25:57,799 --> 00:25:59,079
I'm Su Xie Yi.

495
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:01,119
I just started
in the General Manager's Office.

496
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:03,319
Nice to meet you.

497
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:05,480
Thanks, Miss Shi.

498
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,519
If there's nothing else,

499
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:10,720
I'll leave then.

500
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,519
Enjoy.

501
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,400
Okay.

502
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,680
It's just a new staff.

503
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,359
How did she cross you?

504
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,960
Her existence crossed me.

505
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:25,799
When did you learn

506
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:27,480
to throw a tantrum?

507
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,160
Yes, Ying Song?

508
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,599
Mr. Li.

509
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:49,400
I have some updates regarding

510
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,200
the task you gave me.

511
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,319
Wait for me.

512
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:56,559
Chu Chu.

513
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:57,839
Ying Song wants to talk to me.

514
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,920
Give me a moment.

515
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:00,039
Okay.

516
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:03,480
Enjoy the tea.

517
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:05,480
Come back soon.

518
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,400
Okay.

519
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,559
So?

520
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,319
Xie Ming Hao has returned.

521
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:20,640
He has founded a law firm.

522
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,759
Is that so?

523
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,799
Great.

524
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,359
Do you wish to meet him?

525
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,519
Yes.

526
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,680
I want to meet everyone

527
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,240
who has contacted my father

528
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,880
before he passed away.

529
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,039
When?

530
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,279
Now.

531
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,400
Okay.

532
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:14,799
Acting cool and aloof

533
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:15,599
but you still

534
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:16,839
prepared a secret gift for me.

535
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,039
(Your clothes)

536
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,440
Sorry, I have an emergency.

537
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,480
Let's hang out again next time.

538
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,799
This is the place, Mr. Li.

539
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:03,119
Wait for me in the parking lot.

540
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,119
Mr. Xie.

541
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:19,839
There's a Mr. Li

542
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:21,279
waiting for you inside.

543
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:22,680
Mr. Li?

544
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,880
Okay.

545
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:25,799
All right.

546
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,400
Pardon me

547
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,359
for asking. You are...?

548
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:55,039
The son of Li Kuo Hai,

549
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:56,160
Li Ze Liang.

550
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,920
The son of an old friend.

551
00:29:58,319 --> 00:29:59,519
Come, have a seat.

552
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:05,880
Mr. Xie.

553
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,480
Sorry for the sudden visit

554
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:09,279
but I have something to ask you.

555
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,559
Go ahead.

556
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,720
The day when my dad passed away,

557
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,799
were you in the hospital?

558
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,160
Did you meet him?

559
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,640
It's more like I arrived

560
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:20,039
after he passed away.

561
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,160
Don't get me wrong.

562
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,119
I'm not suspecting you of anything.

563
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,440
I know

564
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:26,720
when you arrived,

565
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,000
my father

566
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:30,599
has been pronounced dead.

567
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:31,680
Yes.

568
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,240
I was representing Zhiwei

569
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,039
to negotiate

570
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,519
the partnership deal with him.

571
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:37,079
Unfortunately,

572
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,240
when I arrived,

573
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,359
Mr. Li has already passed away.

574
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,720
Mr. Xie, I just want to know

575
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,319
when you arrived at the hospital,

576
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,680
did you see something

577
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,119
or someone noteworthy?

578
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:50,240
When I arrived,

579
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,359
I just saw doctors

580
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:52,559
hustling around.

581
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,559
Other

582
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:54,880
than that,

583
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:56,559
nothing out of the ordinary.

584
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,770
(Haotian Law Firm)

585
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,400
Are you doubting the cause of death

586
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,799
of your late father?

587
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,599
This is my business card.

588
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:26,310
(Li Ze Liang)
What I'm after isn't important.

589
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:28,279
If you

590
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:29,920
can recall something important,

591
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,799
please get in contact.

592
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,039
Thank you for your time.

593
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:36,720
I know

594
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,839
your consultation fee is expensive

595
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,119
but don't worry, I will pay you.

596
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,200
No need.

597
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,119
I can't help you much

598
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:44,440
so I feel guilty charging you.

599
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:45,759
If you ever need

600
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:47,240
any legal aid,

601
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:48,319
feel free to come to me.

602
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,720
I shall not bother you further then.

603
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:53,960
Have a safe trip.

604
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,640
See you.

605
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,519
Okay.

606
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:04,279
Here, please.

607
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:19,510
(Ming Hao)
(Li Ze Liang took the elevator.)

608
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:20,839
(Stay alert if you have arrived.)

609
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:40,880
Thank God you sent me that message.

610
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,799
Why did he come here?

611
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,160
He came

612
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,960
to ask about his father.

613
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,079
You met his father?

614
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:54,279
Zhiwei and Ocean Hotel
are longtime partners.

615
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,599
You were overseas

616
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,960
so you wouldn't know.

617
00:32:59,279 --> 00:32:59,880
What about you?

618
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:03,160
Why did you come to me today?

619
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,279
I found Zhiwei's contract

620
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,759
from back then.

621
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,599
The one who signed with Zhiwei

622
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:12,960
wasn't Li Ze Liang.

623
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,799
Besides, he was with me

624
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:16,279
the day the contract was signed.

625
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,400
So he didn't do it?

626
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,799
Does that mean

627
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,240
you can stop now?

628
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,359
But when my father
jumped from the building,

629
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:26,680
he was on the rooftop too.

630
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,279
Even if he didn't do it,

631
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,799
that doesn't mean Ocean Hotel's name
has been cleared.

632
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:32,640
The one who signed the contract

633
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,200
was Chen Heng Sheng.

634
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,000
I will find this man.

635
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:42,680
You're right,

636
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,720
Mr. Li.

637
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,000
It's her.

638
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,960
She came to see Mr. Xie.

639
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:00,000
Why did she avoid me then?

640
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,240
Miss Su

641
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,400
might hide more things

642
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:03,599
than we imagined.

643
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,719
How many secrets

644
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,079
does she harbor?

645
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,320
Mr. Li.

646
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,480
Follow her.

647
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:30,970
(Exit to Tianlin Road)

648
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:41,239
Tell me now.

649
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,760
How long have you been staring at me?

650
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,519
If possible,

651
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,760
I wish my eyes could be spared

652
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,039
from this unsightly mess.

653
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,320
No need to look around.
Liang didn't come.

654
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,000
But will he?

655
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,079
If you're looking for him,

656
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,239
why don't you call him?

657
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,039
I ask you that

658
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,039
because I don't want to call him.

659
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,119
Then you're just

660
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,519
wasting your time here.

661
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,920
It's unnecessary.

662
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,599
Hou Xiao Dong.

663
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,360
If you have the time,

664
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:19,000
read more books.

665
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,639
Don't use my real name here.

666
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:24,039
Call me Oscar.

667
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,239
Also,

668
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:27,639
do I need to have a degree

669
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,800
to talk to you now?

670
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:31,960
Whatever.

671
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:32,920
I'm too lazy to deal with you.

672
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:33,760
Bye.

673
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,800
You're just going to leave now?

674
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,920
Or what?

675
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,480
Sit here while you drink your milk?

676
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:40,159
Shi Chu Chu.

677
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,480
It's milk tea.

678
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,079
I love tea with milk in it.

679
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,599
Not just milk.

680
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,400
I think you're a bad drunk

681
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,559
and that's why you don't dare to drink.

682
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,559
Bring it on then.

683
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,280
I know what you want.

684
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:00,960
You want to get me drunk

685
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,000
and fish info out of me.

686
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,360
Ze Liang and you are close.

687
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:07,440
I know you won't snitch on him.

688
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:08,639
I'm glad you know.

689
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,480
So does he

690
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:10,599
have someone he likes?

691
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:12,480
Spare me, please.

692
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,440
There are so many girls in Ocean Hotel.

693
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,519
It's not outlandish to imagine him
falling in love with one.

694
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,760
So that girl

695
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,280
works in Ocean Hotel.

696
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,199
That's your speculation.

697
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:24,679
I didn't tell you that.

698
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,960
How does she look like?

699
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:27,079
I've never met her.

700
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:33,239
I'm serious!

701
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:36,119
But

702
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,519
as the Prince of Stage,

703
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,639
Liang just had to give me

704
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,840
a rough description

705
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:43,320
and I could already deduce

706
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:45,639
what she looked like precisely.

707
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,679
Tell me then.

708
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:53,159
I can tell you very confidently

709
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,800
that you have a rival now.

710
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:57,840
She knows her tricks

711
00:36:58,559 --> 00:36:59,840
and she knows

712
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,280
how to act

713
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:03,559
to evoke the protective urges
from a man.

714
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:04,960
And most importantly,

715
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,559
Liang fell in love with her 
at first sight.

716
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,639
So,

717
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,119
all in all,

718
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,239
she's at least 90 out of 100.

719
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,880
I might have embellished it a bit.

720
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,079
Don't take it personally.

721
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,159
I still have a show

722
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,519
to prepare for.

723
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,559
Enjoy the drink.

724
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,039
It's on me.

725
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:13,760
(No one is following me?)

726
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,900
(Signer of Zhiwei's Contract,
Chen Heng Sheng)

727
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,639
Open the door.

728
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,079
I know you're inside.

729
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,079
Su Xie Yi.

730
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,440
Su Xie Yi.

731
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,320
I can hear you.

732
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,239
I know you're inside.

733
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:22,760
Mr. Li.

734
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,559
What

735
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,920
took you so long?

736
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,519
I was listening to music.

737
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,800
I thought I was hallucinating.

738
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,079
It's late now.

739
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,760
How can I help?

740
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,039
I...

741
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:35,480
Wait.

742
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,559
How do you know where I live?

743
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,719
You know where I live.

744
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,519
How can I not know

745
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:41,719
where my assistant lives?

746
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:42,880
But I'm not

747
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,159
your assistant anymore.

748
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:49,400
But you're my employee.

749
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,480
It's my first time here.

750
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,280
No coffee

751
00:39:58,519 --> 00:39:59,480
for your guest?

752
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,119
We don't have coffee here.

753
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,800
Tea will do too.

754
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:04,239
Mr. Li.

755
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,480
Why did you come to my place?

756
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,039
I told you I'd return your clothes.

757
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:19,559
Miss Su.

758
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,639
Your place

759
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:22,920
is well renovated.

760
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:27,039
This is my bedroom.

761
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:31,320
This too.

762
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,199
We can talk

763
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,559
in the living room.

764
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:34,920
Sure.

765
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:40,840
- This drawing is interesting.
- Don't touch it.

766
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,400
It's expensive.

767
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,480
Fine. I won't touch it.

768
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:57,400
You wear wigs too?

769
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,599
I love to change my style. Why?

770
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:01,840
Wearing a wig

771
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,079
is like putting on fake eyelashes.

772
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,199
What's wrong with that?

773
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:08,159
It doesn't suit

774
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,079
your face.

775
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,239
This outfit looks familiar.

776
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:26,440
When you went to the broadcasting room
in Ocean Hotel

777
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,519
to play Mr. Lin's video,

778
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,599
weren't you wearing this outfit?

779
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,159
Why?

780
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:33,800
You're keeping it as a souvenir?

781
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,039
Are you done,

782
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:37,480
Mr. Li?

783
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,079
It's late now.

784
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,159
I need to rest.

785
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,760
All right.

786
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,400
Actually, I came to visit you

787
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,800
today

788
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:55,239
to apologize.

789
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,639
I shouldn't have doubted you.

790
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:03,480
In fact,

791
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,920
the first day we met,

792
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,760
