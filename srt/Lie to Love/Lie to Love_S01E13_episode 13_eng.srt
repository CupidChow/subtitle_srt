2
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:25,000
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,450
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

4
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:41,330
♫  And turn to face all the long lost times  ♫

5
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,370
♫  Brace the pain  ♫

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:51,210
♫  Let memories wake up from oceans deep  ♫

7
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,250
♫  No place to hide  ♫

8
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,350
♫  No way to run  ♫

9
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,820
♫  New dawn counts down  ♫

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,930
♫  I fight  ♫

11
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,010
♫  I cry  ♫

12
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,610
♫  I give up  ♫

13
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:15,710
♫  Memories forgotten, forsaken surround  ♫

14
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:24,030
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

15
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:32,270
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

16
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:40,850
♫  Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

17
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:49,720
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

18
00:01:49,720 --> 00:02:00,150

19
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,047

20
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:16,050

21
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,200
Guess what. There were many people in the pantry.

22
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,659
I had a hard time going in.

23
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:33,960
Had I been a little later, all the hot water would be gone.

24
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:38,713
Let me clean your face.

25
00:02:38,713 --> 00:02:39,860
Stop it.

26
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,560
You've hurt your hands. I'll do it myself.

27
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,740
It's okay.

28
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,099
You dried my hair for me. So let me help you wash your face.

29
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:47,499
We'll be even, then.

30
00:02:47,499 --> 00:02:48,939
Okay.

31
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,520
Hello. Is there a patient by the name Su Xieyi or Li Zeliang?

32
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,690
Hold on, I'll check it for you.

33
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,990
Okay.

34
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:28,470
♫  You are my everything, my everything  ♫

35
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:33,150
♫  How I want to tell you  ♫

36
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:38,000
♫  I want to be your moon  ♫

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,200
♫  Always shining through  ♫

38
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,020
♫  Guiding you through every maze  ♫

39
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:50,870
♫  You are my star  ♫

40
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:58,770
♫  Always orbiting around you  ♫

41
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:03,570
♫  I want to be your moon  ♫

42
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:14,970
♫  Be mine, my love  ♫

43
00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:24,550
Mister, are you looking for someone?

44
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,160
Room 207, it's time for your IV drip.

45
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,519
You're recovering pretty well. You're glowing with health.

46
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,620
You took good care of me.

47
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,839
By the way, there seems to be a man outside looking for you.

48
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,720
Could it be Yingsong?

49
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,680
It could be Brother Minghao.

50
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,480
I lost my phone. I could only remember his number.

51
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,179
So I asked him to send some clothes over.

52
00:04:52,179 --> 00:04:54,260
I'll be back soon.

53
00:04:58,727 --> 00:05:00,427
Xieyi.

54
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,298
She just left and you're already missing her?

55
00:05:14,298 --> 00:05:17,000
Your girlfriend is really good to you.

56
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,140
While you were in surgery yesterday, she waited outside for you.

57
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,759
I wanted to clean her wound, but she wouldn't let me.

58
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:25,279
She's really good to you.

59
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:31,279
Get some rest.

60
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,620
- Thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

61
00:05:39,179 --> 00:05:40,879
So Chen Hengsheng was behind this.

62
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:44,720
Thanks to Li Zeliang that I managed to escape death this time.

63
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,820
I'll thank him on your behalf.

64
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,659
I brought your clothes.

65
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,639
You're hurt.

66
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,899
It's nothing. It was just a scratch.

67
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,800
Before you do anything next time, you should tell me in advance.

68
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,633
Even if you don't care about yourself,

69
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:07,039
you should at least consider the people who care about you.

70
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,419
Okay. I promise it won't happen again.

71
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,876

72
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:21,419
If it weren't for Mr. Oscar who drank that glass of gin and tonic first yesterday,

73
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:25,830
the one lying in bed would have been my wife.

74
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:31,319
Ocean Hotel Corporation owes me an explanation regarding this matter.

75
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:36,020
Chairman Huo, Miss Su and I hit it off right away.

76
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,519
I trust there may be a misunderstanding.

77
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:42,540
But no matter what, you must give us an answer.

78
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,279
Mr. Roman, Mrs. Roman,

79
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,500
I'm truly sorry for having brought you so much trouble.

80
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,516
About this matter, we've already started investigating it.

81
00:06:49,517 --> 00:06:52,379
If we found out that it was a deliberate act,

82
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:55,600
I give you my word of honor that no matter who was behind it,

83
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,500
I'll not tolerate that person.

84
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,720
Mrs. Roman, for you to give us a chance,

85
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,199
we also regard you and Mr. Roman as our good friends.

86
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,239
So I firmly believe that this must be a misunderstanding.

87
00:07:11,239 --> 00:07:13,879
Okay, then. If you can't give me a satisfactory answer

88
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:16,200
by 2:00 this afternoon,

89
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,141
I'll announce the termination of the cooperation.

90
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:25,799
Let's go.

91
00:07:34,739 --> 00:07:38,539
Chairman Huo, before we get to the bottom of this incident,

92
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:40,619
wouldn't it be better

93
00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:44,240
if we avoid giving Mr. Roman the impression that this is deliberate poisoning?

94
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,879
Chuchu, Mr. Roman has already given us the deadline.

95
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,179
There's not much time left.

96
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:54,330
I was only trying to appease them.

97
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,870
As the person in charge,

98
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:00,510
my nephew has gone missing and turned his back on this matter!

99
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,179
I had no choice.

100
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,039
Hello? Have you found Director Li?

101
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:17,900
Not yet. I've searched all over the city.

102
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,979
I'm driving towards the suburbs now.

103
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:23,299
 If we don't give a satisfactory answer by 2:00 this afternoon,

104
00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:25,460
Roman will withdraw from the deal.

105
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,220
You must find Director Li before then.

106
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,520
 Okay.

107
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,800

108
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:36,699
Hello?

109
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:38,799
 Yingsong, it's me.

110
00:08:40,739 --> 00:08:42,620
Mr. Li!

111
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,780
How did it go?

112
00:08:51,651 --> 00:08:53,931
Mr. Roman has given his ultimatum.

113
00:08:53,931 --> 00:08:57,233
This matter has caused great concern to Ocean's shareholders.

114
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,399
They'll hold a shareholders' meeting soon.

115
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:04,240
We won't know how Huo Jian and Chen Hengsheng will distort the truth at the meeting.

116
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:07,020
We must go back now.

117
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:13,520
Brother Minghao, I might need you to settle the hospital bills first.

118
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,000
Thanks.

119
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,439
Don't worry. I'll pay you back with interest.

120
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:21,439
For this clothe too.

121
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,660
I'll accompany him there first. I'll leave this to you, then.

122
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,359
Xieyi,

123
00:09:36,819 --> 00:09:38,719
I'll protect you.

124
00:09:38,719 --> 00:09:40,340
What do you mean?

125
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,559
You asked me to look into Chen Hengsheng, right?

126
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:47,199
I want to offer you some practical help.

127
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,039
Thank you, Brother Minghao.

128
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,539
Go on now.

129
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,770

130
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:32,000
At 2:00 this afternoon, we must give Mr. Roman an explanation.

131
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,759
The shareholders are crying for a meeting.

132
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:38,399
In the meeting, I'll reveal Su Xieyi's identity.

133
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,820
So there must be no mistake on your side.

134
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,300
Okay. Don't worry.

135
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,739
They probably won't be back in time before everything is over here.

136
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:51,619
Besides, that place has no mobile phone signal.

137
00:12:51,619 --> 00:12:53,700
I think nothing will go wrong.

138
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,290
Very good.

139
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,673
After this matter is over,

140
00:12:57,674 --> 00:13:01,120
put out a word to his driver and let him do the search.

141
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,620
Okay.

142
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,519
Is Chen Hengsheng reliable?

143
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,520
I helped him solve his son's issue.

144
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,600
He wouldn't dare to betray me.

145
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,550

146
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:24,578
Chairman Huo, Mr. Roman has already spoken.

147
00:14:24,578 --> 00:14:28,499
If we don't give him a reasonable explanation by 2:00 this afternoon,

148
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:31,939
he'll officially announce the cancellation of the auction,

149
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:34,719
terminate the cooperation with Ocean,

150
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,060
and claim compensation according to the contract.

151
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,459
What is going on with Li Zeliang?

152
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:43,000
We trusted him so much. Am I right?

153
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,279
Chairman Huo, we can't rely on him anymore.

154
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:48,419
You should think of something.

155
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:58,000
Ladies and gentlemen, we've already reached a conclusion about the incident yesterday.

156
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,406
After what happened, we've invited a testing laboratory to do a test.

157
00:15:01,406 --> 00:15:05,326
I can confidently tell you that it wasn't an accident.

158
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,900

159
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,100

160
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,660
Chen Hengsheng.

161
00:16:46,859 --> 00:16:50,559
Lawyer Xie? What are you doing here?

162
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,840
I remember a book saying

163
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,960
that murders usually return to the crime scene.

164
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,009
It seems to be true.

165
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:01,519
I don't know what you mean.

166
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:07,000
So tell me, why did you come here as soon as you got a call from Li Zeliang?

167
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,900
Li Zeliang...

168
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:13,380
Director Li is missing. Everyone is worried.

169
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,240
I came here by following the trails.

170
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,300
Is there anything wrong with that?

171
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,640
I have looked into someone lately.

172
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,305
His name... is Chen Weiran.

173
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:33,279
In front of you is the testing report.

174
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:35,439
According to what we know so far,

175
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,380
it was Su Xieyi who mixed this drink for Mrs. Roman.

176
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:43,200
But Oscar drank it during the process, which led to him being poisoned.

177
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,098
Other than Su Xieyi, who else has touched this drink?

178
00:17:48,098 --> 00:17:49,960
This is what I'm about to tell you.

179
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,140
Based on the surveillance footage,

180
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,100
Su Xieyi was the only one who touched this drink.

181
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,900
So we're certain that Su Xieyi is the one behind it.

182
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,839
Her target was Mrs. Roman.

183
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,039
Are we going to convict her just because she was the only one

184
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,989
who touched that drink?

185
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:15,580
My apologies. I'm merely stating the facts.

186
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,000
During the absence of the person in question,

187
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,039
who are we to make such an assumption?

188
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,599
Let me ask you, then.

189
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:24,419
Where is she now?

190
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:27,119
Yes, find her and confront her.

191
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:29,742
After the incident, Su Xieyi left Yunfeng Hotel,

192
00:18:29,743 --> 00:18:31,720
and can't be contacted until now.

193
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,980
What's more strange

194
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,680
is Director Li is also missing.

195
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,960
Did they flee to escape from punishment?

196
00:18:42,979 --> 00:18:44,300
Let me ask you this.

197
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,000
They fought hard to win the chance to host Fujiade Auction themselves.

198
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,619
And Director Li is the only person in charge of this project.

199
00:18:51,619 --> 00:18:54,239
Why would Su Xieyi do this

200
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,659
when she's Director Li's girlfriend?

201
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:04,219
I had my doubts about this question in the beginning.

202
00:19:04,219 --> 00:19:06,980
But after the investigation,

203
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,323
I finally understood the reason she did it.

204
00:19:10,323 --> 00:19:13,880
Miss Su is not only an employee of Ocean Hotel

205
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,020
and Li Zeliang's girlfriend.

206
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,800
She has another identity too.

207
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,686
- That is... 
 - I think the person in question should be answering that herself.

208
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:52,240
Everyone suspects that I dislike Mrs. Roman and want to poison her.

209
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,559
The key is every witness and evidence

210
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:58,960
all point to me being the only one who touched that drink.

211
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,759
Isn't that enough?

212
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,899
Has it ever occurred to you that there might be another possibility?

213
00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:08,850
Before I made the gin and tonic,

214
00:20:08,851 --> 00:20:12,420
the ingredients I used had already been poisoned.

215
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,717
This is the lime I used to make the gin and tonic,

216
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,756
and the pick that Oscar was using.

217
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:28,680
Aren't you curious about why this pick would turn black?

218
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:33,599
 Everyone in the trade knows that it can be used to wipe the bracelet.

219
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:36,540
 As for me, I'll use it to clean my guitar pick.

220
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,618
What I'm trying to say here

221
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,680
is that the lime had been poisoned by someone earlier.

222
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,799
After Oscar used this lemon to clean his pick,

223
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,919
it naturally turned black.

224
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,940
As for the limes, they were prepared by Chen Hengsheng.

225
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,060
Director Li and I found out that he wanted to destroy the poisoned limes.

226
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,224
So we tailed him.

227
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,180
We were found out.

228
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:10,381
He pushed us into an abandoned warehouse to confine us.

229
00:21:10,381 --> 00:21:14,183
That's right. If we didn't manage to escape in time,

230
00:21:14,183 --> 00:21:17,600
we would have been dead in the warehouse.

231
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,319
What? I can't believe that actually happened.

232
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:24,566
But that's only your side of the story.

233
00:21:24,566 --> 00:21:25,859
Do you have any evidence?

234
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:26,759
That's right.

235
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:31,359
Miss Su, the account of your experience sounds reasonable.

236
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:37,100
But how do we know if Oscar used the pick in your hand on that same day?

237
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:41,059
Oscar gave her that pick. I can attest to that.

238
00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:42,719
Chuchu,

239
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:46,039
how are you certain it's the same pick?

240
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,039
That's right.

241
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,739
You can just use a random blackened pick,

242
00:21:49,739 --> 00:21:52,219
and say it was robbed by a poisoned lemon.

243
00:21:52,219 --> 00:21:55,759
This evidence is outrageous.

244
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:58,187
How do you expect us to believe you?

245
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,800
Have they given you any response?

246
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,060
Not yet.

247
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,160
Have you contacted the logistics company?

248
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,519
Yes.

249
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:10,539
We can move the auction items anytime.

250
00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:16,639
Inform the lawyer to file a lawsuit against Ocean after we've moved all the auction items.

251
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,460
All right.

252
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:26,739
You want evidence, right?

253
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,960
It's on you now.

254
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:55,359
What now?

255
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:12,539
I was behind all of this.

256
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,959
I poisoned the drink.

257
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:19,860
My real target was Mrs. Roman.

258
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:24,860
My only goal was to disrupt the auction.

259
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:28,519
So that Li Zeliang would take the fall.

260
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:31,900
 I have looked into someone lately.

261
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,900
 His name...

262
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,699
 is Chen Weiran.

263
00:23:36,699 --> 00:23:39,240
 You must be familiar with this person, right?

264
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,920
 What are you trying to do?

265
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:49,587
 Within two years of graduating from high school,

266
00:23:49,587 --> 00:23:55,280
 Chen Weiran became a famous violinist with natural talent in the music industry.

267
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:57,880
 Just tell me what you want.

268
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,799
 This matter has nothing to do with my son.

269
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:01,260
 Yes, it's not.

270
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,559
 I'm just curious.

271
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,279
 After graduating from high school, he didn't continue his studies.

272
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,898
 He even traveled around for three years.

273
00:24:08,898 --> 00:24:12,917
 How did he become a top student of an internationally renowned music academy

274
00:24:12,917 --> 00:24:14,800
 in a blink of an eye?

275
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:21,480
I think there's more to this story, right?

276
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,380
 What exactly do you want to say?

277
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,915
 This is the graduation photo of the music academy that year.

278
00:24:36,915 --> 00:24:39,160
 There wasn't any Chen Weiran in this photo.

279
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,860
 Coincidentally,

280
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,039
 there are a few of my friends in this photo.

281
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:46,379
 They said they don't know any Chen Weiren.

282
00:24:46,379 --> 00:24:48,779
 If this matter gets out,

283
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,880
 will his graduate certificate still be useful?

284
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:57,759
 Lawyer Xie, no matter what happened, this matter has nothing to do with my son.

285
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:59,759
 If you have any requests, you can tell me.

286
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:02,000
 This has nothing to do with my son.

287
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,899
 It wasn't easy for my son to achieve what he has today.

288
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:05,799
 You can't ruin his future, Lawyer Xie.

289
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:08,800
 So you know we can't ruin anyone's future.

290
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:13,753
 No matter what, tell me what you want.

291
00:25:13,753 --> 00:25:16,539
 Do you want money? Give me a number. I can give it to you.

292
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,640
 I'll do anything you want.

293
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,020
 How about that? Don't touch my son, okay?

294
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,079
 I don't care who you're harming!

295
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:25,419
 But not Su Xieyi.

296
00:25:26,699 --> 00:25:29,119
 Su Xieyi.

297
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:37,839
 You're lucky that she's okay.

298
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:40,879
 Or else, I wouldn't know how I should punish you.

299
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:46,559
 Lawyer Xie.

300
00:25:47,211 --> 00:25:49,159
 Lawyer Xie. please

301
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:53,079
 No matter what happened, this has nothing to do with my son.

302
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:54,699
 I'll do anything you say.

303
00:25:54,699 --> 00:25:57,279
 Please, I beg you. Okay?

304
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,979
 It's simple.

305
00:25:59,699 --> 00:26:01,839
 You should take the blame for your action.

306
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:04,140
 Don't let others be the scapegoat.

307
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:10,339
Chen Hengsheng, you have the nerve to do this?

308
00:26:10,339 --> 00:26:13,820
Or did someone put you up to this?

309
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:19,189
Chen Hengsheng,

310
00:26:19,189 --> 00:26:22,419
as long as you tell us who's behind this,

311
00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:26,140
I promise I'll do my best to lighten your sentence.

312
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:30,299
Chen Hengsheng!

313
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,519
The late Mr. Li Senior treated you well.

314
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:36,960
How could you do this to his only son?!

315
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:40,239
You're so heartless!

316
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,640
I'm so disappointed in you.

317
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,879
Yes.

318
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:59,000
I did everything myself.

319
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:02,780
But have anyone of you considered my situation?

320
00:27:04,179 --> 00:27:08,159
After Li Zeliang comes back, you cast aside Yunfeng Hotel

321
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,546
because of an auction.

322
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,880
For Yunfeng Hotel to achieve what it has today,

323
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,400
isn't it all because of me?

324
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,184
Have you ever considered my situation at all?

325
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,840
That's right.

326
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,540
I was the one

327
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,400
who locked Li Zeliang and Miss Su

328
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,119
in a sealed-off warehouse.

329
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,145
That was because they came for me after they knew I was trying to destroy the poisoned limes.

330
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:41,499
But I never thought of endangering your lives at all.

331
00:27:41,499 --> 00:27:43,699
Since I've already started it,

332
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,780
I had no other choice.

333
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,039
You scum!

334
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,440
How could you do such a thing and damage the company's image?

335
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,160
I did everything myself.

336
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,020
I'll take the responsibility myself.

337
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:07,159
We've found the culprit, and time is almost up.

338
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,780
How do we explain this to Mr. Roman?

339
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:15,780
Zeliang, you're in charge of the auction.

340
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:19,440
What do you think?

341
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,960
I'll leave Chen Hengsheng to the police.

342
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,300
And I'll be in charge of the auction until the end.

343
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:29,280
Wait for me in the room.

344
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:43,559
Thank you.

345
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,620
Director Li, I'm serious at work.

346
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:58,220
I can't allow any mishaps at work.

347
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,000
I'm glad we have cleared the misunderstanding.

348
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,699
If I cancel the auction now,

349
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:06,059
I'll be under more pressure than you are.

350
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:11,600
The outcome is a win-win situation where everyone is happy.

351
00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:14,082
I've already told you

352
00:29:14,082 --> 00:29:17,480
that Miss Su also mixed the drinks for me after that.

353
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,720
If she wanted to hurt me, would I still be standing here safe and sound?

354
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:28,920
In any case, I still need to thank both of you for your trust and support.

355
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:32,359
I guarantee this auction will be a success.

356
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:34,059
Good.

357
00:29:34,059 --> 00:29:36,319
We look forward to it.

358
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,940
This way, please.

359
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:41,000
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

360
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:53,319
Zeliang, what did you tell Mr. Roman?

361
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:01,200
Have you heard of bongkrekic acid?

362
00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:06,240
I asked Oscar to admit that he ate expired food, which led to food poisoning.

363
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,440
That's why he passed out on the stage.

364
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:13,278
Of course, Mr. Roman's ultimate goal is that the auction can be held as scheduled.

365
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,480
So even if this reason doesn't make so much sense,

366
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,160
he would choose to believe it.

367
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,020
That's why he explained to the guests for us on the stage.

368
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:31,039
I knew Huo Jian was behind this.

369
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:35,119
Chuchu, I've already told you that I don't want you to get involved

370
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:37,609
in the business between Huo Jian and me.

371
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:39,079
 I finally understood why she did it.

372
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:41,120
 The reason she did it.

373
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,680
 Miss Su is not only an employee of Ocean Hotel

374
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,220
 and Li Zeliang's girlfriend.

375
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,459
 She has another identity too.

376
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:53,431
During the meeting,

377
00:30:53,431 --> 00:30:57,560
he said Su Xieyi has another identity other than being your girlfriend.

378
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,039
What's her identity?

379
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,920
Brother Ji.

380
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,440
Miss Su?

381
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,380
Don't tell me that you want to use this car again.

382
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:12,410
I can't let you use it. It's a company car.

383
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,335
You got me wrong.

384
00:31:15,335 --> 00:31:20,400
I'm here to ask if you have the number of A'Yan's attending doctor.

385
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,665
Why do you need it?

386
00:31:22,665 --> 00:31:24,600
A'Yan's leg has inflammation.

387
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,319
I want to ask the attending doctor how to take care of him better.

388
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:30,558
He got hurt because of me.

389
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,559
I feel guilty about it.

390
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,020
So I want to do something for him.

391
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:42,459
I've sent it to you.

392
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,319
Thank you, Brother Ji.

393
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:53,739
Don't tell Mr. Li I gave it to you, okay?

394
00:31:54,459 --> 00:31:56,159
Okay.

395
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:04,981
 Sorry, the subscriber you've dialed can't be connected for the moment. Please...

396
00:32:10,939 --> 00:32:13,640
Don't take what Huojian said seriously.

397
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,219
His goal is to suppress me and stop me from proving my worth.

398
00:32:17,219 --> 00:32:21,600
Zeliang, if you and Su Xieyi are putting on an act.

399
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,020
Don't you think you should end it now?

400
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:27,160
Huo Jian is obviously using Su Xieyi as an excuse to target you.

401
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,799
If you continue with your act, you'll be in danger.

402
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:33,260
It'll only bring harm to yourself and your career.

403
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:38,140
I know you're worried.

404
00:32:38,899 --> 00:32:40,980
But it is already in the past.

405
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,359
If it has happened once, it'll happen again.

406
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:45,380
I don't want to see you get hurt.

407
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,518
Do you know how much I worried about you last night?

408
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,380
I'm sorry.

409
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:11,060
I just hope you can protect yourself.

410
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,079
As for Miss Su,

411
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,820
it's best for you two to keep your distance for now.

412
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,620
Chuchu, thank you for worrying about me.

413
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:28,359
I'm certain Xieyi and I will be more mature in our decision-making.

414
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,379
As for Chen Hengsheng, I've reported it to the police.

415
00:33:41,379 --> 00:33:44,900
After he's convicted,

416
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,280
I'll ask you to prepare

417
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,031
a final official statement in the name of the hotel.

418
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,460
Okay.

419
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:58,144
I'll send Chen Hengsheng off.

420
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,620
Thanks for your coffee.

421
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,939
Mr. Roman has decided to continue cooperating with us.

422
00:34:23,939 --> 00:34:27,039
The shareholders are satisfied with Li Zeliang's decision.

423
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:31,082
We seem to have underestimated this nephew of yours.

424
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:39,039
He can't take over Yunfeng Hotel that easily.

425
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,180
Mr. Li, eat slowly.

426
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,220
Why?

427
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,832
Listen.

428
00:34:57,832 --> 00:35:02,679
Since last night, I only had some oats with milk.

429
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:04,400
I didn't eat much this morning either.

430
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,199
When I sent Mr. Chen off, my stomach was growling.

431
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:09,159
And you're telling me to eat slowly?

432
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:10,759
Then dig in.

433
00:35:10,759 --> 00:35:12,840
Pass those soup dumplings to me.

434
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:19,919
Huo Jian had it too easy, since Chen Hengsheng took all the blame.

435
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:25,518
By the way, have you sorted all of Huo Jian's purchases in the name of the hotel?

436
00:35:25,518 --> 00:35:31,039
Those works of art have been transported from Ocean Hotel to the warehouse designated by you.

437
00:35:31,699 --> 00:35:32,860
Works of art?

438
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:36,039
Those are just a pile of counterfeits, a pile of trash.

439
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:42,260
He suggested my father buy the so-called works of art

440
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,900
on the grounds that a five-star hotel needs class.

441
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,360
My dad thought that he had a point.

442
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,440
But he didn't know much about art collections.

443
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,840
Out of his trust toward Huo Jian, he left the matter entirely to him.

444
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:59,739
Unexpectedly... Huo Jian took the money for himself.

445
00:35:59,739 --> 00:36:01,993
If we haven't been investigating this matter secretly for the past year,

446
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:05,134
I fear no one would ever discover this secret.

447
00:36:06,819 --> 00:36:09,800
Why did you think I worked so hard to fight for this auction?

448
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,240
I'm not only doing this to seek the limelight.

449
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,859
The experts will be at this auction.

450
00:36:14,859 --> 00:36:17,239
Those works of art are Huo Jian's weakness.

451
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:20,081
Once we display them, it'll ruin Huo Jian's reputation.

452
00:36:21,899 --> 00:36:26,193
Tomorrow, you must make sure that these things can arrive at the venue smoothly.

453
00:36:26,193 --> 00:36:28,059
Don't worry, Mr. Li.

454
00:36:28,059 --> 00:36:30,820
This move of yours is well hidden.

455
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,660
A good one though.

456
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,699
Stop flattering me. Join me.

457
00:36:36,699 --> 00:36:39,459
Anything to drink? It's choking me.

458
00:36:39,459 --> 00:36:41,359
Black soy milk.

459
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,880
Black soy milk? You have good taste.

460
00:36:56,219 --> 00:36:58,039
Where are you going, Mr. Li?

461
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,819
- I have plans. 
 - I'll get the car, then.

462
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:04,960
No need. I'll go myself.

463
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,880
Take this green bean cake along with you, then.

464
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,609
You can eat on your way there.

465
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,400
Sensible guy.
