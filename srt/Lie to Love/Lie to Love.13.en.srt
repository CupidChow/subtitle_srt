Guess what.

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,759
There were many people at the pantry.

22
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,560
I had a hard time going in.

23
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:31,560
Had I been a little later,

24
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,719
all the hot water would be gone.

25
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:37,800
Let me clean your face.

26
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:39,680
Stop it.

27
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,599
You've hurt your hands.

28
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:41,360
I'll do it myself.

29
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,280
It's okay.

30
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,759
You dried my hair for me.

Mister, are you looking for someone?

00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,750
(Jiangcheng Town Hospital
of Traditional Chinese Medicine)

51
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,360
Room 207, it's time for your IV drip.

52
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,279
You're recovering pretty well.

53
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,439
You're glowing with health.

54
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,279
You took good care of me.

55
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,360
By the way,

56
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,040
there seems to be a man outside

57
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,439
looking for you.

58
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,839
Could it be Ying Song?

59
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,399
It could be Ming Hao.

60
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,600
I lost my phone.

61
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,279
I could only remember his number.

62
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:49,839
So I asked him

63
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,279
to send some clothes over.

64
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,360
I'll be back soon.

65
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,560
Xie Yi.

66
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,360
She just left

67
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,480
and you're already missing her?

68
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,360
Your girlfriend

69
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,519
is really good to you.

70
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,519
While you were in surgery yesterday,

71
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,040
she waited outside for you.

72
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,319
I wanted to clean her wound,

73
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,560
but she wouldn't let me.

74
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,279
She's really good to you.

75
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:30,079
Get some rest.

76
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:31,720
Thank you.

77
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,439
You're welcome.

78
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,480
So Chen Heng Sheng was behind this.

79
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,040
Thanks to Li Ze Liang

80
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,399
that I managed to escape death
this time.

81
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,120
I'll thank him on your behalf.

82
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:47,959
I brought your clothes.

83
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,800
You're hurt.

84
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,240
It's nothing.

85
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,199
It was just a scratch.

86
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,360
Before you do anything next time,

87
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,639
you should tell me in advance.

88
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,160
Even if you don't care about yourself,

89
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,199
you should at least

90
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,240
consider the people who care about you.

91
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:07,639
Okay.

92
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,680
I promise it won't happen again.

93
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,870

95
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,319
for Mr. Oscar

96
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,820
who drank that glass
of gin and tonic first yesterday,

97
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,800
the one lying in bed

98
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,160
would have been my wife.

99

Ocean Hotel Corporation

100
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:28,959
owes me an explanation

101
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,319
regarding this matter.

102
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:33,319
Mr. Huo,

103
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,639
Miss Su and I hit it off right away.

104
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,639
I trust

105
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,279
there may be a misunderstanding.

106
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:39,600
But no matter what,

107
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,240
you must give us an answer.

108
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,120
Mr. Roman.

109
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,040
Mrs. Roman,

110
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,879
I'm truly sorry

111
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,000
for having brought you

112
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,160
so much trouble.

113
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:47,839
About this matter,

114
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,279
we've already started investigating it.

115
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,439
If we found out

116
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,959
that it was a deliberate act,

117
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,360
I give you my word of honor

118
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,000
that no matter who was behind it,

119
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,639
I'll not tolerate that person.

120
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,920
Mrs. Roman,

121
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,040
for you to give us

122
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,199
a chance,

123
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,600
we also regard you and Mr. Roman

124
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,199
as our good friends.

125
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,199
So I firmly believe

126
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:10,439
that this must be a misunderstanding.

127
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:11,680
Okay, then.

128
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,519
If you can't give me

129
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:14,959
a satisfactory answer

130
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,000
by 2:00 this afternoon,

131
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,240
I'll announce

132
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,240
the termination of the cooperation.

133
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,040
Let's go.

134
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,160
Mr. Huo,

135
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,120
before we get to the bottom

136
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,120
of this incident,

137
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:39,079
wouldn't it be better

138
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,399
if we avoid

139
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,839
giving Mr. Roman the impression

140
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,120
that this is deliberate poisoning?

141
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,120
Chu Chu,

142
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,759
Mr. Roman has already given us

143
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,560
the deadline.

144
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,199
There's not much time left.

145
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:51,639
I was only trying

146
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,040
to appease them.

147
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,480
As the person in charge,

148
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,480
my nephew

149
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:57,600
has gone missing

150
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,639
and turned his back on this matter!

151
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,279
I had no choice.

152
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:13,839
Hello?

153
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:15,720
Have you found Mr. Li?

154
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,480
Not yet.

155
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,800
I've searched all over the city.

156
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,360
I'm driving towards the suburbs now.

157
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:21,279
If we don't give a satisfactory answer

158
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,920
by 2:00 this afternoon,

159
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,000
Roman will withdraw from the deal.

160
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,079
You must find Mr. Li

161
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,800
before then.

162
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,759
Okay.

163
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,800
(Incoming Call)

164
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,360
Hello?

165
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,679
Ying Song, it's me.

166
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,720
Mr. Li!

167
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,919
How did it go?

168
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,200
Mr. Roman

169
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,759
has given his ultimatum.

170
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,320
This matter has caused great concern

171
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,000
to Ocean's shareholders.

172
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,399
They'll hold

173
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,039
a shareholders' meeting soon.

174
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,200
We won't know

175
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,720
how Huo Jian
and Chen Heng Sheng

176
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,740
will distort the truth at the meeting.

177
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:06,120
We must go back now.

178
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:08,480
Ming Hao,

179
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,279
I might need you to settle

180
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,320
the hospital bills first.

181
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,080
Thanks.

182
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,600
Don't worry.

183
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,399
I'll pay you back with interest.

184
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,639
For this clothe too.

185
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,039
I'll accompany him there first.

186
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,240
I'll leave this to you, then.

187
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,360
Xie Yi,

188
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:37,759
I'll protect you.

189
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:39,960
What do you mean?

190
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,039
You asked me

191
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,759
to look into Chen Heng Sheng, right?

192
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:45,399
I want to offer you

193
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,120
some practical help.

194
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,440
Thank you, Ming Hao.

195
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:50,960
Go on now.

196
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,770
(Corrosive)
(Danger)

197
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,000
At 2:00 this afternoon,

198
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,240
we must give Mr. Roman

199
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,600
an explanation.

200
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,759
The shareholders are crying

201
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,360
for a meeting.

202
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:36,000
In the meeting,

203
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,240
I'll reveal Su Xie Yi's identity.

204
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:38,960
So

205
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,720
there must be no mistake on your side.

206
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:44,519
Okay.

207
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,840
Don't worry.

208
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,960
They probably won't be back in time

209
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:49,320
before everything is over here.

210
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:50,399
Besides, that place

211
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,440
has no mobile phone signal.

212
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,279
I think nothing will go wrong.

213
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,480
Very good.

214
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:57,480
After this matter is over,

215
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,200
put out a word

216
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,960
to his driver and let him do the search.

217
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,000
Okay.

218
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,039
Is Chen Heng Sheng reliable?

219
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,080
I helped him solve

220
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,120
his son's issue.

221
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,600
He wouldn't dare to betray me.

222
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,550
(Li Ze Liang)

223
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,159
Mr. Huo,

224
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,720
Mr. Roman has already spoken.

225
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:25,399
If we don't give him

226
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:26,639
a reasonable explanation

227
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,759
by 2:00 this afternoon,

228
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,720
he'll officially announce

229
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,879
the cancellation of the auction,

230
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,320
terminate the cooperation with Ocean,

231
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,720
and claim compensation

232
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:37,759
according to the contract.

233
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:38,919
What is going on

234
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,200
with Li Ze Liang?

235
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:41,840
We trusted him so much.

236
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,600
Am I right?

237
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:43,600
Mr. Huo,

238
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,039
we can't rely on him anymore.

239
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:47,519
You should think of something.

240
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,300
Ladies and gentlemen,

241
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:55,980
we've already reached a conclusion

242
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:57,300
about the incident yesterday.

243
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,200
(Yunfeng Hotel)
After what happened,

244
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,180
we've invited a testing laboratory
to do a test.

245
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,240
I can confidently

246
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,039
tell you

247
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,440
that it wasn't an accident.

248
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,900
(Dangerous Pollutants. No Admittance)

249
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,100
(Chen Heng Sheng)

250
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,759
Chen Heng Sheng.

251
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:47,639
Mr. Xie?

252
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:49,679
What are you doing here?

253
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,720
I remember a book saying

254
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,039
that murders usually return

255
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,440
to the crime scene.

256
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,039
It seems to be true.

257
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:01,240
I don't know what you mean.

258
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,320
So tell me,

259
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:04,400
why did you come here

260
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,599
as soon as you got a call

261
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,359
from Li Ze Liang?

262
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Li Ze Liang...

263
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,759
Mr. Li is missing.

264
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,799
Everyone is worried.

265
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,720
I came here by following the trails.

266
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,440
Is there anything wrong with that?

267
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,240
I have looked into someone lately.

268
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,559
His name

269
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:26,720
is Chen Wei Ran.

270
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:30,880
In front of you

271
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,079
is the testing report.

272
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:34,000
According to

273
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,359
what we know so far,

274
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,100
it was Su Xie Yi

275
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,319
who mixed this drink

276
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,920
(Testing Report)
for Mrs. Roman.

277
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,240
But Oscar drank it

278
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,359
during the process,

279
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:42,839
which led to him being poisoned.

280
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,119
Other than Su Xie Yi,

281
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,580
who else has touched this drink?

282
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,279
This is what I'm about to tell you.

283
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,740
Based on the surveillance footage,

284
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,000
Su Xie Yi was the only one

285
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:55,500
who touched this drink.

286
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,599
So we're certain

287
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:01,799
that Su Xie Yi is the one behind it.

288
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,079
Her target

289
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:04,839
was Mrs. Roman.

290
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,599
Are we going to convict her

291
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:08,780
just because she was the only one

292
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,079
who touched that drink?

293
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:12,319
My apologies.

294
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:14,680
I'm merely stating the facts.

295
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,160
During the absence

296
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:18,720
of the person in question,

297
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,799
who are we to make such an assumption?

298
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,319
Let me ask you, then.

299
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:23,839
Where is she now?

300
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,079
Yes,

301
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:26,839
find her and confront her.

302
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,000
After the incident,

303
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,559
Su Xie Yi left Yunfeng Hotel

304
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:31,400
and can't be contacted until now.

305
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,039
What's more strange

306
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,240
is Mr. Li is also missing.

307
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,960
Did they flee to escape from punishment?

308
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:44,119
Let me ask you this.

309
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,540
They fought hard to win the chance

310
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,880
to host Fujiade Auction

311
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,680
themselves.

312
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,839
And Mr. Li is the only person in charge

313
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:50,839
of this project.

314
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,559
Why would Su Xie Yi do this

315
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,759
when she's Mr. Li's girlfriend?

316
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,519
I had my doubts

317
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:03,880
about this question in the beginning.

318
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:05,880
But after the investigation,

319
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,079
I finally understood
the reason she did it.

320
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:09,519
The truth is,

321
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:11,599
Miss Su is not only

322
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,079
an employee of Ocean

323
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,920
and Li Ze Liang's girlfriend.

324
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,000
She has another identity too.

325
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,359
That is...

326
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:22,599
I think

327
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:23,680
the person in question

328
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,400
should be answering that herself.

329
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,519
Everyone suspects

330
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:50,000
that I dislike Mrs. Roman

331
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,640
and want to poison her.

332
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:53,599
The key

333
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:55,200
is every witness and evidence

334
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,039
all point to me being the only one

335
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:58,160
who touched that drink.

336
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,759
Isn't that enough?

337
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,599
Has it ever occurred to you

338
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:05,079
that there might be another possibility?

339
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:06,839
Before I made

340
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,640
the gin and tonic,

341
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,079
the ingredients I used

342
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,720
had already been poisoned.

343
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,839
This is the lemon

344
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,119
I used to make the gin and tonic

345
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:22,000
and the pick

346
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,240
that Oscar was using.

347
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:25,160
Aren't you curious

348
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,680
about why this pick would turn black?

349
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,960
(People with experience)

350
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,240
will use this to clean bracelets

351
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,359
while I

352
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,640
use it to clean my pick.

353
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,440
What I'm trying to say here

354
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:46,119
is that the lemon had been poisoned
by someone earlier.

355
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,319
After Oscar used this lemon

356
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,480
to clean his pick,

357
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,319
it naturally turned black.

358
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,839
As for these lemons,

359
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:53,640
they were prepared

360
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:55,240
by Chen Heng Sheng.

361
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,680
Mr. Li and I found out

362
00:20:58,839 --> 00:20:59,480
that he wanted

363
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,599
to destroy the poisoned lemons.

364
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,240
So we tailed him.

365
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,599
We were found out.

366
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:07,079
He pushed us

367
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,279
into an abandoned warehouse

368
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:09,480
to confine us.

369
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:11,079
That's right.

370
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,359
If we didn't manage

371
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,680
to escape in time,

372
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,200
we would have been

373
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:17,000
dead in the warehouse.

374
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,200
What?

375
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,960
I can't believe that actually happened.

376
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,559
But

377
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,160
that's only your side of the story.

378
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,519
Do you have any evidence?

379
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:26,480
That's right.

380
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:27,640
Miss Su,

381
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:30,799
the account of your experience
sounds reasonable.

382
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:33,000
But how do we know

383
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,759
if Oscar used the pick in your hand

384
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,200
on that same day?

385
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:37,519
Oscar gave her

386
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,920
that pick.

387
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:40,359
I can attest to that.

388
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:42,079
Chu Chu,

389
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,839
how are you certain it's the same pick?

390
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,680
That's right.

391
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,079
You can just use

392
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,480
a random blackened pick

393
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:51,960
and say it was robbed by
a poisoned lemon.

394
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:54,759
This evidence is outrageous.

395
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,039
How do you expect us to believe you?

396
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,440
Have they given you any response?

397
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,559
Not yet.

398
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,519
Have you contacted
the logistics company?

399
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,039
Yes.

400
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:07,920
We can move

401
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:09,839
the auction items anytime.

402
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,599
Inform the lawyer

403
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,119
to file a lawsuit against Ocean

404
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,799
after we've moved all the auction items.

405
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,440
All right.

406
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:25,839
You want evidence, right?

407
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:48,960
It's on you now.

408
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:54,720
What now?

409
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:08,839
I was behind

410
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:11,519
all of this.

411
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,559
I poisoned the drink.

412
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,960
My real target was Mrs. Roman.

413
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:20,960
My only goal

414
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:23,799
was to disrupt the auction.

415
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:28,039
So that Li Ze Liang would take the fall.

416
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:31,200
I have looked into someone lately.

417
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:33,200
His name

418
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,799
is Chen Wei Ran.

419
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,119
You must be familiar
with this person, right?

420
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,240
What are you trying to do?

421
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,200
Within two years of graduating

422
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,759
from high school,

423
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:50,359
Chen Wei Ran became

424
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:52,559
a famous violinist with natural talent

425
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,480
in the music industry.

426
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:56,160
Just tell me

427
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:57,359
what you want.

428
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,400
This matter

429
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,400
has nothing to do with my son.

430
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:00,720
Yes, it's not.

431
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,440
I'm just curious.

432
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:03,759
After graduating from high school,

433
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:04,880
he didn't continue

434
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,000
his studies.

435
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,119
He even traveled around for three years.

436
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,160
How did he become a top student

437
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:12,240
of an internationally renowned
music academy

438
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,000
in a blink of an eye?

439
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:19,720
I think there's more

440
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,880
to this story, right?

441
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,640
What exactly do you want to say?

442
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:34,720
This is the graduation photo

443
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,160
of the music academy that year.

444
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,000
There wasn't any Chen Wei Ran

445
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:38,880
in this photo.

446
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,160
Coincidentally,

447
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,680
there are a few of my friends

448
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,839
in this photo.

449
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:44,759
They said

450
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:45,599
they don't know any Chen Wei Ren.

451
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:46,920
If this matter

452
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:48,279
gets out,

453
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,160
will his graduate certificate
still be useful?

454
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,319
Mr. Xie,

455
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:55,799
no matter what happened.

456
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,480
This matter

457
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,519
has nothing to do with my son.

458
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:58,160
If you have any requests,

459
00:24:58,319 --> 00:24:59,440
you can tell me.

460
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:00,319
This has nothing

461
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,880
to do with my son.

462
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,720
It wasn't easy for my son

463
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,599
to achieve what he has today.

464
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:05,000
You can't ruin his future,

465
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,799
Mr. Xie.

466
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:06,440
So you know

467
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,000
we can't ruin anyone's future.

468
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:11,559
No matter what,

469
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,799
tell me

470
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:13,599
what you want.

471
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,599
Do you want money?

472
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:15,680
Give me a number.

473
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:16,440
I can give it to you.

474
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,640
I'll do anything you want.

475
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:17,920
How about that?

476
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,759
Don't touch my son, okay?

477
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,279
Please...

478
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,799
I don't care who you're harming!

479
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:22,519
But not

480
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:24,880
Su Xie Yi.

481
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,319
Su Xie Yi.

482
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:37,640
You're lucky that she's okay.

483
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:38,640
Or else, I wouldn't know

484
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:40,279
how I should punish you.

485
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:45,599
Mr. Xie.

486
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,559
Mr. Xie, please.

487
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,400
No matter what happened,

488
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,359
this has nothing to do

489
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:52,759
with my son.

490
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:54,559
I'll do anything you say.

491
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,000
Please, I beg you.

492
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:57,079
Okay?

493
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,119
It's simple.

494
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,119
You should take the blame
for your action.

495
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:03,440
Don't let others be the scapegoat.

496
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:07,079
Chen Heng Sheng,

497
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,039
you have the nerve to do this?

498
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,160
Or did someone

499
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,920
put you up to this?

500
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:17,680
Chen Heng Sheng,

501
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,519
as long as you tell us

502
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:21,200
who's behind this,

503
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,160
I promise

504
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,240
I'll do my best
to lighten your sentence.

505
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:29,279
Chen Heng Sheng.

506
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,920
The late Mr. Li Senior treated you well.

507
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:34,720
How could you do this

508
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,960
to his only son?

509
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:39,599
You're so heartless!

510
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:40,960
I'm so disappointed

511
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:42,640
in you.

512
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:53,880
Yes.

513
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:56,960
I did everything

514
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,000
myself.

515
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:00,559
But have anyone of you

516
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:01,680
considered my situation?

517
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:05,160
After Li Ze Liang comes back,

518
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:07,359
you cast aside Yunfeng Hotel

519
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,880
because of an auction.

520
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,319
For Yunfeng Hotel

521
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:12,240
to achieve what it has today,

522
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,000
isn't it all

523
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:15,000
because of me?

524
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:15,880
Have you ever considered

525
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,039
my situation at all?

526
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:20,799
That's right.

527
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,640
I was the one

528
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,400
who locked Li Ze Liang and Miss Su

529
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:32,119
in a sealed-off warehouse.

530
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:34,279
That was because they came after me

531
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:35,039
after they found out I was trying

532
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:36,000
to destroy the poisoned lemons.

533
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:38,759
But I never thought

534
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:39,599
of endangering

535
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:40,319
your lives at all.

536
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,519
Since I've already started it,

537
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,359
I had no other choice.

538
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,359
You scum!

539
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:47,880
How could you do such a thing

540
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,440
and damage the company's image?

541
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:51,880
I did everything

542
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,160
myself.

543
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,039
I'll take the responsibility myself.

544
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:04,839
We've found the culprit,

545
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,519
and time is almost up.

546
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,680
How do we explain this to Roman?

547
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:12,720
Ze Liang,

548
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,880
you're in charge of the auction.

549
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:18,319
What do you think?

550
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,559
I'll leave Chen Heng Sheng
to the police.

551
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,400
I'll be in charge of the auction
until the end.

552
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:28,480
Wait for me in the room.

553
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:36,350
(Yunfeng Hotel)

554
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:42,640
Thank you.

555
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,400
Mr. Li,

556
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,400
I'm serious at work.

557
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,559
I can't allow

558
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,920
any mishaps at work.

559
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:59,480
I'm glad we have cleared
the misunderstanding.

560
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,680
If I cancel

561
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,799
the auction now,

562
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,480
I'll be under more pressure

563
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,440
than you are.

564
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,400
Of course.

565
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,759
The outcome

566
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:09,279
is a win-win situation

567
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:10,559
where everyone is happy.

568
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:13,640
I've already told you

569
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:15,319
that Miss Su also mixed the drinks

570
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:17,119
for me after that.

571
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,839
If she wanted to hurt me,

572
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:20,400
would I still be standing here

573
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,720
safe and sound?

574
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,119
In any case,

575
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,519
I still need to thank

576
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:26,400
both of you

577
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,440
for your trust and support.

578
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,400
I guarantee

579
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,960
this auction

580
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:31,880
will be a success.

581
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:32,880
Good.

582
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:35,319
We look forward to it.

583
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,000
This way, please.

584
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:39,920
Let's go.

585
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,480
Okay.

586
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:48,680
Ze Liang,

587
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:51,599
what did you tell

588
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:52,480
Mr. Roman?

589
00:29:58,279 --> 00:29:58,880
Have you heard

590
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:01,200
of bongkrekic acid?

591
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:03,680
I asked Oscar to admit

592
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,359
that he ate expired food,

593
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:05,920
which led to food poisoning.

594
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,480
That's why he passed out on the stage.

595
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,000
Of course, Mr. Roman's ultimate goal

596
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:11,480
is that the auction

597
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,640
can be held as scheduled.

598
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,599
So even if this reason

599
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:16,119
doesn't make so much sense,

600
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,160
he would choose to believe it.

601
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,839
That's why he explained to the guests

602
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,920
for us on the stage.

603
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,240
I knew

604
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,759
Huo Jian

605
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,680
was behind this.

606
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:31,599
Chu Chu,

607
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:32,920
I've already told you

608
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,440
that I don't want you to get involved

609
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:36,680
in the business between Huo Jian and me.

610
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:38,880
(I finally understood why she did it.)

611
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:40,319
The truth is,

612
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:42,400
Miss Su is not only

613
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:43,880
an employee of Ocean Hotel

614
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,720
and Li Ze Liang's girlfriend.

615
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,559
She also has another identity.

616
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:53,079
During the meeting, he said

617
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:55,200
Su Xie Yi has another identity

618
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,480
other than being your girlfriend.

619
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,039
What's her identity?

620
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,079
Ji.

621
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,519
Miss Su?

622
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,039
Don't tell me
that you want to use this car again.

623
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:10,440
I can't let you use it.

624
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,200
It's a company car.

625
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,319
You got me wrong.

626
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,599
I'm here to ask

627
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:18,640
if you have the contact number

628
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,799
of Yan's attending doctor.

629
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,440
Why do you need it?

630
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,079
Yan's leg has inflammation.

631
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,359
I want to ask

632
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,319
the attending doctor

633
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,000
how to take care of him better.

634
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,799
He got hurt because of me.

635
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:31,839
I feel guilty about it.

636
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:33,920
So I want to do something for him.

637
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:41,359
I've sent it to you.

638
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:46,319
Thank you, Ji.

639
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:52,039
Don' tell Mr. Li

640
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:52,880
I gave it to you, okay?

641
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:55,119
Okay.

642
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,039
(Sorry,)

643
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,319
(the subscriber you've dialed)

644
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,720
(can't be connected for the moment.)

645
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:12,640
Don't take what Huo Jian said seriously.

646
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:14,160
His goal

647
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,240
is to suppress me

648
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:16,640
and stop me from proving my worth.

649
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:17,759
Ze Liang,

650
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:19,200
if you and Su Xie Yi

651
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,400
are putting on an act.

652
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,880
Don't you think you should end it now?

653
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,880
Huo Jian is obviously

654
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,920
using Su Xie Yi as an excuse

655
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,720
to target you.

656
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,119
If you continue with your act,

657
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,200
you'll be in danger.

658
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:30,960
It'll only bring harm

659
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,160
to yourself and your career.

660
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:37,240
I know you're worried.

661
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:39,519
But it is already

662
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,279
in the past.

663
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,880
If it has happened once,

664
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,799
it'll happen again.

665
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:44,000
I don't want

666
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,200
to see you get hurt.

667
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,400
Do you know how much I worried

668
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,359
about you last night?

669
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,440
I'm sorry.

670
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,079
I just hope

671
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,880
you can protect yourself.

672
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,079
As for Miss Su,

673
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,559
it's best for you two

674
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,920
to keep your distance for now.

675
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,319
Chu Chu,

676
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,000
thank you for worrying about me.

677
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:24,799
I'm certain Xie Yi and I

678
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,200
will be more mature

679
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,559
in our decision-making.

680
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,279
As for Chen Heng Sheng,

681
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:40,039
I've reported it to the police.

682
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,000
After he's convicted,

683
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:46,240
I'll ask you

684
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,480
to prepare

685
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,000
a final official statement

686
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,279
in the name of the hotel.

687
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,440
Okay.

688
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:57,400
I'll send Chen Heng Sheng off.

689
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,720
Thanks for your coffee.

690
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,599
Mr. Roman has decided

691
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,679
to continue cooperating with us.

692
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,519
The shareholders

693
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:26,159
are satisfied
with Li Ze Liang's decision.

694
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:28,960
We seem to have underestimated

695
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:29,960
this nephew of yours.

696
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,280
He can't take over Yunfeng Hotel

697
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,239
that easily.

698
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,280
Mr. Li, eat slowly.

699
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,119
Why?

700
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,639
Listen.

701
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,320
Since last night,

702
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:01,039
I only had

703
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:02,119
some oats with milk.

704
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:03,199
I didn't each much

705
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:04,119
this morning either.

706
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,840
When I sent Mr. Chen off,

707
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,880
my stomach was growling.

708
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:08,039
And you're telling me to eat slowly?

709
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:09,920
Then dig in.

710
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,599
Pass those soup dumplings to me.

711
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:17,480
Huo Jian had it too easy

712
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:19,039
since Chen Heng Sheng
took all the blame.

713
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:21,000
By the way,

714
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,039
have you sorted

715
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:23,559
all of Huo Jian's purchases

716
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:24,599
in the name of the hotel?

717
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,280
Those works of art

718
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,719
have been transported from Ocean

719
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:29,960
to the warehouse designated by you.

720
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:32,320
Works of art?

721
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,920
Those are just a pile of counterfeits,

722
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,039
a pile of trash.

723
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:39,360
He suggested my father

724
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,360
buy the so-called works of art

725
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,159
on the grounds

726
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,000
that a five-start hotel needs class.

727
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,960
My dad thought that he had a point.

728
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,119
But he didn't know much
about art collections.

729
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,760
Out of his trust toward Huo Jian,

730
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:51,679
he left the matter entirely

731
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:52,840
to him.

732
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:55,480
Unexpectedly...

733
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,920
Huo Jian took the money

734
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,440
for himself.

735
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:00,559
If we haven't been investigating

736
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:01,679
this matter secretly for the past year,

737
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:02,880
I fear no one would ever

738
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:04,119
discover this secret.

739
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:07,440
Why did you think

740
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:08,360
I worked so hard

741
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,320
to fight for this auction?

742
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,400
I'm not only doing this

743
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,440
to seek the limelight.

744
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:12,920
The experts will be

745
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,159
at this auction.

746
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,639
Those works of art

747
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,960
are Huo Jian's weakness.

748
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:17,760
Once we display them,

749
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,079
it'll ruin Huo Jian's reputation.

750
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,440
Tomorrow,

751
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:24,320
you must make sure

752
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,920
that these things can arrive
at the venue smoothly.

753
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:26,880
Don't worry, Mr. Li.

754
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,679
This move of yours

755
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,920
is well hidden.

756
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,360
A good one though.

757
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:34,519
Stop flattering me.

758
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:35,360
Join me.

759
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:37,360
Anything to drink?

760
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:38,800
It's choking me.

761
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:40,000
Black soy milk.

762
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:41,960
Black soy milk?

763
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,039
You have good taste.

764
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:56,880
Where are you going, Mr. Li?

765
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,000
I have plans.

766
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:01,400
I'll get the car, then.

767
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,320
No need.

768
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,039
I'll go myself.

769
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,519
Take this green bean cake along
with you, then.

770
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,440
You can eat on your way there.

771
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,400
