19
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,319
Xie Qing.

20
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,560
I must admit

21
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,000
that I did have feelings for Xie Yi.

22
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,159
But ever since I lost you,

23
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,360
I realized

24
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:18,599
that you are the one

25
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:20,719
I loved the most.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,080
There is no one in this world

27
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,759
who loves me
and treats me better than you.

28
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,319
And there is no one

29
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,599
who cares more for me

30
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,520
and would do anything for me
in this world than you.

31
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,639
Just as how I protect you,

32
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,520
you would protect me too,

33
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,800
right?

34
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,199
Hello? Mr. Li?

35
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,280
You were right.

36
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,960
Xie Ming Hao moved into

37
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,400
a new apartment in the east of the city.

38
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,400
I suspect Shen Xie Qing

39
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,360
lives here too.

40
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,919
He went through all that effort

41
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,280
to hide her.

42
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:06,439
He must be worried

43
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,000
that she would let something slip.

44
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,159
That's right.

45
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,479
The more he doesn't want us to see her,

46
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,400
the more certain it is
that he is hiding something.

47
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,599
Xie Ming Hao must

48
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:17,199
be involved
with what happened that year.

49
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,199
No.

50
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:21,240
I'm worried he'll harm Xie Qing.

51
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,879
We must get Xie Qing away
from there immediately.

52
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,960
Xie Ming Hao hasn't left

53
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,479
since he went inside last night.

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,240
Should I go in and check?

55
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,479
Don't alert him.

56
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,199
I'll think of a way.

57
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,360
All right.

58
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,039
Chu Chu.

59
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,360
Mr. Li.

60
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,840
I'm back.

61
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:57,560
Why are you standing there?

62
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,159
Have a seat.

63
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:09,120
Ms. Shi.

64
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:10,879
Weren't you on break?

65
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,439
You came back so soon.

66
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,800
Did you not want me
to come back so soon?

67
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,319
Of course I want to you be back soon.

68
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,000
Without you around,

69
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,199
many things need

70
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,639
to be taken care of but lack
someone capable of handling them.

71
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,199
We haven't decided on a supplier
for the materials

72
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,800
for the construction
of Lantian Bay Resort yet.

73
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,639
How could I enjoy my break?

74
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,279
So I came back to work early.

75
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,279
Perfect.

76
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:34,879
We've decided on a supplier

77
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,800
for the external wall
insulation materials.

78
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,360
Take a look.

79
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,240
Already?

80
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:43,720
This is

81
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,720
(Construction material catalog, Anyu)
a supplier with good credentials.

82
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,040
Xie Yi

83
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:49,000
chose it.

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,920
That's good.

85
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,560
You can't go wrong

86
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,839
with Miss Su's choice.

87
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,480
Chu Chu.

88
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,240
You know

89
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,839
I don't wish for there to be

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,160
any misunderstandings
between you and Xie Yi.

91
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,000
Actually, I've thought about it

92
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,399
over the past few days.

93
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,040
You were right.

94
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,480
Even if I don't believe Su Xie Yi,

95
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,079
I should have faith in you.

96
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,519
Besides, there were many
suspicious aspects

97
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,879
regarding the incident
with He Jiang Hua.

98
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,199
I shouldn't have acted on impulse

99
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,319
and questioned her.

100
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:26,120
That's the Shi Chu Chu I know.

101
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,839
Thank you.

102
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,600
I'll get back to work then.

103
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:38,879
Oh, right.

104
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,759
There's an important contract
that needs to be drawn up

105
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,439
this afternoon.

106
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,800
I need you to invite Mr. Xie over.

107
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,160
All right.

108
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,279
Xie Qing,

109
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:11,879
have some porridge.

110
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,199
Be good. Have some.

111
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,439
Xie Qing is a good girl.

112
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,199
The wedding dress you drew is beautiful.

113
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,199
Did you know?

114
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:32,360
Not being able to help you
put on your wedding dress myself

115
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,759
has always been one of my regrets.

116
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,160
You must tell me

117
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
when you regain your consciousness.

118
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,720
I will make it

119
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:38,959
up to you.

120
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,160
Come on. Have some more.

121
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,879
Hold on.

122
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,839
Hello? Ms. Shi?

123
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,720
Is something the matter?

124
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,800
Mr. Xie,

125
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,920
I have an urgent agreement
that needs to be drawn up.

126
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,199
Can you come over to the company?

127
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,160
Now?

128
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,600
Yes. Now.

129
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,199
All right. I'll be right there.

130
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,040
Xie Qing.

131
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,639
I need to go out for a bit.

132
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,000
Stay home and wait for me

133
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,360
to come back.

134
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,839
Xie Qing,

135
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:27,959
I'm leaving.

136
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,160
Stay at home and be good.

137
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,839
Ming Hao.

138
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:50,600
Ming Hao.

139
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,199
I am the one

140
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:53,680
you love the most,

141
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,519
right?

142
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,800
You are the one I love the most.

143
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,040
Mr. Li, Xie Ming Hao has left.

144
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:31,279
Follow him immediately.

145
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,120
Don't give him a chance to turn back.

146
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,240
Keep me informed of his whereabouts.

147
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,000
I'll head over right away.

148
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,679
Yes.

149
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,519
Xie Ming Hao

150
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,639
lives on the 16th floor
of the first building.

151
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,240
I don't know his exact apartment number.

152
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,080
Hurry!

153
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,519
Get the fire extinguisher! Hurry!

154
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:39,960
Quickly!

155
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,320
Okay.

156
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:44,960
Hello? Is anyone home?

157
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:45,759
I'm from property management.

158
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,159
Your smoke detector was sounded.

159
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,759
Is anyone home?

160
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:56,200
Split up and look for
the source of the fire.

161
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,200
All right.

162
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:05,240
Over here.

163
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,279
Who's there?

164
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:28,559
Hello?

165
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,799
Hello? Mr. Xie?

166
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:30,879
I'm from property management.

167
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,559
Your apartment's

168
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:32,399
smoke detector

169
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,200
was sounded earlier,

170
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,159
so we came to check on it,

171
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,480
but there wasn't a fire.

172
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:36,759
But when I opened the door,

173
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:37,399
a woman

174
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,519
ran out of your apartment.

175
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,759
That is my sister.

176
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,039
She is mentally unstable.

177
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,559
But it's all right.

178
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,120
She would be somewhere nearby.

179
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:48,879
I'll go and look for her.

180
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,620
(Li Ze Liang)

181
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,080
Hello?

182
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,720
Hello, Mr. Li Ze Liang.

183
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,200
This is Shen Xie Qing.

184
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:50,360
Ms. Shi.

185
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:52,039
This is a supplier I found

186
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,840
for the external wall

187
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,679
insulation materials when you were away.

188
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,000
These are their information

189
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,720
and the procurement contract I drew up.

190
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,279
Is there a problem?

191
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:08,639
Miss Su.

192
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:11,200
I've given it some thought
over the past few days.

193
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,519
Ze Liang was right.

194
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,919
There are many suspicious aspects

195
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,039
concerning the issue.

196
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,240
Perhaps, I was too stressed,

197
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,559
so I lashed out at you.

198
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,200
You wouldn't take it to heart,
would you?

199
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:24,799
Of course not.

200
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,840
You were only considering
the best for the company.

201
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,960
I understand.

202
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,120
Thank you.

203
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,799
However, I still have
the same words for you.

204
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,399
Do well at work.

205
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,960
Yes, Ms. Shi.

206
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,559
I'll leave the contract with you.

207
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:39,600
If

208
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:40,799
there aren't any problems,

209
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,440
we can proceed with the procedures.

210
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,480
All right.

211
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,840
I'll take a good look at it.

212
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,200
I have to admit

213
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,240
that you are

214
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,639
quite efficient.

215
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,360
Go ahead and do your best.

216
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:54,480
Thank you, Ms. Shi.

217
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:56,240
I'll get back to work then.

218
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,070
(External Wall Insulation Material
Procurement Contract)

219
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,480
Hello, Mr. Li.

220
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,080
You've actually recovered?

221
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:39,159
It's as if I had a dream.

222
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:41,919
And now, it's finally time to wake up.

223
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,759
This is great.

224
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,080
Xie Yi would be overjoyed

225
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,639
to know about this.

226
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,679
I'll give her a call.

227
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,960
Wait, Mr. Li.

228
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,399
Don't call her yet.

229
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:56,600
Why not?

230
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,200
Has...

231
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,759
Xie Yi been well?

232
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,679
You'll know when you see her.

233
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,039
I called you

234
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,720
because I don't want to see her.

235
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,879
I let her down.

236
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,320
I'm embarrassed to see her.

237
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,399
Is it because of Zhiwei?

238
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:28,000
You must have found out a lot

239
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,600
about what happened back then, I'm sure.

240
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:31,000
Pardon my bluntness,

241
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:35,240
but do you know the K of Spades?

242
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,559
Of course.

243
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,559
I am K of Spades.

244
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,559
I'm the one behind everything

245
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,080
that happened to Zhiwei back then.

246
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,600
From what I know,

247
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,480
Uncle Shen had always

248
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,679
treated you well back then.

249
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,399
Why did you do those things?

250
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,039
Yes.

251
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:13,679
He had always treated me well.

252
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:15,759
But all along,

253
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,759
I had felt

254
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,320
insecure and inferior

255
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,799
because I was adopted.

256
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,200
When I was young,

257
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,639
I was jealous of how much love

258
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,720
Xie Yi got from our father.

259
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,440
When I grew up,

260
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:32,440
I was jealous
because Xie Yi owns Zhiwei.

261
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:35,120
No matter how much effort I put in,

262
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,480
how hard I worked,

263
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,799
in the end,

264
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,840
all I did would only be for her.

265
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,200
Our father would never

266
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,600
hand Zhiwei to me.

267
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:48,600
All of this happened

268
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,879
only because

269
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,320
Xie Yi was his biological daughter.

270
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,399
And I wasn't.

271
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,200
So you hollowed out Zhiwei

272
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:06,240
and had Huo Jian set a trap.

273
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,880
But I never thought

274
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:17,559
that after

275
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,240
finding out everything I did,

276
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,119
my father didn't blame me...

277
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,640
He even sacrificed himself
to protect me.

278
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,079
All along...

279
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,559
All this time,

280
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:35,799
he had treated me
like his own biological daughter.

281
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,400
Yet, I didn't trust him.

282
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,480
It's all my fault.

283
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:45,359
I'm to blame for everything.

284
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:49,599
I let him down.

285
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,279
I'm sorry.

286
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,160
Was Xie Ming Hao involved too?

287
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,599
He...

288
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:07,359
He was only

289
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:08,400
following my orders.

290
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:12,279
Xie Qing.

291
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,119
Why are you

292
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,480
still protecting him?

293
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,079
What do you mean?

294
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:20,119
I don't understand.

295
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,119
Let me ask you this.

296
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,880
If you were K of Spades,

297
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:28,960
then how would Huo Jian

298
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,440
suddenly find out that Xie Yi and I

299
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:33,599
were in Yun'an Town
when we were searching

300
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,079
for Liu Ah Wei?

301
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:36,559
And why would Xie Ming Hao

302
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,400
coincidentally show up

303
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,680
at the same place?

304
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,400
Xie Qing, you should know

305
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,519
that you've never been the one

306
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,119
Xie Ming Hao

307
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,200
truly loved.

308
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,680
Turn back.

309
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,200
You only need to speak up now

310
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,759
and you'll be able to end all of this.

311
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:56,599
Enough.

312
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,200
Do you think Xie Yi

313
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,920
would be able to handle all of this?

314
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,160
Did you forget

315
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,799
how she lost her memories
in the first place?

316
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,839
Sorry.

317
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,839
Please give me more time.

318
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,880
When I figure things out,

319
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,480
I will

320
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,720
take responsibility
for everything I have done.

321
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,160
But in the meantime,

322
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,680
please don't tell

323
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:32,559
anything about this to Xie Yi.

324
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:34,839
I know

325
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:36,400
I have no right

326
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:38,119
to ask this of you,

327
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:40,000
but I don't want to see her hurt

328
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,359
and upset over what happened in the past

329
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:42,960
ever again.

330
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,650
(Xie Yi)

331
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:05,720
Hello? Xie Yi?

332
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:07,599
Hello? Yan?

333
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:10,160
I have good news to share.

334
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:13,440
Ms. Shi acknowledged my work

335
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:14,480
today,

336
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,519
and she even approved
my procurement contract.

337
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:18,279
She's not upset with me anymore.

338
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,640
Is that so?

339
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,000
I told you

340
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,240
Ms. Shi

341
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,119
would come around.

342
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:27,599
By the way,

343
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,839
where are you?

344
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:30,119
Why aren't you back yet?

345
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:37,440
I'm still having

346
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:38,720
a meeting with a client.

347
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,240
A client?

348
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,440
Is it a man or a woman?

349
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,920
A man.

350
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:47,519
A male client?

351
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,200
Then, I have nothing to worry about.

352
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:51,480
All right.

353
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,319
Thank you, Mr. Li.

354
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,799
Actually, I only came to meet you today

355
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,119
to see if my sister

356
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:02,759
is happy.

357
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,720
Now, I can rest assured.

358
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:05,920
With you by her side,

359
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:08,200
I'm sure she'll live a happy life.

360
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,519
I hope you'll always

361
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:14,559
treat her well.

362
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,319
Both of you

363
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,480
have a private account, don't you?

364
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,720
Xie Ming Hao told you
to open it, didn't he?

365
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:35,720
You are mistaken.

366
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:37,880
There is no private account.

367
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,680
I've spent all the money.

368
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,279
Xie Qing.

369
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,160
Why are you still

370
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,640
protecting him?

371
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,559
You only have

372
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,079
to make that private account public,

373
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,279
and the transactions

374
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,319
within it will be able

375
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,279
to prove whether he is

376
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,319
innocent or not.

377
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:00,440
Ming Hao...

378
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,279
His fate

379
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,599
lies in his own hands.

380
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:08,880
What do you mean?

381
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:26,920
This is what we'll do.

382
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:30,799
Xie Ming Hao must have been
looking for you.

383
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,279
I'll find you

384
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:32,880
a safe place

385
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,880
to stay for now.

386
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,039
We'll discuss the other things

387
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:37,519
at a later date.

388
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,920
Thank you.

389
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:46,480
I need to use the washroom.

390
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,920
(Ocean Group)

391
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:03,960
I apologize for keeping you

392
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:04,759
waiting.

393
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,079
It's all right.

394
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:10,720
This is a printout of the contract

395
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,599
we agreed upon

396
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,640
and drew up.

397
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,599
We have confirmed everything on our end.

398
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:15,720
Please go through it as well.

399
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,119
If everything is in order,

400
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:17,960
we may officially

401
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:18,960
sign the agreement.

402
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:20,519
There's no need for that.

403
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,839
Mr. Xie drafted the agreement.

404
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,440
I have complete faith in him.

405
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:27,759
Besides, I've read the soft copy

406
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:29,039
at least ten or more times.

407
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,079
Let's sign the contract immediately.

408
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:32,960
All right.

409
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,519
Then, I'll sign and seal the agreement

410
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,359
on behalf of Ocean Group.

411
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,440
All right.

412
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,200
This is your copy.

413
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,000
This is for you as well.

414
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,160
To fruitful cooperation.

415
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,160
To fruitful cooperation.

416
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,720
Hello? Ming Hao?

417
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,680
Xie Yi,

418
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:52,960
Xie Qing is missing.

419
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,119
What?

420
00:24:58,279 --> 00:24:58,640
Xie Yi.

421
00:24:58,759 --> 00:24:59,720
Ming Hao, where is my sister?

422
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,480
Come inside first.

423
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,960
To take care of your sister better,

424
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:04,039
I moved her

425
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:05,160
to a better and quieter apartment.

426
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:06,440
I was planning to make her some soup,

427
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,079
but she...

428
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,240
ran out on her own.

429
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,200
So what's going on right now?

430
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,960
She left this note.

431
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,359
I'm worried. What if...

432
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,359
she does something to hurt herself?

433
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,279
(Ming Hao, I love you.)

434
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,680
(But I don't know)

435
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,720
(how I should face this world)

436
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:22,920
(and you.)

437
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:24,559
(Living)

438
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,279
(means only pain and suffering for me.)

439
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,319
(Perhaps only in death)

440
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,119
(can I find salvation.)

441
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:31,079
(I will be going now.)

442
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:32,119
(Do not come and find me.)

443
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,079
We have to find her immediately.

444
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:37,000
Let's go.

445
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:39,359
Xie Qing!

446
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,680
Xie Qing!

447
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:45,359
Xie Qing!

448
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:47,279
Sorry.

449
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,160
Xie Qing!

450
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:59,039
Xie Qing!

451
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,920
Xie Qing!

452
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,559
Xie Qing!

453
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,039
Xie Qing!

454
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:07,200
I can't find her anywhere, Ming Hao.

455
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:14,599
Let's look over there.

456
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:17,400
- Xie Qing!
- Xie Qing!

457
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,720
- Xie Qing!
- Xie Qing!

458
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,720
What is it, Xie Yi?

459
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,119
Xie Yi.

460
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,279
You haven't eaten anything all day.

461
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,839
Have some milk.

462
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:14,839
Xie Yi.

463
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,799
I know

464
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,920
you're upset,

465
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:21,400
but you have

466
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:22,640
to take care of your body too.

467
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,160
Don't worry.

468
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,240
Xie Qing will be fine.

469
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:30,240
We've contacted the police.

470
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:33,119
They will find her.

471
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:37,559
It's my fault.

472
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,480
I was so obsessed with getting revenge.

473
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,440
I never thought about

474
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,440
spending more time with her.

475
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:50,480
I only thought of myself.

476
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,319
I never thought about

477
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:54,480
how lonely she could be.

478
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,400
She was on her way to a full recovery,

479
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:01,160
but I didn't know anything about it.

480
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,720
Yan.

481
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:07,119
Do you think

482
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:08,759
I let her down?

483
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,319
No, you didn't.

484
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:20,079
You have to believe

485
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,640
in how much she cares for you.

486
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,119
She must want you

487
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:26,799
to be happy

488
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,599
and live well too.

489
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,039
Then, why...

490
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:35,000
Why would she rather disappear

491
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,359
than see me?

492
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,920
She must blame me

493
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,160
for not spending more time with her.

494
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:43,559
She must be upset with me...

495
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:03,720
Sir,

496
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:05,200
the lady who was in this seat earlier

497
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,480
left a note for you.

498
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,440
Thank you.

499
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,920
(Thank you for listening to me.)

500
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:17,880
(I haven't figured out)

501
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:19,359
(how to face Xie Yi yet.)

502
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,640
(I need more time.)

503
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,400
(Please do not tell Xie Yi
about this matter)

504
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,359
(for now.)

505
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:25,119
(I will be in touch again.)

506
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,599
(I hope you and Xie Yi
will stay happy together.)

507
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:33,440
(I'm sorry, Xie Yi.)

508
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:35,839
(I can't tell you what happened)

509
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:37,279
(to your family back then.)

510
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,319
(It would be too cruel to you.)

511
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:41,759
(That's why I can't tell you)

512
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,279
(about my meeting with your sister.)

513
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:46,599
(Your sister's matter is too odd.)

514
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,559
(I will find out the truth
for your sake.)

515
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:51,440
(You only need to speak up now)

516
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,039
(and you'll be able to end all of this.)

517
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,720
Do you think Xie Yi

518
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,319
will be able to handle all of this?

519
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,119
Don't forget

520
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,680
how she lost her memories
in the first place.

521
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:20,799
Miss Su has fallen asleep?

522
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,400
She cried a lot earlier.

523
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,400
She tired herself out.

524
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:38,119
There are still no signs

525
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:39,440
of Xie Qing's body as of yet.

526
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,240
However, the estuary was not far

527
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:42,119
from that river.

528
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:45,359
Her chances of survival are slim.

529
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,039
And she left a suicide note as well.

530
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:54,359
Xie Qing said
she would take responsibility

531
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,079
for what she did.

532
00:31:57,839 --> 00:31:59,279
I thought she would turn herself in,

533
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,400
but why would she suddenly

534
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,720
decide to end her own life?

535
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,799
Moreover, another thing

536
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:11,519
is odd as well.

537
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,759
What is it?

538
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:15,440
I clearly remember

539
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:17,720
that she wasn't carrying

540
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,039
that doll with her

541
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,119
when I met her.

542
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,640
But Xie Yi said

543
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:24,359
she saw that doll

544
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:26,880
floating on the river,

545
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,759
and that's how she deducted
her sister committed suicide.

546
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:30,720
Could she have

547
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,240
gone back to retrieve it?

548
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:36,960
Xie Qing escaped from that apartment.

549
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,160
Xie Ming Hao was
looking for her as well.

550
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,119
If she had gone back

551
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:42,839
just to retrieve that doll,

552
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,119
wouldn't she have increased

553
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:46,240
her risk of being found out
by Xie Ming Hao?

554
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:48,200
That doesn't make sense.

555
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:49,799
That's true.

556
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:52,359
However, with this incident,

557
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,359
we'll have lost our trail

558
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:55,559
on Xie Ming Hao as well.

559
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,000
The most important thing to do right now

560
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:14,359
is to comfort Xie Yi.

561
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:17,440
Xie Qing's death is too much

562
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,200
for her.

563
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:19,880
I know very well

564
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:22,480
how much suffering she has been in

565
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:24,119
for this period of time.

566
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:27,160
Mr. Li.

567
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,680
You have to take care of yourself too.

568
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:30,680
You've been

569
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:32,400
overexerting yourself

570
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,200
for Miss Su lately.

571
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,400
I'm concerned about your health.

572
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,160
I'm fine.

573
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Don't worry about me.

574
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:51,000
You've been working hard lately as well.

575
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:52,599
I'm only doing what I should.

576
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:08,079
(Xie Qing.)

577
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,960
(To think you met Li Ze Liang.)

578
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,400
(Good.)

579
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:14,599
(You gave me another useful card.)

580
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,800
(You've always been
in the wrong position.)

581
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,440
(From tomorrow on,)

582
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,199
(everything)

583
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,960
(shall return to their rightful places.)

584
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,000
Xie Yi.

585
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,079
The weather is nice today.

586
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:34,079
Let's go out for a bit.

587
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,360
I don't feel like going out.

588
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:38,440
You've been staying home all day lately.

589
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,320
I'm worried you'll be bored.

590
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:43,719
I'm fine.

591
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,960
You should get to work.

592
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:50,079
I'll be working from home
for these few days.

593
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:51,639
I want to keep you company.

594
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:55,000
I'm really fine.

595
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,280
That won't do either.

596
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,199
Look at you.

597
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,239
You haven't been eating properly.

598
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:01,199
Your body

599
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,360
won't be able to handle that.

600
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:04,960
How about this?

601
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,320
I'll make you

602
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,840
your favorite crab roe noodles.

603
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:11,960
All right.

604
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:14,039
I'll go and buy the best

605
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,360
hairy crabs for you.

606
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:16,920
You stay home by yourself

607
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:17,800
for a bit.

608
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,199
Okay.

609
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,760
Good girl.

610
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:26,039
I'm off then.

611
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,719
Wait for me.

612
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,510
(Ming Hao)

613
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,400
Hello? Ming Hao?

614
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,679
Ming Hao?

615
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,079
Xie Qing.

616
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,360
Are you upset with me?

617
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:17,639
I'm Xie Yi.

618
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:18,840
Ming Hao?

619
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,800
Are you drunk?

620
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,679
Xie Qing, where are you?

621
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:26,719
Come back.

622
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,119
Don't leave me.

623
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,039
Ming Hao,

624
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:36,519
are you all right?

625
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,679
Why didn't you take me with you?

626
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,559
Ming Hao,

627
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:43,440
don't do anything silly.

628
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,159
I'll...

629
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,320
(Xie Yi)

630
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,119
Sorry.

631
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:06,320
The number you have dialed

632
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,639
is currently unavailable.

633
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:36,480
Ming Hao.

634
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:37,960
Xie Yi.

635
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,159
Xie Qing...

636
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,039
Why isn't

637
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:50,239
my Xie Qing back yet?

638
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,719
Stop drinking.

639
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,760
Xie Qing will be sad to know.

640
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:58,559
What is the point of living

641
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,159
without Xie Qing?

642
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:06,559
Xie Yi.

643
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,559
Promise me

644
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,519
you won't leave me.

645
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,800
All right?

646
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,199
Ming Hao.

647
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:30,519
If you're upset, cry it out.

648
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,079
You'll feel much better.

649
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Thank you.

650
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:57,280
This used to be

651
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,679
your sister's favorite doll.

652
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:01,320
Now that she is gone,

653
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,360
I hope you can keep it.

654
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,239
As long as you're around,

655
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:09,880
it will never be lonely.

656
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:15,639
Xie Yi.

657
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,239
I never thought

658
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:22,360
that one day, I would be able

659
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:24,360
to hand that doll to you
with my very own hands.

660
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:43,320
Xie Yi.

661
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,639
There's something

662
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,440
that has been bothering me.

663
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:46,960
I don't know if I should tell you.

664
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,480
But for your sake,

665
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,199
I think

666
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:51,440
I have to tell you.

667
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:55,159
Before she went missing,

668
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,440
Xie Qing met up with Li Ze Liang.

669
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,960
What?

670
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,880
I don't know

671
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:04,239
why she met him

672
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:05,360
or what Li Ze Liang

673
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,239
told her.

674
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,199
Could you ask him about it?

675
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:12,079
Impossible.

676
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,239
Yan has been busy lately.

677
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:17,199
He was meeting a client that day.

678
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,199
There's no way.

679
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,440
I have evidence.

680
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,000
