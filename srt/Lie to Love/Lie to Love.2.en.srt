19
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,439
Mr. Huo,

20
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,639
Yunfeng Hotel

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,599
has become

22
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:13,560
one of the three candidates

23
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,439
for Fujiade Auction's partner selection.

24
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,599
Our meeting today

25
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,919
will mainly discuss

26
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:18,879
the latest bidding tender.

27
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,479
Winning the tender

28
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:22,719
is a good opportunity

29
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,159
for Yunfeng's publicity.

30
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,280
Yes.

31
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,360
(I've told you.)

32
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,599
(It's the peak season now.)

33
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,560
(I told you to keep)

34
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,719
(all the rooms vacant.)

35
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,599
(Why did you accept
outbound reservations?)

36
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,680
(I was scared)

37
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,000
(it might be too suspicious)

38
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,400
(if the whole floor doesn't have
any outbound reservation.)

39
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,479
(I'm in charge of this matter.)

40
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,960
(Do you know how much we can make)

41
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,960
(for each room during peak season?)

42
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,080
(I understand.)

43
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,319
(What should we do now?)

44
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,400
(Go back now.)

45
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,199
(Destroy all correspondence)

46
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,840
(and relevant documents.)

47
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:49,439
(Okay.)

48
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,000
It's...

49
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:50,639
It's rubbish.

50
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,280
It's all rubbish!

51
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:53,960
Turn it off now!

52
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,039
Turn it off!

53
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,240
Enough!

54
00:02:59,039 --> 00:02:59,479
Wait.

55
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,879
I'm sorry, Mr. Huo.

56
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,240
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,520
It's my fault.

58
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:06,639
I deserve to die!

59
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,080
Enough.

60
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,840
In my office now.

61
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,319
Su Xie Yi.

62
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,240
(Interviewer)
A University of Hannover graduate

63
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,159
majoring in hotel management.

64
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,120
You have good results.

65
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,400
You did very well in every subject.

66
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
Fluent in German

67
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,680
and Italian?

68
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,840
Yes.

69
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,039
Tell me,

70
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,000
which

71
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,000
is your favorite hotel?

72
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,240
The Surrey Hotel in Auckland.

73
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,120
It has a British style

74
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,719
and is similar to
a bed and breakfast hotel.

75
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,000
Any reason why?

76
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,759
The founder of the hotel

77
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,960
is the descendant of a survivor

78
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,280
of the Titanic accident.

79
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:58,680
Maybe because

80
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,360
the family had experienced life
and death,

81
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,680
they cherish the present

82
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,520
and the memory
of old acquaintances more.

83
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,360
And they have more faith
in the beauty of life.

84
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:08,800
What is

85
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,800
a hotel to you?

86
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,000
As we all know,

87
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,680
there's a saying

88
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,199
in our hotel industry

89
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,720
that a hotel is people's second home.

90
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,959
But I have to disagree

91
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,079
because there's only one home,

92
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,800
which is irreplaceable.

93
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,879
I told you to keep an eye on Li!

94
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,800
I never asked you to cause any trouble!

95
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,160
Mr. Huo,

96
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,240
we were very cautious.

97
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,600
Someone must be

98
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:35,920
behind this.

99
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,839
Could it be

100
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:39,720
Li who did it?

101
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:41,720
This happened

102
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,040
when he had just come here.

103
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:43,959
Yes,

104
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,240
it must be him.

105
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,199
We'll know if it's him

106
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,399
after we look into it.

107
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,820

Miss Yi.

110
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,279
Uncle Bai, no need to get up.

111

Well,

113
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,040
I need to check

114
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,959
the monitors in the control room.

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,430
I need recordings for the last 12 hours.

is my goal.

125
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,879
the board of directors has decided

126
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,959
to dismiss Lin Tai officially.

127

Why are you panting
from sending the resume?

136
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,519
It is the hardest to serve

137
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,600
the prince.

138
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,639
Have you watched the drama?

139
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,199
The most difficult task in the palace

140
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,079
is to accompany the prince to study.

Mr. Li,

from Dr. Wu.

146

Why are you looking at all these?

147
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,600
Anyone sent by the HR Department

148
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,079
must have been arranged by Huo Jian.

149

One of the moles has just left.

150
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,399
Huo Jian is so anxious

151

that he's trying to send some more here.

152

Even if

153
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,920
we can't find a trustworthy one,

154
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,560
we can at least reject them, right?

155
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,800
The problem is,

156
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:26,959
this happened to Mr. Lin

157
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,879
as soon as you came to work.

158

176
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,519
I'm Su Xie Yi.

177
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:05,559
Did you see

178
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,679
that Lin Tai just now?

179
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,759
Have you heard of it?

180
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:08,480
About what happened.

181
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:10,559
I'm new, so I'm not too sure.

182
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:11,600
What happened?

183
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,519
How could you not know about it?

184
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,039
You missed out on the whole drama.

185
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:15,600
Let me tell you...

186
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
It's about giving private discounts
on the hotel rooms.

187
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,559
Mr. Lin

188
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,960
and Chen Shan, the manager
of the Housekeeping Department,

189
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,639
were behind all that.

190
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,320
We just don't know

191
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,480
who exposed this matter.

192
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,360
Two people were fired at the same time.

193
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,759
So ruthless.

194
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:28,120
That person did well.

195
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,440
That person did

196
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,679
what I didn't dare to do.

197
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,639
If I know

198
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,000
who that person is,

199
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,720
I'm going to reward him
with bravery awards.

200
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,759
They completely disregarded the prince.

201
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,000
The prince is still here.

202
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,440
You're going to make

203
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,679
the prince come out here.

204
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,039
Get back to work.

205
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:43,360
Quickly now.

206
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,039
She came as expected.

207
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,480
Please stop

208
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,360
what you're doing now.

209
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,960
Listen to me first.

210
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,639
Everyone knows

211
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:19,639
that Lin Tai was fired, right?

212
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:21,279
The job of the secretary
of the Deputy General Manager

213
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:21,879
is important.

214
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,320
It can't be delayed even by a day.

215
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,879
Anyone who's free for these few days

216
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,039
can temporarily fill in

217
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:26,919
as the Deputy General Manager's
assistant.

218
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,960
I can't.

219
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,600
I'm currently preparing a plan

220
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:31,840
that needs to be completed next week.

221
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:33,759
Jessica,

222
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:34,799
I'm busy with the report forms,

223
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,159
so count me out.

224
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,159
Lately, I...

225
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:39,919
Gong Ming Yue,

226
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:41,320
if you have time
to watch palace drama,

227
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:42,279
I'm sure you have the time

228
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,240
to be the assistant.

229
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,440
I wasn't watching it for fun.

230
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:45,919
I'm

231
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,799
studying their attires.

232
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:49,080
We're going to hold

233
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,120
a palace theme event later, right?

234
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,720
You and your excuses.

235
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,919
I can go.

236
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:05,399
Come in.

237
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:14,879
Mr. Li,

238
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,440
this is your temporary assistant,

239
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,120
Su Xie Yi.

240
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,279
Hello, Mr. Li.

241
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:20,799
Before the new secretary

242
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:21,960
is confirmed,

243
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,399
she'll temporarily
take over Lin Tai's work

244
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,039
for these few days.

245
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,919
All right.

246
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,279
You can leave now.

247
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:31,360
I want to talk to Miss Su.

248
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:32,480
Okay.

249
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,200
This is the access card of the office.

250
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Do your best.

251
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:38,919
Okay.

252
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,600
You said he hired a new employee

253
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,480
as his assistant?

254
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,799
Yes.

255
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,440
Let him be.

256
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,840
By the way,

257
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,679
how did it go at the control center?

258
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,799
I've watched the footage

259
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:19,559
a day before the incident.

260
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:20,679
There wasn't anything unusual.

261
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,240
You mean

262
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,600
no one unrelated went in?

263
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:27,720
I even checked those

264
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:28,759
from the broadcasting room.

265
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,039
He had no idea at all.

266
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,799
How can

267
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:36,120
there be no trace at all?

268
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:39,440
The timestamp is a little odd.

269
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:41,399
But in terms of motive,

270
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:43,519
Li Ze Liang is the most suspicious.

271
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,399
Do you think

272
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:46,279
he's just pretending to be weak?

273
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,759
He already knew we sent Mr. Lin

274
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,320
to watch him.

275
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,720
So he appears not working

276
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,960
but sent someone to look into Mr. Lin.

277
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,320
I guess I underestimated

278
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,799
this nephew of mine.

279
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,240
Uncle Bai,

280
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:21,360
can you copy this for me?

281
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,759
Okay.

282
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:26,360
Also...

283
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:27,440
Don't worry.

284
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,360
I'll clean it up

285
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,879
without any trace.

286
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,480
You were the one who exposed Mr. Lin.

287
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,320
Yes.

288
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,279
Why?

289
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,039
As a newcomer

290
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:55,879
who came for an interview,

291
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:56,759
I happened to record

292
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,440
such filthy affairs.

293
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:00,120
My sense of justice does not allow

294
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,279
such a person to exist.

295
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,519
Moreover,

296
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:04,519
I already said

297
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:06,559
Ocean Hotel is my number one.

298
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,559
So I won't allow

299
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,000
anything like this to happen.

300
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,399
Is that all?

301
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:13,559
No.

302
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:15,279
Thank you for letting me

303
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:15,919
be your assistant.

304
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,200
You can say

305
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,559
we're even now.

306
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,759
In the future,

307
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:25,159
I'll need your guidance on work.

308
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:27,080
All right. I'm done.

309
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,120
If there's nothing else,

310
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,480
I'll get back to work.

311
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,000
Hello, Ying Song.

312
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:44,639
I want you to look into someone.

313
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:44,639
What are you snapping?

314
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,720
I was snapping at the beautiful view.

315
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,799
Oh,

316
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,399
you said

317
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,080
you returned from overseas.

318
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,600
Were you studying abroad?

319
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,559
Yes.

320
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:03,759
Which country?

321
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,200
Germany.

322
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,799
Germany?

323
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:08,840
I came back

324
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,080
from studying in Germany too.

325
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,120
I studied hotel management.

326
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,039
Really?

327
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:13,320
Which university are you studying at?

328
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:14,559
I've already graduated.

329
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,000
The University of Hannover.

330
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,440
What a coincidence.

331
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,960
So you're my senior.

332
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:20,840
Really?

333
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,399
Hello, junior.

334
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,159
Senior,

335
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,159
you're very fortunate today.

336
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:26,480
I'm going to let you eat

337
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:28,320
the most delicious crab roe noodles
in the world.

338
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,720
Okay.

339
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,639
If you stir

340
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,000
the crab roe like this,

341
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,440
it's only going to be

342
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,279
the world's number two.

343
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,919
It lacks some soul in it.

344
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,240
That's impossible.

345
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:43,440
This is handed down from my ancestors.

346
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:45,399
Besides, how do you know

347
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,620
when you haven't even tried it?

348
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,159
Listen.

349
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,759
Crab roe itself smells fishy.

350
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,480
So it will smell fishy.

351
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,240
Moreover, this crab roe of yours

352
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,080
was under the sun for a long time.

353
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,000
We've already passed

354
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,320
the best time to eat it.

355
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,600
If you want to get rid of the smell,

356
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:01,279
you should add...

357
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,000
Vinegar.

358
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:05,920
Vinegar won't help.

359
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,839
What should I add, then?

360
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,200
(Plum Wine)

361
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,160
Give it to me.

362
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,599
Actually,

363
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,359
it's best to add Shaoxing wine
when cooking crab roe.

364
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:24,440
Crab roe cooked with Shaoxing wine

365
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,440
is fragrant, delicious, and not greasy.

366
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,519
However,

367
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:29,920
using plum wine is okay too.

368
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,960
Why are you smiling?

369
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,640
I wasn't.

370
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,720
You were looking at that side...

371
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:02,279
What is it? Let's talk inside.

372
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:13,759
You asked me

373
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,519
to look into
your temporary assistant, right?

374
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:19,720
What did you find out?

375
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,119
Based on her resume,

376
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:21,799
Miss Su

377
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,240
used to live in Germany.

378
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,960
So I sent someone to dig more

379
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,640
and found that she had been hospitalized

380
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,279
for some time two years ago.

381
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:30,519
Hospitalized?

382
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:32,240
Did you find out

383
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,680
what she was treated for?

384
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,079
The medical database system
is different.

385
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,400
Besides, it concerns
the privacy of a person.

386
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,680
So it's difficult to get more info.

387
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,640
You can stop investigating.

388
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:47,599
I'll do it myself.

389
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:57,359
Hello, Mr. Li.

390
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:58,160
Hello.

391
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,519
Mr. Li, it's this way.

392
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:01,599
I'm used to walking this way.

393
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,640
Mr. Li, hello.

394
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:03,599
Hello.

395
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:14,599
Hello, Mr. Li.

396
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,440
(Where's the contract?)

397
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,279
Li Ze Liang,

398
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:15,000
are you this childish?

399
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:35,519
(Is it sweet?)

400
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:36,240
(Yes.)

401
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,799
Don't tell your mom about this.

402
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,440
Let's make a pinky swear.

403
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:06,240
Hello?

404
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,400
Miss Su,

405
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,519
did you work overtime
on your first day at work?

406
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:13,599
Don't look around.

407
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,599
I'm not that free
to be following you around.

408
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:17,319
On your first day at work,

409
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:18,440
I'll treat you to dinner

410
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,279
as your superior.

411
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:20,599
I'll send the address

412
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,400
to you later.

413
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:34,920
(Jiu Si)

414
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,359
Mr. Li,

415
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:36,640
you've brought your friend
with you today.

416
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:39,759
Do you come here often, Mr. Li?

417
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,720
Every time I think

418
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,000
about crab roe noodles,

419
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:44,799
I'll come and eat here.

420
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:45,519
That's right.

421
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:46,799
Our crab roe noodle is the best

422
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:47,640
and the most authentic.

423
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,319
Miss, please take a look.

424
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,279
I'll have crab roe noodles as well then.

425
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,000
All right.

426
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,119
Two bowls of crab roe noodles, right?

427
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:54,079
Only one.

428
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,920
Give us two empty bowls.

429
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:57,759
We'll be sharing.

430
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:00,000
(I only prepared one serving.)

431
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,039
Let's share.

432
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,759
Let me do it.

433
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,160
Having too much of a delicacy like this

434
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:10,359
can be overkill.

435
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:11,720
Just one taste of it

436
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,359
could make this life worthwhile.

437
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:22,359
The view is beautiful.

438
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:24,359
The position of this tree

439
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,000
is too perfect.

440
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:27,559
Do you think

441
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,160
that someone moved

442
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,000
this tree here from somewhere else?

443
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:32,759
If that's the case,

444
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,240
it must be suffering.

445
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,480
Why?

446
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,880
Trees have memories too.

447
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,160
If you move a tree along with its roots

448
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,119
to a different ground,

449
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,960
they will suffer too.

450
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,640
Because

451
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,880
they can't forget their past.

452
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,319
Some trees slowly die

453
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:56,160
because they can't get used

454
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,880
to the new soil and environment.

455
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,400
Only the trees that can adapt

456
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,240
and forget their past completely

457
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:03,599
can survive.

458
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,359
It sounds pretty sad

459
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,160
when you put it like that.

460
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,640
But exchanging a new life with memories

461
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:14,559
seems to be worth it.

462
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,599
You may say so,

463
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,160
but humans

464
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:19,920
aren't objects, after all.

465
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,359
You've gone too far.

466
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,000
You cooked it with so much effort.

467
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,680
I must eat more to show my appreciation.

468
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:36,440
Hey!

469
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,880
I'm not a kid anymore.

470
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,279
There was no need to hit me
when I dropped my chopsticks.

471
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:40,839
It has nothing to do with age.

472
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,680
You need to be hit three times
if you drop your chopsticks.

473
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,599
It's my habit.

474
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,559
What kind of habit is that?

475
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,599
You have no idea, right?

476
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,480
There's an old saying

477
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:51,640
that you need to be hit three times
if you drop your chopsticks.

478
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:53,480
The first hit

479
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:54,799
means you're a fool.

480
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:56,920
The second hit

481
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:57,880
means blessing.

482
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,400
It is to wish you happiness

483
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,279
as "chopsticks falling" and "happiness"
sound similar in Chinese.

484
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:03,799
The third hit

485
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:05,359
indicates that you'll get hit

486
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:06,400
by someone very soon

487
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,599
for dropping your chopsticks.

488
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,759
People around you

489
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,920
will hit you symbolically.

490
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:11,599
That way,

491
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:12,440
we can prevent you

492
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,440
from getting beaten even worse.

493
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,839
(Petty tricks.)

494
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:21,079
(So you're trying to bring up the past)

495
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,640
(to test if I have lost my memories.)

496
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:24,920
(All right.)

497
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,039
(Bring it on.)

498
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,200
Miss Su, what are you thinking about?

499
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,920
I think

500
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,960
you must take care of your health.

501
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:36,480
You can't eat too little.

502
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,039
This is the first time

503
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,119
someone has said this to me.

504
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,400
As your temporary assistant,

505
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,400
it's my obligation to take care
of your health.

506
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,079
Your easygoing personality

507
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,240
makes me feel close to you.

508
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:52,240
Close?

509
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:54,119
It's like we've met before.

510
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,119
Also,

511
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,640
we've eaten

512
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,079
noodles from the same bowl.

513
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:09,839
That's what we called deja vu.

514
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:11,079
Most people would have

515
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,359
experienced that before.

516
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:14,480
Things they've never done before

517
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:16,200
and people they've never met,

518
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,599
yet they feel familiar with them.

519
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:23,799
Then do you

520
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:24,799
feel familiar with me?

521
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,039
For someone like you,

522
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,759
anyone would want to know you earlier.

523
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,359
I wasn't that fortunate.

524
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,480
But it's not too late to know you now.

525
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,599
I'll give a toast to you

526
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,599
with noodles instead of alcohol.

527
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,119
I thought it was supposed to be three...

528
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:50,119
What?

529
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:51,960
(Oh, no.)

530
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:52,880
(I almost gave myself away.)

531
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:55,000
What did you say just now?

532
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,920
Fishy.

533
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,680
I said fishy.

534
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,839
This crab roe smells a little fishy.

535
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:09,160
Don't you think so?

536
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,359
Yeah, it's fishy.

537
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,319
We'll just add some vinegar.

538
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,079
It'll smell even fishier
if you add vinegar.

539
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:17,440
What should we add, then?

540
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:18,440
We should add...

541
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,279
Shaoxing wine? Plum wine?

542
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,680
(Every step is a trap.)

543
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,119
We should

544
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,599
not waste time
and just order another one.

545
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:36,480
Excuse me.

546
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:42,480
The crab roe smells fishy.

547
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,440
Can you make another bowl for us?

548
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,200
Miss,

549
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,480
you can't wrongly accuse us.

550
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,480
Our crab roe noodle

551
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,200
is the most authentic.

552
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,079
Just make another bowl.

553
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,880
But...

554
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:51,519
I'll pay for these two bowls.

555
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:00,559
(Su Xie Yi,)

556
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:02,160
(you should stop talking.)

557
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,000
What are you doing?

558
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,839
Don't be nervous.

559
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:23,839
I just find

560
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,480
the view opposite to where I was sitting

561
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,839
isn't good enough.

562
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,440
I wanted to change seats.

563
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,319
What are you doing?

564
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:40,880
Nothing.

565
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:42,720
I just want to sit here

566
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:43,720
so I can enjoy the same view

567
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,960
as you.

568
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,160
You don't think the view you just saw

569
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,279
looks beautiful?

570
00:27:58,799 --> 00:27:59,440
It's beautiful.

571
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,279
(Shameless.)

572
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,319
(You didn't say that)

573
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:18,480
(two years ago.)

574
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:20,519
Are you free later?

575
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,279
I want to take you somewhere.

576
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,799
A place

577
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,839
where we can see the sunrise.

578
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:38,620
(Ming Hao)

579
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,279
Hello?

580
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,079
Xie Yi,

581
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,759
do you have time for a meal tomorrow?

582
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:47,559
What?

583
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,839
Now?

584
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,039
All right.

585
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,680
I'll be there right away. Wait for me.

586
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:53,400
Why are you in such a rush?

587
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,079
I said

588
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,680
I'll be there right away.

589
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,319
I'll leave now.

590
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,079
Mr. Li, I'm sorry.

591
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:02,519
Something came up.

592
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,279
What's the hurry?

593
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:05,880
Do you have another date?

594
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,200
My friend wants to see me urgently.

595
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:10,319
I'll drive you there, then.

596
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,720
It's okay.

597
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:13,240
I can go myself.

598
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,279
The entrance is that way.

599
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:37,110
(Haotian Law Firm)
Mr. Xie, look.

600
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,160
If it weren't for you, our daughter

601
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:39,960
would have been

602
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,759
abused for nothing.

603
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,680
Please accept this.

604
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,000
It's okay.

605
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,400
Please.

606
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:46,599
It's a small token

607
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:47,319
of appreciation.

608
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,680
No, you don't have to give it to me.

609
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,559
Since

610
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:51,079
it's free legal aid,

611
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:52,240
we won't accept

612
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,160
any kind of payment.

613
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,480
But you've helped us.

614
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,880
You're our family's benefactor.

615
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:56,599
Yes.

616
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:58,200
The law helped you.

617
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,039
I'm serious.

618
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:00,039
Take it back.

619
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:01,519
I suggest your daughter

620
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,039
consider changing her job

621
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:04,759
after she recovers.

622
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,720
She has gone through so much.

623
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,640
I'm worried

624
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:08,440
that her previous job

625
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,319
will bring bad effects
to her mental health.

626
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:11,279
We'll tell her that.

627
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,200
Thank you so much.

628
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,039
Then

629
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:14,200
we'll get going if there's nothing else.

630
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,200
Take care.

631
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:16,000
Okay.

632
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:16,599
Thank you.

633
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,640
Not bad, Mr. Xie.

634
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,759
It was a timely help.

635
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,640
You're the best talker in the family.

636
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:29,799
Thank you for the compliment.

637
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:31,519
You went for an interview
 at Ocean Hotel.

638
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:32,559
Mr. Xie.

639
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,160
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

640
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,400
You just set up your law firm,

641
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,000
and you have to take care
of your sister.

642
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:39,400
I was afraid you couldn't manage.

643
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:41,640
Besides,

644
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:43,200
if I fail the interview,

645
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:44,960
it'll be too humiliating.

646
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,720
I think

647
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:48,319
you thought I was too busy

648
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:49,920
to take care of you.

649
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,200
Ming Hao,

650
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,559
you know

651
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:55,480
I must get into Ocean Hotel.

652
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,759
Xie Yi,

653
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,920
listen to me.

654
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,119
You're

655
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,400
in a dangerous situation now.

656
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:04,400
If the perpetrator finds out

657
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:06,359
your identity and motive,

658
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:07,839
no one will know

659
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,079
what they will

660
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:10,519
do to you.

661
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:11,960
Don't worry.

662
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:14,000
My mom and I left the country early.

663
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,720
No one can recognize me

664
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,559
ten years ago.

665
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,839
Let alone now.

666
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,160
What about Li Ze Liang?

667
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,839
Him?

668
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:24,839
I've already worked out a plan.

669
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,200
But the police

670
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,279
had found that Uncle Shen's death

671
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,519
was due to suicide.

672
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,640
There was nothing suspicious
about his death too.

673
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,240
Besides, he did leave a suicide note.

674
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,200
He wrote it clearly too.

675
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:40,640
But all of you didn't see

676
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,039
what I saw.

677
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,880
If you insist on looking into it,

678
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,599
you'll need

679
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,640
to find the poison contract.

680
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,160
Before signing the contract,

681
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:52,119
it was clearly written

682
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,160
that the penalty for
the breach of contract

683
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,519
was five million yuan.

684
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,440
How did the penalty

685
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,079
increase more than tenfold

686
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,359
on the day of signing the contract?

687
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,000
Someone was obviously

688
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,279
up to no good.

689
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,200
So

690
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:05,759
do you know

691
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,000
where the contract is?

692
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:09,680
I've searched his office.

693
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,240
I didn't find anything.

694
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,880
Also, he didn't come
to the office before.

695
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,240
If he's always at home,

696
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:18,720
could the contract be...

697
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:20,880
That's it.

698
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,960
It must be at his place.

699
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,319
What are you thinking about?

700
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:26,240
Let's see

701
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,079
if I can help.

702
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,000
Ming Hao,

703
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,519
you already did me a favor.

704
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:30,720
I'll get going now.

705
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,079
Where are you going?

706
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,440
I got it now.

707
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,720
No risk, no reward.

708
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:23,320
Ying Song,

709
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,559
fix this buckle.

710
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:28,960
Mr. Li,

711
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,280
you shouldn't rush it.

712
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,840
You could make
your workout less intense.

713
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,079
I can't.

714
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:35,380
Huo Jian

715
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,320
would never have dreamed

716
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,760
that you're desperate to recover

717
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,440
after putting his guard up

718
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,480
all the time.

719
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,960
But judging from Lin Tai's incident,

720
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,199
he's still suspecting

721
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,519
and doubting you.

722
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,519
So no one else should know

723
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,000
about this place other than you.

724
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:49,840
Yes.

725
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:09,880
Uncle.

726
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,639
What?

727
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,920
Aren't you going to invite me in?

728
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:15,320
Uncle, please come in.

729
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:27,039
It's already late.

730
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:28,400
What brings you here suddenly?

731
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:31,079
It's been a while
since I last visited you.

732
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,559
I happened to pass by today.

733
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:34,559
Are you alone at home?

734
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:37,760
Have you forgotten

735
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,320
that I've always lived alone?

736
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,079
Have a seat, Uncle.

737
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:02,639
Ze Liang,

738
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:05,559
why is your house so messy?

739
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:06,760
Does no one

740
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,800
help you clean?

741
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,000
How about this?

742
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:10,920
I'll ask Yi Fei to come

743
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,079
and clean the house for you.

744
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,920
I'll ask her to bring some plants.

745
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:16,519
You'll be in a better mood

746
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,679
looking at plants.

747
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,480
It's okay, Uncle.

748
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,920
I live alone.

749
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:24,920
It's actually more comfortable
to be a bit messy.

750
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,639
All right.

751
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:27,960
Take a seat.

752
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:29,400
Don't just stand there.

753
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,719
Okay.

754
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:33,719
I don't have anything else to drink.

755
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,760
How about some beer?

756
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,559
No need.

757
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:39,440
No need to bother.

758
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:41,039
Come.

759
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,360
Have a seat.

760
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:54,400
Look at your clothes.

761
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,360
You look sloppy.

762
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,400
It's been so long since you last worked.

763
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,199
How did it go?

764
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:07,840
You've seen it yourself.

765
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,840
I can't even manage my subordinates.

766
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:13,440
I've let you down.

767
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:18,039
You've only returned to work
for a few days.

768
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,920
You can't take all the blame
for what Lin Tai did.

769
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,920
It's my fault

770
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,280
for overlooking it.

771
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,880
But

772
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,840
who do you think released

773
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:31,280
that video of Lin Tai?

774
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,559
It was very odd.

775
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,519
Indeed,

776
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,440
even you can't find out who did it.

777
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:41,480
It is quite odd.

778
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:44,800
Logically speaking,

779
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,800
if an outsider did it,

780
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:47,639
there would be some trace left.

781
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,880
Do you think this person

782
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,599
is working at Ocean Hotel?

783
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,800
Why don't I help you

784
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,639
look into this matter together?

785
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:03,599
It's a small matter.

786
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:04,440
No need to trouble you.

787
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:06,400
You should

788
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,920
focus on work.

789
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,159
I heard

790
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,079
the General Manager's Office

791
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,079
had arranged a newcomer

792
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,920
as your assistant.

793
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:14,760
What on earth

794
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,760
are they thinking?

795
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:16,840
Don't worry.

796
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:17,639
I'll arrange

797
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:19,079
a candidate for you myself.

798
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:22,800
You're always busy.

799
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:24,719
No need to waste time
on this small matter.

800
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,719
The newcomer

801
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,800
is a woman.

802
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:30,280
Perhaps she's more meticulous.

803
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:32,840
I'll see how it goes first.

804
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,320
Okay.

805
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,159
Ze Liang,

806
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:41,519
you must not lose heart

807
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:42,760
that easily.

808
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,039
I feel assured

809
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,840
to have you at the company.

810
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,400
I still have many things

811
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,440
to learn from you.

812
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,440
Stop drinking all the time.

813
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,480
Ocean Hotel will be yours in the future.

814
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,679
I'm only managing it for you.

815
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:07,559
Your dad left the hotel to me

816
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:08,960
before he died

817
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,840
because you were too young, then.

818
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:14,320
He wanted you to gain more experience.

819
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,360
It's a shame

820
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:20,320
that my brother-in-law

821
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:22,760
passed away too soon.

822
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:25,320
He didn't see you

823
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,719
for one last time.

824
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:33,960
You were the one

825
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:35,000
my dad trusted the most.

826
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:38,119
It has always been that way.

827
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:46,719
You're right.

828
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,639
Your dad is not only my family.

829
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,719
He also discovered my talent.

830
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:53,960
I won't be where I am without him.

831
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:57,320
Mr. Li,

832
00:39:57,679 --> 00:39:59,079
your climbing gears have been repaired.

833
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:05,559
Fancy seeing you here.

834
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:07,440
Hello, Mr. Huo.

835
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,519
Are you still practicing rock climbing?

836
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,079
That's perfect.

837
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:17,280
I want to know

838
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,519
about rock climbing too.

839
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:19,840
Let me see it.

840
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,800
Well,

841
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,679
why did you think of repairing
your gears?

842
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,519
Didn't you tell me to exercise more?

843
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:52,800
You know

844
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:54,360
I like rock climbing.

845
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:56,199
So I told Ying Song

846
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:57,119
to bring out

847
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,760
all my rock climbing gears.

848
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:01,000
I didn't know many
of my gears were damaged

849
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,840
because I hadn't been using them
for so long.

850
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,719
So

851
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:06,599
I asked Ying Song
to get me some new ones.

852
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,440
I'll be going to the club

853
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,599
to start climbing again.

854
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,679
I'm relieved to hear you say that.

855
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:24,559
This painting is really not bad.

856
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,880
If you like it,

857
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:41,960
I can give it to you.

858
00:41:58,559 --> 00:41:59,320
Ying Song,

859
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,400
take down the painting

860
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,679
and wrap it for Uncle.

861
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:18,039
No need.

862
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,159
I'm your elder.

863
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,679
I can't take away what you like.

864
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:29,719
Moreover, even if I like it,

865
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:32,840
I have to hold back.

866
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:35,599
