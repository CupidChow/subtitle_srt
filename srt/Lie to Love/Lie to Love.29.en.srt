(Little hedgehog.)

20
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,120
You're so cute.

21
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,120
You look

22
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:28,719
just like a hairy egg.

23
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,250
(Xie Yi)

24
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,400
Let's not see each other again.

25
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,879
Don't contact me anymore.

26
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:55,240
From now on,
we have nothing to do with each other.

27
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,860
(Xie Yi)

28
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,199
(Xie Yi.)

29
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,000
(You wouldn't even look me in the eye)

30
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,639
(when you said those things.)

31
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,759
(I believe you have your own reasons.)

32
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,879
(Could you tell Chestnut)

33
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,120
(and me about it?)

34
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,479
Xie Qing.

35
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,360
I'm here.

36
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,360
I'm having a terrible headache.

37
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:13,919
Help me.

38
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:15,919
Headache?

39
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:17,959
What's the matter?

40
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,155
If you're having a headache,
you should take medicine.

41
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,511
Come on.

42
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,920
No, I feel like throwing up.

43
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,959
Super strong fever medication.

44
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,120
It's very effective.

45
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:50,800
Here.

46
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,079
No, I feel like throwing up.

47
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:52,920
Come on.

48
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Do you want it to fry your brains?

49
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,759
I'm saving your brains for a purpose.

50
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,000
When you recall

51
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,759
the account number and password,

52
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,639
I won't give a dime

53
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,920
if you have a high fever.

54
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,759
Dropping the act already?

55
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:25,079
Trying to trick me into

56
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,199
getting you out
using the battered-body ruse?

57
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,800
Save it.

58
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,560
Are you even human?

59
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,879
So what if I am?

60
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,959
And what if I'm not?

61
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:35,519
I came

62
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,279
just to share some good news with you.

63
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,680
Xie Yi broke up with Li Ze Liang.

64
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,680
She's back by my side

65
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,839
and she's going to be with me forever.

66
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:47,759
That's impossible.

67
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,680
Xie Yi will never fall in love with you.

68
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:51,680
I know.

69
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,079
But so what?

70
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,439
What matters

71
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,319
is she pretends to fall head over heels
in love with me.

72
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,759
Xie Qing, you should know best.

73
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,959
Fake love is a kind of love too,

74
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,639
isn't it?

75
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,120
I forgot to tell you.

76
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,959
It's all thanks to you.

77
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,720
I told Xie Yi that you're still alive.

78
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,160
She wants to see you so badly.

79
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,240
That's why she broke up
with Li Ze Liang.

80
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,959
You used me to threaten her?

81
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,199
Xie Ming Hao.

82
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,879
That's so shameless of you.

83
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,079
Xie Qing.

84
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,920
There's something
that I want to ask you.

85
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,240
Did you leave a message

86
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,040
to Xie Yi or something?

87
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,279
How did she figure out
that what happened to Zhiwei

88
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,879
two years ago was related to me?

89
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:39,720
Also, she said

90
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,040
that I've been controlling you.

91
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,180
(To my beloved sister, Xie Yi.)

92
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,319
From the looks of it,

93
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,000
she has gotten her hands on it.

94
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,319
On what?

95
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,279
All thanks to you then.

96
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,480
You gave it to her yourself.

97
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,040
I'd given you a chance.

98
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,120
If you had

99
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,240
the slightest bit of love for me,

100
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:39,839
Xie Yi wouldn't have found out.

101
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,199
So what if she knows?

102
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,839
She still came back to me.

103
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,240
I'm going on a first date

104
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,040
with Xie Yi today.

105
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,199
So I'm in a good mood.

106
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,480
As for the account number and password,

107
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,879
I won't force you anymore.

108
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:59,120
I hope you'll recall it tomorrow.

109
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,079
You must be hungry.

110
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,879
Eat up.

111
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,360
This is all the courtesy

112
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,959
of your sister.

113
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,360
Enjoy.

114
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,560
Don't forget to get changed.

115
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:29,399
Xie Ming Hao, you scumbag!

116
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,759
What's the matter?

117
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:33,440
What's going on?

118
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,799
Did you have a fight?

119
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,279
She's in one of her moods today.

120
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:39,519
That's how couples are.

121
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:41,320
You'll fight now,
but kiss and make up later on.

122
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,480
Just cheer her up will do.

123
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,399
That's right.

124
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,320
Did you make this?

125
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,679
Thank you.

126
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,080
You seem like someone

127
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,519
who spoils your wife.

128
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,240
Did you just move in here?

129
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:57,720
Yes, we just moved in.

130
00:08:58,919 --> 00:08:59,799
I live over there.

131
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,799
If there's anything,

132
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:01,639
just let me know.

133
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,679
Sure.

134
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,600
So sorry

135
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,320
for disturbing you.

136
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,320
It's okay.

137
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,320
I'll get going then.

138
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:07,120
Okay.

139
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,480
Finish it.

140
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,759
Make sure there are no leftovers.

141
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,559
Otherwise, don't think

142
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,679
about seeing Xie Yi again.

143
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:42,759
These clothes that I bought for you

144
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:43,919
suit you well.

145
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,519
What do you think?

146
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,759
Xie Yi.

147
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:51,720
Let's grab a doll.

148
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,159
I don't like it.

149
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,840
But I remember you do.

150
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,320
Come on.

151
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,279
Which do you like? Pick one.

152
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,279
This.

153
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,639
Okay.

154
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,519
I'll surely get it for you.

155
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:43,080
For you.

156
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:44,440
Thank you.

157
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,360
Do you remember the doll
that Xie Qing had?

158
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:49,799
It was meant for you.

159
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,480
But too bad, Xie Qing took it.

160
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,440
No one will fight with you anymore.

161
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:56,039
It's all yours now.

162
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,200
Today, I got to do a lot of things

163
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,200
that I'd been wanted to do with you.

164
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:01,840
I'm really happy.

165
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:03,600
Are you?

166
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:07,879
Xie Yi.

167
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,639
What are you looking at?

168
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:11,360
Ming Hao.

169
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,039
There's a famous store

170
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,039
in the mall that sells double skin milk.
[*a Cantonese dessert]

171
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,600
Ming Hao.

172
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:18,720
Buy one for me.

173
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:19,480

broke your left leg!

333
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,680
On top of that,
you're suffering from burnout lately.

334

Your health condition is worrisome.

335
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:02,839
If you're not feeling well,

336
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,240
you should just stay at home.

Stop taking pictures! All of you!

338

Everyone.

339
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,720
Indeed, I injured my left leg.

340
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:13,640
But it's always been

341
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:15,039

It's nothing serious,

343
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,359
nor will it affect

344
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:18,720
the future development of Ocean.

345
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,759
Mr. Dai.

346
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:22,960
Thank you for your concern.

347
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:23,839
I hope

348
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:25,319
with you joining us,

349
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,039
it'll take us to new heights.

350
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,519
Of course.

351
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,480
That's for sure.

352
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,200
Here.

353
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,680
Invite the higher-ups to the stage
to take a group photo.

354
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,079
Let's have the hospital representatives

355
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,000
on the stage take a photo.

356
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:38,960
Welcome.

357
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:40,839
This way, please.

358
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,279
Okay.

359
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:41,680
Okay.

360
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:57,039
Mr. Dai.

361
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:58,680
We can go down now.

362
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,519
Is your leg

363
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,880
all right?

364
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,400
Chu Chu.

365
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,519
Don't you think

366
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:09,759
it's weird that Xie Yi resigned?

367
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,400
Her leaving Ocean
is the right thing to do.

368
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:14,160
What's the matter?

369
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Even now, you're still
concerned about her?

370
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:18,559
Are you aware

371
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,000
of Ocean's situation now?

372
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,440
I bet you had an ulterior motive

373
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,359
for putting her in charge

374
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,240
of the Lantian Bay project
all of a sudden.

375
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:27,839
That's right.

376
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:30,079
I have no reason to hide it from you.

377
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,119
Before all this went down,

378
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,119
I knew

379
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,759
she was going to tinker
with the purchase.

380
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:34,920
But I did that

381
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:36,640
just to catch her in the act.

382
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,920
I didn't know it would turn
into such a big deal.

383
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:40,359
Who told you that?

384
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,880
Xie Ming Hao, right?

385
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,160
Yes.

386
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:46,960
I did all this

387
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:48,079
for Ocean's sake.

388
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,359
I have a clear conscience.

389
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:50,680
Chu Chu.

390
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,559
I know everything you've done

391
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:52,160
is for Ocean's sake,

392
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,039
but your method

393
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,400
might not be the right one.

394
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,640
Take my advice.

395
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:57,240
Stay away from Xie Ming Hao.

396
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,039
You don't even know him.

397
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,400
He and Dai Zi Ang are very tight now.

398
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,519
Do you know that?

399
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:03,480
Do you know Su Xie Yi then?

400
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,759
Everything she did

401
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,200
was to avenge the Shen family.

402
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,079
She's the root cause

403
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,440
for all that has happened!

404
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,160
She isn't worthy of your love.

405
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,880
Chu Chu, I've said it before.

406
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,799
Between us, we're just friends.

407
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,599
Xie Yi has been tricked by Xie Ming Hao.

408
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:26,799
So have you.

409
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,359
Friends?

410
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:30,519
Li Ze Liang.

411
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:33,880
Is there a friend like me

412
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:35,920
who's willing to rip her heart out
for you?

413
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:37,359
Did you know

414
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,039
that everyone started to avoid you
after Zhengde suddenly

415
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,079
boosted its stake?

416
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,079
I am the only one who is
still by your side.

417
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,079
I even begged my dad

418
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,039
to help you.

419
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:47,640
If my method is wrong,

420
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,440
I don't mind apologizing to you.

421
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,480
But everything I do

422
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:52,079
is for your own good.

423
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,279
I don't need that from you.

424
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,559
When you're wrong,

425
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,640
you're wrong.

426
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:04,119
So

427
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:07,160
it's all my wishful thinking?

428
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,279
Listen carefully.

429
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:13,759
I don't need your sympathy

430
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,839
or your apology.

431
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,000
Shi Chu Chu.

432
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,200
All right.

433
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,480
Li Ze Liang.

434
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,319
Remember what you've said today.

435
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,599
Don't come begging me ever again.

436
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:45,759
Mr. Xie.

437
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,400
Here's another good news.

438
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,720
Li Ze Liang and Shi Chu Chu
had a falling out.

439
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,440
Ms. Shi.

440
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:01,599
Why did you suddenly

441
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,000
ask me out for sightseeing?

442
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,079
Zhengde and Diying Media

443
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,880
boosted their stakes
at the same time.

444
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:07,680
Do you know that?

445
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,799
It's the talk of the town.

446
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:10,799
Who doesn't know?

447
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:14,799
Why didn't you tell me

448
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,799
that you're tight with Mr. Dai?

449
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:17,000
Between Zhengde and I,

450
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:18,440
it's just normal business cooperation.

451
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:20,559
You should know better who's responsible

452
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:21,559
for that batch of insulation boards.

453
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:24,039
Besides, you saw it yourself.

454
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,079
Mr. Li has always had a problem with me.

455
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,960
I'm no longer in charge

456
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:29,160
of Ocean's important contracts.

457
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:30,680
I'm just a lawyer.

458
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,319
I need to make a living.

459
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,039
Well, what's the deal

460
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:35,200
with Mr. Dai?

461
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:38,279
Mr. Dai is one who holds a grudge.

462
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,160
Previously,

463
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:40,640
Mr. Li stole the deal
with Fujiade from him.

464
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:42,400
He's been holding a grudge since.

465
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:45,039
Now that Ocean is rife with scandals,

466
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,039
he's not going to let

467
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:46,920
such a good opportunity slip away.

468
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,559
Tomorrow, he plans

469
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,720
to hold a shareholders meeting in Ocean

470
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:50,920
to impeach Li Ze Liang.

471
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:57,920
I won't let that happen.

472
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,599
Ms. Shi.

473
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,559
I think

474
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,200
this is a good opportunity for you.

475
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:10,680
Why is that?

476
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,920
I have heard

477
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:14,160
about you and Li Ze Liang.

478
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:15,640
The fire in Lantian Bay

479
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:17,279
was clearly Xie Yi's fault.

480
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,079
He chose to protect her

481
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:21,640
and hold you accountable instead.

482
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,960
After what he's done to you,

483
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,279
won't you feel disheartened?

484
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,559
I think tomorrow's shareholders meeting

485
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,440
is the best time for you to test him.

486
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:34,359
At that time,

487
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:36,000
if he still refuses to beg you for help,

488
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,599
what else

489
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:39,119
do you expect of him then?

490
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:43,720
Be it career or love,

491
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:44,920
making a timely exit

492
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,000
is the best choice.

493
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,240
Why are you looking at me like that?

494
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,799
Does it suddenly hit you

495
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:58,759
that I'm the one who knows you best?

496
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,240
Actually, we're the same.

497
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:04,759
In love,

498
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:07,119
we're the ones who need to be saved.

499
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,839
Thank you for your concern.

500
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,039
It's quite a nice view.

501
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,880
You can come here more often.

502
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,799
(There's no trace)

503
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:08,359
(of my sister living here.)

504
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,960
(Where exactly is she?)

505
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,270
(Dr. Wu)

506
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:20,839
Hello?

507
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:21,880
Miss Su.

508
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,119
Why did Mr. Li postpone the follow-up?

509
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,359
Follow-up?

510
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,960
Mr. Li is suffering from osteomyelitis

511
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,599
and it's serious.

512
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,359
You have to take it seriously.

513
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,319
What did you say?

514
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,559
If it's not treated in time,

515
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,759
osteomyelitis may become cancerous.

516
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:36,839
Bring him to do a follow-up
as soon as possible.

517
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:39,359
Understood.

518
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,240
Cancerous?

519
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,200
Oh, no.

520
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:48,319
Our company's stock price

521
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,160
keeps dropping.

522
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:50,559
Isn't it evil of Zhengde

523
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:51,519
to boost its stake now?

524
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,799
Mr. Li is nowhere to be seen.

525
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,599
Should we run?

526
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:54,359
Come on!

527
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:55,599
It's not like we're going to war.

528
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Should we invite a master here

529
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,079
to do prayers and get rid of bad luck?

530
00:26:58,279 --> 00:26:59,160
You look like one to me.

531
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:00,160
Why don't you perform the ceremony?

532
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:05,799
It's Xie Yi.

533
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:07,200
I'm sure she knows what's happening.

534
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,400
Hello, Ming Yue.

535
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,079
Hey, Xie Yi.

536
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:11,839
Where are you?

537
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,480
Why haven't you been coming to work?

538
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,039
I have things to take care of.

539
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:17,279
By the way, where's Mr. Li?

540
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:18,279
Is he in the office?

541
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:19,440
Don't you know?

542
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,599
Zhengde and Diying

543
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:21,440
have boosted their stakes

544
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,000
and they hold over
10 percent of Ocean shares.

545
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:24,039
We're all worried sick

546
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,400
and we can't get ahold of Mr. Li.

547
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,599
Can't get ahold of him?

548
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,039
He's not in the office anyway.

549
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,599
Is he at home?

550
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,400
I have things to do.

551
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:33,519
That's all for now.

552
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,319
(You can't meet)

553
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:52,559
or contact Li Ze Liang anymore.

554
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,519
No WeChat, phone calls,

555
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,960
or emails. Nothing.

556
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:57,319
Otherwise, you know

557
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,680
what I would do to Xie Qing
and Li Ze Liang, right?

558
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,000
Hello.

559
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:15,920
Xie Yi.

560
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:16,960
Where are you?

561
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,039
Just taking a stroll outside.

562
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,839
Come with me to a party tonight.

563
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,680
With whom?

564
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,279
You'll know when you get there.

565
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,900
(No. 9 Steak House)

566
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,559
You're really something.

567
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:53,559
I haven't even made you pay

568
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:55,039
for standing me up the other day.

569
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,559
And now, you're making me

570
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:59,000
drink with you during the day.

571
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,759
All right. Stop drinking.

572
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,240
You've had enough.

573
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,119
You merely had a fight with Liang.

574
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,079
All right.

575
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:08,079
Right now,

576
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:09,119
I'll give him a call

577
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,799
and get him to come here
and apologize to you.

578
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,759
I don't want to see him.

579
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,200
Liang has been under
a lot of pressure lately.

580
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:17,519
After the fire in Lantian Bay,

581
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:19,000
he had to make a public apology.

582
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,839
It's normal to be in a bad mood.

583
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:21,839
Be more understanding.

584
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,759
Understanding of him?

585
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,480
He's clearly being unprofessional.

586
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,640
You know what?

587
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,480
The fire in Lantian Bay happened

588
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:32,680
because Su Xie Yi bought a batch

589
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:33,759
of low-quality insulation boards

590
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,319
to avenge the Shen family.

591
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,279
Ze Liang

592
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,519
made a public apology to protect her.

593
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,240
Xie Yi taking revenge?

594
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:40,640
That's impossible!

595
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,200
Her feelings for Liang are real.

596
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,599
There's no reason for her
to take revenge.

597
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,160
Why are all of you

598
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,680
taking her side?

599
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:48,759
Boring.

600
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,359
I'm leaving.

601
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:51,720
Shi Chu Chu, stand right there!

602
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:52,839
Shi Chu Chu!

603
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:55,960
I went to visit Xie Yi the other day.

604
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,119
Liang just had a fight with her

605
00:29:58,319 --> 00:29:59,359
and she was very depressed.

606
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:00,440
So she told me

607
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:01,400
what happened back then.

608
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:04,559
Zhiwei's bankruptcy

609
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,400
had nothing to do with Liang.

610
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,559
It was all Shen Xie Qing

611
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,480
and Xie Ming Hao's doing.

612
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:17,839
What do you mean?

613
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:19,400
Make things clear.

614
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,000
I can do that.

615
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:27,880
Chu Chu.

616
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,000
I came to apologize to you.

617
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,160
I'm sorry.

618
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:35,200
I deliberately said those things

619
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,119
in the afternoon for Mr. Dai to hear.

620
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:53,599
I don't need that from you.

621
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,920
When you're wrong, you're wrong.

622
00:30:58,039 --> 00:30:58,599
(Lately,)

623
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:00,720
Dai Zi Ang and Xie Ming Hao

624
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,720
have been very tight.

625
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:03,240
I've checked.

626
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,839
Zhengde and Diying's shareholders

627
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:08,640
are Dai Zi Ang and Xie Ming Hao.

628
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,160
Judging from today's situation,

629
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,000
their motives are simple

630
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,200
which is to acquire Ocean.

631
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:17,240
Xie Ming Hao

632
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:18,920
is Diying's shareholder?

633
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,000
Not only that.

634
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:21,839
Before Shen Xie Qing went missing,

635
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:23,319
she met up with me.

636
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,720
She admitted

637
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,799
that Zhiwei's funding hole

638
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,720
was related to her.

639
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,799
In terms of the contract,
this thing had to be done

640
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,000
through Xie Ming Hao.

641
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,119
He's Shen Xie Qing's fiance.

642
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,319
So I surmise

643
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:36,319
that these things

644
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:38,559
must have something to do with him.

645
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,480
I've explained everything

646
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,920
to the police.

647
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:44,680
On top of that,

648
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,319
have you considered the fact

649
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,279
that perhaps,
the timing of the disclosure

650
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,920
of the project proposals
wasn't after we decided

651
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,480
to go through with the project

652
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:53,799
but before?

653
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,240
And during that time,

654
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,079
only Xie Ming Hao

655
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,200
fits the criteria to do that.

656
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,079
(Actually, there are)

657
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:05,480
two options available for Ocean.

658
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:06,559
First,

659
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,960
set up hotels overseas.

660
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,039
Second,

661
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:10,599
build local projects.

662
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:11,720
As expected

663
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,200
of our ace commercial lawyer.

664
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:14,799
You sure know a lot.

665
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,559
I'm responsible

666
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,440
for commercial projects.

667
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:19,319
If I don't even know these,

668
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:21,240
(it means I haven't been doing my job.)

669
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:23,200
(The transaction
hasn't even gone through.)

670
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:24,559
If you make a deal out of this,

671
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:25,799
it won't do any harm to Xie Yi.

672
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,960
I know how you feel.

673
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:29,960
But we have to be patient.

674
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:32,319
It will only work if you report her

675
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,039
after the transaction goes through.

676
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,960
The logic behind all this turmoil

677
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,200
is pretty obvious now.

678
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:39,960
From the story leaked out
by He Jiang Hua

679
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:41,759
to the fire in Lantian Bay,

680
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:43,079
they're the ones

681
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:44,880
responsible for all that.

682
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,240
Their motives are simple.

683
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:47,160
They want to

684
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,440
suppress Ocean's stock price

685
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,720
and then,

686
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,400
take the opportunity
to buy Ocean shares.

687
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,799
I've been fooled

688
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,119
by Xie Ming Hao all this time.

689
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:57,880
Even today,
he was still trying to fool me.

690
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,880
I was too impulsive.

691
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:03,240
Chu Chu, it's not your fault.

692
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,440
Xie Ming Hao is too cunning.

693
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:08,400
Now that Ocean is in trouble,
you, of all people, are more worried.

694
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:09,960
It's my fault

695
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,680
for being insensitive.

696
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:14,000
That's enough.

697
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:15,119
Don't just

698
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:16,480
keep apologizing to one another.

699
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,319
Right now,

700
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,279
it's the time

701
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:20,039
we join hands
and fight against the enemy.

702
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:21,279
Liang.

703
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,319
You already have a plan in mind,

704
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,440
right?

705
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,160
Don't bother.

706
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,200
After shareholding disclosure,

707
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,240
Dai Zi Ang will surely force me
to step down.

708
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:30,599
At that time, I'll need

709
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:32,519
all nine directors to vote
by show of hands.

710
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,039
Lately, Dai Zi Ang

711
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,680
is tight with a few of them. So...

712
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,079
Chu Chu, your vote

713
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:38,359
will be especially critical.

714
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,400
I think

715
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:40,640
Xie Ming Hao

716
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,119
will try to rope you in.

717
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:43,319
That's right.

718
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,000
He already did.

719
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,079
But don't worry.

720
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,559
This time,

721
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,559
I'm not going to take their side.

722
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,440
No.

723
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:50,759
On the contrary,

724
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,599
I think you should support him.

725
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,599
Why?

726
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:57,720
I've long been a thorn

727
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,440
in Dai Zi Ang and Xie Ming Hao's sides.

728
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:00,599
If I don't step down,

729
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:02,200
they'll only double down their efforts

730
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,119
to take Ocean down.

731
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,119
Why don't

732
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,480
I take evasive action?

733
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,880
Dai Zi Ang is the kind

734
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:08,320
to let his guard down

735
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:09,760
once he gets carried away.

736
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:10,920
Besides,

737
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,960
given Dai Zi Ang's capability,

738
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,039
he couldn't possibly come up
with that many funds

739
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,480
to buy Ocean's equity.

740
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,320
He has always been known

741
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,480
for being aggressive and vicious.

742
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,159
If I'm right,

743
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:23,880
he is likely

744
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,800
to pledge his equity in Zhengde.

745
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,440
Got it.

746
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,719
His aggressiveness

747
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,280
is his weak point
that gives us an edge over him.

748
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,920
If we can find evidence of him

749
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,400
behind the Lantian Bay incident,

750
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,360
then it will

751
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,519
backfire on Zhengde,

752
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,519
and its stock price will plummet.

753
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,559
At that time,

754
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:39,920
he'll surely sell

755
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,519
Ocean's shares that he just bought

756
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,199
to save Zhengde.

757
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,559
If luck isn't on his side,

758
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,239
there'll be

759
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,320
forced liquidation

760
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:46,719
of his pledged equity.

761
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,639
Then, he'll end up empty-handed.

762
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,119
Such a wonderful business war.

763
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,880
Ms. Shi and Mr. Li.

764
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,599
How can I just sit by and watch?

765
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,880
It's too exciting.

766
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:03,360
So?

767
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:05,079
Do you want to play us a rock song

768
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,079
to liven things up?

769
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:09,079
Zhengde's pledged equity

770
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,400
is just your speculation.

771
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:11,840
We need to verify it first.

772
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,000
Besides, this is huge.

773
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,800
You'll need my help to ask around.

774
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,280
This time,

775
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,360
Hou Xiao Dong could be of help.

776
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,199
After all, his dad

777
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,000
is a fund industry giant.

778
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:26,800
Ma'am.

779
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,119
I haven't been home in years.

780
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,840
That's why you should go home.

781
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,519
Chu Chu.

782
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,760
Spare him.

783
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,239
Xiao Dong chose to be a rock singer

784
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:39,960
to avoid

785
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,639
inheriting his family business.

786
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:44,239
Liang, you're such a loyal friend.

787
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,320
So

788
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:46,599
since my buddy is in trouble,

789
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,920
how can I sit by and do nothing?

790
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,039
Mr. Dai.

791
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,400
The reason I helped

792
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:02,559
was solely

793
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:03,840
for my own reputation.

794
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:05,880
I shall not accept money

795
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:06,559
that...

796
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,719
I shouldn't.

797
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,039
What do you mean by that?

798
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,639
It's what you deserved.

799
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,440
Here, I'll put it in for you.

800
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,199
Here. Don't stand on ceremony.

801
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:15,039
No, Mr. Dai.

802
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:15,840
I really can't take it.

803
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,559
This kind of thing can't happen again.

804
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:21,000
You chief editor

805
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:21,760
have quite some character.

806
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,599
Acting noble, huh?

807
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:24,039
No.

808
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:24,760
Fine.

809
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:27,000
Go home

810
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:28,639
and think about it.

811
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:29,800
Mr. Dai.

812
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:30,960
Well...

813
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,079
I shall get going then.

814
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,280
Miss Su.

815
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:46,239
Mr. Xie.

816
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,000
Mr. Dai is waiting for you inside.

817
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:01,620
(Voice Memos)

818
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,360
Give me your phone.

819
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:06,039
I don't want anyone

820
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:07,159
to interrupt my private party.

821
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:15,840
Satisfied?

822
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,800
Yes, she just went inside.

823
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:24,079
She was with Xie Ming Hao.

824
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,760
Keep an eye on them.

825
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:27,559
Okay.

826
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Hello, Mr. Li. Hold on.

827
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,360
I just saw someone.

828
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,280
Who?

829
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,400
He Jiang Hua.

830
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:36,920
Follow him.

831
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:38,280
Let me know

832
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,440
where you are later.

833
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,639
I'm coming over now.

834
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,360
Okay.

835
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:43,760
Come on.

836
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:44,800
Welcome.

837
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,599
Finally,

838
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:47,599
you brought your girlfriend along.

839
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:48,920
Hi, Mr. Dai.

840
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,559
Hi.

841
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,239
Have we met

842
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:55,440
somewhere before?

843
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,320
The crab roe noodles restaurant.

844
00:37:59,039 --> 00:37:59,840
You're getting prettier.

845
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,280
Mr. Dai.

846
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,519
Tomorrow is the day

847
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:02,440
of us boosting our stakes.

848
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:03,480
How about celebrating it?

849
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:04,159
That's right.

850
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,320
I've prepared the wine.

851
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,480
It's all thanks

852
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,840
to Miss Su.

853
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:08,800
You have to drink this.

854
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,719
If it hadn't been for you,

855
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,239
it wouldn't be that easy for us

856
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,639
to become Ocean's shareholders.

857
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,280
Here.

858
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:15,000
Cheers.

859
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,880
Mr. Dai is an outstanding person.

860
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:18,519
It's an honor for Ocean

861
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,079
to have you as its shareholder.

862
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,239
Is it?

863
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:23,320
But what I want

864
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:24,920
isn't to be just the shareholder.

865
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:25,920
Tomorrow,

866
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:26,800
we're attending Ocean's board meeting.

867
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:27,880
At that time,

868
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:30,079
Li Ze Liang won't be able

869
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:31,480
to keep his position.

870
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:33,159
Here. Cheers.

871
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:34,719
Miss Su.

872
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,470
(Physique Gym)

873
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:46,119
Mr. Li.

874
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:47,599
He's inside.

875
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:51,960
Okay.

876
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:53,519
Wait outside for me.

877
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:54,719
Okay.

878
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,719
Li Ze Liang.

879
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:14,559
What brings you here?

880
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:17,519
Well, you stood me up the other day.

881
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:19,000
I came here today

882
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:21,840
to have a chat with you,
Chief Editor He.

883
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:24,880
I don't think

884
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:26,920
we have anything to talk about.

885
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:28,159
Really?

886
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,199
I would like to ask you something

887
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:35,000
regarding the fire in Lantian Bay.

888
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:38,519
Look, the directors

889
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,519
aren't happy

890
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:41,320
with a lot of things
that Li Ze Liang did.

891
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,000
The board has nine members.

892
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,079
I've roped three of them over.

893
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:46,920
Me included,

894
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,480
we have four votes on our side.

895
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,800
The most important now

896
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,519
is Shi Chu Chu's vote.

897
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:56,920
She has had a fall out

898
00:39:57,079 --> 00:39:58,079
with Li Ze Liang.

899
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,079
On top of that,

900
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,639
I've messed with her mind.

901
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:02,239
So it's not going to be a problem.

902
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:03,840
Nice!

903
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,519
The thought of the situation

904
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,960
that Li Ze Liang will be in tomorrow

905
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:09,960
just makes me feel so good.

906
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,119
I can't help

907
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,679
but shake it.

908
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,400
Li Ze Liang.

909
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:24,519
Ming Hao.

910
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,320
How about a dance?

911
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:27,880
Yes!

912
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,280
Nice!

913
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:30,440
That's a good suggestion.

914
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,559
I found something

915
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,000
on the construction site in Lantian Bay.

916
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:35,960
Mr. He.

917
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:37,480
