00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:25,000
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,550
♫  Still haunts me now and then in quiet nights  ♫

4
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:41,530
♫  And turn to face all the long lost times  ♫

5
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,370
♫  Brace the pain  ♫

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:51,210
♫  Let memories wake up from oceans deep  ♫

7
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,350
♫  No place to hide  ♫

8
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,450
♫  No way to run  ♫

9
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,920
♫  New dawn counts down  ♫

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,030
♫  I fight  ♫

11
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,010
♫  I cry  ♫

12
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,800
♫  I give up  ♫

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:15,810
♫  Memories forgotten, forsaken surround  ♫

14
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:24,030
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

15
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:32,370
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

16
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:40,950
♫  Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

17
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:49,750
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

18
00:01:49,750 --> 00:02:00,150

19
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,259

20
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:06,100
Director Li, what did you promise?

21
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,199
You guaranteed that this auction would be successful. There would be no mistakes.

22
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,120
But what is your explanation for what happened today?

23
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,820
Mr. Roman, don't worry.

24
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,539
I am sorry for what happened today.

25
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:19,720
But please trust me. I will get to the bottom of the matter.

26
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,140
I will give you a satisfactory answer.

27
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,719
Also, I'm not sure if the singer was poisoned by the wine?

28
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,939
If so, that glass of wine was originally served to my wife.

29
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,560
You must get to the bottom of the matter!

30
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,880
I will give you one day. Within a day, please give me a reasonable explanation.

31
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,500
And it must not affect Fujiade's image. Or else, I will pull out of the exhibition.

32
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,800
All losses shall be borne by you.

33
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,200
Mr. Ro...

34
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,559
Oscar.

35
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,200
How's he now?

36
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,320

37
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,080
 Everyone in the trade knows that it can be used to wipe the bracelet.

38
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,859
 As for me, I'll use it to clean my guitar pick since I'm using it later.

39
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,560
Chairman Huo, I have no idea what's going on. How could it be that guy?

40
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,599
Don't panic.

41
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:46,219
What's most important now is to get rid of all evidence and clues.

42
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:49,479
Yes. I will deal with it right away.

43
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,980

44
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,500
 Chen Hengsheng?

45
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,550

46
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,400
Mr. Ji, give me the car key.

47
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,390
Where are you going? This is Mr. Li's car.

48
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,080
Inform Li Zeliang that I've found the evidence of Oscar's poisoning.

49
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,270
I'll call him later.

50
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,719
Li Zeliang, where's Su Xieyi?

51
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:14,520
No idea. I'm also looking for her.

52
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,850
I tried calling her, but she didn't pick up my call.

53
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,520
I don't know what happened to her.

54
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,299
If anything happens to Xieyi again, you will answer for it.

55
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,620
Mr. Li! Miss Su drove your car away.

56
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,650
She said she had found the evidence of Oscar's poisoning.

57
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,439
- Did she say where she was going? 
 - No.

58
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:44,375
Su Xieyi is really...

59
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,820

60
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,739
Su Xieyi, where are you?

61
00:06:48,739 --> 00:06:50,720
I'm tailing Chen Hengsheng.

62
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,520
He must be thinking of using the fact that Mrs. Roman only drinks gin and tonic I made,

63
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,930
 and laced the limes with poison.

64
00:06:55,939 --> 00:06:57,620
Now, he's afraid that the matter will come to light.

65
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,120
He must be getting rid of the problematic limes now.

66
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,319
Chen Hengsheng?

67
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:04,120
That box of lemons is the evidence. I can't let him destroy it.

68
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,479
Su Xieyi, send me your location now. I will come to you right away.

69
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,440
 Before I arrive, don't take any impulsive action. Do you hear me?

70
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,080
Okay.

71
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,319
Wait for me here. No one should know about this matter.

72
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,899
Got it.

73
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,900

74
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,520

75
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,620
Xieyi.

76
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,790
It's Chen Hengsheng.

77
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:58,000
Hello.

78
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,080
 It's bad. I was exposed.

79
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,380
What?

80
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,619
When I was getting rid of the limes, Su Xieyi saw me.

81
00:11:05,619 --> 00:11:07,920
I've knocked her out.

82
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,019
Su Xieyi?

83
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:14,480
She has been knocked out?

84
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,940
 Yes. She saw me.

85
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,860
I had no choice.

86
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,301
What should I do now?

87
00:11:20,301 --> 00:11:22,520
 I didn't want to hurt anyone.

88
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,639
Xieyi!

89
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,720
Crap. Li Zeliang is here.

90
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,179
 What should I do now? What should we do?!

91
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:37,300
 The police will suspect me.

92
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,859
 I have a long life ahead.

93
00:11:38,859 --> 00:11:42,240
 I don't want to spend the rest of my life in prison.

94
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:46,239
Xieyi!

95
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,919
Xieyi!

96
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,200
He's getting nearer.

97
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,079
He'll definitely notice Su Xieyi.

98
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,679
What about we turn ourselves in?

99
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:00,799
Shut up! Why are you panicking?

100
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:02,139
Isn't this good?

101
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,260
What are you talking about?

102
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,860
Su Xieyi!

103
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,900
 Have you forgotten the reason we did this?

104
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,420
Isn't this a great opportunity?

105
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,020
A great opportunity?

106
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,879
 Use your brain and think carefully.

107
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:20,340
 As long as they don't turn up at the press conference tomorrow,

108
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,700
Roman will officially announce to pull out of the exhibition.

109
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,200
No matter what they do then,

110
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,200
they won't be able to turn the tables.

111
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,519
But... But I can't lock them up forever.

112
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:31,960
They have seen me.

113
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,979
If they testify against me, I... I will be done for.

114
00:12:35,979 --> 00:12:38,599
Of course, if you insist on turning yourself in,

115
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:42,360
I can't stop you.

116
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:49,000
But your son may also need to call for a press conference.

117
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,579
Hello. Hello.

118
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:52,059
Hello.

119
00:12:55,059 --> 00:12:57,520
Su Xieyi!

120
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,060
Xieyi!

121
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,200
Xieyi!

122
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,580
I'm here. Over here.

123
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,999
Xieyi!

124
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,820
Xieyi!

125
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:35,719
Are you all right?

126
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,000

127
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:55,359
 Chen Hengsheng!

128
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:58,859
Chen Hengsheng, are you aware of the consequences of your action?

129
00:13:58,859 --> 00:14:01,140
Stop shouting!

130
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,779
I won't hurt you two.

131
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:04,940
I will turn myself in.

132
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,920
 I was forced to do this. I have no choice!

133
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,339
After the matter is over, I will come back to release you two!

134
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:13,740
 Chen Hengsheng!

135
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,560
-  Chen Hengsheng! 
 - Chen Hengsheng!

136
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,600
Come back!

137
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:36,899
If those two return, they won't let Chen Hengsheng go.

138
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:39,340
Things will get complicated then.

139
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,159
The limes have been disposed of.

140
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:45,058
How will they testify?

141
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:47,540
They need to show the evidence.

142
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:52,159
Besides, Chen Hengsheng is also a veteran at Ocean Hotel.

143
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,281
Well, do you think the shareholders will believe Shen Zhihong's daughter,

144
00:14:56,282 --> 00:14:59,499
or those on their side?

145
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,440
You're right.

146
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,159
I didn't expect Su Xieyi to be such a great pawn.

147
00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:17,120
Men can't live without women.

148
00:15:18,499 --> 00:15:22,240
Are you talking about yourself or him?

149
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,140
Once men are trapped by a relationship,

150
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:28,599
they can't achieve great things.

151
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:35,719
If you follow me obediently,

152
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:41,499
you will be treated well.

153
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:58,100
There's no signal here either.

154
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:02,799
There isn't any signal in here.

155
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,439
This must be an abandoned chemical plant.

156
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:20,738
And below here must be a chemical warehouse.

157
00:16:20,738 --> 00:16:24,180
To prevent the radiofrequency radiation from the mobile phone

158
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,886
from igniting the volatile chemical substances,

159
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:30,499
the entire warehouse must have been installed with a signal jammer.

160
00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:34,239
Looks like we can only wait here.

161
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:42,039
A'Yan, have I done something very risky?

162
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:44,580
I rushed over to find you recklessly.

163
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,199
That's also considered risky.

164
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:50,360
You just wanted to do something for me.

165
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,514
You have a rather high EQ.

166
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,689
Well, you won't change even if I scold you.

167
00:17:00,689 --> 00:17:02,940
You're right.

168
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,740
Actually, this is considered good too.

169
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,240
There's no signal here.

170
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,980
We can't use our phones.

171
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,619
There's nothing much to bother us.

172
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,419
No one will bother us too.

173
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,980
 Sorry. The subscriber you dialed cannot be connected for the moment.

174
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,400
 Please try again later.

175
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,200
 Sorry.

176
00:17:59,459 --> 00:18:03,200
Previously, why didn't you pass the medicine to me directly?

177
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,000
Didn't you have Lawyer Xie's medicine with you?

178
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,860
You don't need mine.

179
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,480
What are you saying?

180
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,699
I need it.

181
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:20,540
Brother Minghao has always taken care of my older sister and me.

182
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,179
He's like my family.

183
00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:25,360
But you are different.

184
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,100
How so?

185
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,559
You know it well.

186
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,799
I've seen a movie.

187
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:53,599
In the vast starry sky, there's a mysterious hole

188
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,380
where people can travel through time and space.

189
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,270
It's the wormhole.

190
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:04,179
In the movie, it's known by a very beautiful name,

191
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:06,389
the Rainbow Bridge.

192
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,319
A'Yan.

193
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,440
I really want to return to the day we met.

194
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,867
I thought that would be the beginning of my happiness.

195
00:19:21,867 --> 00:19:24,820
I never thought everything would change after that.

196
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:29,039
At least, there's one thing

197
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,240
that has never changed.

198
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,860
What is it?

199
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,839
I've never forgotten about you.

200
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:51,080
I've never forgotten about you for even just one second.

201
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,880
Although I didn't know who you were

202
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,280
and where you went,

203
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,439
I kept looking forward

204
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,000
to your return.

205
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,800
If the Rainbow Bridge does exist,

206
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,000
I hope we can return to an earlier time in the past.

207
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,200
This way, I may encounter you earlier.

208
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,000
Xieyi, am I greedy?

209
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,400
Xieyi.

210
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,700
What's wrong?

211
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,500
Are you sleepy?

212
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,300
No.

213
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,400
Just a little dizzy.

214
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,600
Dizzy?

215
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,100

216
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,600
Not good.

217
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,800
There must be some traces of chemicals left in these containers.

218
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,400
Let's get out of here first.

219
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,300
Come on. Get up.

220
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,200
Get to the back.

221
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,800
Be careful.

222
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,200
Come on. Sit down.

223
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,200
How do you feel?

224
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm fine.

225
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,300
Here. Hold this.

226
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,900
Wait for me.

227
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,400
The poisonous gas is getting stronger.

228
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,600
We must get out of here now.

229
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:17,300
Xieyi, did you see the black pipe?

230
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,200
There must be a transom overhead.

231
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:25,000
Now, I'll climb up the pipe and break the window

232
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,800
so we can get out of here.

233
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,800
Then, I'll pull you up.

234
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,400
You must be careful.

235
00:22:37,267 --> 00:22:40,379
Don't worry. I'm a rock climber.

236
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,200
Climb slowly.

237
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,000
Be careful.

238
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,100
Xieyi, stand to the side.

239
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,100
I'm going to break the window.

240
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,400
Be careful. Don't get yourself hurt.

241
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,400
Be careful.

242
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,700
Xieyi, I did it!

243
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,400
Xieyi, wait for a while.

244
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,600
I'll pull you up!

245
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:16,400
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

246
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:25,100
♫  Still haunts me now and then in quiet nights  ♫

247
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,000
♫  Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

248
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,400
Tie the rope around your waist.

249
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,400
I'll pull you up.

250
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:41,420
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

251
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,600
♫  Looking around, don't want to be found  ♫

252
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,900
♫  And in silence, I become  ♫

253
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:56,600
♫  Tired of trying to go on  ♫

254
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:05,700
♫  I am lost in the mist of time  ♫

255
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,600
Hang in there.

256
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:15,600
♫  I must run and never look behind  ♫

257
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,700
♫  Memory of us in darkened sky  ♫

258
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,200
Extend your hand.

259
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:33,600
♫  Can I be really born another kind  ♫

260
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:42,800
♫  Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

261
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:50,700
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

262
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,800
We've finally gotten out.

263
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,600
A'Yan, we've finally gotten out.

264
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,000
A'Yan.

265
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,700
A'Yan, what's wrong?

266
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,400
A'Yan, your leg.

267
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,900
I'm fine.

268
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,000
When I was climbing up,

269
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I accidentally scratched it.

270
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,400
Let's go.

271
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,700
I'll send you to the hospital. Come on.

272
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,200
Come on.

273
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,300
Yan, you must hang in there.

274
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,800
Hang in there.

275
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,400
Xieyi, don't worry.

276
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,300
I'll hang in there.

277
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,400
I'll be fine.

278
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,000
I don't want anything to happen to you.

279
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Come on.

280
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
We'll go to the hospital. Come on.

281
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000

282
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Director Shi, the online discussion has died down.

283
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,700
Public opinion is under control. We've contacted the media.

284
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,800
At 2:00 tomorrow afternoon, we'll be holding a press conference.

285
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,200
Good.

286
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,100
Director Shi. Director Shi.

287
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,000
Mr. Oscar's lab report is here.

288
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,300
It is confirmed that bongkrekic acid has caused a toxic reaction.

289
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:09,800
This toxin is most commonly found in starchy foods and fungi that have gone bad.

290
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,000
- Have you inspected the kitchen? 
 - I've inspected everything.

291
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,500
No such toxin has been found.

292
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:19,400
But what is strange is the toxin is found in the last glass of wine that Mr. Oscar drank.

293
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,100
Where's Miss Su?

294
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,300
She has gone missing after the incident. I can't reach her by phone.

295
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,800
Director Shi, although public opinion is under control,

296
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:32,000
many of the hotel guests want to check out.

297
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,100
Well, invite the local top food safety experts immediately

298
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,300
to conduct a test on all the ingredients in the hotel.

299
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,100
At the same time, open up Yunfeng Hotel's kitchen

300
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,100
and invite the hotel guests to inspect it personally.

301
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,400
If they find anything, we will take full responsibility.

302
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,800
We must regain our guests' confidence in us quickly.

303
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,400
- Get it? 
  - Yes.

304
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,200

305
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,500
 Sorry. The subscriber you dialed cannot be connected for the moment.

306
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,800
 Please try again later.

307
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,800
 Sorry. The subscriber you dialed cannot be connected for the moment.

308
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,000
 Please...

309
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,300

310
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,200
 Where's Director Li?

311
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,600
 I can't reach him by phone.

312
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,200
 Mr. Li went to look for Miss Su.

313
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,000
Go find Director Li now.

314
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I can't reach both of them by phone. I'm afraid that something has happened to them.

315
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,600
Okay!

316
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,000
Doctor! Doctor!

317
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,600
- What happened to him? 
 - His leg is injured.

318
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,600
Quick. The emergency bed.

319
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,000
Here. Be careful.

320
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,600
Come. Come on. Slowly.

321
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,700
Send him to the first aid room.

322
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,800
Miss, your hand is bleeding too.

323
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,000
Follow me. I will clean your wound for you.

324
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,800
No need. I'll wait for him here.

325
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:40,500
 A'Yan, let's take care of each other from now on. All right?

326
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,900
 All right.

327
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,000

328
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:11,620

329
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,000
Doctor, how's A'Yan? Is he all right?

330
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,400
Don't worry. Your boyfriend is fine.

331
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,700
But... But what?

332
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,000
Do you know about his leg?

333
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,100
What is it?

334
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,200
There's a serious abrasion on his amputated leg.

335
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,000
It has become inflamed. It needs to be treated with antibiotics immediately.

336
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,800
Can you contact his attending doctor?

337
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,000
I want to know more about his medications.

338
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,800
I'm not so sure about this.

339
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,100
I only know that he fell while climbing two years ago.

340
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,800
He fell?

341
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,300
That's strange.

342
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,000
The bone of his left leg is fine.

343
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,600
It doesn't look like an injury induced by a fall.

344
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,700
I've given him some broad-spectrum antibiotics.

345
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,400
We'll monitor his situation.

346
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,900
- Thank you, Doctor. 
 - You're welcome.

347
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:36,600

348
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,000
Normal temperature. He's recovering well.

349
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
But why hasn't he woken up yet?

350
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,700
Don't worry. The patient needs sufficient sleep to regain his strength.

351
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,200
Once he has enough sleep, he'll wake up naturally.

352
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,200
You're tired too. Get some rest.

353
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,800
I'm fine. I'll wait for him to wake up.

354
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,500
Okay.

355
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,800
Why is there not a single piece of news on the internet?

356
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,200
I feel uncomfortable.

357
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,200
How's your recovery?

358
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,200
I feel dizzy and have a migraine. I feel drained of energy.

359
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,400
I can't even get out of bed.

360
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,900
Then, who ate those fruits out there?

361
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,000
The nurse.

362
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,800
Stop pretending.

363
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,400
The doctor said you are fine.

364
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,800
Well, you all are quite adept in public relations.

365
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,500
I thought I could create my first trending topic.

366
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:15,000
If you drank the entire glass of wine, then it might happen to you.

367
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,200
What do you mean?

368
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:23,200
It has been found that the toxic reaction was induced by bongkrekic acid.

369
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,700
It was found in the wine you drank.

370
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,600
What's going on?

371
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,400
The specifics are still under investigation.

372
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:35,400
This toxin is usually found in foods that have expired and gone bad.

373
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:40,000
But it was strange that it was found in your wine.

374
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,000
- It must be the lime. 
 - What lime?

375
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,400
I don't have any solid evidence now.

376
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,800
It's just my deduction.

377
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,800
But there's one thing I can be sure of.

378
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,200
Drinking milk tea really can save your life.

379
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,500
I'll get to the point.

380
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,400
This time, I represent the company to pay you a visit.

381
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,400
I hope you will cooperate with us to issue a clarification statement.

382
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,800
Sure.

383
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,700
By the way, how are things going for A'Liang?

384
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,800
I can't reach him by phone.

385
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,600
It's only a minor setback.

386
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,500
I believe he can handle it well.

387
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,400
I brought you some soup to replenish your body.

388
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,800
Thank you.

389
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,300
But I still feel dizzy and have a migraine.

390
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,000
I feel drained of energy.

391
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:41,400
Phone, spoon, chopsticks, and bowl.

392
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,000
They are too heavy for me now.

393
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,800
I can't hold them.

394
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,200
It's too hard on me.

395
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,400
I'll feed you, all right?

396
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,200
Okay.

397
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,400
- It's hot. 
 - Be careful.

398
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:15,000
How come I can suddenly lift my hands?

399
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,200
This must be a miraculous soup.

400
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,700
A miraculous soup.

401
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,400
Well, for a person who drinks milk tea,

402
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
why did you think of going for the alcohol?

403
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,200
For many things,

404
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:39,000
we'll only know whether we like them or not after trying them.

405
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,200
Has your phone been fixed?

406
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,400
That's not right.

407
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,000
Who are you here to visit?

408
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,100
Initially, I felt touched when you came and visited me.

409
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:12,000
But it turns out that you're still thinking about the test result on my phone.

410
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,800
I did not. I just feel that I'm responsible for your broken phone.

411
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,100
All right. Stop acting.

412
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:22,100
The screen was fixed a while ago.

413
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,600
I'll show it to you now.

414
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:28,800
But I have to warn you that there's one good news and one bad news.

415
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,400

416
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,700
Isn't it good news?

417
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,400
It can be considered so.

418
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,800
After all, since childhood, I achieved high scores in everything I did.

419
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,000
You're right. You and A'Liang were top students.

420
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,800
And it made me look slow-witted in comparison.

421
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,400
What about the bad news?

422
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,800
The bad news is when I entered the data that day,

423
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,000
out of instinct and conditioned reflex,

424
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I entered my birth details instead.

425
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,700
What?

426
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,300
- What are you doing? 
 - It's not accurate.

427
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,500
I didn't say it's accurate.

428
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,100
Childish. I'm leaving.

429
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,900
The doctor said you could be discharged tomorrow.

430
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,500
It's quite accurate.

431
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,800
It's 98 percent.

432
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,400
♫  Sailing on the sea of life  ♫

433
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,800
♫  All alone lost on the tide  ♫

434
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:43,800
♫  Waves of silver glitters blind my eyes  ♫

435
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,200
♫  Another day has gone  ♫

436
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,000
♫  Another night has come  ♫

437
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,900
♫  Take my boat and point it east  ♫

438
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,200
♫  Where the first star holds its place  ♫

439
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:12,000
♫  When the storm comes hailing down my face  ♫

440
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,400
♫  I close my eyes and look  ♫

441
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,200
♫  To where you are  ♫

442
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,800
♫  You are my guiding star  ♫

443
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:26,600
♫  You are the compass in my heart  ♫

444
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,200
♫  Rain or shine, you never falter  ♫

445
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,400
♫  Always on your mark  ♫

446
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,000
♫  You are my guiding star  ♫

447
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,800
♫  With you, I will never lose my way  ♫

448
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,100
♫  Life is a journey  ♫

449
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,400
♫  Taking me back to where you are  ♫

450
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,600
You're awake.

451
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,600
Are you hungry?

452
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,200
I'll help you get up so you can eat something.

453
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,800
The doctor said you must eat more high-protein food to replenish your energy.

454
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,800
I've bought you some milk and oatmeal.

455
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,000
Have some later.

456
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,000
Are you all right?

457
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,900
I'm fine.

458
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,200
What happened to your hand?

459
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,600
I accidentally scratched it when I climbed up.

460
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,000
Does it hurt?

461
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I'm fine. It will recover in a few days.

462
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
What's most important now is your health.

463
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,600
Come on.

464
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,700
Xieyi, where's your bracelet?

465
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,000
Didn't I drop my phone?

466
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,400
I traded my bracelet to the hospital's convenience store.

467
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,000
Otherwise, you won't have these foods.

468
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
The bracelet was a gift from your dad.

469
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,600
It means a lot to you.

470
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:55,200
There's something that means more to me now.

471
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,200
Finishing all these foods is the greatest respect for my bracelet.

472
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,000
Come on.

473
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:24,400
The doctor said your leg doesn't look like being caused by a fall.

474
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,600
You fell from such a high place, but your bone was fine.

475
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,500
That's really rare.

476
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,400
It's a small hospital.

477
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,200
The doctors have seen fewer cases.

478
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,000
That's not surprising.

479
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,400
By the way, the doctor also said that there's some inflammation on your leg.

480
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,800
He needs to contact your attending doctor

481
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,500
so he can find a way to treat it.

482
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,800
I know my own body well.

483
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,600
I'm fine. Don't worry.

484
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,200
Just leave it to Yingsong to handle it.

485
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:10,800
- But... 
 - Su Xieyi, are you here to ask me questions,

486
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,200
or to feed me?

487
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,600
Come on.

488
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,700
♫  Baby, I love you  ♫

489
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,400
♫  I feel you, I need you  ♫

490
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,500
♫  I want to be happy because of you  ♫

491
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,400
♫  I secretly blindfolded you  ♫

492
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,400
♫  I'll tell you where I am  ♫

493
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:53,500
♫  It's just you and I, forever  ♫

494
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:05,000

495
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,200
 ''How Have You Been Lately?'' - Silence Wang

496
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:16,100
♫   Halfway through the journey on the train,   ♫

497
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:20,000
♫   a new passenger takes a seat   ♫

498
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,200
♫   The bells on the platform are ringing   ♫

499
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,700
♫   I wave my hands to see the passengers off   ♫

500
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:30,500
♫   With a one-way ticket stub in your hand   ♫

501
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:34,200
♫   you've embarked on a journey to happiness   ♫

502
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,600
♫   I didn't save your contact information   ♫

503
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,900
♫   But in my heart, I secretly ask   ♫

504
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,600
♫   How have you been lately?   ♫

505
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,800
♫   How's it going with him?   ♫

506
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,200
♫   I bet his temper is better than mine   ♫

507
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:52,200
♫   He's better at guessing your complicated thoughts   ♫

508
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:56,100
♫   Does he hold you when you're sad?   ♫

509
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,000
♫   How have you been lately?   ♫

510
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,800
♫   Everything must be going well   ♫

511
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:03,700
♫   Do you want to hear what I haven't said?   ♫

512
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:11,200
♫   Do lyrics of love songs stir up your emotions and recall all of our memories?   ♫

513
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:15,000
♫   It doesn't seem to be difficult   ♫

514
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,600
♫   How have you been lately?   ♫

515
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,500
♫   How's it going with him?   ♫

516
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:49,300
♫   You and fate have not given me an answer   ♫

517
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:53,200
♫   The price of growing up is like a pile of bargaining chip   ♫

518
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,900
♫   The wager is who can let go first   ♫

519
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,800
♫   How have you been lately?   ♫

520
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,800
♫   Everything must be going well   ♫

521
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:05,000
♫   Life is not as complicated as I thought   ♫

522
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,200
♫   Silence is the best that I can do   ♫

523
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,400
♫   Whatever pain and suffering may come,   ♫

524
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,000
♫   I'm not afraid at all   ♫

525
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:25,810
