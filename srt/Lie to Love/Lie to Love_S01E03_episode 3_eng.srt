2
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:25,200
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

3
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:33,600
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

4
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:41,400
♫  And turn to face all the long lost times  ♫

5
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,400
♫  Brace the pain  ♫

6
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:51,200
♫  Let memories wake up from oceans deep  ♫

7
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,400
♫  No place to hide  ♫

8
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,600
♫  No way to run  ♫

9
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,800
♫  New dawn counts down  ♫

10
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,000
♫  I fight  ♫

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,200
♫  I cry  ♫

12
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,700
♫  I give up  ♫

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:15,800
♫  Memories forgotten, forsaken surround  ♫

14
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:24,200
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

15
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:32,800
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

16
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:41,000
♫  Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,600
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

18
00:01:49,600 --> 00:02:00,200

19
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,000

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,800
You should rest early.

21
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,800
I'll head back then.

22
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,300
Okay. Thanks, Uncle.

23
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,000
Do you have visitors this late?

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,100
You're popular.

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,400
Is no one going to open the door?

26
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,300
Hello, is Mr. Li here?

27
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,800
I need him to sign several documents.

28
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,800
Let her in.

29
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,700
Please come in.

30
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Zeliang, this is...

31
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,800
Chairman Huo. Hi.

32
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,800
I'm Su Xieyi, Mr. Li's temporary assistant.

33
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,200
I have several documents pending his signature.

34
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,400
I still have matters to discuss with Chairman Huo.

35
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,700
I'll sign tomorrow.

36
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,900
Wait. Show me the documents.

37
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,000
If I'm not mistaken, you were assigned to be Zeliang's assistant

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,800
the first day you started working?

39
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,200
Yes, Chairman.

40
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,000
You barely started,

41
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,700
and you already know Zeliang's address.

42
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,000
You come to him at this ungodly hour.

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,700
Why? Are you close to him?

44
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,200
You must be joking, Chairman.

45
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,600
I can't possibly be very close to Mr. Li.

46
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,300
It was Jessica who told me his address, his itinerary,

47
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,300
his habits, and his hobbies.

48
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,800
These are all important info

49
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,400
that a personal assistant should have from the start.

50
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,000
Good.

51
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,240
Zeliang, you picked the right candidate.

52
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,900
Miss Su here is better than I expected.

53
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,600
You're exaggerating, Uncle.

54
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,700
She's just a random candidate that the General Manager's Office sent to me.

55
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,400
She's on the probation period anyway.

56
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,600
We might as well give her a trial.

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,700
It's late now. I will leave you guys be.

58
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,400
- See you. 
 - Let me see you off, Uncle.

59
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,700
No need.

60
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,200
Don't drink so much. Rest early.

61
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,400
As for rock climbing, be patient.

62
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,000
Don't hurt yourself.

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,400
Thanks for your concerns, Uncle.

64
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,000
Yingsong, see my uncle off.

65
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,600
Yes.

66
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,800
I invited you just now, and you said no.

67
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
Why did you come out of a sudden then?

68
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,000
My work is not done.

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,300
I need you to sign the documents here

70
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,800
so I can send them off tomorrow.

71
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,000
You're working so hard.

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,600
Of course.

73
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,400
You don't need to work, but I have to.

74
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,200
I'm still a newbie, and I'm on a probation period.

75
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,000
I have to work hard.

76
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,400

77
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,500
What are you looking at?

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,600
I like your house layout.

79
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Aren't you in a hurry to send these documents off?

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,900
Leave now then.

81
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,200
Mr. Li, I have an upset tummy suddenly.

82
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,000
Can I use your bathroom?

83
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,800
Go ahead.

84
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,600
Thanks.

85
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,100
You went past it.

86
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 The contract might be in his study.

87
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,600
 I can't leave now.

88
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,000
 I need to find a way to stay here.

89
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,400
Miss Su, my floor can be slippery.

90
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,100
It's your first time here. Don't slip and fall.

91
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,800
Thank you.

92
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,200
Then if there is nothing else, I will leave.

93
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,800
If you're not in a hurry, help clean my house too.

94
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,200
My uncle complained that my house was too messy.

95
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,400
It needs a good cleaning.

96
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,000
Never mind. I should let Yingsong handle it.

97
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,500
You don't look like you can do house chores.

98
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,200
No.

99
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,600
Mr. Ji is a man.

100
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,700
I'm sure he doesn't do house chores at all.

101
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,200
I'm the right person to do it.

102
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,000
Whether I'm happy or upset, I do house chores.

103
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,400
Now, I consider myself a perfect house manager.

104
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,700
Do, Re, Mi.

105
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,000
Go do the dishes.

106
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,800
Sure.

107
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,200
Fa.

108
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,200
♫  So open your mind  ♫

109
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,800
♫  Give me some time  ♫

110
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,600
♫  Every second matters for a perfect love  ♫

111
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,200
♫  Are you a little excited?  ♫

112
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
♫  First, I'll tease your eyes  ♫

113
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,800
♫  Tell sweet little lies  ♫

114
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,600
♫  The height of canvas shoes is perfect for a spin  ♫

115
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,800
♫  You are my stage  ♫

116
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,400
Well... Mr. Li, I have cleaned the kitchen.

117
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,400
Let me help you tidy up the guest room and the study too.

118
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,800
There is no need to do them first.

119
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,800
Help me change the bedsheets and the duvet.

120
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,300
Okay.

121
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,300
♫  Take a deep breath and give me five!  ♫

122
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,400
♫  I want to give you a perfect, exclusive, absolute love  ♫

123
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,300
♫  I'm tame when I'm happy  ♫

124
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,300
♫  I'm mean when I'm angry  ♫

125
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,600
♫  Make you smile, Oh, then make you cry  ♫

126
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,100
Done?

127
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,600
If you're done, mop the floor and clean the window.

128
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Okay.

129
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,400
♫  Your eyes will follow me  ♫

130
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,200
♫  Your heart will beat for me  ♫

131
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,700
♫  Don't be surprised, my love comes with spice  ♫

132
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,500
♫  I am your Mrs. Right  ♫

133
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,700
It's done. Air the bedsheets.

134
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,100
Okay.

135
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,800
♫  Your eyes will follow me  ♫

136
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,600
♫  Your heart will beat for me  ♫

137
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,600
♫  Don't be surprised, my love comes with spice  ♫

138
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,200
Done?

139
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,500
Then come clean the living room.

140
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,700
I'm on it.

141
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
This feels good.

142
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,400
Of course.

143
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,800
Meanwhile, I'm all exhausted here.

144
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,600
But it's good.

145
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,500
Once I'm done with the living room, the study will be next.

146
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,300
S-Sorry, Mr. Li. I didn't do it on purpose.

147
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,000
And you call yourself a perfect house manager?

148
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,500
I will pay for it.

149
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,400
Forget it. I never like that accessory anyway.

150
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,800
Clean up the broken pieces.

151
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,800
 So cute!

152
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,400
 Don't touch it.

153
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,000
 You need a medical plaster to disinfect the wound.

154
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Come on.

155
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,800
Is your hand okay?

156
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,200
It's just some cuts.

157
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,200
Put it on yourself.

158
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,800
Since you're injured, you don't need to clean anymore.

159
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
You can go back now.

160
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,400
No!

161
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,300
Director Li, I'm really fine.

162
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,600
Look. I've cleaned the kitchen, the living room, and the bedroom.

163
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,800
I aired the bedsheets and changed the duvet. There's only the study left.

164
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,800
Please let me finish the cleaning.

165
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,200
Fine.

166
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,800
Thanks, Director Li.

167
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,000
 Other than drinking, he doesn't do anything.

168
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,300
 I can't find any document here, let alone a contract.

169
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,400

170
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,200
 Chestnut, it's time to eat now.

171
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,000
 This is an apple.

172
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,400
 Do you like it, Chestnut?

173
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,400
 - Who are you feeding? 
 - Smell it.

174
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,600
 I gave it a name, Chestnut.

175
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,800
 Chestnut, allow me to introduce. This is your brother.

176
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,000
 His name is Li Zeliang.

177
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,600
 Let's eat.

178
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,800
 Chestnut.

179
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,700
 Chestnut, I'm your brother. Do you understand?

180
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,090

181
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,700

182
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,400
Miss Su, what are you doing?

183
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,000
I saw a messy rack, so I went to arrange it.

184
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,200
It's been a night. Are you not tired?

185
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,200
You came to ask me to sign something. Then you had a stomachache,

186
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,200
and then you started cleaning my house.

187
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,400
I must give credit to your acting.

188
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,900
But you asked me to do the cleaning.

189
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,800
Is that so?

190
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,800
Meeting me at that bar, ousting Secretary Lin,

191
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,200
applying to Ocean Hotel in order to become my assistant...

192
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,800
Did I ask you to do all that?

193
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,000
Also,

194
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,000
you didn't lose your memory, did you?

195
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,000
What do you mean?

196
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,300
Those who are amnesiac will inquire about the details

197
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,000
when they see a photo of themselves,

198
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,800
but you didn't.

199
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,200
You stowed it away.

200
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,100

201
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,400
Come clean now.

202
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,800
What exactly do you want?

203
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,200
Fine.

204
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,800
Yes, I did see the photo. So what?

205
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,600
But how is that a solid reason for you to doubt me?

206
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,400
In the past two years, many people have used

207
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,800
"I think we have met" as an excuse to approach me.

208
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,200
I talked to them in hopes that I could find something useful,

209
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:01,000
but what I received were sinister intentions, one after another.

210
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,000
You're just like them.

211
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
In your eyes, someone amnesiac is like a liar.

212
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,800
I see now.

213
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,200
You already started to doubt me when we were

214
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,400
in the crab roe noodles restaurant, didn't you?

215
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,200
Why do you do this?

216
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,200
I just want to know who I am and what happened in my past.

217
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,600
Is that too much to ask for?

218
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,200
After all this time,

219
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,600
I finally understood something.

220
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:41,200
Don't simply show your wound to someone else.

221
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,000
Not only is it pathetic,

222
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,200
but it is also because no one will truly pity you.

223
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,500
That's why I learned to keep quiet.

224
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,600
I've learned to stop asking.

225
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,000
I've learned to shut myself in my own world.

226
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,700
It's painful,

227
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,600
but it's the best way to protect myself.

228
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Just so you know,

229
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,200
no one will ever joke about his or her trauma.

230
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,000
You have never lost your memory,

231
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
so you have no idea how torturous it is to lose your memory.

232
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,200
Can you imagine one day,

233
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,700
when you open your eyes,

234
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,600
you can't remember a thing?

235
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,600
As if the world just abandoned you?

236
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,000
As if you're just a lone ship on the vast ocean.

237
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,600
No matter how hard you try,

238
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,800
you can never get any signal.

239
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,000
This is where the memory went missing,

240
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
but this is where it feels empty.

241
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,400
♫  We're together right from the start  ♫

242
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,800
♫  I was the shadow that chased you round and round  ♫

243
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,000
♫  You don't see me  ♫

244
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm sorry.

245
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,400
♫  But now I need to take back myself  ♫

246
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,200
Director Li, sorry for disturbing you tonight.

247
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,600
♫  Trust in another to heal these open scars  ♫

248
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,600
I'll leave now.

249
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,000
♫  So I can love again  ♫

250
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,800
Also,

251
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,600
thank you for covering for me about Secretary Lin.

252
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,800
I don't like to owe anyone a favor,

253
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,200
so don't need to repay my clothes.

254
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,200
Just think that I took advantage of you.

255
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,400
From now on, I'll regard you as my superior.

256
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
♫  Looking so close but yet so far  ♫

257
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,400
♫  I need to stop, I need to give you up  ♫

258
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,780
♫  Before my heart comes apart  ♫

259
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:07,399
♫  In your circle of love  ♫

260
00:20:07,399 --> 00:20:11,259
Su Xieyi, you shouldn't have come today.

261
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,688
You were too reckless.

262
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,699
 Who is that new secretary of Zeliang?

263
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:22,119
She's interesting.

264
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:25,319
She was hired by HR through legit means.

265
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:27,899
I heard she used to study in Germany.

266
00:20:27,899 --> 00:20:32,139
I don't think it's that simple.

267
00:20:32,139 --> 00:20:35,161
Because she took Lin Tai's position?

268
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:48,020
My nephew never allows any outsider into his house.

269
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:52,340
But that girl just started, and she barged into his place.

270
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,920
They have a unique relationship.

271
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,540
I will get to the end of this.

272
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,160
Your work ethic always reassures me.

273
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:11,800
Oh, right. It's your birthday next month.

274
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,499
I have prepared a surprise for you.

275
00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:16,040
Thank you.

276
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,680
Let me prepare the bed for you.

277
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,280
No need.

278
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,799

00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,620
Tell me what happened.

291
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,880
Do you still remember the girl I told you about?

292
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,580
Which girl?

293
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,860
Oh, I remember.

294
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:34,580
Was it the girl you saw when you went rock-climbing two years ago,

295
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:39,359
who you think was your soul mate but ended up disappearing?

296
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,580
Yes.

297
00:22:42,219 --> 00:22:44,000
She's back now.

298
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,060
She's in Ocean Hotel and is now my assistant.

299
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,599
What?

300
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:50,939
She's back?

301
00:22:50,939 --> 00:22:52,720
And she's your assistant now?

302
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,499
But she said she had lost her memory and couldn't recognize me.

303
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,920
Yet, she keeps trying to approach me.

304
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,360
What do you think she wants?

305
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,620
This sounds complicated.

306
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,019
You know what? Let's start from the top.

307
00:23:07,899 --> 00:23:10,759
Was it love at first sight?

308
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,699
 Allow me to introduce myself.

309
00:23:12,699 --> 00:23:15,500
 I'm Li Zeliang. And you?

310
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,640
 You can call me Xiao Yi.

311
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,880
Did you wish you two could have met earlier?

312
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:51,739
 What do you think? Does my rainbow sweater look good?

313
00:23:51,739 --> 00:23:53,520
 It's quite good.

314
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:59,020
 But next time when you're changing, remember to switch off the light.

315
00:24:03,219 --> 00:24:05,960
 Perhaps I did it on purpose.

316
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:17,359
Did you guys click with each other?

317
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:28,340
 Giving someone a taste of his own medicine is my forte.

318
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,000
 Thanks for the lesson.

319
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,519
 You too.

320
00:24:34,939 --> 00:24:39,340
Did something intimate happen between you two?

321
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,519
All the boxes are ticked.

322
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:59,840
I thought you two just met each other once. That's all.

323
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,000
Does Chuchu know about this?

324
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,440
She'll be back soon.

325
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,480
What does this have anything to do with Shi Chuchu?

326
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,739
You know Chuchu's feelings, don't you?

327
00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:14,739
She told me loud and clear that she doesn't like me.

328
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,240
She's just acting tough.

329
00:25:19,939 --> 00:25:23,699
Also, why drag her into this?

330
00:25:23,699 --> 00:25:26,599
You've asked me many questions. What's your analysis?

331
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:30,420
Well, have you confronted her about why she approached you?

332
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,780
Yes, but I couldn't get anything useful.

333
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,880
She won't admit it?

334
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:41,279
I think she's pretending to be an amnesiac.

335
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,400
But if she never lost her memory, why go through the hassle?

336
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,839
Perhaps...

337
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,720
she still loves you?

338
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,620
 Do you like rock climbing a lot?

339
00:26:21,219 --> 00:26:24,879
 Yes. I love how relaxing it can be.

340
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:32,179
 You know, if you want to escape from time, you should listen to music.

341
00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:35,980
 If you want to prolong time, you can travel.

342
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,759
 If you want to stop time...

343
00:26:45,859 --> 00:26:49,979
 If you want to stop time then?

344
00:26:52,859 --> 00:26:54,279
 Oh, right.

345
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:58,619
 Why did you come here and camp alone?

346
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:01,540
 Do you want to capture the sunrise?

347
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,899
 My father has always wanted to watch the sunrise from this spot,

348
00:27:05,899 --> 00:27:08,239
 but he's been very busy.

349
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:14,139
 So this time, I snuck here to take a photo of the sunrise as his birthday present.

350
00:27:14,139 --> 00:27:16,079
 He will be over the moon.

351
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,000
 What's wrong?

352
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,740
 You're doing a great job.

353
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,440
 It's just that

354
00:27:30,379 --> 00:27:32,960
 the opportunity might not always be available.

355
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:36,919
 Why so sentimental out of a sudden?

356
00:27:38,179 --> 00:27:41,799
 No reason. It's just that it reminds

357
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:48,499
 me of how I never gave my father a present before he passed away.

358
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,159
 I'm sorry.

359
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:59,780
 Don't be. It's just a cycle of life.

360
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:04,359
 But back then, I thought my father was invincible.

361
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:07,920
 He could have everything he wanted.

362
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,319
 But when I think about it now,

363
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:15,980
 I realized I never cared to find out what he truly wanted,

364
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,939
 what he truly liked.

365
00:28:17,939 --> 00:28:22,280
 Besides, I never offered to share his burden.

366
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:29,899
 Hayao Miyazaki once said that if the people around you have to leave,

367
00:28:29,899 --> 00:28:31,440
 even if it pains you a lot,

368
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,619
 you still have to smile and bid them farewell.

369
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:37,820
 After all, life is short, so try to fill it with joy.

370
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,960
 Let me ask you this question then.

371
00:28:49,219 --> 00:28:54,120
 Do you know why we turn into stars when we pass away?

372
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,839
 Because the stars are actually your family

373
00:28:56,839 --> 00:29:01,060
 who light up the path for you when everything is dark.

374
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,820
 Sherlock Holmes once said

375
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:15,459
"When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains,"

376
00:29:15,459 --> 00:29:19,319
"however improbable, must be the truth."

377
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:22,900
She worked so hard to approach you.

378
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,900
Perhaps she still has feelings toward you.

379
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,380
But why did she claim to be an amnesiac?

380
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,739
It doesn't make sense.

381
00:29:31,739 --> 00:29:34,739
It's like what they show on TV.

382
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:40,659
Only a unique woman can attract the attention of an elite man.

383
00:29:41,267 --> 00:29:43,519
- You've got a point. 
 - Based on my experience,

384
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:48,640
her advances towards you are like this glass of wine,

385
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,219
you'll get addicted to it.

386
00:29:50,219 --> 00:29:53,039
It's just a matter of how long you can resist it.

387
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,340
 What?

388
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,960
 Didn't you say a tree has its own memory?

389
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,100
 We'll write our name on a tree leaf and hide it inside a tree hollow.

390
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,340
 That way, it will remember us forever.

391
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,339
 Your turn now.

392
00:31:18,339 --> 00:31:19,859
 So childish.

393
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,900

394
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,420
 Give it to me.

395
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:35,070

396
00:31:36,879 --> 00:31:39,640
 - Done. 
 - Acting tough.

397
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,519
 Do you think anyone will find it if I put it there?

398
00:32:04,499 --> 00:32:07,419
 How about we come here again to check on it?

399
00:32:07,419 --> 00:32:08,919
 Sure.

400
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,560
 Take this.

401
00:32:16,699 --> 00:32:20,979
 Don't you think we're very close to the stars?

402
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,360
 Thank you.

403
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:37,800
 Didn't you say you wanted to stay in this moment forever?

404
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,319
 Let's stop the time then.

405
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:47,519
 So... what is the answer?

406
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:52,100
 If you want to stop time, you...

407
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:59,150
♫  Yes, I do swear it's true  ♫

408
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:02,750
♫  There is light in a hollow tree too  ♫

409
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:08,650
♫  I want to protect you by your side  ♫

410
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:11,130
♫  I want to give to you  ♫

411
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:14,720
♫  A space you'll never feel hurt  ♫

412
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:20,020
♫  I'll hug you when you feel like crying  ♫

413
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:25,950
♫  Ever and after  ♫

414
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:38,520

415
00:33:40,313 --> 00:33:41,379
Hello?

416
00:33:41,379 --> 00:33:44,395
 Xieyi, are you home?

417
00:33:44,395 --> 00:33:46,300
Yes, Brother Ming Hao.

418
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,060
 Are you tired from work?

419
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:51,440
 You don't sound well.

420
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,720
I'm fine.

421
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,919
Something unexpected happened,

422
00:33:56,499 --> 00:33:58,340
and it was tricky to deal with it.

423
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:02,140
Xieyi, your plan isn't the priority.

424
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,259
Your safety is.

425
00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:05,799
Don't worry.

426
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:08,879
I know what to do next.

427
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:11,260
Okay.

428
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:15,039
No matter what, protect yourself first.

429
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:17,459
Don't push yourself too hard.

430
00:34:17,459 --> 00:34:19,139
Okay.

431
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:22,280
 I'm going to Heping Night Market to buy some mung bean cakes for your sister.

432
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,499
Do you want to join me?

433
00:34:23,499 --> 00:34:25,340
No, thanks.

434
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,979
Tell my sister that I miss her a lot.

435
00:34:31,259 --> 00:34:33,020
 Oh, right, Brother Ming Hao.

436
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,920
 Can I ask you something?

437
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,420
Sure.

438
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,120
If...

439
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,639
my sister stays that way forever,

440
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,540
will you still remain by her side?

441
00:34:48,979 --> 00:34:52,940
Even though we're merely engaged to each other,

442
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,699
I promised her

443
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:59,859
that no matter what happens, I wouldn't give up on her.

444
00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:01,000
Thank you.

445
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,860
 Rest early. Rest your mind.

446
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,519
 If the contract is not at Li Zeliang's place,

447
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:18,280
 it must be inside Ocean Hotel.

448
00:35:31,979 --> 00:35:33,679
 If...

449
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:37,119
 my sister stays that way forever,

450
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,559
 will you still remain by her side?

451
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,240

452
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,399
- Come out now. Time to take your medicine. 
 - No!

453
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,739
- Come out now. 
 -  Don't touch me.

454
00:35:56,739 --> 00:35:59,560
- You'll recover after you take your medicine. 
 - I don't want to take medicine.

455
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,320
Be a good girl. Come on.

456
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,280
- Come out. 
 - I don't want medicine.

457
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,159
- Come out. 
 - I don't want medicine. Don't touch me.

458
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:05,800
- Come on. 
 - I'll stay here. Don't touch me.

459
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,321
- I don't want medicine. 
 - Listen to us, please.

460
00:36:07,321 --> 00:36:09,139
I don't want medicine.

461
00:36:09,139 --> 00:36:10,619
- Let's get you out of there first. 
 - What happened?

462
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:12,099
No!

463
00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:14,459
Lawyer Xie, thank god you're here.

464
00:36:14,459 --> 00:36:16,579
We don't know what to do here.

465
00:36:16,579 --> 00:36:18,279
Let me handle this.

466
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,920
Xie Qing.

467
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,940
Xie Qing.

468
00:36:30,419 --> 00:36:31,579
It's me.

469
00:36:31,579 --> 00:36:33,900
Come on. Come out.

470
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,920
Come on.

471
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,920
Don't touch me!

472
00:36:45,459 --> 00:36:47,059
Xie Qing.

473
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:52,159
Xie Qing, it's okay. Come out.

474
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:55,300
It's me, Ming Hao.

475
00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:03,660
Ming Hao?

476
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:14,139
Xie Qing. Take the medicine, okay?

477
00:37:14,139 --> 00:37:16,119
I don't want to.

478
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:17,800
- You don't want to? 
 - No, I don't.

479
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,840
Okay. We won't take it then.

480
00:37:24,499 --> 00:37:28,020
Look what I bought you.

481
00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:35,280
Take the medicine and you can have the mung bean cakes, okay?

482
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:39,560
That's my Xie Qing.

483
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,119
Hold this, okay?

484
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,359
Here. Take the medicine.

485
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:04,179
Careful. Hot.

486
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:07,899
Wait for me.

487
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:24,599
Good.

488
00:38:29,399 --> 00:38:33,220
I miss the time when we were in Germany.

489
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:37,520
The three of us were so happy.

490
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,599
Here.

491
00:38:44,459 --> 00:38:47,780
But Xieyi insisted on doing something risky.

492
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,940
Don't worry.

493
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,440
I'll protect her.

494
00:38:54,939 --> 00:38:56,400
Rest for a while.

495
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,739
We can have the cakes later, okay?

496
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,820
Xie Qing just arrived here from Germany.

497
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,979
She's not used to the new environment.

498
00:39:06,979 --> 00:39:10,120
Back in Germany, she was very obedient.

499
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:15,960
- Dr. Zhu, please be patient with her. 
 - Don't worry, Lawyer Xie.

500
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,840
Hi, Dr. Zhu.

501
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,679
We will do our best to help Xie Qing get used to the new environment.

502
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:23,719
However, Lawyer Xie, I must say you're very dedicated to her.

503
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:25,780
Many spouses can't even do half of what you did.

504
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,099
Not to mention you're just her fiancé.

505
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:29,799
It's my duty.

506
00:39:31,499 --> 00:39:33,220
We're a family.

507
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:37,020
And a family... won't leave each other.

508
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:45,260
 And a family... won't leave each other.

509
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:07,480
♫  I need you, I love you  ♫

510
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,130
♫  I'll brave the waves for you  ♫

511
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:14,490
♫  You don't have to be brave all the time  ♫

512
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:20,160
♫  Please believe that I am by your side  ♫

513
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:26,780
♫  Ever and after  ♫

514
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:38,050

515
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,110
♫  Halfway through the journey on the train,  ♫

516
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,930
♫  a new passenger takes a seat  ♫

517
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:54,160
♫  The bells on the platform are ringing  ♫

518
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,630
♫  I wave my hands to see the passengers off  ♫

519
00:40:56,630 --> 00:41:00,360
♫  With a one-way ticket stub in your hand  ♫

520
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:04,180
♫  you've embarked on a journey to happiness  ♫

521
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:07,580
♫  I didn't save your contact information  ♫

522
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,740
♫  But in my heart, I secretly ask  ♫

523
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,790
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

524
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:14,570
♫  How's it going with him?  ♫

525
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:18,210
♫  I bet his temper is better than mine  ♫

526
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:22,160
♫  He's better at guessing your complicated thoughts  ♫

527
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,060
♫  Does he hold you when you're sad?  ♫

528
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,940
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

529
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,770
♫  Everything must be going well  ♫

530
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:33,700
♫  Do you want to hear what I haven't said?  ♫

531
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:41,190
♫  Do lyrics of love songs stir up your emotions and recall all of our memories?  ♫

532
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:46,060
♫  It doesn't seem to be difficult  ♫

533
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:13,660
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

534
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,600
♫  How's it going with him?  ♫

535
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,120
♫  You and fate have not given me an answer  ♫

536
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:23,130
♫  The price of growing up is like a pile of bargaining chip  ♫

537
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:27,080
♫  The wager is who can let go first  ♫

538
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,830
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

539
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:30,610
♫  Everything must be going well  ♫

540
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:34,960
♫  Life is not as complicated as I thought  ♫

541
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,130
♫  Silence is the best that I can do  ♫

542
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:42,170
♫  Whatever pain and suffering may come,  ♫

543
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:45,910
♫  I'm not afraid at all  ♫

544
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:55,930
