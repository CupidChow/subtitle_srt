Where do you want to go?

Look at how dirty you are.

21

Does it hurt?

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,960
Be well-behaved.

Be a good girl.

Be well-behaved.

26
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,599
She isn't well-behaved.

27
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:27,599
She wants to fly away.

28
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:29,680
But don't worry.

29
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,960
I'll ensure that she'll

30
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,800
stay by our side forever.

31
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:43,879

Come on.

33
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,400
I've made lotus seed pig heart soup.

34
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:52,039
The doctor said it would help
to replenish the brain.

35
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,080
Xie Qing, it's me.

36
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,360
The doctor said you're recovering well.

37
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,439
There's hope in regaining health.

38
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,639
Do you know how much
I've been looking forward

39
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,439
to the day?

40
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,280
The day you'll call my name

41
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,680
as usual.

42
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,960
And share with me

43

your little secrets.

44
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,840
Did you recall something?

45
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,319
Don't worry.

46
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,199
You'll recall it one day.

47
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:54,000
Open your mouth.

48
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,000
That's right.

49
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,639
Have more.

(Meili Clothing Store)

52
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:30,759
- Yes?
- Hello.

53
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,079
I'd like to ask

54
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,800
if you sent this message to me.

55
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,320
(I have news about Liu Ah Wei.
Call me if want to know.)

56
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Why did you come so late?

57
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,279
I sent it a few days ago.

58
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:45,959
You know Liu Ah Wei?

59
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,480
It's mentioned
in the missing person notice

60
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,040
that there'll be a reward.

61
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,240
Okay.

62
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,000
I know Ah Wei.

63
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,199
He used to come here often

64
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,199
to buy alcohol.

65
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,360
But later on,

66
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,720
I heard he's not in good health.

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,279
He hasn't been here

68
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:14,800
for almost two months.

69
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,720
Then, do you know where he lives?

70
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,480
I don't know the exact location.

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,959
But I know

72
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,839
that he lives in the neighboring
Nanfeng Village.

73
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,759
Nanfeng Village?

74
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,240
Okay. Thank you.

75
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,199
Thank you.

76

78
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,319
You've been driving all the way.

79
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,959
Let me drive later.

80
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,920
I haven't driven for a long time.

81
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,480
I haven't had enough of it.

82
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:49,839
What is it?

83
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,319
You have no faith in my driving skills?

84
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,279
Come on.

85
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,079
Let's head to Nanfeng Village.

86
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,120
(Honor one's ancestors
for auspicious future)

87
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,959
This is the place.

88
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,160
Come on.

89
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,040
This village has a beautiful name

90
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,600

91
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:29,959
That way.

92
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,120
It's so delicious, folks.

93
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:37,360
Our honey is authentic
and reasonably priced.

94

97
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,279
our honey

98
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:46,199
is absolutely homemade.

99
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,800
No middlemen are involved
and earn a part.

100
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,639
We are only wild bees

101
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:50,519
keepers.

102
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,240

speaks quite passionately.

108
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,720
What about asking him for direction?

109
00:06:58,759 --> 00:06:59,120
Okay.

110
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,120

I'm fine.

119
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,360
Little girl,

120
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,800
when you hear the horn next time,

121
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:21,560
you must get out of the way.

122
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,439
Get it?

123
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,839
What a strange girl.

124
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,000
Folks,

125
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,279
did you see it?

126
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,480
This place

127
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,160
is full of good people.

128
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,879

137
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,600
You like our honey,

138
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,399
right?

139
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,879
That's great.

140
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,959
Miss, well,

141
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,759

I'll give you an extra 40 percent off

143

144
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:04,600
Sir,

145
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,240
we're not here to buy honey.

146
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,439
We'd like to ask you about a person.

147
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,720
Young man,

148
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,160
honey is good.

149
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,759
Honey

150
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,279
makes you healthy and beautiful.

151
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,160
Are you two dating?

152
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,639
I can assure you

153
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,000
that our honey

154
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,879

155
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,839
and filled with sweetness.

156
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:25,639
What do you think?

157
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:26,480
Okay.

158
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,879
We'll buy the honey.

159
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,040
But can we ask you

160
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,199
a question?

161
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,759
You can ask two questions too.

162
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,120
How many would you like to buy?

163
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:36,519
Give us two bottles then.

164
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,799
Great!

165
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,360
Two bottles sound good.

166
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,720
A pair.

167
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,720
Two bottles for sweet love.

168
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,639
Four bottles for a miracle in happiness.

169
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:48,519
Six bottles for a good marriage.

170
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:49,840
Six bottles.

171
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,480
You're magnanimous, young man.

172
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,519
Six bottles. Good.

173
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,679
An extra 40 percent off for six bottles.

174
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:55,480

and eighty cents.

176
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,519
Come on. What an auspicious number.

177
00:08:58,799 --> 00:08:59,840
One hundred and thirty-six
and eighty cents.

178
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,399
A smooth and prosperous life.

179
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,159
Here, scan this code.

180
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:04,600
Done.

181
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:06,600
Okay.

182
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:08,440
Sir,

183
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,639
do you know

184
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:10,399
where Liu Ah Wei lives?

185
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,159
He lives...

186
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:13,960
Well,

187
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,639
turn right after crossing the bridge,

188
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,120
and you'll find his house
at the end of the road.

189
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,159
Okay.

190
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,200
Thank you, sir.

191
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:21,919
Thank you.

192
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:22,600
Let's go.

193
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,200
Hey, you haven't taken your honey.

194
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,000
Keep them for us.

195
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,000
We'll come back for them later.

196
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,080
Thank you.

197
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,080
Wish you a booming business.

198
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,360
Wish you sweet love.

199
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:10,250
(Good fortune)

200
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,279
Anybody home?

201
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,080
Anybody home?

202
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:27,840
Yan.

203
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,960
Who are you looking for?

204
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:44,799
Hello.

205
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:46,399
We're looking for...

206
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:49,360
Looking for Liu Ah Wei.

207
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:51,159
Didn't you see

208
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,480
that he's gone?

209
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,440
May I know

210
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,960
the cause of his death?

211
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,840
It was two months ago.

212
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,799
He died from alcohol intoxication.

213
00:10:59,159 --> 00:10:59,759
He couldn't live

214
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,240
without alcohol.

215
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,000
I...

216
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,080
Who are you?

217
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,559
Let me tell you.

218
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,639
His debts are written off
after his death.

219
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:09,600
What he owed you before

220
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:10,679
has nothing to do with me.

221
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:12,720
Please don't get us wrong.

222
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,360
We're not here because of his debts.

223
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:15,799
We just have a few questions

224
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:16,840
to ask him.

225
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:18,159
What's it about?

226
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,480
Why did he suddenly resign

227
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,240
two years ago?

228
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:23,759
What?

229
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,039
How would I know why he resigned?

230
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,759
I have no idea.

231
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,039
Please leave.

232
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,559
We've met just now.

233
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,240
My name is Su Xie Yi.

234
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:39,600
What's your name?

235
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm Liu Xiao Xiao.

236
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:41,919
Xiao Xiao,

237
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,159
you know them?

238
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,399
She saved me

239
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:45,120
just now.

240
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,879
Otherwise, I might have been hit
by the electric tricycle.

241
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,159
Are you all right?

242
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,320
What's wrong with you?

243
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:52,559
How many times have I told you

244
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,519
to put on

245
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:54,879
your hearing aid when you go out?

246
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:56,799
Sir, Miss,

247
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,440
thank you so much.

248
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,360
Don't mention it.

249
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,600
It's our responsibility too.

250
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,159
Her hearing aid

251
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,480
was broken once.

252
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,679
So, she has been reluctant
to wear it now.

253
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,559
Xiao Xiao,

254
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,320
get to your room and do your homework.

255
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,000
Sir, Miss,

256
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:14,240
so sorry for what I said just now.

257
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:15,720
Come into the house.

258
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,679
I'll make you a pot of tea.

259
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:17,840
- Okay. Come on.
- Thank you.

260
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:18,559
Thank you.

261
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:46,759
Xiao Xiao,

262
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:49,960
what are you doing?

263
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,440
I'm listening to songs.

264
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,960
Why are you so nervous then?

265
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:58,960
My mom doesn't allow me

266
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,240
to listen to songs.

267
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:02,200
She'll be upset.

268
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,919
So I can only listen to them in secret.

269
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,039
Don't worry.

270
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,360
I won't tell your mom.

271
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,519
Carry on.

272
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:17,679
By the way, Xiao Xiao.

273
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,399
Xiao Xiao.

274
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:20,799
When did you

275
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:21,960
get the hearing aid?

276
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,679
My dad bought it for me two years ago.

277
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,240
He'd spent a lot of money on it.

278
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,240
Then, do you know

279
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:29,320
why your dad suddenly resigned

280
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,919
and moved here with you?

281
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,080
I don't know.

282
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:34,639
I heard from my mom

283
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:35,720
that my dad had seen

284
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,879
something terrible
that had frightened him.

285
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,480
That's why he brought my mom and me

286
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:41,120
and moved here.

287
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,799
Then, do you know what happened?

288
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,600
Xiao Xiao!

289
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,720
Sir, Miss,

290
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,159
thank you so much

291
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:57,000
for saving Xiao Xiao.

292
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,039
But you don't have

293
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:59,840
to go to great lengths
to make Xiao Xiao tell you.

294
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:01,080
We really

295
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:03,000
don't know anything about Ah Wei.

296
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,159
You may leave.

297
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,879
Xie Yi.

298
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,679
It's fine.

299
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:09,360
We'll leave now.

300
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,559
We'll visit you when we're free.

301
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,480
Sorry for disturbing you.

302
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:15,919
Let's go.

303
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,519
It seems that Liu Ah Wei must have seen

304
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,679
what Huo Jian did.

305
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,240
That's why he was frightened.

306
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,200
Well,

307
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,000
could he have witnessed Huo Jian

308
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,679
killing your dad?

309
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:39,879
Unfortunately, Liu Ah Wei
has passed away.

310
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,360
The trail goes cold now.

311
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:43,360
No.

312
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,919
I think Xiao Xiao's mom

313
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:46,000
does know something.

314
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,840
So, we can't leave now.

315
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,039
But she rebuffed us.

316
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,759
But Xiao Xiao likes us.

317
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,919
I'm afraid it won't be easy

318
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,399
to get close to her next time.

319
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,840
It will eventually turn out fine.

320
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,399
It's getting dark.

321
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,399
Let's find a place

322
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:10,039
to spend the night.

323
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,600
Okay.

324
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,080
You're saying

325
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,559
that Li Ze Liang isn't injured at all?

326
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,399
Yes.

327
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:21,320
Where are you going?

328
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,440
Want me to go with you?

329
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,799
Who is it? It's late at night.

330
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:36,360
Who is it?

331
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,320
Mr. Huo,

332
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,960
why did you come late at night?

333
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,679
Uncle, you're here.

334
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,639
Ze Liang,

335
00:15:58,519 --> 00:15:59,879
your left leg has grown?

336
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,879
Mr. Huo,

337
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,279
you caught me.

338
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:05,879
Look at my costume.

339
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,960
Does it look particularly interesting?

340
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,120
Where's Li Ze Liang?

341
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:10,840
Ze Liang has woken up

342
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:11,720
and gone to the hospital.

343
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,320
Is that so?

344
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:16,519
Mr. Huo,

345
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,960
where are you going?

346
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,759
Mr. Huo.

347
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:25,679
Mr. Huo!

348
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,000
Mr. Huo!

349
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:52,279
Mr. Huo.

350
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:51,200
(Huo Jian! Key suspect)
(Do not act rashly)

351
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,160
Good.

352
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:07,880
I have a good nephew indeed.

353
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:18,480
(K of Spades)
(My friend, it's been a while.)

354
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:19,519
(You are in trouble.)

355
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,070
(Yun'an Town)

356
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:39,119
(Li Ze Liang has found)

357
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,440
(Spider's whereabouts.)

358
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:41,920
(This is where they are now.)

359
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,000
(Stop them
if you want to save your life.)

360
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,400
Xie Yi.

361
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,319
Xie Yi.

362
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:03,480
Xie Yi.

363
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,559
Xie Yi.

364
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,160
Xie Yi.

365
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:17,920
Hello.

366
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,359
Mr. Li,

367
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,000
Huo Jian came

368
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,079
and found your secret room.

369
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,240
I'm sorry.

370
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,440
I was too careless.

371
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,279
It's okay.

372
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,599
Huo Jian might only know

373
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:35,680
that I'm not injured.

374
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:37,039
He doesn't know where I am.

375
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,720
He's the nervous one

376
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,079
now.

377
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,240
Got it.

378
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,480
You have

379
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,759
to be careful.

380
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,000
How's it? Is it settled?

381
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:58,960
Yes.

382
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:00,640
They only have rooms
on the first floor.

383
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:01,200
Let's go.

384
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,400
What do you mean by that?

385
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,240
I told you

386
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:04,960
that the second-floor room is good.

387
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,160
It comes with a balcony
and a free breakfast.

388
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,960
And the room is bigger.

389
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:08,480
You just don't want
to take the stairs, do you?

390
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,039
How come I don't...

391
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:10,599
Xie Yi,

392
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,599
since the room on the second floor

393
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,640
is better,

394
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,119
then let's stay on the second floor.

395
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:16,759
No.

396
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,279
I want to live on the first floor.

397
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:33,960
Xie Yi,

398
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:36,680
this may look small,

399
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,559
but it's quite cozy.

400
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:41,759
Yan,

401
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:43,119
are you tired?

402
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,319
Don't just stand there.

403
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,519
We've been walking the whole day.

404
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,720
Why don't you lie down?

405
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,640
No need.

406
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,200
Stop wiping.

407
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,319
It's quite clean.

408
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,000
It's fine.

409
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:01,880
Xie Yi,

410
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,640
you seem to care about my leg a lot.

411
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,440
Of course, I care about you.

412
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,559
It has been a long day today.

413
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,119
These conditions aren't as good as home.

414
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,720
It's better to pay more attention.

415
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:15,680
Okay.

416
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,839
I'll go out to buy some water.

417
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,319
Take a rest.

418
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:23,240
Come back soon.

419
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,119
Hello, Mr. Ji.

420
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,319
Miss Su, what's the matter?

421
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,920
We've been walking the whole day.

422
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:40,039
I'm worried

423
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,079
Yan might have leg pain.

424
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:43,079
You do know

425
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:44,680
that he often pushes himself.

426
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,160
I'm worried

427
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,160
he won't say that he's in pain.

428
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:48,200
Miss Su,

429
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:50,559
you do know Mr. Li well.

430
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:51,960
So, I called

431
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,720
to ask about

432
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,319
how to take care of his leg.

433
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,480
His leg will swell easily

434
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:58,799
after walking for a long time.

435
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:00,640
He needs a hot compress and a massage

436
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,160
to promote blood circulation.

437
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,559
Then, can you teach me

438
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:04,839
how to do it in detail?

439
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,039
Just go ahead. I can remember it.

440
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,200
First, prepare

441
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,720
a towel and hot water.

442
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,920
What took her so long to buy some water?

443
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:28,839
Has something happened to her?

444
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,599
Mr. Ji,

445
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,240
thank you for taking care of Yan.

446
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:38,039
From now on,

447
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:39,480
let me take care of him.

448
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,640
He injured his leg

449
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,200
because of my dad.

450
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,200
Logically and sentimentally,
I should repay him.

451
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,759
Besides,

452
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,960
I really love him.

453
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:57,400
I hope

454
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,880
he can be healthy

455
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:00,279
and stay by my side forever.

456
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,640
Miss Su,

457
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,680
thank you

458
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,000
for your concern for Mr. Li.

459
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,240
(I know Xie Yi's personality well.)

460
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:26,759
(She is righteous and kind.)

461
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,559
She always repays
other people's kindness

462
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,839
with even more kindness.

463
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,599
If it weren't for knowing

464
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,160
that you injured your leg
because of Uncle Shen,

465
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,119
she would've already

466
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,400
gotten out of your way.

467
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:44,920
(Xie Yi,)

468
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:46,759
let me drive instead.

469
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:47,759
It's fine.

470
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:49,720

I haven't driven for a long time.

474
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
I haven't had enough of it.

475
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:00,799
No.

476
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,240

Yan,

486
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,759
you drank alcohol?

487
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,200
Did your leg hurt again?

488
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,400
Where have you been?

489
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,720
Why did you come back so late?

490
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,839
I went to the convenience store.

491
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:23,559
It's very far.

492
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,640
It took me so long to find it.

493
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:26,079
Look, I bought you

494
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:27,119
a new basin.

495
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:27,799
Later, I'll give you

496
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,440
an expert hot compress.

497
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:31,039
What do you think?

498
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:32,359
Do you look forward to it?

499
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Are you sure this towel

500
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,880
is usable?

501
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,039
I'll buy a new one for you then.

502
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:43,119
Wait for me here.

503
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:43,799
No need.

504
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:46,720
What's wrong with you today?

505
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:48,519
You've been talking oddly.

506
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,000
I've thought it through.

507
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,319
You may stay on the second floor.

508
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,359
The room there is better.

509
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:01,119
You don't have to keep me company here.

510
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,440
What's wrong?

511
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,640
Are you all right?

512
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:08,279
I'm fine.

513
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,200
Then, why are you chasing me away?

514
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,279
I just feel

515
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:14,400
that you don't have to do all this.

516
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,599
What have I done?

517
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:17,440
Is it wrong to care for you?

518
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:18,799
Are you concerned about me

519
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,079
or my leg?

520
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,640
Is there any difference?

521
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:24,960
Fine.

522
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,359
If you really mind

523
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:27,519
that I touch your leg,

524
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,079
then I'll apologize.

525
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,160
I won't touch it.

526
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:30,920
But can you

527
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,960
stop talking to me like this?

528
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,079
Su Xie Yi,

529
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,960
you don't owe me anything.

530
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,119
You don't need to repay me.

531
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:39,000
Li Ze Liang,

532
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,240
are you in a bad mood

533
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:41,359
because you were

534
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,519
given a cold shoulder?

535
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,519
Or is there any misunderstanding
between us?

536
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,000
You can't tell me, right?

537
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:49,920
Then, I'll say it for you.

538
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,279
Ever since the auction,

539
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,680
you've been very concerned about my leg

540
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,640
because you know

541
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:57,799
that my leg

542
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,200
was amputated for saving your dad.

543
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:00,920
You blame yourself.

544
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,240
You feel guilty.

545
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:04,240
You feel responsible.

546
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,680
But let me tell you, Su Xie Yi.

547
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,640
I don't need your sympathy.

548
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,559
Even if I lack everything

549
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:11,599
in the world,

550
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:13,119
I don't need your sympathy.

551
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,079
I don't need your mercy.

552
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:17,759
I saved your dad voluntarily.

553
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,799
Not to mention a leg.

554
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:20,880
Even if

555
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,960
I fell with him,

556
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:23,720
that'd be my own choice.

557
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:25,920
It has nothing to do with you.

558
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,519
This isn't how it is.

559
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:28,480
You don't have to explain.

560
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:30,119
You called

561
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,200
Ji Ying Song out there.

562
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,599
I heard everything.

563
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:42,240
Take some rest.

564
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,640
You don't need to repay me.

565
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:46,160
We're already tired.

566
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,640
Please.

567
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:00,359
I won't leave.

568
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:03,279
I'll never leave.

569
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,519
What can you do?

570
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:06,359
I not only will not leave

571
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,359
but also sleep here today.

572
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:10,160
I can sleep here alone.

573
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:11,880
I don't need to give someone a massage.

574
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,559
I don't need to give someone
a hot compress.

575
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:14,480
How great it is.

576
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,039

577
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:16,880
tomorrow

578
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,920
will be another vigorous day.

579
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:18,720
Good night.

580
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,039
Su Xie Yi,

581
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,640
did you not hear what I said?

582
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:30,079
Su Xie Yi.

583
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,559
You didn't hear me, right?

584
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:35,519
You refuse to leave, right?

585
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:37,200
Fine.

586
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,559
I'll leave then.

587
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,000
Didn't you already leave?

588
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,400
Why did you come back?

589
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,559
I've forgotten my toiletries.

590
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,200
What else have you forgotten?

591
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:09,359
I've forgotten my game console.

592
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,599
Anything else?

593
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,359
Nothing else.

594
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:19,640
You've forgotten me.

595
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,559
Yan,

596
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,200
to be honest,

597
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,039
when I knew your leg

598
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,400
was amputated

599
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,079
because of my dad,

600
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,359
I felt very guilty.

601
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,359
But it wasn't only guilt.

602
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,160
Whenever I looked at your leg,

603
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:53,839
I'd thought of

604
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,559
the person I love

605
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,920
had once tried very hard

606
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,720
to save my dad.

607
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,279
I'm really grateful for what you did.

608
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:05,319
I guess,

609
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:09,640
at his

610
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:10,839
last breath,

611
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,440
my dad was very touched too.

612
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:18,640
Although he'd chosen to give up,

613
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,039
your persuasion

614
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,079
must have dissolved many of his regrets.

615
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:27,440
Yan,

616
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,519
I want to tell you

617
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:33,160
that when I saw

618
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,359
the picture of us

619
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:35,920
kissing under the starry night
that you took,

620
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:39,240
when I saw Chestnut,

621
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:41,880
when I saw you

622
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,720
cutting out pictures
of starry night for me,

623
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:45,680
only did I realize

624
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,720
that both of us

625
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,640
have never forgotten

626
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,480

in the deepest part of my heart.

630
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,640
I didn't want to face it.

Sir,

693
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,720
you're even more generous

694
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,720
than the good-looking man and woman

695
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:08,880
you're looking for.

696
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:09,880
Where are they?

697
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,519
At the neighboring Nanfeng Village.

698
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:19,420
(Good fortune)

699
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,000
Ma'am,

700
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,519
are you making pickled cabbages?

701
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:33,800
Didn't I tell you

702
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,039
that I know nothing?

703
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,519
Stop bothering me.

704
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:38,920
We have no hidden agenda.

705
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,960
We just want to say goodbye

706
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,199
to Xiao Xiao before we leave.

707
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,880
Xiao Xiao is not at home.

708
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,119
Do you think

709
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,639
I don't know what's on your mind?

710
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,320
Since you two

711
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,480
have saved Xiao Xiao,

712
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,719
I don't want

713
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,639
to be rude.

714
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:53,039
Just leave.

715
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,440
There's no need for a farewell.

716
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,239
Xiao Xiao said her dad resigned

717
00:34:57,559 --> 00:34:58,119
because he saw

718
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:59,079
something frightening.

719
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,760
Stop talking nonsense.

720
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,400
Ah Wei was timid.

721
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:04,199
He was afraid

722
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:05,440
of everything.

723
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:06,320
Timid?

724
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,039
How could he be a Spider

725
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,559
and clean the windows
of high-rise buildings?

726
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,440
To make a living,

727
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:14,599
he had no choice.

728
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:18,440
Xiao Xiao's hearing aid

729
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,280
must have cost at least 200,000 yuan.

730
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:22,320
What does it have to do with you?

731
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:23,800
Liu Ah Wei worked as a Spider

732
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,559
for less than a year.

733
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,559
He bought a hearing aid for Xiao Xiao

734
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,920
and bought this house.

735
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,800
These cost at least 500,000 yuan.

736
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:31,960
Where did he get

737
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,679
so much money from?

738
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,719
He earned it himself.

739
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,880
Can you be sure

740
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,920
that it was from his legitimate income?

741
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:39,400
What nonsense are you talking about?

742
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,920
Are you done with it yet?

743
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,440
Didn't I tell you

744
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,239
that his debts are written off
after his death?

745
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:45,559
The source of that amount

746
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:46,400
has nothing to do with me.

747
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,119
Please.

748
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:50,239
Let us off, can you?

749
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:51,559
I really don't know

750
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:52,719
about Ah Wei's matter.

751
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,519
As for the money you mentioned,

752
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,800
I'd asked him before.

753
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,559
But whenever I did,

754
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,000
he'd lost his temper.

755
00:35:59,320 --> 00:35:59,880
After a while,

756
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,039
I dared not ask him again.

757
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:02,800
Now that Ah Wei is gone,

758
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:03,800
where can I

759
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,079
find the truth for you?

760
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,599
He really didn't say anything at all?

761
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:07,840
He didn't.

762
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:12,880
The evidence Liu Ah Wei possessed

763
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,000
is related to the truth

764
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,079
of my dad's death.

765
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,360
If you really know something,

766
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,400
I hope

767
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:20,760
you will tell us.

768
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:25,719
Ma'am.

769
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,119
Yan,

770
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,199
let her think about it.

771
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:33,440
We won't bother you any longer.

772
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,360
We should leave now.

773
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,000
Don't worry.

774
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,400
There will be a way.

775
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,679
From Li Xia's expression,

776
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,280
she must be keeping something from us.

777
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,000
But we shouldn't push too hard.

778
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,000
We must be patient.

779
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:19,079
But Xiao Xiao is quite

780
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,119
friendly with us.

781
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:21,920
Maybe

782
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:23,679
she'll be able to help us.

783
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,440
You're here to collect your honey!

784
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:28,400
Great!

785
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:30,079
I've waited for a day.

786
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:30,960
Here you go.

787
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:31,800
Thank you, sir.

788
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:34,599
What about

789
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:35,400
we get Xiao Xiao some too?

790
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:36,840
Are you talking about Liu Xiao Xiao?

791
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:39,159
She

792
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,239
doesn't like honey.

793
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,920
She likes my music.

794
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:43,360
But

795
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:44,920
doesn't she have a hearing disability?

796
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,440
That's not congenital.

797
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:49,280
If I'm not wrong, she had a high fever
when she was nine,

798
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:50,599
and it damaged her hearing.

799
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,519
But

800
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:53,480
she did surgery two years ago

801
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:54,480
and recovered well.

802
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,440
It's not a huge problem now.

803
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,599
In the past,

804
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,800
her dad, Liu Ah Wei,

805
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,559
told us

806
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,559
that Liu Xiao Xiao

807
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,119
could sing really well.

808
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,840
We look forward to hearing her sing.

809
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,480
But the girl

810
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,880
doesn't want to sing.

811
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:09,480
But based on my observation,

812
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,519
she

813
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:12,400
still likes singing very much.

814
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,239
Look, when I sell items
via a live broadcast

815
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:16,119
and the music begins,

816
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,519
Liu Xiao Xiao

817
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:19,960
will always come over to listen.

818
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,159
Look, Xiao Xiao is here.

819
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,119
Want some sweets?

820
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:41,159
My mom said sweets are bad for teeth.

821
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,599
Then, did your mom tell you

822
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,840
that sweets can make you feel good?

823
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:50,280
Right.

824
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:51,559
We shouldn't eat

825
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:52,800
what a stranger gives us.

826
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,000
I understand.

827
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:55,280
Xie Yi,

828
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,239
you're not a stranger.

829
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:57,880
I like you very much.

830
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:08,239
By the way, Xiao Xiao.

831
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,159
Did your mom forbid you to sing?

832
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:16,360
I don't sing well.

833
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:18,440
After I lost my hearing,

834
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,920
I kept singing out of tune.

835
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:22,719
I even got laughed at.

836
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:24,960
When my mom knew about this,
she was very mad

837
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,760
and often argued with those who laughed

838
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,239
at me.

839
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:29,119
So as not to let others bully me,

840
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:31,840
she doesn't allow me to sing again.

841
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,719
I don't want to see my mom
argue with others

842
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,880
because of me.

843
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:37,559
After my dad was gone,

844
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,679
she suffered a lot to make a living.

845
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,719
What's wrong with singing out of tune?

846
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:45,599
I sing out of tune too.

847
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:47,199
Listen if you don't believe me.

thank you.

I know you are comforting me.

854

855

are two different matters.

Xie Yi,

869
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,039
this silk scarf looks good.

870
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,639
I think it fits you well.

871
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:14,079
It indeed looks good.

872
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,119
Mr. Li,

873
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:20,639
let me ask you a question.

874
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:21,719
Sure.

875
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:24,280
Which one is better?

876
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:26,199
Me or the scarf?

877
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,519
Of course, it's you...

878
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:31,559
The scarf you're holding.

879
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:34,480
Fine.

880
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:35,320
I'm ugly.

881
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:36,079
I don't deserve it.

882
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:36,840
Take it.

883
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,159
You don't want it?

884
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:39,960
Okay.

885
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:41,239
I'll give it to someone then.

886
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,360
Let's see who I should give it to.

887
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:45,719
He's so handsome.

888
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,710
I like him.

889
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,199
What a fangirl.

890
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,320
Give this ugly lady away then.

891
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:52,360
No way.

892
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,079
I can't bear

893
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,679
to give this ugly lady to anyone.

894
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:00,159
Xie Yi,

895
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,480
you two are too cheesy.

896
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,559
Is this how adults are
when they are in love?

897
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,079
Adults in love

898
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,639
aren't for you kids to watch.

899
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,000
Okay. I won't watch.

900
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:10,159
I'll buy some water for you.

901
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:11,039
Okay.

902
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,440
Then, Xiao Xiao,

903
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,360
we'll wait for you there.

904
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:15,280
- Okay.
- Go.

905
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:19,119
Ma'am,

906
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:20,840
I'll take this.

907
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:21,559
Twenty-eight yuan.

908
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:22,480
