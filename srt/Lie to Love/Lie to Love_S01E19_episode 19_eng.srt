 ''Memory of Last Life'' - Curley Gao

3
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:25,200
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

4
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:33,600
♫  Still haunts me now and then in quiet nights  ♫

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:41,400
♫  And turn to face all the long lost times  ♫

6
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,400
♫  Brace the pain  ♫

7
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:51,200
♫  Let memories wake up from oceans deep  ♫

8
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,300
♫  No place to hide  ♫

9
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,600
♫  No way to run  ♫

10
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,800
♫  New dawn counts down  ♫

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,000
♫  I fight  ♫

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,200
♫  I cry  ♫

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,700
♫  I give up  ♫

14
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:15,800
♫  Memories forgotten, forsaken surround  ♫

15
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:24,200
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

16
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:33,000
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
♫  Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,900
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

19
00:01:49,900 --> 00:02:00,200

20
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,900

21
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,600
Xieyi,  I'd like to talk to Lawyer Xie in private.

22
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,000
Okay.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Do take it while it's hot.

24
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,600
What happened between Huo Jian and I has brought you harm.

25
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,000
Sorry about that.

26
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,700
I got injured because of Xiaoxiao.

27
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,900
I don't blame anyone for it.

28
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,900
So no need to apologize, Director Li.

29
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,000
However, Lawyer Xie.

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,200
Why did you suddenly show up here?

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,100
I saw a video online of Xieyi saving Xiaoxiao.

32
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,000
I went and looked up the address of the honey seller.

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,800
That's how I found this place.

34
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,600
You could have given us a heads-up before you came.

35
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,200
This town isn't very big.

36
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,800
But I'm sure it took some effort in locating us.

37
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,600
If I had told Xieyi beforehand, I doubt she would have let me come.

38
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,400
So when did you get here?

39
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,100
This morning. The honey seller was nearby.

40
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,200
I haven't even had the chance to check before the guy charged at me.

41
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,800
What?

42
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,300
Judging from your words, it seems like you are doubting me.

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,100
My uncle used to be someone I trusted most.

44
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:53,359
Who would've thought

45
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,700
that he would do such a cruel thing to my father.

46
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,600
So, I can't help but be warier.

47
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,300
Thank you, Lawyer Xie, for protecting Xiaoxiao.

48
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,400
I hope you don't take offense at any inconvenience caused.

49
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Sure. I'm a little tired.

50
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,300
I need to rest.

51
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,000
I'll excuse myself.

52
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,800
 By right, I shouldn't have revealed Mr. Li's illness.

53
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,100
 He's not in a clear state of mind.

54
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,100
 I'd rather you did not disturb him.

55
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,400
 If he suffers any more shock, his condition will get worse.

56
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,500
 All right, I got it. Thanks, Doctor.

57
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
 It's no problem.

58
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,700
 Are you okay?

59
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,800
 Lawyer Xie.

60
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,300
 Do you know me?

61
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,400
 My name is Liu A'Wei.

62
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,200
 I'm a window cleaner.

63
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,800
 My daughter took the wrong medication, and it ruined her hearing.

64
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,800
 You were the one who provided legal aid.

65
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,800
 Right. Your daughter was treated by a quack doctor for her fever and it caused her hearing loss.

66
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,400
 Yes.

67
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,100
 Is there something you need?

68
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,500
 Lawyer Xie, I have something here.

69
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,300
 Can you take a look?

70
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,500
 Should I tell the police?

71
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,000
 Let me see.

72
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,200
 Where did you get this?

73
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,800
 I secretly recorded it.

74
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,000
 I didn't do it on purpose.

75
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,300
 I... I took the video without thinking

76
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,200
 while I was cleaning the window.

77
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,600
 - Has anyone else seen this? 
 - No, no one.

78
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,000
 I just took it.

79
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,500
 I'm... I don't know what to do now.

80
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,500
 I... Should I report to the police?

81
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,700
 Listen to me.

82
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,000
 This man you recorded is someone important.

83
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,400
 If you tell the police and word gets out,

84
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,400
 I worry that you might be in danger.

85
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,800
 I knew it would come to this.

86
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,800
 Why did I get myself into such a mess?

87
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,800
 A'Wei.

88
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,700
 If you trust me, give me the video.

89
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 I'm a lawyer.

90
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Let me handle the matter.

91
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,600
 Really?

92
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,600
 Lawyer Xie.

93
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,200
 I saw on the news that people who provide tips

94
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,000
 are offered rewards.

95
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,600
 My daughter is suffering from hearing loss.

96
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,400
 It's pretty expensive to get a cochlear implant.

97
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,600
 All right.

98
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,800
 Give me the video and I'll give you the reward in advance.

99
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,400
 This way you should be free from danger.

100
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,200
 You'll do that?

101
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,400
 The passcode is the last six digits.

102
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,700
 Keep it safe.

103
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,200
 Lawyer Xie, you've done me a big favor.

104
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,700
 Here you go.

105
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,600
 Did you make a copy?

106
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,100
 No.

107
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,000
 Listen. You need to leave this city right away.

108
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,400
 Don't ever come back.

109
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,800
 If they find out your whereabouts, your family will be in danger too, let alone you.

110
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,800
 Okay. I'll do as I'm told.

111
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,400
 Liu A'Wei.

112
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,000
 Didn't you say there was no copy?

113
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 You best not have told anyone else this secret.

114
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,400
 Otherwise, don't blame me for being heartless.

115
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,600
Come, eat some more.

116
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,200
Thanks.

117
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,300
Thanks, Xiaoxiao.

118
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,000
Thank you.

119
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,700
Sorry for troubling you.

120
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,200
Don't say that.

121
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,900
You got hurt trying to save Xiaoxiao.

122
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,400
We should be taking care of you.

123
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,600
Here, have some more.

124
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,800
It's okay. I can help myself.

125
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,200
Mom, I'm full.

126
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,400
I'm going out to play.

127
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,300
Don't stay out too late.

128
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,200
Your friends said they'll pick you up tomorrow morning.

129
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,100
Sister Xia. What does A'Wei have in that USB drive?

130
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,700
If only I knew. A'Wei never showed me.

131
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm not good with computers, so I really have no idea.

132
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,400
Does he have anything else ike a memory drive?

133
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,700
That's the only one he left behind.

134
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,300
That's too bad.

135
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,200
Do you know if he told any friends about what it contained?

136
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,700
Forget friends.

137
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,600
A'Wei is a stubborn man.

138
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,400
He doesn't have many friends.

139
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,200
But one time he got a bit drunk and said he came across

140
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,000
something that scared him.

141
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,300
When I asked him to tell me more, he wouldn't say anything.

142
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,500
He was going to hit me.

143
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,400
He said we had to move.

144
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,100
That's why we moved here. It's a new surrounding.

145
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,200
He hardly had any friends.

146
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,200
Here, dig in.

147
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,900
Thanks.

148
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,200
The soup has gotten cold.

149
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,200
Let me heat it up.

150
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,700
Thank you.

151
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,200
What's on your mind?

152
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,400
Nothing.

153
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,700
I just thought it was a pity to let such a good chance slip.

154
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,800
A'Yan, do you think we'll get another clue?

155
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,000
We will.

156
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,400
It's like rock climbing.

157
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,000
The closer we are to the goal, the easier it is to fall.

158
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,400
But as long as the goal doesn't change and you don't give up,

159
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,400
you will surely succeed.

160
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,000
Sister Xieyi.

161
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,100
Xiaoxiao.

162
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,800
Here. Xiaoxiao.

163
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,300
Why did you suddenly come?

164
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,800
I have something for you.

165
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,600
What is it?

166
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,500
The thing you've been searching for.

167
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,600
Xiaoxiao. Where did you get this?

168
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,200
When I learned that you wanted it, but mom wouldn't give it to you,

169
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,400
I secretly put it away to give it to you later.

170
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,500
 Sir, Miss, thank you so much for saving Xiaoxiao.

171
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,500
 But you don't have to go to great lengths to make Xiaoxiao tell you.

172
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,600
 We really don't know anything about A'Wei.

173
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,800
 You may leave.

174
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,400
 Sister Xieyi.

175
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
But mom later changed her mind.

176
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,800
I didn't take it out in case she scolded me for lying.

177
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,200
So this is the USB drive your father left behind?

178
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,000
That's right.

179
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,000
Then why didn't you give it to your mom this morning?

180
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,800
Xieyi wanted me to tell Mom not to show it.

181
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,400
But she insisted.

182
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,500
So I made the decision not to give it to her.

183
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,700
Aren't I smart?

184
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,500
Xiaoxiao, what a smart girl you are.

185
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,200
Xiaoxiao. You know what?

186
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You've done something great.

187
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Later, I'll buy you lots and lots of presents for your good work.

188
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,200
I don't need presents. So long as you guys come play with me often.

189
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,400
- We will. 
 - Okay.

190
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,000
I need to get home.

191
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm out at this late hour. My mom will be worried.

192
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,600
Bye, Sister Xieyi. Bye, Brother Li.

193
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,800
- Be safe on the way back. 
 - Take care.

194
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,700
Thanks, Xiaoxiao!

195
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,500
A'Yan.

196
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,200
Looks like miracles do happen when you don't give up.

197
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,000
You're up, Lawyer Xie.

198
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Mr. Li asked me to come to pick you up.

199
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,100
- I bet you haven't had breakfast. 
 - Not yet.

200
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,600
Come, sit down and join me.

201
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,800
- Can I? 
 - Sure you can.

202
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,500
Don't mind if I do then.

203
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,800
Let me get you some congee.

204
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
No, no.

205
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,200
I'm good with what's here.

206
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,500
- Are you sure? 
 - Yes.

207
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,000
Where is Xieyi?

208
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,600
Miss Su and Mr. Li already left last night.

209
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,000
What's the hurry?

210
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,300
I think they found new evidence.

211
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,200
What did you say?

212
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,700
What evidence?

213
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,600
What?

214
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,200
The good news came too suddenly. I was caught by surprise.

215
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,000
So am I.

216
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,200
Right. Why wasn't I told about such good news earlier?

217
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,400
It's because you went to sleep early last night.

218
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,600
I didn't want to disturb you.

219
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,000
You eat. I've had my fill.

220
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,200
I'll wait for you in the car.

221
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,200
That was quick.

222
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,100
I can finish this in the car. You take your time.

223
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,100
I won't be long.

224
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,400

225
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,200
Hey, Zeliang. Are you back?

226
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,800
 Chuchu, I found new evidence on Huo Jian's crime.

227
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
 Bring your laptop and meet me right away.

228
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,600
Okay.

229
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,900
Nice play. Good one.

230
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,000
Chairman Huo's play is always fast and lethal.

231
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Not at all. We're all still learning.

232
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Old Kang, water for you.

233
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,400
Thanks.

234
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,200
Anyway, Old Huo, are you really going to while away the time

235
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,700
just playing badminton?

236
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,900
Right. All of us think that you withdrew too hastily.

237
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,400
You've worked so hard to build the foundation.

238
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,000
Are you ready to give it up so soon?

239
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,600
This position will be Li Zeliang's sooner or later.

240
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,100
That's true.

241
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,800
But passing the baton so soon is a little hasty, no?

242
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,200
Zeliang is very capable,

243
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,200
but he's just recovered after all.

244
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,600
We are thinking for the sake of the group.

245
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,800
All right.

246
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,400
If that's what you all think,

247
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,800
I will give this matter more time to think through.

248
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,100
- Come. Who wants to play another round with me? 
 - I'll play.

249
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,800
Allow me to play a round with you, Uncle.

250
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,200
Zeliang.

251
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,800
You are quite obedient.

252
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,400
I asked to meet you and here you are.

253
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,500
This will be the last time I play with you.

254
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,800
Surely I have to do my best.

255
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,400
Are you sure you can receive my serve?

256
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,700
No.

257
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,600
The one serving today will be me.

258
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,600
When a tree gets big, it easily becomes a nest for termites.

259
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,000
But I didn't think that the biggest termite

260
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
in a great big tree like Ocean would be you, Uncle.

261
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,000
Over the years, you've embezzled a pretty hefty sum from Ocean

262
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,800
using your power.

263
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,400
You let Lin Tai carry out real estate speculation.

264
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:05,700
 I heard the hotel's booking system has some bugs.

265
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,400
 Why are you so nervous?

266
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,800
 You just have to do what I told you to do well.

267
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,900
 As for the booking system,

268
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,500
 you can take your time with it.

269
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,600
You instructed Chen Hengsheng to sell fake liquor.

270
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,800
 Yunfeng's liquor business is our biggest cash inflow.

271
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,200
 It's a stable source of income.

272
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,600
 I will transfer the latest profits to the specified account.

273
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,300
Not only that. You also used the group's name

274
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:36,200
to purchase certain art pieces in bulk.

275
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,800
 And these art pieces

276
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,600
 are actually imitations for your personal gain.

277
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,800
 My father had given you full authority

278
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,800
 in the procurement of art pieces

279
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,800
 due to his utmost trust in you.

280
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,600
 Tens of millions of expenditure.

281
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,200
 You probably pocketed 80 percent of it.

282
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,000
Zeliang. We have shareholders present.

283
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,400
Watch what you say.

284
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,800
We have already dealt with Lin Tai and Chen Hengsheng.

285
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,400
Those incidents had nothing to do with me.

286
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,200
No need to get worked up, Uncle.

287
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,500
Or feel scared.

288
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,000
Regarding those art pieces,

289
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,300
I already know where they are.

290
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:20,000
The rebate was all remitted to a company named Kaixing.

291
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,200
Anyone wants to make a guess?

292
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,400
Who does this company belong to?

293
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,000
Huo Jian, what is going on here?

294
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,800
I've never heard of this company.

295
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,200
No use denying, Uncle.

296
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,300
I've looked into the company as well.

297
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:48,500
The legal representative is none other than your secretary, Yi Fei's younger brother.

298
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,600
Yi Fei.

299
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,200
What exactly is going on?

300
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,200
Yes.

301
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,200
The company's legal representative is indeed my brother.

302
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,200
But I don't know any of the details.

303
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,200
Secretary Yi. You need to wake up.

304
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,300
Do you know who you're helping right now?

305
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:27,500
In his eyes, you are no different from Lin Tai and Chen Hengsheng.

306
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,600
You're merely pawns that can be sacrificed when needed.

307
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,700
Su Xieyi!

308
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,600
Watch your words.

309
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,500
Slander is punishable by law!

310
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,600
I'm done playing for the day.

311
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,100
Huo Jian.

312
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,900
You're the one who should be punished by law.

313
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,400
You can deny all these accusations.

314
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,000
But you can't deny the fact that you killed my father.

315
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,400
What?

316
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,000
What do you mean?

317
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,900
Huo Jian, what is he talking about?

318
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:36,639
You defrauded shares from my father.

319
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:40,580
Premeditated murder. We have the evidence.

320
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,539
How will you deny this?

321
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:46,200
Huo Jian, have you lost your mind?

322
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,019
You murdered someone?

323
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:53,119
Huo Jian, I've called the police.

324
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:57,900
Looks like there is no chance to serve the shuttle after all.

325
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:03,051
The match between us is over.

326
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,860
Yi Fei, Kaixing's legal representative is your brother.

327
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,335
As long as you keep quiet,

328
00:21:13,336 --> 00:21:15,799
I will get your brother the best lawyer to get him acquitted.

329
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:19,600
If I am arrested, we will be done for.

330
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,140
Secretary Yi, I hope you'll cooperate with the police.

331
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,240
You don't have to bear the accusations that aren't meant for you.

332
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,499
Trust me. You'll only be ruining yourself.

333
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,779
Huo Jian.

334
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,940
I can do anything for you.

335
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:52,599
I am also willing to be the pawn you sacrifice.

336
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:54,900
But I just want to ask you one thing.

337
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,219
During our time together,

338
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,480
have you ever

339
00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:03,060
been sincere with me?

340
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,480
Of course, I'm sincere about you.

341
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:08,019
I really love you.

342
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:09,619
It's true.

343
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,519
Yi Fei. You just have to admit that you were behind everything.

344
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:19,539
Just say that you had forced me to kill Li Kuohai.

345
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:22,740
I promise you, I'll be forever grateful to you.

346
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,319
I'll give you anything you want.

347
00:22:25,979 --> 00:22:29,179
I'm begging you. Yi Fei. Just admit it.

348
00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:31,100
Admit that you did everything.

349
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,700
Only if—

350
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,640
Don't you know what it is I want?

351
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,580
I've done so much for you.

352
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,039
And gratitude is all I got in return?

353
00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:03,099
Okay.

354
00:23:04,979 --> 00:23:06,779
I give in.

355
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:29,399
A'Yan. To be honest, I still feel like I'm in a daze.

356
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,799
Everything seems a bit unreal.

357
00:23:36,459 --> 00:23:41,539
Why don't I help you discern whether it is a dream or reality?

358
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:49,359
Did you feel it?

359
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:56,380
Xieyi. I actually have another surprise for you.

360
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:00,019
What is it?

361
00:24:03,639 --> 00:24:05,800
Close your eyes first.

362
00:24:09,939 --> 00:24:11,539
Are they close?

363
00:24:16,399 --> 00:24:19,100
Why are you being so mysterious?

364
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,640
If it's not a nice surprise, I'm going to hit you.

365
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,500
Open your eyes.

366
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,440
This is from back then.

367
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,979
When did you get it?

368
00:24:38,499 --> 00:24:41,900
I went as soon as I could walk again.

369
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,819
Luckily it was still there.

370
00:24:52,879 --> 00:24:55,680
So the big tree did hear our conversation.

371
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,159
It kept it safe for us.

372
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:01,759
By the way, A'Yan.

373
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:04,879
Remember I told you

374
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:08,059
that Huo Jian mentioned something about K of Spades

375
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:11,060
on the day he was arrested?

376
00:25:15,459 --> 00:25:18,059
 The one who made me sabotage Zhiwei

377
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,380
 was K of Spades.

378
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:00,039
I know Huo Jian better than you.

379
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:04,840
He can't accept that we are happy and content.

380
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,759
So he deliberately sowed doubt.

381
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:10,539
Don't worry about it.

382
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,820
You're right.

383
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,200
We can't fall for this trap.

384
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,860
K of Spades?

385
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:35,900
Mr. Li, do you believe what Huo Jian said?

386
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:44,219
It's true that the motive for sabotaging Zhiwei is weak.

387
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,879
Huo Jian said it was K of Spades that instructed him to target Zhiwei.

388
00:26:48,879 --> 00:26:52,160
So does he hold a grudge against Zhiwei?

389
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:57,019
But why did Huo Jian listen to him?

390
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,859
Right.

391
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,340
If K of Spades really existed, who could it be?

392
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,000
 A once successful legendary hotelier turns out to be an unscrupulous criminal.

393
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,839
 There is much rejoicing over his arrest.

394
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,900
 Awaiting him will be legal punishment.

395
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:18,379
 As for the culprit's motive, it is still being investigated.

396
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,179
Hello, Brother Minghao.

397
00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:38,779
Hey, Xieyi.

398
00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:41,540
I just saw the news of Huo Jian's arrest.

399
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,880
So I called you.

400
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,119
 That's right.

401
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:47,680
 We should really celebrate the occasion.

402
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,818
By the way, why are you already back at work?

403
00:27:50,818 --> 00:27:52,964
How is your injury?

404
00:27:52,964 --> 00:27:55,439
It's fine. Nothing serious.

405
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:56,620
Are you sure?

406
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,700
Yes, of course.

407
00:28:02,219 --> 00:28:04,039
- What's the matter? 
  - It's nothing.

408
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:06,900
I stretched it when putting something down.

409
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,179
Nothing serious, you say?

410
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:09,419
How about this?

411
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:12,140
I'll leave earlier from work and pay you a visit.

412
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,079
Really?

413
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:15,500
Did you think I'm kidding?

414
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,139
What do you want to eat? I can buy it on the way.

415
00:28:18,139 --> 00:28:20,319
It's okay. Just you coming is good enough for me.

416
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:22,940
- See you later then. 
  - See you.

417
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:34,079
Mr. Li, if K of Spades is still out there unchecked,

418
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:38,580
a ruthless guy like him may pose a threat to Miss Su.

419
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:43,459
I need to get Xieyi to move in with me sooner.

420
00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:48,019
Come in.

421
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,460
- Xieyi. 
 - Miss Su.

422
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,100
You two chat.

423
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:59,959
Xieyi. Why are you here?

424
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:04,419
A'Yan, I have something to do. Can I get off work earlier?

425
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:06,019
Brother Minghao is injured, right?

426
00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:08,879
I want to go and see how he's recovering.

427
00:29:08,879 --> 00:29:11,600
Okay, I'll go with you.

428
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,220
Okay.

429
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:16,759
Let's meet at the car in five minutes.

430
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:18,359
I'll get ready.

431
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,439
Xie Minghao.

432
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,180
Brother Minghao.

433
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,860
You're here.

434
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,980
Come. Sit.

435
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,419
I didn't know Director Li would be here too. I only ordered Xieyi's favorite latte.

436
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,479
What would you like, Director Li?

437
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,999
I'm good, thanks.

438
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,380
Brother Minghao, why did you go back to work so soon?

439
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:57,340
Your hand needs more time to heal.

440
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,840
It's not a big deal. I'll be fine.

441
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:03,278
No matter how busy work gets, health is always more important.

442
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,800
You should take better care, Lawyer Xie.

443
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:10,320
Xieyi. On the way here, I noticed a fruit stall.

444
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,740
We should have brought something for Lawyer Xie.

445
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,072
Why don't you go buy some fruit for him?

446
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,179
Okay.

447
00:30:17,179 --> 00:30:19,319
You guys chat.

448
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,920
Did you come to thank me?

449
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,319
We left in a hurry the last time.

450
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:36,440
We didn't have time to properly thank you.

451
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,400
Your arm got injured.

452
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,340
If you need anything in the future, don't hesitate to tell us.

453
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,480
The one thing I had plenty of in the past two years is taking care of others.

454
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,720
This bit of injury is nothing.

455
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:52,920
You've been taking care of Xieqing without fail.

456
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,600
It is truly admirable.

457
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,079
What I'm curious about is whether your care for Xieqing

458
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:03,140
stems from love or responsibility.

459
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:09,260
I guess you don't know our story.

460
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,240
The day I met her

461
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,359
was the day my life took a new turn.

462
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:15,659
That day after school,

463
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:18,300
I was surrounded by a group of bullies.

464
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:22,940
Out of nowhere, this little girl stepped in front of me.

465
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,239
Not only did she reprimand the bullies,

466
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,519
she also blocked the stones that were thrown at me.

467
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,060
She got hit square in the head and bled a lot.

468
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,180
To make stitching easier,

469
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,620
the doctor shaved her head.

470
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,539
Not only was she not perturbed,

471
00:31:38,539 --> 00:31:40,739
but she also comforted me.

472
00:31:40,739 --> 00:31:42,580
She asked for my name.

473
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,080
She called me

474
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,040
Brother Minghao.

475
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,800
That was the first time anyone called my name so affectionately.

476
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,100
I will never forget it.

477
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,520
The way you two met

478
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:01,419
must have left a deep impression.

479
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,040
That's right.

480
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,999
Later on, Uncle Shen took pity on me and decided to sponsor me.

481
00:32:08,999 --> 00:32:10,559
He was a good man.

482
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,580
I'm indebted to him.

483
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:15,200
But what made me happier

484
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,620
was that I could see her every day.

485
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:21,680
I could be her dear Brother Minghao and not some orphan that nobody wanted.

486
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,239
Not every kind of love needs to be reciprocated.

487
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,880
The fact that she exists is the biggest reciprocation for me.

488
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:33,380
I'm content as long as she is with me.

489
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,900
Talking about Uncle Shen.

490
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,899
I'd like to ask you some things.

491
00:32:40,899 --> 00:32:46,819
Back then, did Zhiwei Corporation, or Uncle Shen have any enemies?

492
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,079
Why are you asking me that?

493
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:51,020
You are Xieqing's fiancé.

494
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,040
As well as Zhiwei's appointed lawyer at the time.

495
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,641
I thought perhaps you knew some inside information.

496
00:32:57,459 --> 00:33:00,939
Director Li, Zhiwei has been annexed by you.

497
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:06,280
You should be more aware of the ins and outs of Zhiwei's business connections.

498
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,720
What about outside of business?

499
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:11,359
I'm a lawyer.

500
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:14,659
Following professional customs and ethics, I only focus on the work.

501
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,507
I never delve into private affairs.

502
00:33:17,507 --> 00:33:20,420
Could it be that Huo Jian told you something else?

503
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,599
What are you two talking about?

504
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:25,980
You're smiling ear to ear.

505
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,720
It's nothing.

506
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,500
I suggested that we visit Lawyer Xie more often when possible.

507
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,159
He's happy to hear it.

508
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,640
That's great.

509
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,820
I'll go order something for you.

510
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,520
A'Yan, you never paid much attention to Brother Minghao before.

511
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,919
Why did you suddenly say that you'd visit him more often?

512
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:02,280
No matter what, he is your brother-in-law.

513
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,019
Now that we're together, it's not right

514
00:34:05,019 --> 00:34:07,619
to put you in a difficult position between us.

515
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,938
Chairman Li's ability to see the bigger picture deserves recognition.

516
00:34:11,938 --> 00:34:14,186
What did you two talk about?

517
00:34:14,198 --> 00:34:18,819
Nothing much. We just made some small talk.

518
00:34:18,819 --> 00:34:21,300
Brother Minghao's injury hasn't fully healed.

519
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:25,620
Let's ask Director Shi not to give him so much work from Ocean.

520
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,880
Don't worry.

521
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,800
Thank you, Chairman Li.

522
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:41,579
Xieyi. Why don't you pack your thing?

523
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,280
My place is ready for you.

524
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,880
I'd like...

525
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,340
I would like you to move in with me.

526
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,660
What?

527
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,559
Don't you want to?

528
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:59,860
But, it's only appropriate for boyfriend and girlfriend to live together, right?

529
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:03,679
We are boyfriend and girlfriend.

530
00:35:04,499 --> 00:35:09,500
Objectively speaking, we are boyfriend and girlfriend.

531
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:14,240
But something seems to be missing.

532
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,387
If that something is filled up,

533
00:35:16,388 --> 00:35:20,400
we can then officially be called a couple.

534
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,860
Xieyi.

535
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:25,560
Point is, I don't want to wait another day.

536
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:28,519
What's missing? Just tell me.

537
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:32,100
You've waited two years. Just a few days more won't hurt.

538
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,139
You'll know soon enough.

539
00:35:37,578 --> 00:35:39,998
- Where are you going? 
 - Home.

540
00:35:39,998 --> 00:35:42,880
I won't trouble Chairman Li to send me today.

541
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,739
A ball that has come to a stop

542
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,059
better not start moving again.

543
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,979
A marriage has to have a ceremony.

544
00:36:14,979 --> 00:36:17,760
So a relationship has to have a love confession.

545
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,000
Listen.

546
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,300
The girl keeps her feelings hidden deep inside her heart.

547
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:26,059
Just like the pearls at the bottom of this glass.

548
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:29,939
The love confession is the straw.

549
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:34,139
Stick it right into the heart.

550
00:36:34,139 --> 00:36:39,059
That way, she will share her love and sweetness with you

551
00:36:39,059 --> 00:36:41,059
without inhibitions.

552
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,440
So what should I do?

553
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,920
It's a good thing you came to me.

554
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,979
This place, with the right lighting and music,

555
00:36:50,979 --> 00:36:52,380
makes for the most romantic setting.

556
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,760
I'm a pro at this. Just leave it to me.

557
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:00,420
How much time do you need to set this place up?

558
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,000
Tomorrow night at 7 p.m.

559
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,059
Bring Xieyi here on time.

560
00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:06,460
I can guarantee that your love confession

561
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,601
will go off without a hitch.

562
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,939
Tell no one.

563
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:12,539
Okay.

564
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:19,399
Stop pretending.

565
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,939
Sit like that more and you may never stand up again.

566
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:23,539
You better keep this a secret too.

567
00:37:23,539 --> 00:37:26,960
Or else Chu Chu won't send me soup anymore.

568
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,940
Sorry about before.

569
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:19,900
Now, let me do something for you.

570
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:36,179
Have you ever confessed your feelings?

571
00:38:36,179 --> 00:38:37,955
A love confession?

572
00:38:39,419 --> 00:38:42,120
Never mind. Forget I asked.

573
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,106
Do you not trust me in this matter, Mr. Li?

574
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,264
How many relationships have you had?

575
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,000
There you have it.

576
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,740
♫  I need you, I love you  ♫

577
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:58,480
♫  I'll brave the waves for you  ♫

578
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,540
♫  You don't have to be brave all the time  ♫

579
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:08,340
♫  Please believe that I am by your side  ♫

♫  Ever and after  ♫

581

582
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:33,700
♫   Halfway through the journey on the train,   ♫

583
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:37,540
♫   a new passenger takes a seat   ♫

00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:41,760
♫   The bells on the platform are ringing   ♫

00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,220

♫   I didn't save your contact information   ♫

589
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,420
♫   But in my heart, I secretly ask   ♫

590
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,380
♫   How have you been lately?   ♫

♫   How's it going with him?   ♫

592
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:05,760
♫   He's better at guessing your complicated thoughts   ♫

593
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,760
♫   Does he hold you when you're sad?   ♫

594
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,460
♫   Does he hold you when you're sad?   ♫

595
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,440
♫   How have you been lately?   ♫

596
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,380
♫   Everything must be going well   ♫

597
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:21,200
♫   Do you want to hear what I haven't said?   ♫

598
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:28,680
♫   Do lyrics of love songs stir up your emotions and recall all of our memories?   ♫

599
