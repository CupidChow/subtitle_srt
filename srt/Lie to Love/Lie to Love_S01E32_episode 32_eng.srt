2
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:25,200
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

3
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:33,510
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

4
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:41,330
♫  And turn to face all the long lost times  ♫

5
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,270
♫  Brace the pain  ♫

6
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:51,210
♫  Let memories wake up from oceans deep  ♫

7
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,250
♫  No place to hide  ♫

8
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,450
♫  No way to run  ♫

9
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,820
♫  New dawn counts down  ♫

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,930
♫  I fight  ♫

11
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,010
♫  I cry  ♫

12
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,700
♫  I give up  ♫

13
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:14,710
♫  Memories forgotten, forsaken surround  ♫

14
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:24,130
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

15
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:32,570
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

16
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:40,950
♫  Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

17
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:49,650
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

18
00:01:49,650 --> 00:02:00,120

19
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,050

20
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,860
President Dai. The Finance Department said that we're running out of funds

21
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,080
to buy back Zhengde's shares.

22
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:16,419
What? Why would this happen?

23
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:18,759
What do I pay you for?

24
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:20,240
President Dai, calm down!

25
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,679
Calm down.

26
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:24,000
Calm down, President Dai.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,660
- Calm down? 
 - How am I to calm down?

28
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:30,099
Does losing your temper help to solve the problem?

29
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,220
Lawyer Xie. Tell me.

30
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,879
What should I do?

31
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,180
Once the stock price drops below 30 percent,

32
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,760
Aihong Fund will take back all of my pledged shares.

33
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,400

34
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:55,039
Speak of the devil.

35
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,319
Mr. Sun.

36
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,119
I understand.

37
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,319
It's all just rumors.

38
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:08,240
Okay. Don't worry. Don't worry.

39
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,459
Sure. You may hang up.

40
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,139
Let's have tea sometime.

41
00:03:18,339 --> 00:03:21,800
Mr. Sun from Aihong Fund called and made it clear

42
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,240
that once the stock price falls below 30 percent,

43
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,279
I'll have to either meet a margin call or make an early repayment.

44
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,539
How do I get the money to repay him?

45
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,520
Lawyer Xie, say something.

46
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,000
How about this, President Dai?

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,640
Let's hold a meeting with the employees to prevent any further leaks that will be detrimental to the company.

48
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,039
Get the PR Department to take more pictures that show unity,

49
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:52,065
and we'll figure out our next moves.

50
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,939
Unity?

51
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,259
Okay. You can get to it.

52
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,639
Okay. I know.

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,160
As expected, Dai Ziang is at his wit's end

54
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,020
and decided to call for a staff meeting to keep the company on an even keel.

55
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:30,339
Since he has had the stage ready for us,

56
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:34,720
let's join the fun and give him the final blow.

57
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,080
I hope everyone can stay united to get through this difficult time.

58
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,299
For the people who started these rumors, we're going to sue them.

59
00:04:43,299 --> 00:04:44,381

60
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:46,858
Are you sure you want to do that?

61
00:04:46,858 --> 00:04:48,720
- Why is Chairman Li here? 
 - It's Li Zeliang.

62
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,019
Why is he here?

63
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,639
I've clarified the issues that need to be addressed.

64
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,040
The meeting ends here. You're dismissed.

65
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,160
It ended just like that?

66
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,300

67
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,640
Hold on.

68
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:19,159
Chairman Li. Anything else?

69
00:05:19,159 --> 00:05:20,720
Someone wants to see you.

70
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,320
Save it.

71
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:29,160
Xie Minghao. You never saw this coming, right?

72
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,299
Xieqing. What are you talking about?

73
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:35,240
Do you know how hard I looked for you?

74
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,759
I even asked the police to help.

75
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:39,800
I didn't expect you to be with Li Zeliang.

76
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,160
Xie Minghao. Drop the act.

77
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,560
Back then, you tricked me into transferring Zhiwei's assets.

78
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,000
Made me think I was pregnant and begged my dad for forgiveness.

79
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,639
But who knew it pushed my dad

80
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,920
to take the blame for me and ended up taking his own life.

81
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,882
Not too long ago, you knew I had regained consciousness

82
00:05:57,882 --> 00:06:00,239
and had me put under house arrest.

83
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:02,720
You even created a fake scene of my suicide.

84
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,639
You're a lawyer.

85
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,840
You should know better about the crimes you committed.

86
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,079
I've made the call to turn myself in.

87
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,759
The police will be here soon.

88
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,639
You won't get away with it.

89
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:21,900
Xieqing. You might be a mental patient.

90
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,800
But you can't just make things up.

91
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,539
This is a certificate issued by the hospital.

92
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:29,779
I've fully recovered. Everything I said is the truth.

93
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,480
Xieqing. Stop messing around.

94
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,000
Come on. Let's go home.

95
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,780
The money went into your account. You won't get away with it either.

96
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,600
Two years ago, when I found out that you were K of Spades,

97
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,759
I've been collecting the evidence of your crimes.

98
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,720
I went soft-hearted and wanted to spare you.

99
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,779
That was why I tried to jump off the balcony.

100
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,980
Very well.

101
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,800
Right now, these can be put to use.

102
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,240
Indeed, Zhiwei's money went into my account.

103
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,079
But there are also transaction details

104
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:08,319
of the money going into the bank card under your name.

105
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,720
The recording of you instigating me to embezzle Zhiwei's funds

106
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,000
and the screenshots of the messages that you sent to Huo Jian

107
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,439
under the name of K of Spades

108
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:18,720
to force him to commit the crimes.

109
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,460
Are these considered as evidence?

110
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,839
Xie Minghao. Even at this point,

111
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:32,360
don't you have an ounce of remorse?

112
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,380
I once loved you.

113
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,560
I hate it the most when you say that!

114
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,264
If it weren't for you, Shen Zhihong wouldn't stop me from pursuing Xieyi.

115
00:07:41,264 --> 00:07:44,659
All of this started with you.

116
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:48,199
Xie Minghao. You once took care of Xieyi back then.

117
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:50,033
So here's a piece of advice for you.

118
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,079
Turn yourself in.

119
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,679
Fine.

120
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:56,799
It looks like I don't have a choice now.

121
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:00,139
- Don't move! 
 - Xie Minghao!

122
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:02,000
Li Zeliang! Don't come over!

123
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,680
Or I'll stab her!

124
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,800
Take it easy!

125
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,320
Don't come over. Don't come over!

126
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,120
Xie Minghao! Are you out of your mind?

127
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,560
Shut up, Shen Xieqing!

128
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,619
Move over there.

129
00:08:11,619 --> 00:08:14,880
- Get out of the way! 
 - And you!  Move over!

130
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,079
Don't go over there!

131
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,160
Xie Minghao, the police will be here soon.

132
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,639
Stay away from me!

133
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,480
What are you trying to do?

134
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,179
Xieyi. I'll save us some alone time to talk later.

135
00:08:25,179 --> 00:08:26,519
Stop taking pictures!

136
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,600
Let go of her!

137
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,200
Get lost!

138
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,240
Xie Minghao. It's just the two of us now.

139
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,360
What do you want to talk about?

140
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,000
That's the look.

141
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,559
You keep giving me that look.

142
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,759
They can look down on me or despise me. But not you!

143
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,259
Xieyi!

144
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,519
Don't come over!

145
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:55,859
Xie Minghao. Let go of Xieyi.

146
00:08:55,859 --> 00:08:57,960
The police are here. Are you out of your mind?

147
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,080
So what if I am.

148
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,919
I just want an answer.

149
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:04,240
I was despised and looked down upon since I was a kid.

150
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,519
I've worked so hard all these years to be acknowledged by the world.

151
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,659
But why?

152
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:13,759
Why the person that matters most to me doesn't notice me?

153
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,879
Xie Minghao! I'm sorry for what happened to you during your childhood.

154
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:22,040
Your whole life is about pursuing a sense of identity,

155
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,040
good grades, a good job, and good status.

156
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,459
You desperately want to pursue all the good things

157
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:31,899
to prove your success and get recognition from others.

158
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:35,440
To you, Xieyi is the most beautiful gift in the world for you.

159
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,800
You want to have her simply for the same reason!

160
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
That's not love!

161
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,919
- If you really love her, how could you bear to hurt her? 
 - Nonsense.

162
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:49,919
Xie Minghao! In this world, you're the one who despises yourself the most!

163
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:53,679
Let go of Xieyi and set yourself free.

164
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,960
Fine!

165
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,979
Li Zeliang. You love Su Xieyi, don't you?

166
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:03,279
I'll give you a chance in exchange for her safety.

167
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,519
Will you take it?

168
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:06,159
Say it! I'll agree to it!

169
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,000
I'll agree to it!

170
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,879
A'Yan, no! Don't listen to him!

171
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,100
Xie Minghao! Don't try anything!

172
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,200
Jump off from here.

173
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,000
A life for a life.

174
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,179
That's fair enough!

175
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,180
Okay.

176
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,880
I'll do it!

177
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,300
Xie Minghao. You're a man.

178
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,219
Remember what you promised me.

179
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,360
Jump! Do it now!

180
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,160
Jump.

181
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:58,059
Jump!

182
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,859
- Xieyi! 
 - A'Yan!

183
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,230
♫  I fight  ♫

184
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,290
♫  I cry  ♫

185
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:27,860
♫  I give up  ♫

186
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:36,880
♫  Memories forgotten, forsaken surround  ♫

187
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:45,960
♫  Memory of us in darkened sky  ♫

188
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
Xie Minghao!

189
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,600
♫  Can I be reborn another kind?  ♫

190
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,400
What are you doing?

191
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,177
Get down here!

192
00:11:57,177 --> 00:11:58,539
Turn yourself in!

193
00:11:58,539 --> 00:12:02,180
You still have a chance to turn over a new leaf!

194
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,800
I've lost.

195
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,260
This is the best ending.

196
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:14,000
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

197
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,700
Xie Minghao!

198
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,040

199
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,840
Are you Dai Ziang?

200
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,000
We're from the Economic Investigation Corps of the Municipal Public Security Bureau.

201
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,979
You're suspected of inciting another to commit arson

202
00:13:15,979 --> 00:13:17,739
and involved in the illegal competition.

203
00:13:17,739 --> 00:13:21,000
We need you to come down to the station with us to assist in the investigation.

204
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,870

205
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,139
The Lantian Bay project went on smoothly and the stock price soared.

206
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:31,799
All the shareholders are full of praise for you.

207
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:35,000
All thanks to the support from all that Ocean is able to overcome the crisis

208
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,240
and everything is back on track now.

209
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,280
Among those, I should thank is you, Director Shi.

210
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,799
Actually, the person you should thank is Su Xieyi.

211
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,080
You two have quite a lot in common.

212
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,360
To help shed light on the events, she could endure so much.

213
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,659
She was right.

214
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:58,240
There's a reason why you two love each other so deeply.

215
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,320
Thank you for your understanding, Director Shi.

216
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,279
I said this before when I just came back.

217
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:09,000
If you can find your own happiness, I'll surely give you my blessing.

218
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,840
Back then, I've indeed misunderstood Su Xieyi.

219
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:19,320
But I have to admit that she's perfect for you.

220
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,480
Thank you, Director Shi.

221
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,699
Well, I hope you can find your happiness soon.

222
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,359
Don't you worry about that.

223
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:35,619
Oh, right. You just had surgery.

224
00:14:35,619 --> 00:14:37,619
How's your recovery going?

225
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,579
I'm fine now.

226
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,320
A'Yan.

227
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,279
- Xieyi. 
 - Xieyi.

228
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:48,279
You're here, Director Shi.

229
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:50,399
It's almost time for your appointment with Dr. Wu.

230
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,279
We have to get going now.

231
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:54,279
Are you going for a follow-up appointment?

232
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:55,600
That's right.

233
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,960
I always have to chivy him along.

234
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,240
I've completely recovered.

235
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,720
You are only when Dr. Wu says so.

236
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,860
Zeliang. I'm on Xieyi's side with this one.

237
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,779
Now, take him there.

238
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:14,339
Let's go. My dear Chairman Li.

239
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:16,959
Okay. Whatever you say.

240
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:34,639
Xieyi.

241
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,919
Dr. Wu said there are no serious problems with my leg now.

242
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:40,879
But we both know

243
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:45,120
that no one knows what the future holds.

244
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,799
But Dr. Wu also said that you'd be fine

245
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:50,999
as long as it's well taken care of.

246
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,700
Xieyi.

247
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,299
Things will be tough for you in the future.

248
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:01,260
If you get tired from walking,

249
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,820
I won't be able to carry you.

250
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,979
When it's sunny,

251
00:16:05,979 --> 00:16:08,399
I can't go hiking with you.

252
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,580
And when it rains,

253
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,320
I can't hold an umbrella for you.

254
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,640
Not only will you have to take care of me,

255
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:23,040
I don't even have the confidence that I can grow old with you.

256
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:26,459
Have you thought about these problems?

257
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,480
Of course, I have.

258
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:41,419
These aren't the only things that we can't do together.

259
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,200
But even so, why does it matter?

260
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,340
If I get tired from walking, we can sit down and have coffee.

261
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:53,720
If it rains, we can stay home and watch movies.

262
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:58,559
When it's sunny, I can take you to the park for a walk.

263
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,320
Actually, it doesn't matter what we do.

264
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,400
What matters is that from now on,

265
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,600
it's changed from "me" to "us".

266
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,960
Okay.

267
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:22,160
Well, later, we can go to the movies.

268
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,819
Sure.

269
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,739
Oh, right, Xieyi.

270
00:17:26,739 --> 00:17:30,279
Xie Minghao's verdict has been delivered.

271
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:33,599
Inciting another to commit a crime, information leakage in trading,

272
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:39,360
unlawful restrictions on others' ability to move freely, and other crimes.

273
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,187
He'll get a minimum sentence of ten years.

274
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,640
Come to think of it, back on the rooftop,

275
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,179
Xie Minghao seemed to have wavered.

276
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,079
There's good news too.

277
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:13,559
Your application for visiting Xieqing has been approved.

278
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,920
Really?

279
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,120
This is great.

280
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,810
I wonder how is she doing now.

281
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:24,519
Well, tomorrow, you can ask her that yourself.

282
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,900
Let's go to the movies.

283
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:34,759
- Let's go! 
 - Let's go.

284
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,920

285
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:53,820

286
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,700
Sister.

287
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,100
How are you?

288
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,259
Don't worry.

289
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,559
I'm doing great.

290
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:24,160
I've never felt so relaxed.

291
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:32,440
I'll wait for you to come back.

292
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,859
Thank you.

293
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:43,419
I'm truly blessed to have a sister like you.

294
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:45,419
Back then,

295
00:19:47,459 --> 00:19:50,100
I didn't cherish you.

296
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,680
It's all in the past.

297
00:19:57,559 --> 00:19:59,239
Let's not talk about it anymore.

298
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,799
Since we were kids,

299
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:07,719
you've always been the kind one.

300
00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:13,480
But you were innocently hurt

301
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:20,079
by me and Minghao.

302
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:26,640
What brought me to my senses

303
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:30,720
was the guilt that I felt

304
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,040
for you and our dad.

305
00:20:36,979 --> 00:20:42,279
But no matter how I try to make amends

306
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:46,359
or take the punishment,

307
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,659
there's no way to bring back our dad

308
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:54,119
and the house we used to live in.

309
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,859
We've always been a family.

310
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,680
Our dad loved you.

311
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,820
So do I.

312
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,379
That's why dad gave up his life to protect you.

313
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,539
That's because you're his beloved baby girl.

314
00:21:11,379 --> 00:21:14,499
You have made the right choice, and it's courageous of you

315
00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:18,160
to face your mistakes and take responsibility.

316
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,599
Dad would understand.

317
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:23,580
So do I.

318
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:30,659
Can I really go on

319
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,339
with my life?

320
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:37,399
Of course.

321
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,319
A'Yan and I have talked about it.

322
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:46,319
When you come back, we'll all live together.

323
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:48,119
It'll be lively.

324
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:49,919
How great is that?

325
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:53,439
Okay.

326
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,380
Okay.

327
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,780
Xieyi. You must stay happy.

328
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,739
You want to ask about him?

329
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,319
You're right.

330
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:28,019
It's all in the past.

331

He and I

332
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,900
are histories now.

333
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,040
I've thought it through.

334
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,820
I won't make the same mistake again.

335
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:45,459
Don't worry.

336
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:53,080
Oh, right. When are you two getting married?

337
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,380
I wish I could see you in the wedding dress.

338
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:00,979
When you get married,

339
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:05,240
I won't be able to go there and give you my blessing.

340
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,200
Make sure you take nice pictures and show them to me.

341
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,700
Okay.

342

Seriously, A'Yan?

347
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,319
He was the one who asked me here.

348
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:14,359
But he ends up being late.

349
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:23,440
 Su Xieyi. You broke up with me here the other day. It broke my heart.

350
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,380
 So I'm going to give you a small punishment.

351

 Find me as soon as you can.

352

 If not, I might disappear.

353

00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,980
What did you call me?

490
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,960
Forget it if you didn't hear it.

491
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,039
No, don't. S-Say it again.

492
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:18,400
Again.

493
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,940
Not mad at me anymore?

494
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,639
It was too petty of me.

495
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:25,360
It's just a dress. It was nothing.

496
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,940
Xieyi looks good in anything she wears.

497
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,039
That was the Cheongsam that my husband bought.

498
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:33,279
You can't make casual comments.

499
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:37,639
Who bought it?

500
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,879
My husband. Hubby.

501
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,840
My wife.

502
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,220
- Fill up the form already. 
 - All right.

503
00:36:56,619 --> 00:36:57,840
We've got the marriage certificate.

504
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,400
Next, let's fill up his household registration booklet.

505
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,100
Why?

506
00:37:05,071 --> 00:37:08,760
Why do I look so awful in this photo and you look so good?

507
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,159
It's not.

508
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:11,980
I think we both look great.

509
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,659
Look. Isn't it?

510
00:37:14,659 --> 00:37:16,159
It's not if I say so.

511
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:17,959
It's not fair!

512
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:21,619
What can we do? The photo is already taken.

513
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:23,559
Come with me to the bridal store and take another shot.

514
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:25,280
I'll decide on the costume and style.

515
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,759
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

♫  Halfway through the journey on the train,  ♫

521
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:59,310
♫  a new passenger takes a seat  ♫

522
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:03,540
♫  The bells on the platform are ringing  ♫

523
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,910

♫  With a one-way ticket stub in your hand  ♫

♫  you've embarked on a journey to happiness  ♫

526
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:17,060
♫  I didn't save your contact information  ♫

527
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:20,320
♫  But in my heart, I secretly ask  ♫

528
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,070
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

529

♫  How's it going with him?  ♫

530

♫  I bet his temper is better than mine  ♫

531
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:29,740
♫  He's better at guessing  ♫

532
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,490
♫  your complicated thoughts  ♫

533
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:35,340
♫  Does he hold you when you're sad?  ♫

♫  Do you want to hear what I haven't said?  ♫

537

♫  Do lyrics of love songs stir up your emotions  ♫

538
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:50,870
♫  and recall all of our memories?  ♫

♫  You and fate have not given me an answer  ♫

543
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:32,510
♫  The price of growing up is like a pile of bargaining chip  ♫

544
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:36,360
♫  The wager is who can let go first  ♫

♫  Life is not as complicated as I thought  ♫

548
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:48,610
♫  Silence is the best that I can do  ♫

549
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:51,550
♫  Whatever pain and suffering may come,  ♫

550
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:54,390
♫  I'm not afraid at all  ♫

551
