Xie Yi.

20
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,680
If we can't even

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,280
trust each other on this matter,

22
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,919
how can we spend the rest
of our life together?

23
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,280
As I said,

24
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,439
the whole matter

25
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,280
doesn't add up.

26
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,319
I ordered the PR department

27
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,319
to contact He Jiang Hua.

28
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:23,919
But they couldn't reach him.

29
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,159
He went on a vacation.

30
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,759
I think

31
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,000
he's avoiding us.

32
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,080
Yan,

33
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,719
all I need is your trust.

34
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,719
However, there are
rumors circling around.

35
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:35,840
Perhaps

36
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:36,840
you should

37
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,479
put my work to a halt
for the time being.

38
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:39,639
No.

39
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,039
If I did so

40
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,360
before the dust settled,

41
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,560
people would be even
more suspicious of us.

42
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,039
But I'm worried

43
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,680
it might cause you more trouble.

44
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:53,919
As I said, I trust you.

45
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,719
You have all the more reasons

46
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,039
to finish your work.

47
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,560
Deliver results

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,919
and prove your worth to everyone.

49
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,360
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

50
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,680
Contact me if you need anything.

51
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,400
Sure.

52
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,560
Ms. Shi.

53
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,599
Over here.

54
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:21,719
Why are you in a hurry

55
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,439
to see me?

56
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,639
I watched the press conference.

57
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,520
It was a success.

58
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,639
You don't seem

59
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,199
particularly happy.

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,719
Is something wrong?

61
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:34,479
This is Su Xie Yi's doing,

62
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,639
am I right?

63
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,039
Ms. Shi, calm down.

64
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,159
Hear me out.

65
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,400
Stop defending her.

66
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,159
Wine is the best truth potion.

67
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,599
You already

68
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,080
exposed her plan at the bar that night.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,280
She is only staying in Ocean Hotel

70
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,120
so she can bring it down,

71
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,080
am I right?

72
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,360
The files of the Lantian Bay project

73
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,159
have been kept inside Ze Liang's home.

74
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:57,039
No one else

75
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,639
would have the chance to read them.

76
00:03:59,240 --> 00:03:59,800
Not to mention

77
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,080
it's already a fact that she secretly

78
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,479
contacted He Jiang Hua.

79
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,159
Even a fool can tell

80
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,080
what's going on.

81
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,759
What more is there to be explained?

82
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,319
Mr. Xie.

83
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,039
I want you to be honest with me today.

84
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,280
Is this

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,920
Su Xie Yi's doing?

86
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,399
Did she do it or not?

87
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,759
Say something.

88
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,360
Ms. Shi.

89
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,920
Allow me to apologize on her behalf.

90
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,879
I see.

91
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,639
She really is here for revenge.

92
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,079
Why didn't you

93
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,000
tell me sooner?

94
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,279
Xie Yi is Xie Qing's only family.

95
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,639
I cannot hurt her.

96
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,040
But she is hurting the others.

97
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,279
Ms. Shi.

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,879
Two years ago, Mr. Shen passed away.

99
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,680
Zhiwei went bankrupt.

100
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,079
Her sister went mad.

101
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,000
Xie Yi had already

102
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,240
suffered too much.

103
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,360
She blames Ocean Hotel for her loss.

104
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,279
She is filled with hatred.

105
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,680
Huo Jian has been arrested,

106
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,600
but she refused to give up just yet.

107
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,600
She will not stop

108
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,800
until Ocean Hotel

109
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:18,959
goes bankrupt.

110
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,040
So,

111
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,439
she was merely taking advantage

112
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,279
of Ze Liang's feelings for her.

113
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,720
Am I right?

114
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,839
I could only stand there and watch

115
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,839
as she uses Mr. Li's love for her

116
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,319
for revenge.

117
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,399
I couldn't do anything.

118
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,319
She's been

119
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,600
like a sister to me.

120
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,240
I can't bring myself

121
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,319
to betray my family.

122
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,079
But I am worried

123
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,759
if she stays on this path,

124
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:48,720
there will be

125
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,040
damage that can't be undone.

126
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,000
If you know she is playing with fire,

127
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,439
we have

128
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,560
all the more reasons to stop her!

129
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,319
What more can we do?

130
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,319
Li Ze Liang is madly in love with her.

131
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,879
We have no evidence.

132
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,120
No matter what you say,

133
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,079
he will never believe you.

134
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,279
It will only make him

135
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,319
misunderstand you even more.

136
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,199
The two of you will only

137
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,439
grow further apart.

138
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:20,800
Fine.

139
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,600
Su Xie Yi can put on an act.

140
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,000
But every plan

141
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,959
comes with a flaw.

142
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,040
Mr. Xie.

143
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,920
Since you agree

144
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,199
that she must be stopped,

145
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,519
at least our interest

146
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,399
aligns.

147
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,639
What do you mean?

148
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,720
I don't know Su Xie Yi very well,

149
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,000
but I know Li Xe Liang.

150
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,759
He never mixes business
with personal matters,

151
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:47,839
he's reasonable.

152
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,480
He may love Su Xie Yi with all his life,

153
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,120
but with enough evidence to prove

154
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,519
Su Xie Yi is just using him for revenge

155
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,720
and she does mean

156
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,040
to bring Ocean Hotel down,

157
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,560
I believe

158
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,199
he will

159
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,240
make the right choice.

160
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,000
Ms. Shi.

161
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,000
I understand your intention.

162
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,879
But I don't have any proof

163
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,079
against Xie Yi.

164
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,360
Trust me.

165
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,360
Why do

166
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,600
I encourage you to win Mr. Li over?

167
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,680
That's because I believe

168
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,639
you love him more than anyone else.

169
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,079
You are the right person for him.

170
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,000
Mr. Li's relationship with Xie Yi

171
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,040
is just a terrible mistake.

172
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,519
But I lack the evidence

173
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,000
to put an end to this mistake.

174
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,920
How would I know

175
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,240
if you are being honest with me?

176
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,160
How about this?

177
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,680
Xie Yi will not give up on her revenge.

178
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,519
If we pay attention,

179
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:43,600
we will find the flaw

180
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,560
in her plan.

181
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,120
Are you certain you can pull this off?

182
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:50,720
Mr. Li and his company
will only remind Xie Yi

183
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,360
of her tragic past

184
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,360
with Mr. Shen and Zhiwei.

185
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,480
They will only bring her pain.

186
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,040
I don't want her to live

187
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,600
in this constant hatred.

188
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,279
I want her to leave this company.

189
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,600
Then,

190
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,160
I'll take Xie Yi

191
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,279
and Xie Qing back to Germany.

192
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,759
We'll start a new life there

193
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:10,800
and never come back.

194
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:13,759
You and Mr. Li

195
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:15,199
will never see us again.

196
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,519
Aren't you worried

197
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:22,199
that Su Xie Yi might hate you

198
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,560
after knowing what you've done?

199
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,800
All I ask is for her

200
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:26,879
to let go of this obsession.

201
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,160
But I need something in return.

202
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,720
We can find out

203
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,039
the flaw in Xie Yi's plan

204
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,000
and let Mr. Li learn the truth,

205
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,879
but I don't want her

206
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,279
to get hurt.

207
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,399
You really

208
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,799
care a lot about her.

209
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,039
We all want to protect

210
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,799
our loved ones.

211
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,399
Very well.

212
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,120
I agree with your term.

213
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,200
With the two of us joining hands,

214
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,480
I believe

215
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,120
we can realize our goal.

216
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,440
Very well.

217
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,519
Calm down for the moment.

218
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,200
Once I've dug up

219
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,879
some lead on Xie Yi,

220
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,600
we'll talk again.

221
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,799
Are you still thinking about
what happened earlier?

222
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,720
It's behind us.

223
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,159
Don't trouble yourself with it.

224
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,519
From what I heard,

225
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,519
Ms. Shi has never taken a leave

226
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,440
ever since she started
working in Ocean Hotel.

227
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,879
She must be very upset

228
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,000
to have taken a leave.

229
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:50,639
Don't be paranoid.

230
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,559
She's been working too hard lately.

231
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,279
A vacation is good for her.

232
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,200
She is a smart person.

233
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,799
Once she's calmed down,

234
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:00,360
she will realize

235
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,519
something is amiss.

236
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,919
But now that she is away,

237
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,639
you will have even more tasks
on your hands.

238
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,679
You'll be busier than ever.

239
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,120
Don't worry.

240
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,840
I'll manage.

241
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:21,480
You said you wanted me

242
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,960
to focus on my work.

243
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Is there anything

244
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,200
I can help you with?

245
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,559
There is one thing.

246
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,039
What is it?

247
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,440
You mentioned that you want to

248
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,519
participate

249
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,559
in the Lantian Bay project?

250
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,000
The project needs to purchase

251
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:39,000
a batch of wall insulation material.

252
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,919
Ms. Shi didn't close the deal.

253
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,360
With her away,

254
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:45,080
the purchasing has been set aside.

255
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,279
Can I leave it to you?

256
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,600
Ms. Shi has been in charge

257
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:51,639
of the Lantian Bay project.

258
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,120
Besides,

259
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:55,279
she doesn't want me to intervene.

260
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,519
Xie Yi.

261
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,159
You are more than just

262
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:01,360
Ms. Shi's subordinate,

263
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,200
you are my girlfriend.

264
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:04,879
You will be

265
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,600
the future wife of
Ocean Hotel's President.

266
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,200
You will get involved eventually.

267
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:11,279
This is your chance

268
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,200
to prove your worth in the company

269
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,000
to Ms. Shi and everyone else.

270
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,759
I believe in you.

271
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,320
With your capability,

272
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:19,759
you'll do great.

273
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,480
I assure you,

274
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:24,720
I'll give it my best

275
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,399
and live up to the name.

276
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,679
Don't push yourself too hard.

277
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,879
Even if the sky was falling down,

278
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,840
I'd be there for you.

279
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:36,480
Go to sleep.

280
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,600
You first.

281
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:41,440
What is it?

282
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:42,840
I need to check

283
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,720
the files of the insulation material.

284
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,320
Don't stay up too late.

285
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,919
Our insulation boards

286
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,399
are all imported.

287
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,840
They are the finest polystyrene boards.

288
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:01,679
They are great fire retardants.

289
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:03,320
They will satisfy your need.

290
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,879
Do you have a large amount
of ready stock?

291
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,120
I need to request from the headquarters.

292
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,559
Considering the production
and shipping,

293
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:10,879
it will at least take one month.

294
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,240
Thank you, I will consider.

295
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:13,120
Sure.

296
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,759
I look forward to it.

297
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:15,320
Thank you.

298
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,799
Xie Yi.

299
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,759
Hello, Ming Hao.

300
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:28,879
Sorry,

301
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,559
I've been busy with work lately.

302
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,080
It's more convenient

303
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,759
for us

304
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:33,799
to meet here.

305
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:34,720
It's all right.

306
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I've read

307
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,720
the headlines.

308
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,000
I was worried about you.

309
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,200
So I decided to pay a visit.

310
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,639
How are you doing?

311
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,759
I'm doing just fine.

312
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,000
Yan was right.

313
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,600
Now is the time for me

314
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:47,559
to prove my worth with results.

315
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,360
I expected as much from you.

316
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,879
You've always been so strong.

317
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,799
I saw you

318
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:54,879
meeting with a client just now.

319
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,000
What was it about?

320
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,480
It was a construction material supplier.

321
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,559
Why would you need
construction materials?

322
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,080
Are you renovating the house?

323
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:05,600
It's not me.

324
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:06,799
It's company work.

325
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:08,720
The Lantian Bay project

326
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,120
requires a batch of insulation boards.

327
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:11,799
I need

328
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,279
a reliable supplier.

329
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,440
Insulation board?

330
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,960
Ming Hao,

331
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,480
do you know someone?

332
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,919
I helped

333
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:21,360
a supplier with a lawsuit.

334
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,559
I think they

335
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,000
started out as

336
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,360
insulation board agents.

337
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,600
They are very respectable.

338
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,840
Really?

339
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:29,679
Could you introduce them to me?

340
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:32,080
I thought Ocean Hotel

341
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:33,240
had its own suppliers.

342
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,600
They do,

343
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,679
but

344
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
our dealings with them were
handled by Huo Jian.

345
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:39,679
There could be some

346
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:41,279
illicit transactions.

347
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:42,919
Insulation boards

348
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,519
concern the safety of

349
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:45,879
the Lantian Bay project.

350
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:48,399
I don't trust them.

351
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:51,679
But I need progress

352
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:52,919
and ready stock.

353
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:54,879
In that case,

354
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,000
I'll contact them.

355
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,720
They sell quality products.

356
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,240
We can have a look at their workshop.

357
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:01,200
How about now?

358
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:02,639
Is it that urgent?

359
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:03,519
Sure.

360
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,960
We can go there right now.

361
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,080
Thank you, Ming Hao.

362
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:06,639
Sure.

363
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,720
We've been in the business

364
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:11,159
for over a decade.

365
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:12,960
You can see the quality

366
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,080
of our business partners.

367
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,840
Our production lines are top-notch.

368
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,039
The supply

369
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,279
won't be a problem.

370
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,440
Your products

371
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:22,799
are decent.

372
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,840
You've met all the safety standards.

373
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,159
This is great.

374
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm flattered, Miss Su.

375
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,840
We've been looking forward

376
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,159
to partnering up with Ocean Hotel.

377
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,120
Great. In that case,

378
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:33,919
let's get down

379
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,759
to the contract.

380
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,759
I'll get down to business.

381
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:40,080
As you know, we need a large supply

382
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,480
for the project.

383
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,440
So I'm hoping the price

384
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,159
can go down a little.

385
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,840
Mr. Fang.

386
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,960
Miss Su here is my family.

387
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,679
She came here

388
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,960
with goodwill.

389
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,120
If everything goes well,

390
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,759
we can close the deal today.

391
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,000
Sure, Miss Su.

392
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,159
I like

393
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,679
your straightforward demeanor.

394
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,679
How about this?

395
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,399
I'll give you a ten percent discount.

396
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:07,600
Make it 20 percent,

397
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,480
okay?

398
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:09,840
Miss Su,

399
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,200
that is the best I can do.

400
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,919
Do you know how much

401
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,759
that ten percent is?

402
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,679
It's almost three million yuan.

403
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,679
We still

404
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,120
have a business to run here.

405
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:25,240
Okay.

406
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,519
I'll have the contract ready for you.

407
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,879
Great.

408
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,399
By the way, Mr. Fang,

409
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,879
could I have the address?

410
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,840
It's the end of the year.

411
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,600
Ocean Hotel

412
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:34,960
has a gift for every

413
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,519
business partner.

414
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:37,320
And now

415
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,559
you are one of our business partners.

416
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,279
We want to send you a gift too.

417
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,679
I appreciate the thought.

418
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,919
One kindness for another.

419
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,720
I'd love to have

420
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:45,679
your address too.

421
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,039
I'm sending it now.

422
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:47,720
Great.

423
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:52,720
After the project is over,

424
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:53,679
I'll send a gift

425
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:54,879
to that address.

426
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,759
A token of goodwill.

427
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,639
I hope you don't mind.

428
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:57,559
Thank you.

429
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,639
All the best.

430
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,559
All the best.

431
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:04,720
Ming Hao.

432
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,480
Thanks to you,

433
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:07,320
I managed

434
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,799
to get this great supplier.

435
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,000
I'll tell Yan the credits

436
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,200
go to you.

437
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,480
Let's not tell Mr. Li.

438
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:15,440
Why not?

439
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,080
I am Ocean Hotel's legal consultant.

440
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,559
There would be negative rumors
if people knew

441
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:20,759
that I knew the supplier.

442
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,759
Understood.

443
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,519
After the contract is signed,

444
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,960
let me treat you to dinner.

445
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,240
I'm content

446
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,720
that I was able to help.

447
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,639
By the way,

448
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,240
you mentioned

449
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,840
transferring my sister
to another hospital.

450
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,360
It's done.

451
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:38,960
Xie Qing needs some time

452
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,960
to acclimate.

453
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,120
We'll visit her together

454
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,399
when we're free.

455
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:43,840
Sure.

456
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:55,799
Mr. Li.

457
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,039
That man is Qin.

458
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,240
He was in charge of

459
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,399
fish breeding at Yunxiao Fishery.

460
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:01,799
Have you contacted him?

461
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,920
Before the owner Tang Zheng
ran away with money,

462
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,319
he was owed a large sum of salary.

463
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,960
I promise to reimburse him.

464
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,759
Let's go.

465
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:10,440
Okay.

466
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,079
Good morning, Qin.

467
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:17,920
Mr. Ji.

468
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,079
This must be Mr. Li.

469
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:21,960
He does look like a righteous man.

470
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:23,839
Qin,

471
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,440
I'll get to the point.

472
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,599
From what I heard,

473
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,799
you were

474
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,000
very close with Tang Zheng, the owner

475
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,359
of Yunxiao Fishery.

476
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,160
Yes.

477
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,759
We used to drink

478
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,559
and fish together.

479
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:36,000
Who would have thought?

480
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,119
He ran away after owing me
so much money.

481
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,480
Who was Tang Zheng anyway?

482
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,400
How did a new company

483
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:43,319
manage

484
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,480
to become Zhiwei's business partner?

485
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:47,000
I couldn't be sure either.

486
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,519
When I last met him,

487
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:50,160
I wanted to grab a drink with him

488
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:51,359
and get my money back.

489
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,319
But in the end,

490
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,279
he got drunk

491
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:55,319
and started crying.

492
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,640
He told me he wasn't the owner.

493
00:17:58,039 --> 00:17:58,680
He also told me

494
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:00,440
someone used him to launder money.

495
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:02,759
Did he tell you

496
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,519
who the real owner was?

497
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:06,359
He said it was a girl.

498
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:08,480
I don't know the whole story either.

499
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,599
If he didn't have the money,

500
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,200
where is it then?

501
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:14,000
I asked.

502
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,119
He said

503
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:17,200
the money went into
an anonymous account.

504
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,920
No one knows about it.

505
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,000
Do you know the account number?

506
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,920
How could I possibly know?

507
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,519
I'm just a fish breeder.

508
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:26,359
I'm not even sure

509
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:27,440
if the account existed.

510
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:28,440
I bet

511
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,480
he made up some stories

512
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,759
so he wouldn't have to pay me.

513
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:32,880
But of course,

514
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,119
I believe

515
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,839
you are nothing like him.

516
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:41,200
You're good people.

517
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,200
Sure.

518
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,440
If you need to know anything,

519
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,880
just let me know.

520
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,799
Thank you.

521
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,079
Bye.

522
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:48,599
Thanks.

523
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:01,680
Mr. Li,

524
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:04,000
do you believe Qin's story?

525
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:06,319
Tang Zheng had no reason to lie to him.

526
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:07,599
Besides,

527
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,079
drunk people tell the truth.

528
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,359
I find the story plausible.

529
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,279
If Tang Zheng was merely

530
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,079
holding the shares for someone,

531
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,240
who could that woman be?

532
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,079
Back then,

533
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:20,319
before Mr. Shen jumped off the building,

534
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,599
he told me he was protecting his family.

535
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,319
He asked me

536
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,480
to give up on the investigation.

537
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:29,720
He said everything was over.

538
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:31,799
I found it baffling.

539
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:33,119
I didn't understand

540
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:34,319
why he would say that.

541
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,119
But now,

542
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,119
I think I get it.

543
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,720
Do you think he was a scapegoat?

544
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,160
And the person he protected

545
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,319
was his family?

546
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,000
If the person could manage transactions

547
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:50,359
and receive the stock,

548
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:52,960
there could only be one person.

549
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,599
That person was Shen Xie Qing.

550
00:19:58,039 --> 00:19:59,640
Do you think Shen Xie Qing

551
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,240
is K of Spades?

552
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:05,440
After Zhiwei was shut down,

553
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,920
Shen Xie Qing lost her mind.

554
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:08,720
If Shen Xie Qing

555
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:10,559
forced Huo Jian to bring down Zhiwei...

556
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,640
That doesn't add up.

557
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:12,920
It doesn't make sense.

558
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,759
It must be Xie Ming Hao!

559
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,559
So far,

560
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:18,920
he's the prime suspect.

561
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,400
He is extremely devious.

562
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:22,519
Back then,

563
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,720
he must have given Shen Xie Qing support

564
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,680
for all her underhand dealings.

565
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,799
So now it's pivotal to find out

566
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,200
who owned the anonymous account.

567
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,319
If we find it

568
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:32,720
and check its records,

569
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,240
we can track down

570
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,400
where Zhiwei's money went to.

571
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:36,640
We'll have solid proof.

572
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,359
But Shen Xie Qing has lost her mind.

573
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,960
Perhaps we could ask Miss Su.

574
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,000
After all, she is Xie Qing's sister.

575
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:47,079
Perhaps Miss Su

576
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,400
knows a thing or two.

577
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,559
Xie Yi had been living abroad.

578
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:54,920
She barely

579
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,960
had any idea

580
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:57,599
about her family business.

581
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,519
Shen Xie Qing

582
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,000
is now her only family.

583
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,119
Before we learn the truth,

584
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,279
I won't trouble her with the case.

585
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:11,400
Mr. Li,

586
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,319
you once mentioned

587
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,759
when you told Shen Xie Qing

588
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,359
Zhiwei had gone bankrupt,

589
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,920
she seemed triggered.

590
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:19,559
That means

591
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:20,640
she has regained her consciousness.

592
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,680
Maybe it's possible that she might

593
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:24,160
remember the anonymous account.

594
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,000
The exposé

595
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,519
was merely part of the preparation.

596
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:38,599
More importantly,

597
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:39,880
we need Shi Chu Chu

598
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:41,160
to be on our side.

599
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,160
The final blow comes later.

600
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:44,599
What is your plan now?

601
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:46,680
I've set up the stage for this play.

602
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,680
Your job is to enjoy it.

603
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,559
You read my mind.

604
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,000
Come on.

605
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,079
Have a drink.

606
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,119
Cheers, Mr. Dai.

607
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:58,240
Darn you, Dai!

608
00:21:58,799 --> 00:21:59,960
You tricked me!

609
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,119
You told me it was an exclusive scoop!

610
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,079
The Lantian Bay project was abandoned

611
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:05,279
by Ocean Hotel,

612
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,799
it was just a pile of junk!

613
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:07,920
Listen up.

614
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm in this business

615
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,519
for the reputation.

616
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,519
And now what?

617
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:12,799
Li Ze Liang showed the world

618
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,359
his new plan for the project firsthand.

619
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,200
I was totally embarrassed!

620
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,480
You are responsible for this!

621
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,000
Watch your attitude!

622
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,640
I paid you.

623
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,400
I have the record.

624
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:25,920
You took bribe money
to slander Ocean Hotel.

625
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:27,200
The proof is undeniable.

626
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,759
Let's analyze

627
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,640
the consequences for him.

628
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:32,200
Your reputation will be ruined.

629
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:34,319
You will spend
the rest of your life in jail.

630
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:38,960
Let's sing!

631
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,400
♪You carry the pole♪

632
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,240
♪You lead the horse away♪

633
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,720
Mr. Dai has a bad temper.

634
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:53,920
Don't mind it.

635
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,039
Don't worry.

636
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:56,720
We already have a plan to counter it.

637
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:58,440
I have a plan that will

638
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,559
not only save your reputation

639
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:00,880
but make you famous.

640
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,799
What is your plan?

641
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,440
You'll know soon enough.

642
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:09,079
Mr. Dai,

643
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,000
to your health.

644
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,440
Cheers.

645
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:28,119
It smells great.

646
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:29,480
Welcome home.

647
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,200
The food just arrived.

648
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,039
Are we having hot pot tonight?

649
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:35,000
Yes.

650
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,480
Aren't you touched

651
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,839
by this thoughtful gesture?

652
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:39,680
Yan,

653
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:40,880
I have good news

654
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:41,759
for you.

655
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:43,519
I have found a supplier

656
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:44,279
to provide us

657
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:45,640
with the insulation boards.

658
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,000
Have a look.

659
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,039
That was fast.

660
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,960
Not bad.

661
00:23:58,519 --> 00:23:59,680
Impressive, Miss Su.

662
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:00,960
Great work.

663
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:02,680
If this is enough

664
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,640
to earn your compliment,

665
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:04,920
I need to work even harder.

666
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,359
I must live up to your expectation.

667
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,559
Go wash your hands.

668
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,720
Then, get ready for dinner.

669
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,400
Sure.

670
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:16,799
Yan,

671
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:19,000
what are these crayons for?

672
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:20,880
The last time I visited Xie Qing,

673
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:22,440
I startled her.

674
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,000
I think I owe her an apology,

675
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:25,279
so I bought some crayons

676
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:26,359
and drawing sheets.

677
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,480
I plan to

678
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,119
visit her again.

679
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,000
But you will

680
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,920
have to wait.

681
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,000
After our last visit,

682
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:35,880
my sister's mental state
has been unstable.

683
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,000
Ming Hao transferred her

684
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,119
to a different sanatorium.

685
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,359
We'll visit her

686
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:40,039
another time.

687
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:44,759
Xie Ming Hao transferred her

688
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,039
to a different sanatorium

689
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,440
and wouldn't let you visit her?

690
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:49,240
Ming Hao wants

691
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,440
what's best for my sister.

692
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:55,880
Xie Yi,

693
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:57,839
wait for me at the parking lot.

694
00:24:58,319 --> 00:24:59,079
I need to use the restroom.

695
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,319
Okay.

696
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:09,759
No!

697
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,079
I'm not going back!

698
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,599
Don't touch me!

699
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:13,000
Are you all right?

700
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:13,839
None of your concern.

701
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:15,480
No!

702
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,400
- I'm not going back!
- Come!

703
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:17,759
I'm not going back!

704
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:18,839
Don't touch me!

705
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,279
I'm not going back!

706
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,759
Don't touch me!

707
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,519
What's on your mind? Dig in.

708
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,000
Go wash your hands.

709
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,599
Then, you can have dinner.

710
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:41,680
Fine.

711
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,160
What condiments do you want?

712
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,440
I want some soy sauce and vinegar,

713
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:50,440
and some tabasco pepper.

714
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,640
Sorry, Mr. Li.

715
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:05,880
I am busy,

716
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:07,440
so I can't stay here for too long.

717
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:11,079
Even with all your work,

718
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,119
you still make time
to look after Xie Qing.

719
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:14,319
It couldn't have been easy.

720
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:15,319
Not bad.

721
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,559
I am not as busy

722
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,920
as you are.

723
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,759
After all,

724
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,039
you have a big hotel to run.

725
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,799
Xie Yi told me

726
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,039
Xie Qing's condition has deteriorated.

727
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:29,880
I feel bad for what happened.

728
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:31,039
But fortunately,

729
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,680
I know

730
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,319
a psychologist.

731
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,920
He is coming to Shanghai.

732
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:37,440
We could let him

733
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,200
have a look at Xie Qing.

734
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,119
You are too kind, Mr. Li.

735
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,200
Thank you.

736
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,519
But that won't be necessary.

737
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,319
I transferred her

738
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:46,160
to a top-notched

739
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,200
nursing home.

740
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:48,759
The professional staff
takes care of her.

741
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,440
She is doing much better now.

742
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:53,920
But this expert

743
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,160
has plenty of experience.

744
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:56,720
It'd be such a shame

745
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:58,119
to miss this opportunity.

746
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,079
To be honest with you,

747
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:01,920
I've taken Xie Qing

748
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,359
to many doctors.

749
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,039
Nothing seemed to work.

750
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,599
But then I realized

751
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:08,319
what she needs

752
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,519
isn't more doctors,

753
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,799
she needs my company and protection.

754
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,480
Which sanatorium

755
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,880
has she been transferred to?

756
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,279
Xie Yi has been talking about

757
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:25,000
how she missed her sister.

758
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,759
As the younger sister,

759
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:27,880
she must

760
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,000
see her sister at some point.

761
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,680
Once Xie Qing is doing better,

762
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,279
I will inform her.

763
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:34,519
How long will it take?

764
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:36,240
I wouldn't be too sure.

765
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,319
After all,

766
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:38,440
you caused it.

767
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,559
Had you not

768
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:40,640
agitated Xie Qing,

769
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,480
I wouldn't have gotten my hands full.

770
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,160
Excuse me,

771
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,160
I must go now.

772
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:50,319
Thank you for the coffee.

773
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:07,440
Hello?

774
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,680
Mr. Li,

775
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,720
I searched all the sanatoriums
in this city,

776
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,240
Shen Xie Qing isn't in any of them.

777
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,400
I suspect Xie Ming Hao

778
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,000
has never sent Xie Qing

779
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,079
into a sanatorium.

780
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,559
Follow him.

781
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:21,440
He will go see her eventually.

782
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,480
Yes.

783
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,559
Xie Ming Hao is very cautious.

784
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,759
Use a different car.

785
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:26,599
Yes.

786
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,839
Deep down,

787
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,880
you just want to cover up for her.

788
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:43,720
Ms. Shi.

789
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:46,799
It's you who shouldn't let
emotions get the better of you.

790
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:47,960
In the past,

791
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:50,039
you could have found out

792
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,480
everything that is suspicious

793
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:52,519
about this case.

794
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:54,319
(Why would I encourage you)

795
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:55,519
(to win Mr. Li over?)

796
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,160
That's because I believe

797
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,039
you love him more than anyone else.

798
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,039
You are the right person for him.

799
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:02,319
Mr. Li's relationship with Xie Yi

800
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,359
is just a terrible mistake.

801
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,720
But I lack the evidence

802
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,279
to put an end to this mistake.

803
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,400
(Hou Xiao Dong)

804
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:16,839
Hello, Hou Xiao Dong.

805
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:17,920
Chu Chu.

806
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,319
Did you forget

807
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,680
about our deal?

808
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,880
I contacted the producer for you.

809
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,839
I even set up the equipment for you.

810
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:26,920
Don't you dare

811
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,279
stand me up.

812
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:30,319
I remember now.

813
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:32,519
When is the performance?

814
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:33,519
When is it?

815
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,599
It's 9:00 tonight.

816
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,279
It's already over 8:00.

817
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,480
Come here now.

818
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,400
Okay, understood.

819
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:41,400
See you there.

820
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,920
(Mr. Xie)

821
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:57,000
Hello, Mr. Xie.

822
00:29:57,519 --> 00:29:59,160
Ms. Shi, where are you now?

823
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:00,759
What is it?

824
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,720
Do you remember our plan?

825
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,200
The time has come.

826
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,200
Thanks.

827
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,640
What do you mean the time has come?

828
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,799
Xie Yi is participating

829
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:17,000
in the Lantian Bay project.

830
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:18,519
She just closed a deal

831
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,160
with the supplier of
all insulation boards.

832
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,039
What?

833
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,279
She always wanted

834
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:24,279
to take part in the project.

835
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,119
She didn't have the chance
because of me.

836
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,480
But as soon as I went away,

837
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,559
she's taking charge.

838
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:31,839
She really is impatient.

839
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,119
I pointed her

840
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,000
to the supplier.

841
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:35,319
He told me

842
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:37,000
Xie Yi

843
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,960
mentioned an underhand deal

844
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:40,759
when they were discussing the contract.

845
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:43,000
My guess is the material

846
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:44,559
might be faulty.

847
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,839
She just

848
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,880
wouldn't give up until
she gets what she wants.

849
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:50,119
The insulation boards concern
the project's safety.

850
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,880
There will be severe consequences.

851
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:53,279
No.

852
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,640
I must inform Ze Liang.

853
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,519
No.

854
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,599
Not yet.

855
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:57,920
Not yet?

856
00:30:58,839 --> 00:30:59,400
Should we wait

857
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,960
until she destroys the whole company?

858
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,160
The purchasing hasn't been completed.

859
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:04,599
Confronting her

860
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,000
with this accusation is useless.

861
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,079
I understand your concern.

862
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,119
But we must be patient.

863
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:12,240
Your report will only be meaningful

864
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,119
after the purchasing has been completed.

865
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:15,640
You are right.

866
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:17,160
We need to catch her red-handed.

867
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:18,359
Let's wait.

868
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:19,480
This time,

869
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,759
I will expose her true nature.

870
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:35,480
Ming Hao.

871
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I noticed

872
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,960
that lawyers are usually

873
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,440
very rational

874
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,039
in their relationships.

875
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:46,480
After all,

876
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:47,720
you are Xie Yi's brother-in-law.

877
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:49,680
But you're helping me to bring her down.

878
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:53,039
Is it because

879
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:55,000
she ruffled your feathers too?

880
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,640
She is my family.

881
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,160
I love my family.

882
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:05,359
So, I want her to be safe.

883
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:40,880
Boss.

884
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,119
We're closing.

885
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,599
Go ahead.

886
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:41,799
No.

887
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,119
No.

888
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:44,839
No!

889
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,440
Ming Hao...

890
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,679
Ming Hao?

891
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,880
Ming Hao, where are you?

892
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,800
Ming Hao...

893
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,199
Ming Hao, where are you?

894
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,039
Ming Hao?

895
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,159
Ming Hao?

896
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:41,360
Ming Hao?

897
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,679
Ming Hao?

898
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,960
Ming Hao?
Are you here?

899
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,719
Dolls.

900
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:21,519
Stop!

901
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,119
Ming Hao?

902
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,159
Stand aside!

903
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,519
Ming Hao!

904
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,320
I'm so scared.

905
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,800
Let go of me!

906
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,079
Ming Hao is drunk.

907
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:40,360
He is so scary.

908
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,840
Xie Qing is scared.

909
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:43,480
You can tell I got drunk.

910
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:47,239
But do you know why I was drinking?

911
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,719
Do you know why I was drinking?

912
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:52,519
It hurts!

913
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:55,960
You know pain.

914
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,360
But do you know my pain?

915
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:00,360
If it weren't

916
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,760
for your pestering,

917
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,639
Xie Yi and I would have fallen in love!

918
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,079
Ming Hao is so scary.

919
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,360
So scary.

920
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:13,440
The doll, my doll!

921
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,639
My doll cares about me.

922
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,320
My doll.

923
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:17,840
You are the best.

924
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:18,480
My doll...

925
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,159
Hand it over.

926
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:20,079
Hand it over!

927
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:20,639
No!

928
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:21,760
That is not yours.

929
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,360
Hand it over.

930
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:22,880
This is mine!

931
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:24,639
This is my doll!

932
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,599
Give it back!

933
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,639
No!

934
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,440
Give it back!

935
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,679
- This is my doll!
- Give it back!

936
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,719
Give it back!

937
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,119
- Listen up!
- I...

938
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,800
This doll is meant for Xie Yi.

939
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,480
This is not yours!

940
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:37,119
No...

941
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,199
This is my doll.

942
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:41,000
Give it back to me.

943
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,840
Give it back!

944
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,920
I'll say this one more time!

945
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,800
This is not yours.

946
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:48,000
You took it from her.

947
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,079
You took away

948
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:50,599
my entire life!

949
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:51,639
No!

950
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,159
(This is not yours.)

951
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,320
(You took it from her.)

952
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,519
(You took away)

953
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:16,079
(my entire life!)

954
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:20,440
It looks nice.

955
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:22,199
Is this for me?

956
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,480
(Do you like stuffed dolls too?)

957
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,039
I love them.

958
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,519
But I tried the toy crane many times

959
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,800
and got nothing.

960
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,719
Could you get more for me in the future?

961
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:46,599
It'd be great if you were awake.

962
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:47,760
If you were awake,

963
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,000
you could tell me

964
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:52,199
the true reasons behind

965
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,119
Zhiwei's bankruptcy.

966
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,320
Xie Qing.

967
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,039
Xie Qing.

968
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:38,119
What are you doing here?

969
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,119
Do you feel cold?

970
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:45,880
What's wrong?

971
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:52,920
Ming Hao was drunk.

972
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,039
He was so scary.

973
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:02,960
Xie Qing.

974
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,599
I got drunk and said

975
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,920
something bad to you.

976
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,159
I didn't mean it.

977
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:08,960
Are you all right?

978
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:18,719
Xie Qing.

979
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,440
Do you remember the account number

980
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:22,719
and its password?

981
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:34,280
Why do I have a feeling

982
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,920
you can understand me now?

983
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:41,280
Two years ago,

984
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:43,559
you made a grave mistake.

985
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,760
But I kept you safe.

986
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,440
I've never told anyone

987
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,840
your secrets.

988
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,159
Therefore,

989
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:54,119
you must learn to protect yourself.

990
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:56,159
Mind what you say.

991
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,519
Remember,

992
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,760
ever since you lost your mind,

993
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:02,159
no one will believe

994
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:03,320
a word you say.

995
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,719
I am

996
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,440
the only one you have left.

997
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,559
By the way,

998
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:09,960
you have a younger sister.

999
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,079
But remember,

1000
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:13,159
your father

1001
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:15,159
sacrificed himself to protect you.

1002
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,159
If your sister finds out

1003
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,800
you caused his death,

1004
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:21,199
she will never forgive you.

1005
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,440
She will never see you

1006
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:23,719
as her family again.

1007
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,119
But it doesn't matter.

1008
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:33,719
You still have me.

1009
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:39,360
I will never leave you.

1010
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:41,360
We are not like Xie Yi.

1011
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:43,800
We are both orphans.

1012
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,760
We can only rely on each other.

1013
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,440
We've been looking after

1014
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:51,800
each other

1015
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,239
since we were kids.

1016
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,360
Xie Qing.

1017
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:01,599
I must admit everything to you.

1018
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,039
I was in love with Xie Yi.

1019
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:07,199
But ever since I lost you,

1020
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,400
I realized

1021
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:09,559
you are the one

1022
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,519
I love the most.

1023
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:14,119
No one else

1024
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,800
loves me as you do.

1025
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:17,360
No one else cares about me

1026
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,840
and makes sacrifices for me

1027
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,760
as you do.

1028
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:28,519
Just as I protect you,

1029
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,239
you will protect me,

1030
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,719
right?
