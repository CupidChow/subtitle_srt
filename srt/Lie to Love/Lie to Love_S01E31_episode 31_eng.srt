♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

♫  Let memories wake up from oceans deep  ♫

7

♫   No place to hide, no way to run  ♫

00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,820
♫  New dawn counts down  ♫

9
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,030
♫  I fight  ♫

♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

20
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,879
 A'Yan, I'm back.

00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:42,399
Xieyi.You're back.

25
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:50,730
♫  In silence, I become tired of trying to go on  ♫

26
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,579
Didn't I tell you to wait for me at home?

27
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,600
I couldn't wait, I want to bring you home.

28

♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

35
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,959
Xieqing has a fever.

36
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:29,739
Before we came back, Yingsong had given her some medicine.

37
00:04:29,739 --> 00:04:33,600
For her safety, I arranged for her to settle down here first.

38
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,520
Don't worry.

39
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,480
Xieqing will be all right.

40
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,060
She just took the medicine.

41
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,580
After having a good rest for two days,

42
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,540
she'll get better.

43
00:05:26,299 --> 00:05:27,899
Here, Xieyi.

44
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:37,659
A'Yan, sorry

45
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:40,380
I have hurt you previously.

46
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,919
Silly.

47
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,820
Actually, I figured it out a while ago.

48
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,070
You must have your reasons

49
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,579
We might be apart.

50
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:57,219
But the thought of us fighting for the same goal makes it

51
00:05:57,219 --> 00:05:59,500
more bearable.

52
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,160
It even gave me a shred of courage.

53
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,919
You know what? Actually,

54
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,600
seeing you suffer and be given a hard time

55
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,000
pained me more than it pained you.

56
00:06:16,739 --> 00:06:18,439
I know.

57
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,480
Xie Minghao imprisoned my sister and used her to threaten me.

58
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,720
I had to save my sister and help you at the same time.

59
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,720
I didn't mean to hurt you.

60
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,979
Also, I found out that all those things hat happened to Ocean back then

61
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:36,300
were all his doings as well.

62
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,559
I'm aware of that.

63
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:45,919
Actually, what you'd gone through was no less than me.

64
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,279
A'Yan, you took all the blame for the external wall insulation materials

65
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:58,200
because Xie Minghao threatened you, right?

66
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,810
He showed me a lot of evidence.

67
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,770
Among them was a recording, which is the key evidence

68
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:13,080
in which there was a conversation between you and the supplier about rebates.

69
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,459
This jerk.

70
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,060
That recording must have been edited.

71
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,470
Of course, I'm not that foolish.

72
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,900
I'm aware of that, and I believed in you.

73
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,700
Xieyi.

74
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,860
during this period of time,

75
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:41,260
I've been thinking of you every minute and every second of the day. Now,

76
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,740
we can finally be together again.

77
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:47,620
I don't ever want to be apart from you again.

78
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,320
I, too, don't want to be apart from you ever again.

79
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,640
Take a nap if you're tired.

80
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:47,179
Xieqing.

81
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:52,199
I don't know what you like to eat. So I prepared more dishes.

82
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:56,219
There are western-style waffles, Chinese-style pot stickers, and shumai.

83
00:08:56,219 --> 00:08:57,600
Help yourself.

84
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,139
Thank you.

85
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,520
Do you have no appetite?

86
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,119
Let's have some appetizers.

87
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,819
I guess Xieqing doesn't like to have porridge.

88
00:09:14,819 --> 00:09:17,940
Xieqing, I'll pour you a glass of milk.

89
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,840
Here.

90
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:36,420
Sorry. Sorry, Xieyi,

91
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,470
I was such a fool.

92
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,700
That's why I fell for his tricks.

93
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,259
Xieyi, Sorry.

94
00:09:48,619 --> 00:09:51,040
It was all my fault.

95
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,420
I've been so selfish.

96
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,820
Ever since you were born,

97
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,719
I have felt so insecure.

98
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:00,879
The moment

99
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:07,100
I heard that you were graduating and coming back from Germany,

100
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:12,100
Xie Minghao caught and firmly held onto this sense of insecurity of mine.

101
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,100
It kept growing and ended up

102
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,400
devouring me like a black hole.

103
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,459
At Xie Minghao's instigation,

104
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,890
I transferred Zhiwei's assets

105
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,830
in the name of procurement.

106
00:10:31,439 --> 00:10:34,920
There was no food in the warehouse at that time.

107
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
That's why our dad was unable

108
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,559
to deliver the goods to Ocean

109
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,140
and pay the liquidated damages.

110
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,800
I was the one who drove our dad into a corner.

111
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,600
 Minghao! This is bad!

112
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,620
 What's wrong? I just passed by my dad's office and heard him checking the accounts.

113
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,960
 If he found out that I secretly embezzled public funds to transfer assets,

114
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,297
 I would definitely be kicked out of the house.

115
00:11:10,297 --> 00:11:13,000
 It's all right. You're his daughter.

116
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,120
 If he finds out, he'll only give you an earful at most. What else would he do?

117
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,179
 No. If he asked me where did all the money go, how should I answer him?

118
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,520
 Say you lost the money when you traded futures.

119
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,579
 So you temporarily took Zhiwei's funds to fill up the gaping hole.

120
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:27,759
 You were the one who earned the money for Zhiwei.

121
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,780
 What's there to worry about?

122
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,400
 No. I did it out of spite.

123
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:47,300
 All I have to do is return the money and my dad won't blame me for that.

124
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,439
 - That's right. 
 - Come to your senses, Xieqing.

125
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,799
 There's no turning back now.

126
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,900
 Have you considered our future?

127
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:00,900
 I want to help you put on a wedding dress and give you a lifetime of happiness.

128
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:05,200
 Had you returned the money, what about us?

129
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:08,099
 We would have nothing.

130
00:12:08,099 --> 00:12:12,799
 Even if it weren't for me, you couldn't do that either.

131
00:12:13,939 --> 00:12:15,860
 What do you mean?

132
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,960
 Wait a second.

133
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,670

134
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:45,059
 This is your medical report from the checkup done a few days ago.

135
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:47,419
 I collected it for you today.

136
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,679

137
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:54,040
 You're going to be a mother.

138
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:03,020
 Aren't you happy?

139
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,240
 My goodness.

140
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,720
 We're going to have our own child.

141
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,259
 We really are going to have our own child.

142
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,320
 Xieqing, I'm so happy.

143
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,300
 We'll watch him grow up together.

144
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,000
 We'll give him all our love.

145
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,900
 If you return the money, we might go to jail.

146
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:32,000
 Do you want our kid to become an orphan just like how we were

147
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,190
 when we were young?

148
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,299
 Tell me. What's going on?

149
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:50,340
 Did you transfer the company's funds?

150
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,799
 Yes.

151
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,700
 Where to?

152
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:59,100
 I traded futures and lost a lot of money.

153
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,720
 So I thought of using the company's funds to fill up the gaping hole.

154
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,420
 I thought...

155
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:08,739
 - I thought... 
 - What were you thinking?!

156
00:14:08,739 --> 00:14:12,100
 How dare you embezzle the company's funds to trade futures?

157
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,459
 Tell me! Was it Xie Minghao?

158
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:17,540
 Did he instigate you to do this?!

159
00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:22,519
 You're being biased.

160
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:24,059
 What did you say?

161
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:25,959
 He was right.

162
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,700
 You're biased.

163
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,399
 Deep in your bones, you despise him.

164
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,380
 You dislike him, including me!

165
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,879
 No matter how hard we try and how good we are,

166
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,900
 you always treat us as outsiders.

167
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:43,399
 We are just the orphans you adopted and sponsored!

168
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:46,980
 Right from the start, you've never considered us your own!

169
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,700
 All you care about is your own daughter.

170
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,900
 Su Xieyi!

171
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,679
 You...

172
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:54,100
 What nonsense is this?

173
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,300
 It's not.

174
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,100
 If you hadn't been biased and wanted to pass Zhiwei down to Xieyi,

175
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,740
 would I do all these?

176
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,939
 Don't forget.

177
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,974
 When Zhiwei was at its lowest,

178
00:15:09,974 --> 00:15:12,140
 I was the one who helped you to get it on its feet!

179
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,940
 Shut up!

180
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,519
 And you wouldn't admit that you are biased?

181
00:15:35,179 --> 00:15:37,639
 If this was Su Xieyi,

182
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,719
 could you bring yourself to hit her?

183
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,259
 Why would you think this way?

184
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,140
 I've always considered you my own.

185
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:56,920
 In my heart, there's no difference between you and Xieyi.

186
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,800
 Xie Minghao must be the one who orchestrated this.

187
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,619
 My child. Do you know?

188
00:16:07,619 --> 00:16:10,840
 Because you transferred the company's funds,

189
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,300
 Zhiwei is about to go bankrupt.

190
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,900
 Did you not think of the consequences of your action?

191
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,859
 Have you thought about it?

192
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,600
 Dad. I know I was wrong.

193
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,800
 I'm begging you, Dad.

194
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,799
 Please spare us, will you?

195
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,820
 I can spare you.

196
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,891
 But not Xie Minghao.

197
00:16:40,891 --> 00:16:42,340
 No, Dad.

198
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,720
 Dad. Nothing can happen to Minghao.

199
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,340
 I'm pregnant with his baby.

200
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,900
 Dad. You wouldn't want your grandchild

201
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,200
 to be born without a father, right?

202
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:09,999
 Get up first.

203
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:11,399
 No.

204
00:17:11,399 --> 00:17:15,439
 If you don't agree, I'll keep kneeling.

205
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:20,879
 I've told you.

206
00:17:20,879 --> 00:17:23,480
 In my heart, you and Xieyi are the same.

207
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,960
 You're both my daughters.

208
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,539
 Both of you are dear to me.

209
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,659
 I hope for the best for all of you.

210
00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:38,640
 Thank you.

211
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,779
 Thank you, Dad.

212
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,519
 Dad, thank you for still treating me as your daughter.

213
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:50,119
 But...

214
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:53,559
 But what do we do now, Dad?

215
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:56,380
 I've emptied the company's funds.

216
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,599
 I'll figure out a way.

217
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,400
 I'll find Chairman Huo and sit down with him.

218
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:15,100
 Let's hope he'll bend the rules and let Zhiwei off the hook.

219
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,780
I didn't know that the situation for Zhiwei

220
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,500
was so dire back then.

221
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:35,300
After dad left, he never came back.

222
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:40,960
He chose to take all the blame for my sake.

223
00:18:43,219 --> 00:18:45,359
I've wronged my dad.

224
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,400
Never did I expect that all these...

225
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,740
were a trap that Xie Minghao had set up.

226
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,300
He's the K of Spades.

227
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:05,019
 You disguised yourself as K of Spades and had Huo Jian ruin Zhiwei, didn't you?

228
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,619
 Yes, it was me.

229
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:10,240
 It was my plan to have Huo Jian take down Zhiwei.

230
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,040
 Also, I wasn't the one who killed Shen Zhihong.

231
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,620
 It was you, Shen Xieqing.

232
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,599
 Your father died because of you.

233
00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:45,979
 Are you out of your mind?

234
00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:48,599
 Let go of me! Let me die!

235
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:51,748
 Let go of me! Let me die!

236
00:19:51,748 --> 00:19:53,158
 Tell me the account number and password.

237
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,100
 I can't end up getting nothing, can I?

238
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,900
 I'll never give it to you.

239
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,000
 Let me die!

240
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,459
 Tell me the password.

241
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:09,459
 You're not the man that I loved.

242
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,740
 Didn't I tell you?

243
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,060
 All these years, I've never loved you.

244
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,620
 The one I love is Xieyi.

245
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,799
 You hardly even qualify as a substitute for Xieyi.

246
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,120
 Stop talking!

247
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,378
 I'm not going to stop.

248
00:20:24,378 --> 00:20:27,000
 If it wasn't because you're still of some use to me, I wouldn't even

249
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,859
 look you in the eye.

250
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,960
 I have to thank you for playing along with me.

251
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,039
 If not, that scumbag Shen Zhihong wouldn't have met his end so quickly.

252
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,440
 I don't want to listen to you!

253
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,259
 Listen up!

254
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,759
 In this world, he was the one who despised me the most!

255
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:45,060
 Back then, he adopted me

256
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,240
 just to gain a good reputation.

257
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,979
 I've worked hard all my life

258
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:55,600
 so that no one will despise me ever again

259
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:59,400
 and to gain his approval.

260
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,299
 But in the end?

261
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:06,119
 He thought I am not even qualified to love Xieyi!

262
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,019
 This was all your dad's fault.

263
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,300
 Very well.

264
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,919
 If so, I'm begging you to let me die.

265
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:22,519
 Just let me die

266
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,840
 along with my baby.

267
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,919
 You were never pregnant with our child.

268
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,319
 The report was fake.

269
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,759
 Fake?

270
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:39,200
 How could I possibly have a child with someone like you?

271
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,119
 I've been lying to you all these years!

272
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,499
 You lied to me?

273
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,900
 It was all a lie?

274
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,640
 A lie?

275
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,360
 Xieqing.

276
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,700
I'm sorry, Xieyi.

277
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,180
I'm sorry.

278
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,979
It was all my fault.

279
00:22:36,979 --> 00:22:38,319
I shouldn't be jealous.

280
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:40,800
You're our dad's biological daughter.

281
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,039
I shouldn't have listened to Xie Minghao

282
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,299
and transferred Zhiwei's assets either.

283
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:49,360
I've wronged our dad.

284
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:55,500
Back then, when he chose to jump off the building just to protect me,

285
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,760
only then I realized how important I was to him.

286
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,580
I'm sorry, Sister.

287
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,739
I have only myself to blame.

288
00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:10,600
Don't worry.

289
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,900
I'll turn myself in.

290
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:22,119
Why?

291
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:24,019
Why did you do that?

292
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:25,340
I'm sorry.

293
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,380
It was all my fault.

294
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,319
You can hit me or scold me.

295
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,759
I'm begging you.

296
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:34,500
It was all my fault. I'm sorry.

297
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,259
So what if it was your fault?

298
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,220
Will it bring our dad back to life?

299
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,340
I'm sorry.

300
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,640
Our dad's gone.

301
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,359
So is our family.

302
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:47,559
I'm sorry.

303
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:51,200
The sister I loved most is gone too.

304
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,780
There's nothing left now!

305
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,859
I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

306
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:00,679
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

307
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,020
I'm sorry.

308
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,439
I'm sorry.

309
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,639
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

310
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,939
Li Zeliang!

311
00:24:18,939 --> 00:24:21,280
Li Zeliang, open the door!

312
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,720
Li Zeliang! Li Zeliang!

313
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,319
Come out here, Li Zeliang!

314
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:29,080
Xieyi.

315
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,300
Take Xieqing into the secret room.

316
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,900
Come on.

317
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,659
Come out here, Li Zeliang!

318
00:24:35,659 --> 00:24:37,719
- Li Zeliang! 
 - Get inside.

319
00:24:37,719 --> 00:24:39,459
I know you're in there!

320
00:24:39,459 --> 00:24:41,399
Li Zeliang come out here!

321
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,900
Lawyer Xie, what brings you here to my house? What's the matter?

322
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,979
I'm looking for Su Xieyi. Is she in there?

323
00:24:51,979 --> 00:24:53,459
She is.

324
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:56,140
But I wonder why you want to see my girlfriend.

325
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,620
So Shen Xieqing is in there as well?

326
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,459
Xieqing?

327
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:06,439
Didn't Xieqing jump into the river and commit suicide?

328
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:09,300
What's the matter? Are you hiding something?

329
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,080
Drop the act!

330
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,659
Lawyer Xie, re you trying to break into my house?

331
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:20,219
Entry without consent is against the law.

332
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:23,400
As a lawyer, you should know that, right?

333
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,839
Hand both of them over to me now.

334
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:26,820
Don't forget the evidence that I have.

335
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,839
That recording?

336
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:30,799
Xieyi has told me everything.

337
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,480
The recording was edited, right?

338
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,360
If you dare to release it,

339
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,180
I'll hire a professional to conduct a technical appraisal.

340
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:42,540
Also, all the evidence that you have won't pass the examination.

341
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,379
Listen up, Xie Minghao.

342
00:25:44,379 --> 00:25:48,139
Right now, you have nothing that can be used as a threat anymore.

343
00:25:48,139 --> 00:25:49,679
On the contrary,

344
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,059
you should think about the things that are going to happen to you.

345
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:54,799
Are you talking about Shen Xieqing?

346
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,720
No one will believe her words given that she's a lunatic.

347
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,559
So what if people believe her?

348
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,000
I'm a lawyer. I know how to play with the system.

349
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,020
The funds from Zhiwei went straight to her account.

350
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,060
It has nothing to do with me at all!

351
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:08,060
Xie Minghao.

352
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,659
Xieyi.

353
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:11,440
You're a monster.

354
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,219
My dad was kind enough to provide you with financial aid.

355
00:26:13,219 --> 00:26:15,859
But you forced him to commit suicide.

356
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:17,359
My sister loved you so much,

357
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:19,200
but you drove her crazy, made her take her own life,

358
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,300
and ruined her life and my family!

359
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,839
How do you have the cheek to show up in front of me?

360
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:27,039
Xieyi, what are you talking about?

361
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,979
I did all this for you.

362
00:26:28,979 --> 00:26:31,580
You used to be the first person who protected me.

363
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,559
Why are you... Why are you standing on the opposite side now?

364
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,058
Come here.

365
00:26:36,058 --> 00:26:39,259
Listen up! Try taking another step forward and I'll call the police!

366
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,839
- Xieyi, come back... 
 - Every word that you utter right now

367
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:46,779
just makes me hate you even more.

368
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,600
Very well, Su Xieyi.

369
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,200
You'll regret this.

370
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,500
You can only be mine!

371
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,580
As long as you two are together, I'm not going to spare him.

372
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,760
Just you wait!

373
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,240
I'll destroy Ocean and trample Li Zeliang under my feet

374
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,000
until you come begging me

375
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,080
and come back to my side.

376
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,000
Lunatic.

377
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,019
A'Yan.

378
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:31,200
Given Xie Minghao's extreme behavior,

379
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,060
I'm afraid he might do something to hurt you.

380
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,620
Now that you and Xieqing are back,

381
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,840
I have nothing to worry about now.

382
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,259
The one who should be afraid is him.

383
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:45,400
What do you mean?

384
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,100
Go and get changed.

385
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,979
I'm taking you to meet my friends.

386
00:27:51,979 --> 00:27:54,060
What about my sister?

387
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,240
It's all right.

388
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,519
I'll ask Yingsong to come and watch over her.

389
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:59,740
If Xie Minghao comes back,

390
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,240
I'll get the security to kick him out.

391
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,360
All right.

392
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,040
Don't worry.

393
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,140
Mr. He.

394
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,879
Chairman Li. You're here.

395
00:28:20,879 --> 00:28:22,500
Hi, Miss Su.

396
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,720
Hi.

397
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,139
Miss Su. I'm sorry about last time.

398
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:28,679
No offense.

399
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,779
Xieyi.

400
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,980
Director Shi, why are you here?

401
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,779
Oscar, why are you dressed differently now?

402
00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:40,480
You should call him Director Hou now.

403
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,259
He's now the new vice president of Zhengda Fund.

404
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:46,699
Don't listen to her. Xieyi.

405
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,019
Just stick to Oscar will do.

406
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:52,960
Zeliang. Now that Xieyi and Xieqing are back,

407
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,639
you have nothing to worry about now.

408
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:00,319
Mr. He. Have you made up your mind?

409
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:02,199
No regrets?

410
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,799
No regrets.

411
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,759
I can't keep going down the wrong path.

412
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,839
What's going on here?

413
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:13,619
A'Liang. Haven't you told Xieyi?

414
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:21,200

415
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,780
That explains why you were so calm.

416
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,440
So you've been secretly having a big plan set in motion.

417
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,559
All's fair in love and war.

418
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,559
That's the man that I love.

419
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,719
Smart, forbearing, and visionary.

420
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,759
After hearing your compliments, I suddenly realized

421
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:43,779
I'm actually that great.

422
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,460
I'm just being polite.

423
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,700
A'Yan, let's have this for tomorrow's breakfast, all right?

424
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,219
And this.

425
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,420
Excuse me.

426
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,900
Yes?

427
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,400
Please get me a box of mung bean cakes.

428
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,380
Sure. A moment, please.

429
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,820
I didn't say I wanted that.

430
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,420
Xieyi.

431
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:30,179
I know that you're worried about Xieqing and you actually care about her.

432
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:32,160
Xieqing asked me to relay the message.

433
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,380
She'll take responsibility

434
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,719
for the things she has done.

435
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:40,079
She doesn't expect you to forgive her.

436
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:44,819
But she hopes you won't hate her anymore.

437
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:48,699
Because it's a great torment to hate a person.

438
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,820
She doesn't want you to suffer.

439
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,739
She wants you to be happy.

440
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:57,740
Xieyi.

441
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:03,200
Xieqing is your only family.

442
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,400
To forgive her is to set yourself free.

443
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:26,559
Xieyi.

444
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,219
I'm sorry.

445
00:32:05,219 --> 00:32:07,680
I've failed you.

446
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:16,060
Dad had always considered me as his own.

447
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:20,860
But I felt inferior because of my status as an adopted child

448
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:23,280
and I always tried to compare to you.

449
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,079
That's how I went astray.

450
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,259
Thank you for coming here.

451
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:40,279
I am sorry.

452
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:43,519
You can hate me.

453
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,059
This is the punishment I deserve.

454
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,040
Sister.

455
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,439
You've suffered enough in the past two years.

456
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,420
I don't hate you.

457
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,099
Right now, you're my only family.

458
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,600
I think our dad, who's up there in heaven, doesn't hate you either.

459
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,700
Thank you.

460
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,319
I'm sorry.

461
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,760
A'Yan.

462
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,860
Thank you.

463
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,000
If it hadn't been for your encouragement,

464
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,840
I wouldn't be able to fix things so quickly with my sister.

465
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:03,499
You care a lot about Xieqing.

466
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:07,599
That's something you can't hide.

467
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:10,000
But I was insensible when I was a kid

468
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,380
and made my sister misunderstand things.

469
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,239
Had I been more sensitive,

470
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,079
my sister wouldn't have been brainwashed by Xie Minghao.

471
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,639
The status as an adopted daughter

472
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,960
had always been an issue to Shen Xieqing.

473
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,559
If she couldn't get over it, no matter how nice

474
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:33,519
and thoughtful you were, it would be of no use.

475
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:36,999
It's just

476
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,060
it was a huge price to pay to finally find closure.

477
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,400
That's right.

478
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:50,059
My sister said she will turn herself in after this is all over.

479
00:34:50,059 --> 00:34:52,679
But she just regained her consciousness.

480
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,780
I can't bear to let her go.

481
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,700
Don't worry.

482
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,939
It will be okay.

483
00:35:05,917 --> 00:35:09,837
Oh, right. That day, Xie Minghao said he wants to destroy Ocean's reputation.

484
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,139
We must find a way to stop him.

485
00:35:12,139 --> 00:35:15,739
Don't worry. He won't succeed.

486
00:35:16,819 --> 00:35:19,080
So...

487
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,099
are you going to fight back now?

488
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:27,999
Of course.

489
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:31,260
But before that,

490
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:34,059
there's something more important that I have to do.

491
00:35:34,059 --> 00:35:35,960
What is it?

492
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:38,659
Stamp the papers.

493
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:46,400

494
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,660
President Dai. You said you want to change Ocean's name to Zhengcai.

495
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,459
Is that true?

496
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:58,519
Back then, Zhengde and Ocean were rivals and enemies.

497
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:00,039
But things are different now.

498
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:01,480
We're a family.

499
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,339
So we have to act like one.

500
00:36:04,339 --> 00:36:06,539
What do you say?

501
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:09,510
Everyone. If there's no other problem,

502
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:13,199
please sign the shareholder resolution.

503
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:14,480
This is huge.

504
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,499
Chairman Li isn't here yet.

505
00:36:16,499 --> 00:36:18,419
All of us...

506
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:27,760
A wise man submits to circumstances.

507
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,000
Sign it. Sign it.

508
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,400
The meeting is held before everyone arrives.

509
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,280
President Dai, aren't you being too impatient?

510
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,520

511
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:47,599
Chairman Li.

512
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:48,920
Oh, not right.

513
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,800
You are no longer the chairman of Ocean.

514
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,139
I should just call you Mr. Li.

515
00:36:54,139 --> 00:36:56,239
Mr. Li, you came just in time.

516
00:36:57,039 --> 00:36:59,719
Please take a look at the shareholder resolution.

517
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:04,719
You can vote against it.

518
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:07,740
But your vote won't change anything anyway.

519
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,039
Don't push too far.

520
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:13,579
You know how to make me stop.

521
00:37:13,579 --> 00:37:16,000
Xie Minghao.

522
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,660
Your threat is no longer valid.

523
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,039
All right.

524
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:22,780
Same old rules. Let's vote.

525
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,920
Vote.

526
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,340
Think no more. Let's vote.

527
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,400
I'm against it.

528
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,480
It's 10 AM.

529
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,479
President Dai. It's my turn now.

530
00:37:39,479 --> 00:37:41,920
What does that mean? Your turn? My turn?

531
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,839
What are you saying?

532
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,199
President Dai, this is bad.

533
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:50,119
He Jianghua made an exposé on the Internet.

534
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:52,860
Zhengde is in trouble.

535
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,559
 I'm He Jianghua.

536
00:37:54,559 --> 00:38:00,800
 I'm making this video to solemnly apologize to my fans

537
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,440
 who have always supported me and trusted me.

538
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,960
 I've made a grave mistake.

539
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,320
 I previously made an exposé of Lantian Bay construction project proposal.

540
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,920
 It was actually obtained from Dai Ziang,

541
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,300
 the chairman of Zhengde Group.

542
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,360
 Later on, the fire at the Lantian Bay construction site was also

543
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,360
 done by me at Dai Ziang's instigation.

544
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:27,159
 In order to get exclusive stories, I've stooped to becoming

545
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:29,039
 an accomplice to discredit Ocean.

546
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:32,659
 This went against my conscience as a human being

547
00:38:32,659 --> 00:38:35,900
 and my original aspiration when first getting into this industry.

548
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:40,979
 To Zeliang, Ocean and those whom I've hurt, I hereby

549
00:38:40,979 --> 00:38:43,319
 sincerely apologize

550
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:45,719
 with all of my heart.

551
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:48,800
 After this, I'll turn myself in to the police

552
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,760
 and take responsibility for what I've done.

553
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,980
 Let my fate be a lesson to all of you.

554
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,320
Nonsense!

555
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,880
Li Zeliang, you must have a death wish.

556
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,997
President Dai. There's a conflict close to home now.

557
00:39:00,997 --> 00:39:05,159
If I were you, I wouldn't waste a single minute.

558
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:06,960
That makes sense. Move!

559
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,079
Call off the meeting.

560
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,519
Just you wait.

561
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,460
That's all for today. We'll continue at another time.

562
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,719
Go on.

563
00:39:33,219 --> 00:39:34,239
Hang in there.

564
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:36,719
Buy back all of Zhengde's stocks. Buy all that there is in the market.

565
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:39,840
Be sure to stabilize the stock price to avoid panic in the market.

566
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,800
Shut up! Get it done!

567
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,699
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

568
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,480
What's the situation with Zhengde's stock price now?

569
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,239
It's down by 10 percent.

570
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:55,181
They've noticed and they're frantically buying back their own shares

571
00:39:55,181 --> 00:39:57,039
to delay the fall in stock prices.

572
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:59,159
But someone in the Hong Kong, China stock market

573
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:01,119
took the opportunity to short their stocks.

574
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,559
What a surprise!

575
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:05,159
Dai Ziang is arrogant and bossy.

576
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:07,800
He has offended many people in the business world.

577
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,719
It's normal if people kick him while he's down.

578
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:15,159
That's what they say. What goes comes around.

579
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:18,880
Previously, they spent a lot of money to acquire Ocean's equity.

580
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,880
I'm afraid they won't be able to hold out any longer.

581
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,079
Oscar, the rest is on you.

582
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,579
Okay.

583
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,640
It has dropped almost below 20 percent now.

584
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,255
Dai Ziang couldn't resist the pressure

585
00:40:38,255 --> 00:40:41,679
and started to sell Ocean's stock to save Zhengde.

586
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:44,060
Oscar. It's showtime.

587
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:47,679
Buy all of Ocean stocks that Dai Ziang sold under Zhengda Fund.

588
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:48,840
Won't you reconsider it?

589
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:53,400
If that's the case, Zhengda will be Ocean's largest shareholder.

590
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,900
I have you, don't I?

591
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,959
You're right.
