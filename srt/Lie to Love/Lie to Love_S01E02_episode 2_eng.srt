00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:15,090

2
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:25,100
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

3
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:33,510
♫  Still haunts me now and then in quiet nights  ♫

4
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:41,330
♫  And turn to face all the long lost times   ♫

5
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,270
♫   Brace the pain  ♫

6
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:51,210
♫  Let memories wake up from oceans deep  ♫

7
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,350
♫  No place to hide  ♫

8
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,450
♫  No way to run  ♫

9
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,820
♫  New dawn counts down  ♫

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,930
♫  I fight,  ♫

11
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,010
♫  I cry,  ♫

12
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,600
♫  I give up  ♫

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:14,710
♫  Memories forgotten, forsaken surround   ♫

14
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:24,130
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

15
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:33,070
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

16
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:40,950
♫   Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

17
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:49,650
♫   When morning comes from the other side  ♫

18
00:01:49,650 --> 00:02:00,150

19
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,050

20
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,580
Chairman Huo, Yunfeng Hotel has become one of the three candidates

21
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,480
for Fujiade Auction's partner selection.

22
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,039
Our meeting today will mainly discuss the latest bidding tender.

23
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:25,019
- Winning the tender is a good opportunity for Yunfeng's publicity. 
 - Yes.

24
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,660
 I've told you we are in peak season.

25
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,080
 I told you to reserve all the rooms.

26
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,719
 Why did you allow online booking?

27
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:34,020
 I was worried if the rooms of an entire floor weren't available to be booked online,

28
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,580
 it'd be too suspicious.

29
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,780
 I'm in charge of this matter.

30
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,280
 Do you know how much money a room can make during the entire peak season?

31
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,560
 I understand. What should we do now?

32
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,700
 Go back now.

33
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,339
 Destroy all correspondence and relevant documents.

34
00:02:49,339 --> 00:02:51,539
It's... It's nonsense.

35
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:53,099
It's all nonsense!

36
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:54,560
Turn it off now!

37
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,400
Turn it off!

38
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,100
Enough!

39
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,439
Wait.

40
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,180
I-I'm sorry, Chairman Huo.

41
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,779
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

42
00:03:05,779 --> 00:03:08,239
- I deserve to die! 
 - Enough.

43
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,860
In my office now.

44
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:31,539
Su Xieyi.

45
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:35,160
A Hannover University graduate majoring in hotel management.

46
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,600
You have good results. You did very well in every subject.

47
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,280
Fluent in German and Italian?

48
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,299
Yes. Tell me, which is your favorite hotel?

49
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,640
The Surrey Hotel in Auckland.

50
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,880
It has a British style and is similar to a bed and breakfast hotel.

51
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,580
Any reason why?

52
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:57,980
The founder of the hotel is the descendant of a survivor of the Titanic accident.

53
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,599
Maybe because the family had experienced life and death,

54
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:04,800
they cherish the present and the memory of old acquaintances more.

55
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,840
And they have more faith in the beauty of life.

56
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,059
What is a hotel to you?

57
00:04:10,059 --> 00:04:14,739
As we all know, there's a saying in our hotel industry

58
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:17,719
that a hotel is people's second home.

59
00:04:17,719 --> 00:04:19,859
But I have to disagree

60
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:23,800
because there's only one home, which is irreplaceable.

61
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,879
I told you to keep an eye on the one surnamed Li!

62
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:29,099
I never asked you to cause any trouble!

63
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:33,120
Chairman Huo, we were very cautious.

64
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,820
S-Someone must be behind this.

65
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,639
Could it be that Li who did it?

66
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,199
This happened when he had just come here.

67
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,240
Yes, it must be him.

68
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:54,399
We'll know if it's him after we look into it.

69
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,920

70
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:12,219
Uncle Bai.

71
00:05:12,219 --> 00:05:14,278
- Miss Yi. 
 - Uncle Bai, no need to get up.

72
00:05:14,278 --> 00:05:15,140
Okay.

73
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,000
Well, I need to check the monitors in the control room.

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,959
I need recordings for the last 12 hours.

75
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:22,360
Okay.

76
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,739
Do you like Ocean Hotel?

77
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,739
Of course.

78
00:05:41,739 --> 00:05:46,559
Ocean Hotel is my goal.

79
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:51,070
I can see from your resume that your job preference

80
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,040
is the General Manager's office?

81
00:05:54,299 --> 00:05:57,179
Mr. Li, the board of directors has decided

82
00:05:57,179 --> 00:05:59,639
to dismiss Lin Tai officially.

83
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,979
Here are some new resumes submitted by the HR Department to you.

84
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,680
 I major in hotel management.

85
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,060
 Ocean Hotel is the hotel that I want to work for the most.

86
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,060
 It's Number one.

87
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,380
What's wrong?

88
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,360
Why are you panting from sending the resume?

89
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,649
It is the hardest to serve the prince. Have you watched the drama?

90
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:43,279
The most difficult task in the palace is to accompany the prince to study.

91
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,380

92
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,640
Come in.

93
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:11,439
Mr. Li, I've gotten the medicine from Dr. Wu.

94
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:13,339
Why are you looking at all these?

95
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:16,580
Anyone sent by the HR Department must have been arranged by Huo Jian.

96
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,240
One of the moles has just left.

97
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,060
Huo Jian is so anxious that he's trying to send some more here.

98
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,040
Even if we can't find a trustworthy one,

99
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,739
we can at least reject them, right?

100
00:07:24,739 --> 00:07:28,900
The problem is, this happened to Secretary Lin as soon as you came to work.

101
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,600
Huo Jian will definitely suspect you.

102
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,979
 Miss Su Xieyi,

103
00:07:56,979 --> 00:07:59,600
 congratulations on passing your interview

104
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,660
 and becoming part of Ocean Hotel.

105
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,499
 You're welcome to join us officially tomorrow.

106
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:06,320
 General Manager's Office, Ocean Hotel.

107
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,900
Hello, I'm Su Xieyi, reporting for duty.

108
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,079
Welcome.

109
00:08:41,079 --> 00:08:44,059
This is the employee handbook and your desk.

110
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:45,880
Work hard.

111
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,680
Thank you.

112
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:02,319
Hello there. I'm Gong Mingyue.

113
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:04,979
Hello. I'm Su Xieyi.

114
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:06,760
Did you see that Lin Tai just now?

115
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,879
Have you heard of it? About what happened.

116
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:12,159
I'm new, so I'm not too sure. What happened?

117
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:15,100
How could you not know about it? You missed out on the whole drama.

118
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,178
It's about giving private discounts on hotel rooms.

119
00:09:18,178 --> 00:09:21,520
Secretary Lin and Chen Shan, the manager of the Housekeeping Department, were behind all that.

120
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,860
We just don't know who exposed this matter.

121
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,400
Two people were fired at the same time.

122
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,719
So ruthless.

123
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:28,079
That person did well.

124
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:30,720
That person did what I didn't dare to do.

125
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,000
If I know who that person is,

126
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,280
I'm going to reward them with bravery awards.

127
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,779
They completely disregarded the prince.

128
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:41,000
The prince is still here. You're going to make the prince come out here.

129
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,459
Get back to work.

130
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:44,159
Quickly now.

131
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,939
She came as expected.

132
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,000
Please stop what you're doing now.

133
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Listen to me first.

134
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,039
Everyone knows that Lin Tai was fired, right?

135
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:22,159
The job of the secretary of the Deputy General Manager is important.

136
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,519
It can't be delayed even by a day.

137
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,239
Anyone who's free for these few days can temporarily fill in as the Deputy General Manager's assistant.

138
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,179
I can't.

139
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:32,419
I'm currently preparing a plan that needs to be completed next week.

140
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:37,159
Jessica, I'm busy with the report forms, so count me out.

141
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:41,659
- Lately, I... 
 - Gong Mingyue, if you have time to watch Palace drama,

142
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:43,459
I'm sure you have the time to be the assistant.

143
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:47,799
I wasn't watching it for fun. I'm studying their attires.

144
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:51,440
We're going to hold a palace theme event later, right?

145
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,720
You and your excuses.

146
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,900
I can go.

147
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:06,499
Come in.

148
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:18,140
Mr. Li, this is your temporary assistant, Su Xieyi.

149
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,699
Hello, Mr. Li.

150
00:11:19,699 --> 00:11:22,020
Before the new secretary is confirmed,

151
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:26,139
she'll temporarily take over Lin Tai's work for these few days.

152
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:28,380
All right.

153
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,779
You can leave now.

154
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:31,759
I want to talk to Miss Su.

155
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:33,359
Okay.

156
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,500
This is the access card of the office.

157
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,260
Do your best.

158
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,960
Okay.

159
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:06,860
Did you say he hired a new employee as his assistant?

160
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,660
Yes.

161
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,240
Let him be.

162
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,680
By the way, how did it go at the control center?

163
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,759
I watched the footage from a day before the incident.

164
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:21,859
There wasn't anything unusual.

165
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:25,500
Do you mean no one unrelated went in?

166
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:28,960
I even checked those from the broadcasting room.

167
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,939
He had no idea at all.

168
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,819
How can there be no trace at all?

169
00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:39,779
The timestamp is a little odd.

170
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:44,519
But in terms of motive, Li Zeliang is the most suspicious.

171
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,140
Do you think he's just pretending to be weak?

172
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,939
He already knew we sent Secretary Lin to watch him.

173
00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:55,159
So he appears not working but sent someone to look into Secretary Lin.

174
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:58,399
I guess I underestimated this nephew of mine.

175
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,020
 Uncle Bai, can you copy this for me?

176
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,720
 Okay.

177
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:27,779
 - Also... 
 - Don't worry.

178
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:31,879
 I'll clean it up without any trace.

179
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,280
You were the one who exposed Secretary Lin.

180
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,240
Yes.

181
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,840
Why?

182
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,979
As a newcomer who came for an interview,

183
00:13:55,979 --> 00:13:58,859
I happened to record such filthy affairs.

184
00:13:58,859 --> 00:14:02,539
My sense of justice does not allow such a person to exist.

185
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:06,920
Moreover, I already said Ocean Hotel is my number one.

186
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,900
So I won't allow anything like this to happen.

187
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,479
Is that all?

188
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,179
No.

189
00:14:14,179 --> 00:14:17,079
Thank you for letting me be your assistant.

190
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,859
You can say we're even now.

191
00:14:22,859 --> 00:14:25,459
In the future, I'll need your guidance on work.

192
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:27,540
All right. I'm done.

193
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,580
If there's nothing else, I'll get back to work.

194
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,479
Hello, Yingsong. I want you to look into someone.

195
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:45,459
 What are you snapping?

196
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,560
 I was snapping at the beautiful view.

197
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,480
 By the way,

198
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,380
 you said you returned from overseas.

199
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,760
 Were you studying abroad?

200
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,939
 Yes.

201
00:16:02,939 --> 00:16:04,240
 Which country?

202
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,359
 - Germany. 
 - Germany?

203
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:10,100
 I came back from studying in Germany, too.

204
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,340
 I studied hotel management.

205
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,459
 Really? Which university are you studying at?

206
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:14,980
 I already graduated.

207
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,760
 The University of Hannover.

208
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,579
 What a coincidence.

209
00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:20,039
 So you're my senior.

210
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:21,320
 Really?

211
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,620
 Hello, Junior Sister.

212
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,199
 Senior, you're very fortunate today.

213
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,979
 I'm going to let you eat the most delicious crab roe noodles in the world.

214
00:16:28,979 --> 00:16:30,760
 Okay.

215
00:16:33,946 --> 00:16:36,399
 If you stir the crab roe like this,

216
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,531
 it's only going to be the world's number two.

217
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:40,240
 It lacks some soul in it.

218
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,579
 That's impossible.

219
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:43,579
 This is handed down from my ancestors.

220
00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:46,860
 Besides, how do you know when you haven't even tried it?

221
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,820
 Listen, crab roe itself smells fishy.

222
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,539
 So it will smell fishy.

223
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:56,220
 Moreover, this crab roe of yours was under the sun for a long time.

224
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,100
 We've already passed the best time to eat it.

225
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,979
 - If you want to get rid of the smell, you should add... 
 - Vinegar.

226
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,499
 Vinegar won't help.

227
00:17:06,499 --> 00:17:08,739
 What should I add then?

228
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,250

229
00:17:14,259 --> 00:17:16,059
 Give it to me.

230
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:22,659
 Actually, it's best to add Shaoxing wine when cooking crab roe.

231
00:17:22,659 --> 00:17:26,680
 Crab roe cooked with Shaoxing wine is fragrant, delicious, and not greasy.

232
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,720
 However, using plum wine is okay too.

233
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,560
Why are you smiling?

234
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,800
I wasn't.

235
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,108
You were looking at that side...

236
00:18:00,108 --> 00:18:03,279
What is it? Let's talk inside.

237
00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:16,359
You asked me to look into your temporary assistant, right?

238
00:18:19,187 --> 00:18:25,080
- What did you find out? 
 - Based on her resume, Miss Su used to live in Germany.

239
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,839
So I sent someone to dig more and found that she had been hospitalized for some time two years ago.

240
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:31,199
Hospitalized?

241
00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:35,080
Did you find out what she was treated for?

242
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,600
The medical database system is different. Besides, it concerns the privacy of a person.

243
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,459
So it's difficult to get more info.

244
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,640
You can stop investigating.

245
00:18:46,499 --> 00:18:48,099
I'll do it myself.

246
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,720
- Hello, Director Li. 
 - Hello.

247
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,519
Mr. Li, it's this way.

248
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:01,920
I'm used to walking this way.

249
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,599
- Director Li, hello. 
 - Hello.

250
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:15,459
Hello, Director Li.

251
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:41,440
 Where's the contract?

252
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,000
Li Zeliang, are you this childish?

253
00:20:34,939 --> 00:20:36,141
- Is it sweet? 
 - Yes.

254
00:20:36,141 --> 00:20:38,100
Don't tell your mom about this.

255
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,340
Let's pinky swear.

256
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,480
Hello?

257
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,119
 Miss Su, did you work overtime on your first day at work?

258
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,539
 Don't look around. I'm not that free to be following you around.

259
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:19,799
 On your first day at work, I'll treat you to dinner as your superior.

260
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:22,340
 I'll send the address to you later.

261
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,522
Director Li, you've brought your friend with you today.

262
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:40,000
Do you come here often, Mr. Li?

263
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,119
Every time I think about crab roe noodles, I'll come and eat here.

264
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:47,720
That's right. Our crab roe noodle is the best and the most authentic.

265
00:21:47,721 --> 00:21:49,321
Miss, please take a look.

266
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,540
I'll have crab roe noodles as well then.

267
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,359
- All right. Two bowls of crab roe noodles, right? 
 - Only one.

268
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:56,519
Give us two empty bowls.

269
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:58,759
We'll be sharing.

270
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:02,060
 I only prepared one serving. Let's share.

271
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,660
 Let me do it.

272
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,799
 Having too much of a delicacy like this can be overkill.

273
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,420
 Just one taste of it could make this life worthwhile.

274
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:23,519
 The view is beautiful.

275
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:26,739
 The position of this tree is too perfect.

276
00:22:26,739 --> 00:22:31,279
 Do you think that someone moved this tree here from somewhere else?

277
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:35,340
 If that's the case, it must be suffering.

278
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,080
 Why?

279
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,680
 Trees have memories, too.

280
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,640
 If you move a tree along with its roots to a different ground,

281
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,640
 they will suffer, too.

282
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,480
 Because they can't forget their past.

283
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,440
 Some trees slowly die because they can't get used to the new soil and environment.

284
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:04,619
 Only the trees that can adapt and forget their past completely can survive.

285
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:09,960
 It sounds pretty sad when you put it like that.

286
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:15,419
 But exchanging a new life with memories seems to be worth it.

287
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:20,720
 You may say so, but humans aren't objects, after all.

288
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,720
 You've gone too far.

289
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,760
 You cooked it with so much effort. I must eat more to show my appreciation.

290
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:39,363
 Hey! I'm not a kid anymore. There was no need to hit me when I dropped my chopsticks.

291
00:23:39,363 --> 00:23:41,100
 It has nothing to do with age.

292
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,920
 You need to be hit three times if you drop your chopsticks. It's my habit.

293
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,480
 What kind of habit is that?

294
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,699
 You have no idea, right?

295
00:23:48,699 --> 00:23:51,739
 There's an old saying: "you need to be hit three times if you drop your chopsticks."

296
00:23:51,739 --> 00:23:56,099
 The first hit means you're a fool.

297
00:23:56,099 --> 00:23:59,900
 The second hit means blessing. It is to wish you happiness

298
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,519
 as "chopsticks falling" and "happiness" sound similar in Chinese.

299
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:07,759
 The third hit indicates that you'll get hit by someone very soon for dropping your chopsticks.

300
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:11,039
 People around you will hit you symbolically.

301
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,199
 That way, we can prevent you from getting beaten even worse.

302
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,259
 Petty tricks.

303
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:24,340
 So you're trying to bring up the past to test if I have lost my memories.

304
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,699
 All right. Bring it on.

305
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:29,279
Miss Su, what are you thinking about?

306
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,319
I think you must take care of your health.

307
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:37,580
You can't eat too little.

308
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,079
This is the first time someone has said this to me.

309
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:45,540
As your temporary assistant, it's my obligation to take care of your health.

310
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:51,119
Your easygoing personality makes me feel close to you.

311
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:52,599
Close?

312
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:55,219
It's like we've met before.

313
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:02,179
Also, we've eaten noodles from the same bowl.

314
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:10,019
That's what we called deja vu.

315
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:13,019
Most people would have experienced that before.

316
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:16,400
Things they've never done before and people they've never met,

317
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,699
yet they feel familiar with them.

318
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:25,599
Then do you feel familiar with me?

319
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:30,060
For someone like you, anyone would want to know you earlier.

320
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,640
I wasn't that fortunate.

321
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,980
But it's not too late to know you now.

322
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,760
I'll give a toast to you with noodles instead of alcohol.

323
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,819
- I thought it was supposed to be three... 
 - What?

324
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:54,079
 Oh, no. I almost gave myself away.

325
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:56,019
What did you say just now?

326
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,699
Fishy.

327
00:26:02,699 --> 00:26:05,860
I said fishy.

328
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:09,279
This crab roe smells a little fishy. Don't you think so?

329
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,000
Yes, it's fishy.

330
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,039
We'll just add some vinegar.

331
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,479
It'll smell even fishier if you add vinegar.

332
00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:17,659
What should we add, then?

333
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:21,379
- We should add... 
 - Shaoxing wine? Plum wine?

334
00:26:24,939 --> 00:26:27,680
 Every step is a trap.

335
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:35,719
We should not waste time and just order another one.

336
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,539
Excuse me.

337
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:44,720
The crab roe smells fishy. Can you make another bowl for us?

338
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,880
Miss, you can't wrongly accuse us.

339
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,160
- Our crab roe noodle is the most authentic. 
 - Just make another bowl.

340
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,619
- But... 
 - I'll pay for these two bowls.

341
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:02,960
 Su Xieyi, you should stop talking.

342
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,060
What are you doing?

343
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,100
Don't be nervous.

344
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:28,220
I just found the view opposite to where I was sitting wasn't good enough.

345
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,540
I wanted to change seats.

346
00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:39,119
 What are you doing?

347
00:27:39,739 --> 00:27:41,759
 Nothing.

348
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:45,760
 I just want to sit here so I can enjoy the same view as you.

349
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:56,379
 You don't think the view you just saw looks beautiful?

350
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,499
 It's beautiful.

351
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,960
 Shameless.

352
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,079
 You didn't say that two years ago.

353
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:21,400
Are you free later?

354
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,000
I want to take you somewhere.

355
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,239
A place where we can see the sunrise.

356
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:38,620

357
00:28:42,453 --> 00:28:43,400
Hello?

358
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,739
 Xieyi, do you have time for a meal tomorrow?

359
00:28:46,739 --> 00:28:49,160
What? Now?

360
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,319
All right. I'll be there right away. Wait for me.

361
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:54,200
 Why are you in such a rush?

362
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,060
I said I'll be there right away.

363
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,639
I'll leave now.

364
00:28:59,639 --> 00:29:01,259
Director Li, I'm sorry.

365
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:03,440
Something came up.

366
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,699
What's the hurry? Do you have another date?

367
00:29:06,699 --> 00:29:09,000
My friend wants to see me urgently.

368
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:10,920
I'll drive you there then.

369
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,239
It's okay. I can go myself.

370
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,279
The entrance is that way.

371
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:37,340
Lawyer Xie, look.

372
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:43,159
If it weren't for you, our daughter would have been abused for nothing.

373
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:44,980
- Please accept this. 
 - It's okay.

374
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,418
Please. It's a small token of appreciation.

375
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:49,000
No, you don't have to give it to me.

376
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,340
Since it's free legal aid, we won't accept any kind of payment.

377
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,680
- But you've helped us. You're our family's benefactor.
 - Yes.

378
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,259
The law helped you. I'm serious. Take it back.

379
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:04,868
I suggest your daughter should consider changing her job after she recovers.

380
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:09,079
She has gone through so much. I'm worried that her previous job

381
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:10,499
will bring bad effects on her mental health.

382
00:30:10,499 --> 00:30:12,480
We'll tell her that. Thank you so much.

383
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,340
Then we'll get going if there's nothing else.

384
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,559
Take care.

385
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:17,700
- Okay. 
 - Thank you.

386
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,880
Not bad, Lawyer Xie. It was a timely help.

387
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,340
You're the best talker in the family.

388
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:30,759
Thank you for the compliment.

389
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:32,720
You went for an interview at Ocean Hotel.

390
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,640
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

391
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,240
You just set up your law firm, and you have to take care of your sister.

392
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,740
I was afraid you couldn't manage.

393
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:45,880
Besides, if I fail the interview, it'll be too humiliating.

394
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,620
I think you thought I was too busy to take care of you.

395
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:56,480
Brother Ming Hao, you know I must get into Ocean Hotel.

396
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,359
Xieyi, listen to me.

397
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,759
You're in a dangerous situation now.

398
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:06,419
If the perpetrator finds out your identity and motive,

399
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:11,039
no one will know what they will do to you.

400
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,359
Don't worry.

401
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:14,580
My mom and I left the country early.

402
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,920
No one could recognize me ten years ago.

403
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,020
Let alone now.

404
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,960
What about Li Zeliang?

405
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,559
Him?

406
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:25,739
I've already worked out a plan.

407
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,820
But the police had found that Uncle Shen's death was due to suicide.

408
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,939
There was nothing suspicious about his death either.

409
00:31:34,939 --> 00:31:39,240
Besides, he did leave a suicide note. He wrote it clearly too.

410
00:31:39,739 --> 00:31:42,739
But all of you didn't see what I saw.

411
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,740
If you insist on looking into it, you'll need to find the poison contract.

412
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,440
Before signing the contract, it was clearly written

413
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,960
that the penalty for the breach of contract was five million yuan.

414
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,319
How did the penalty increase more than tenfold on the day of signing the contract?

415
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:03,160
Someone was obviously up to no good.

416
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:08,100
Then... Do you know where the contract is?

417
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,360
I've searched his office. I didn't find anything.

418
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,780
Also, he didn't come to the office before.

419
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:17,240
If he's always at home,

420
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,820
could the contract be...

421
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,580
That's it.

422
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,680
It must be at his place.

423
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,399
What are you thinking about? Let's see if I can help.

424
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:31,359
Brother Ming Hao, you already did me a favor. I'll get going now.

425
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:32,440
Where are you going?

426
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,720
I got it now. No risk, no reward.

427
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:26,559
Yingsong, fix this buckle.

428
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,430
Mr. Li, you shouldn't rush it.

429
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:33,380
You could make your workout less intense.

430
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,459
I can't.

431
00:34:34,459 --> 00:34:36,790
Huo Jian would never have dreamed

432
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:40,860
that you're desperate to recover after putting his guard up all the time.

433
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:45,820
But judging from Lin Tai's incident, he's still suspecting and doubting you.

434
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:49,280
So no one else should know about this place other than you.

435
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,680
Yes.

436
00:35:08,999 --> 00:35:10,499
Uncle.

437
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,619
What? Aren't you going to invite me in?

438
00:35:14,619 --> 00:35:16,219
Uncle, please come in.

439
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:29,600
It's already late. What brings you here suddenly?

440
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,460
It's been a while since I last visited you. I happened to pass by today.

441
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,659
Are you alone at home?

442
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:41,220
Have you forgotten that I've always lived alone?

443
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,000
Have a seat, Uncle.

444
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:06,059
Zeliang, why is your house so messy?

445
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:08,299
Does no one help you clean?

446
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:12,840
How about this? I'll ask Yi Fei to come and clean the house for you.

447
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,559
I'll ask her to bring some plants.

448
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:18,660
You'll be in a better mood looking at plants.

449
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,160
It's okay, Uncle. I live alone.

450
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,880
It's actually more comfortable to be a bit messy.

451
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,239
All right.

452
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:29,740
Take a seat. Don't just stand there.

453
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,540
Okay.

454
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:35,600
I don't have anything else to drink. How about some beer?

455
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,399
No need. No need to bother.

456
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:43,360
Come. Have a seat.

457
00:36:53,059 --> 00:36:55,000
Look at your clothes.

458
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,460
You look sloppy.

459
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,400
It's been so long since you last worked.

460
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,559
How did it go?

461
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:12,040
You've seen it yourself. I can't even manage my subordinates.

462
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,340
I've let you down.

463
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:20,680
You've only returned to work for a few days. You can't take all the blame for what Lin Tai did.

464
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:26,080
It's my fault for overlooking it.

465
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:32,300
But who do you think released that video of Lin Tai?

466
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,659
It was very odd.

467
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:40,540
Indeed, even you can't find out who did it.

468
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,659
It is quite odd.

469
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:47,939
Logically speaking, if an outsider did it, there would be some trace left.

470
00:37:47,939 --> 00:37:51,499
Do you think this person is working at Ocean Hotel?

471
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,140
Why don't I help you look into this matter together?

472
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:05,599
It's a small matter. No need to trouble you.

473
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,020
You should focus on work.

474
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:14,150
I heard the General Manager's Office had arranged a newcomer as your assistant.

475
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,180
What on earth are they thinking?

476
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:20,150
Don't worry. I'll arrange a candidate for you myself.

477
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:24,760
You're always busy. No need to waste time on this small matter.

478
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,719
The newcomer is a woman.

479
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:31,239
Perhaps she's more meticulous.

480
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:33,340
I'll see how it goes first.

481
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,040
Okay.

482
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,060
Zeliang,

483
00:38:40,099 --> 00:38:43,499
you must not lose heart that easily.

484
00:38:43,499 --> 00:38:47,780
I feel assured to have you at the company.

485
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:52,240
I still have many things to learn from you.

486
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:01,760
Stop drinking all the time. Ocean Hotel will be yours in the future.

487
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,579
I'm only managing it for you.

488
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:09,960
Your dad left the hotel to me before he died

489
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,719
because you were too young then.

490
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:15,320
He wanted you to gain more experience.

491
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,460
It's a shame

492
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:23,520
that my brother-in-law passed away too soon.

493
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:27,619
He didn't see you for one last time.

494
00:39:32,979 --> 00:39:35,999
You were the one my dad trusted the most.

495
00:39:37,099 --> 00:39:39,119
It has always been that way.

496
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:47,819
You're right.

497
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:50,480
Your dad is not only my family.

498
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,719
He also discovered my talent.

499
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:55,179
I won't be where I am without him.

500
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,939
Mr. Li, your climbing gears have been repaired.

501
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:06,559
Fancy seeing you here.

502
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:07,999
Hello, Chairman Huo.

503
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,539
Are you still practicing rock climbing?

504
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:19,019
That's perfect. I want to know about rock climbing, too.

505
00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:20,779
Let me see it.

506
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,860
Well, why did you think of repairing your gears?

507
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,079
Didn't you tell me to exercise more?

508
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,059
You know I like rock climbing.

509
00:40:55,059 --> 00:40:59,679
So I told Yingsong to bring out all my rock climbing gears.

510
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:03,700
I didn't know many of my gears were damaged because I hadn't been using them for so long.

511
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,960
So I asked Yingsong to get me some new ones.

512
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,640
I'll be going to the club to start climbing again.

513
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,779
I'm relieved to hear you say that.

514
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:25,559
This painting is really not bad.

515
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:42,880
If you like it, I can give it to you.

516
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:03,760
Yingsong, take down the painting and wrap it for Uncle.

517
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:18,439
No need.

518
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:26,420
I'm your elder. I can't take away what you like.

519
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:30,619
Moreover, even if I like it,

520
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:33,540
I have to hold back.

521
00:42:34,659 --> 00:42:38,320
It's only a painting. No big deal.

522
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,619
All right, then.

523
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:51,900
I'm glad to see that you're okay.

524
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,980
It's getting late. You should get some rest too.

525
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:57,020
I'll be heading back now.

526
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,559
Okay. Thank you, Uncle.

527

528

529

♫  Halfway through the journey on the train,  ♫

534
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:52,390
♫  a new passenger takes a seat  ♫

♫  The bells on the platform are ringing  ♫

♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

542

♫  How's it going with him?  ♫

543

♫  I bet his temper is better than mine  ♫

544

♫  He's better at guessing your complicated thoughts  ♫

545
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,420
♫  Does he hold you when you're sad?  ♫

546
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,400
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

♫  Everything must be going well  ♫

548
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:36,360
♫  Do you want to hear what I haven't said?  ♫

549
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:43,650
♫  Do lyrics of love songs stir up your emotions and recall all of our memories?  ♫

550

♫  You and fate have not given me an answer  ♫

554
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:25,640

555
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:29,440
♫  The wager is who can let go first  ♫

♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

♫  Everything must be going well  ♫

♫  Life is not as complicated as I thought  ♫

559
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:41,690
♫  Silence is the best that I can do  ♫

560
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:44,730
♫  Whatever pain and suffering may come,  ♫

561
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:48,370
♫  I'm not afraid at all  ♫

562
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:58,490
