00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,240
Ladies and gentlemen,

181
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,320
I would like

182
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,879
to use Mr. Shi's party

183
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,759
to make an announcement.

184
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:58,720
Miss Su Xie Yi

185
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,919
is my girlfriend.

186
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,000
Thank you for just now.

187
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,799
Do you have any idea how risky it was?

188
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:47,000
If Chen Heng Sheng finds out,

189
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,600
he'll do anything to eliminate you.

190
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:53,559
So

191
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,840
are you worried about me

192
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,399
or are you testing me?

193
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,840
Su Xie Yi.

194
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,759
Do you want to come clean

195
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:04,159
or do you want me to say it?

196
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,759
Come clean about what?

197
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,600
About who you are.

198
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,320
Who I am?

199
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,679
I want to find out too.

200
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,320
I'll say it then.

201
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:34,320
You can't recognize this photo, can you?

202
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,919
Chestnut.

203
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,600
Does that ring a bell?

204
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,320
I don't know what you're talking about.

205
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:41,120
Good.

206
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,879
Continue your acting.

207
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,000
Su Xie Yi,

208
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,799
you really thought

209
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:46,559
I wouldn't notice
if you faked your amnesia?

210
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,120
You pretended to be amnesiac
and approached me

211
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,919
because you thought

212
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,240
no one else in Ocean Hotel

213
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,840
other than me knows you, right?

214
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,600
What are you trying to say?

215
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:00,000
Unfortunately, Su Xie Yi,

216
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:01,840
you forgot something.

217
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,600
My father

218
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:05,600
has one loyal employer.

219
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,879
He is an old friend

220
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,200
of your parents
from more than two decades ago.

221
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,559
Without him as an

222
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:13,480
eyewitness,

223
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,519
it'll be very hard to find out
that you're

224
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,799
the daughter of Shen Zhi Hong.

225
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:22,840
Fine.

226
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:24,279
Bravo.

227
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:26,200
It seems like you know everything.

228
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:27,600
You must be thinking

229
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:29,879
I'm the culprit who destroyed

230
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,240
your family.

231
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:33,519
So originally,

232
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:34,360
you approached me

233
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,519
to investigate me?

234
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:37,120
Of course.

235
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:38,759
Tell me.

236
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,039
That day when my father died,

237
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:43,000
what were you doing on the rooftop?

238
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,080
You saw everything?

239
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:49,720
So you pretended to be amnesiac

240
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:50,679
to get close to me.

241
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:52,519
Why?

242
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,559
You think I'm the killer

243
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:56,240
who will throw you off a building too?

244
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,399
Go ahead.

245
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,440
I would love to see your true face

246
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,759
before I die.

247
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,919
The truth was already

248
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:04,160
announced by the police.

249
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,920
Shen Zhi Hong committed suicide.

250
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,200
I only believe what I saw.

251
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,359
So I'm asking you

252
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,119
what did you do that day

253
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,000
on the rooftop?

254
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:38,839
Once I received the news,

255
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,200
I rushed to the spot.

256
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:43,599
But I was too late.

257
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,559
Mr. Shen!

258
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,119
I wanted to save him.

259
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:11,759
I was so close.

260
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:23,960
Su Xie Yi.

261
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,960
You think you're the only one suffering?

262
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,799
You know,

263
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:29,200
for the last two years,

264
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,799
that scene

265
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,480
has also been my nightmare.

266
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:44,880
Explain the contract to me then.

267
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,559
I read through

268
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:48,039
the contract

269
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:49,079
in my father's mailbox.

270
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,920
But on the day of signing,

271
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:52,920
the liquidated damages went up tenfold.

272
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,279
Ocean Hotel

273
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:55,640
made my father sign

274
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,240
an unconscionable contract.

275
00:18:57,759 --> 00:18:58,519
Sorry.

276
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:02,799
I wasn't there

277
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:03,880
when the contract was signed.

278
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,240
So

279
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,839
I've also been investigating

280
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:09,240
the truth behind it.

281
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:10,839
I found that contract

282
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:12,000
in the archive.

283
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,200
You weren't the signer.

284
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:17,279
And the date of signature

285
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,279
was when we were on the mountaintop.

286
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,890
(Chen Heng Sheng)

287
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,160
So

288
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,359
am I still a suspect?

289
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,519
Before the truth

290
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,319
resurfaces,

291
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:41,759
everyone in Ocean Hotel is a suspect.

292
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,519
But

293
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,920
I will believe you more than others.

294
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:10,599
Why were you at the party today?

295
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,599
I attended the party

296
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,960
to find Chen Heng Sheng.

297
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,720
He signed the contract.

298
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:19,519
He definitely knows the truth.

299
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,880
What did you find?

300
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:22,920
I saw

301
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,119
him talking to someone.

302
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:26,160
Something about

303
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:27,839
they want to use

304
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:29,400
wine and art objects to make money.

305
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,079
Su Xie Yi,

306
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,440
this is Ocean Hotel's internal issue.

307
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:37,799
Please don't meddle

308
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:38,640
in this business anymore.

309
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:39,599
Fine.

310
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,000
I won't meddle

311
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:43,400
in Ocean Hotel's business

312
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,079
but you can't meddle

313
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,119
in my private business either.

314
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:49,039
But you need to keep me in the loop

315
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:49,839
at least

316
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:51,279
so that I'll know if I should

317
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:52,480
stop or help you.

318
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,160
If you want to help me,

319
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,559
drink with me.

320
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:58,160
So many things

321
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,079
were buried in my heart.

322
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,880
It feels amazing to vent.

323
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,440
Isn't it the same for you?

324
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,160
(Hello.)

325
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,839
(The number you have dialed)

326
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,240
(is currently unavailable.)

327
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,359
(Please try again later.)

328
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:26,079
Miss Su Xie Yi

329
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,440
is my girlfriend.

330
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,500
(Xie Yi)

331
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,119
You believe me

332
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,160
just because

333
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,000
the one who signed the contract

334
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,279
wasn't me?

335
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:11,559
That's not all.

336
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,400
It's also because of

337
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:15,799
that day and night

338
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,720
and

339
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:19,119
that photo of the starry night sky

340
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,160
and Chestnut!

341
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,799
I didn't actually lie to you

342
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,480
about being amnesiac.

343
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:34,359
I witness my father

344
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,640
die in front of me.

345
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,000
It's very hard to accept the truth.

346
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,200
For half a year,

347

how great it'd be if I lost my memory.

She's at the party

378

and you didn't know?

379
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:42,920
Sorry, Mr. Huo.

380
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,680
Last night,

381
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,480
my father's condition deteriorated

382
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,279
so I went to the hospital.

383
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,000
What a filial son you are.

384
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:52,880
It is negligence on my part.

385
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,759
But don't worry, Mr. Huo.

386
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,920
I will guarantee you

387
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,480
that I will quit everything else 

388
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,400
just to keep an eye on her.

389
00:24:57,799 --> 00:24:58,279
Leave.

390
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:01,720
Okay.

391
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:20,559
Do you truly believe that Su Xie Yi

392
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,200
was having a date
with Li Ze Liang at the party?

393
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,480
What do you think about that art piece?

394
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,640
It's good.

395
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,880
But it's a counterfeit.

396
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:37,920
What's fake can never be true.

397
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,920
Observe patiently.

398
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,680
The flaw will reveal itself.

399
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:00,680
You're awake.

400
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,480
Go wash up yourself.

401
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,119
I bought you a new toothbrush.

402
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,920
Once you're done, have breakfast.

403
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,599
Okay.

404
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,119
I know

405
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:39,400
you just came back from abroad

406
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,279
so

407
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:43,160
I made something western.

408
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:46,839
Sit here.

409
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,200
Have a glass of milk.

410
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,799
It's easier on your stomach.

411
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,960
You're too nice.

412
00:26:59,039 --> 00:26:59,880
Are you sending me away

413
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,200
after I finish this meal?

414
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,920
I would love to

415
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:05,880
but now is not a good time.

416
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:07,920
Don't forget

417
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:10,039
you're also now

418
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,640
my girlfriend.

419
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,200
That's easy.

420
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,319
Just dump me again.

421
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:18,680
Or I can dump you.

422
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,839
It can work

423
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,440
but

424
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:25,119
if we break up

425
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,440
straight after we go public,

426
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,359
people will get suspicious.

427
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:31,720
Let's act for a few more days then.

428
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,680
After all,

429
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,039
we have been acting
in front of each other.

430
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,400
Well...

431
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,920
I was quite hammered yesterday.

432
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:47,440
Did I say something?

433
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:48,559
Yes.

434
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,759
What did I say?

435
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,920
You said something

436
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,440
that you'll definitely regret

437
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:58,640
if you make me

438
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,000
say it out loud now.

439
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:01,559
Enough.

440
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:02,680
Good.

441
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,119
I don't want to know.

442
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,880
They are not that important.

443
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,119
Okay then.

444
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:12,039
Let's forget about yesterday then.

445
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:14,119
Let's talk about our future.

446
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,319
At the moment,

447
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:17,839
we have to

448
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:18,559
keep pretending

449
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,640
to be a couple.

450
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:22,440
Don't worry.

451
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,960
I will work with you.

452
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:27,400
Don't make it sound like you are forced.

453
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:29,559
It is I who have to assist you.

454
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,720
However,

455
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,640
I will continue my investigation.

456
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,640
What?

457
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:39,799
Feeling guilty?

458
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,160
You can continue

459
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:48,119
but you have to promise me

460
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,519
that whatever you do,

461
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:52,279
you have to inform me beforehand.

462
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:55,640
I can inform you

463
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,759
but please

464
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:58,200
don't be a hindrance.

465
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,720
To our deal.

466
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,000
Just a kind reminder from me.

467
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,960
In the office, everyone

468
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,960
will have their eyes on us.

469
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,559
Make sure your performance
is believable.

470
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,240
You too.

471
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,000
Is it delicious?

472
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:33,880
Not bad.

473
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Which one do you like?

474
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,480
I like the waffles.

475
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,039
How do you know

476
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,079
I like waffles?

477
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,160
You said it last night.

478
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:52,720
For real?

479
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,079
Of course.

480
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:55,720
It's on the internet.

481
00:29:57,079 --> 00:29:58,440
What are you guys
talking about so early?

482
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:00,119
You don't know?

483
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,559
What?

484
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:02,839
Xie Yi and Mr. Li are an item now.

485
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,119
For real?

486
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:06,759
You still can't see it?

487
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,079
That haute couture dress

488
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:09,440
is a gift from Mr. Li.

489
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,640
Morning.

490
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,039
I bought you guys coffee.

491
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,920
No need, Xie Yi.

492
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:14,680
We should take turns

493
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,920
buying coffee.

494
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:17,200
Take turns? No.

495
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,200
It'll be my treat now.

496
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:20,000
No need to be shy.

497
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:20,880
Come.

498
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,839
Your coffee.

499
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:23,039
Thanks.

500
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,279
Your coffee.

501
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:34,759
Sugar with milk.

502
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,079
Thanks, Xie Yi.

503
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,279
What's the matter?

504
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:42,240
Well,

505
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,559
Xie Yi.

506
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:44,799
I used to bad-mouth

507
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,839
Mr. Li in front of you.

508
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,079
Please don't take them to heart.

509
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:50,880
All of us

510
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,759
look up to him, actually.

511
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,599
But you know me, I speak before I think.

512
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:55,599
Please forgive me.

513
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,640
It's okay.

514
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,559
It's not like you're wrong about him.

515
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,880
He does

516
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:01,359
have a poker face.

517
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,880
But I like it.

518
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:05,920
What do you like?

519
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:07,599
Miss Yi.

520
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,440
What?

521
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,720
I can't listen to gossips now?

522
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:14,920
Xie Yi.

523
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,400
I was there when he made

524
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,200
the announcement yesterday.

525
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:20,799
Congratulations.

526
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:22,640
Thank you.

527
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:24,640
However,

528
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,680
I'm curious.

529
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,400
How did you make Mr. Li

530
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:29,559
fall in love with you?

531
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:30,720
I'm curious too.

532
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,079
Me too.

533
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:31,680
What did you do?

534
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,559
Tell us what happened.

535
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,160
How?

536
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,079
Well...

537
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,759
Uncle.

538
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:40,599
Xie Yi asked me to bring you this

539
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:42,279
because she wants you to have a taste.

540
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:43,960
How thoughtful of her.

541
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:46,839
Uncle.

542
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,720
Since I publicly announced

543
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,599
my relationship with her,

544
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:51,759
I hope

545
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,640
you can do us a favor.

546
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:54,720
Why?

547
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,039
You want her back?

548
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,279
I have tons

549
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,960
of things to take care of in my office.

550
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,240
Xie Yi has learned a lot

551
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,119
in the General Manager's Office.

552
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,640
She should be able to help me
in that regard.

553
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,559
Sure.

554
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:09,759
It's not like

555
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:10,880
she has started here officially anyway.

556
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,200
Thanks, Uncle.

557
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:15,680
But Ze Liang,

558
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:17,279
why didn't

559
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:18,319
you tell me earlier

560
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:19,160
that Su Xie Yi

561
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,079
is your girlfriend?

562
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:23,359
Xie Yi and I

563
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,759
used to date each other two years ago.

564
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:26,880
And this time,

565
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,759
she wants to rekindle our relationship.

566
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:31,680
I also decided quite recently

567
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,359
to give us a fresh start.

568
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:37,160
I didn't know
there was more to your story.

569
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,559
But Ze Liang,

570
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,400
I know that two years ago,

571
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,839
Miss Su was diagnosed with

572
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:47,359
amnesia.

573
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:49,440
Has she recovered from it?

574
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,279
I know several

575
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,319
renowned psychiatrists.

576
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,279
If you need them,

577
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:55,880
I can introduce them to you.

578
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,000
Thanks, Uncle.

579
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:00,000
There's no need for that.

580
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,839
Xie Yi has made full recovery.

581
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:03,039
That's why

582
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:05,200
she came back to find me.

583
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,640
She

584
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,880
has sacrificed a lot for me.

585
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:12,200
Did she apply to Ocean Hotel for you?

586
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,000
It's just one of the things she did.

587
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,440
Also, I need to

588
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:22,839
tell you about something.

589
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,160
What thing?

590
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,400
Xie Yi confided to me

591
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,559
that she's behind

592
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:31,240
the video scandal.

593
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,440
When she was staying in the hotel,

594
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,720
she noticed something suspicious

595
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:35,680
about Mr. Lin.

596
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,559
And it's

597
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,079
something
that will tarnish my reputation

598
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,799
so in a fit of rage,

599
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,839
she did what she did.

600
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,119
She did it?

601
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:56,880
She's that reckless.

602
00:33:57,319 --> 00:33:57,960
Which is why

603
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,039
I broke up with her.

604
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,440
She did a great job.

605
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,000
A parasite like Lin Tai

606
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:05,260
should have been eliminated earlier on.

607
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,860
Thank you for understanding, Uncle.

608
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,199
But Ze Liang,

609
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,800
how did Su Xie Yi

610
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,519
and you meet?

611
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,239
It might sound preposterous.

612
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,000
I was rock-climbing back then.

613
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,599
When I almost reached the top,

614
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:30,960
she almost

615
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:33,599
pushed me off the cliff.

616
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,000
What?

617
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,320
You thought Mr. Li

618
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,239
was a wild boar?

619
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,639
That's ridiculous.

620
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,159
Yes.

621
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,320
But when I noticed
how good-looking he was,

622
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:45,840
I decided not to let him go.

623
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:46,840
And then?

624
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:47,480
And then...

625
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,039
And then

626
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,440
I find an excuse

627
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,800
to make him stay.

628
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,519
We admired the night sky

629
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,960
and took a lot of photos.

630
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,239
Taking photos under a starry sky?

631
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,920
That's so romantic!

632
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,880
I want to look at the photos.

633
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,079
Do you guys want to look at the photos?

634
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:04,599
- Yes.
- Yes.

635
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,480
I do have the photos

636
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,559
but

637
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:10,840
you asked for it, okay?

638
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,679
This looks like the poster
for a romantic drama!

639
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,119
So romantic.

640
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,599
So romantic.

641
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,559
Yes.

642
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:35,159
He did go rock-climbing that day.

643
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,000
And he looked very different

644
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:37,960
from now

645
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,840
two years ago.

646
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,119
Their love story

647
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:44,320
is identical,

648
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:46,199
even the details.

649
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,159
In that case,

650
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,280
joining Ocean Hotel,

651
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,679
going to his place,

652
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,840
and ousting Lin Tai

653
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,519
all make sense now.

654
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,280
But I still feel something's off.

655
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,400
Why?

656
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,840
Because it's too logical.

657
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:10,480
The calmer the sea,

658
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,679
the more ferocious the current.

659
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,280
I still don't know

660
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,880
the other facade

661
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,599
of my nephew

662
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,800
when I'm not around.

663
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:27,800
You're saying he wanted

664
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,400
Su Xie Yi back?

665
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,840
I don't have a strong reason
to keep her.

666
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:33,440
Right.

667
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:36,800
We just need to be patient.

668
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:39,360
The flaw

669
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,480
will reveal itself.

670
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:44,639
Just keep looking.

671
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,079
Noted.

672
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,280
I ruined your birthday yesterday.

673
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,599
Sorry.

674
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,400
You and her...

675
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:11,119
When did it happen?

676
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,519
Two years ago.

677
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:23,760
That's good.

678
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,960
You found yourself a relationship
that suits you.

679
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:27,519
I'm happy for you.

680
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,199
But you never told

681
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,800
Oscar and I.

682
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,199
Are we not good enough for you?

683
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:35,920
Chu Chu.

684
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,000
I'm sure you know

685
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,320
Oscar and you

686
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,519
are my two best friends.

687
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:40,480
I never wanted

688
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:42,039
to hide anything from you two.

689
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:43,679
It's just that

690
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:47,760
you know

691
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,599
how I've been for the past two years.

692
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,360
A relationship wasn't

693
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,199
what I wanted.

694
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,440
So

695
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,559
you asked me to fire her last time

696
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:00,119
because you were worried
that it might affect your work

697
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,199
or was it something else?

698
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,000
You know,

699
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,639
it's an office romance.

700
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,519
We have to be more cautious.

701
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,480
Right.

702
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:14,280
I'll accept this explanation.

703
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,599
But the way

704
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:18,639
and the place you made your announcement

705
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,960
pissed me off.

706
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,840
I'm sorry,

707
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:26,760
Miss Shi.

708
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,199
I apologize to you once more.

709
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,639
I didn't know

710
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:30,960
it would turn out like this.

711
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:33,480
If it's an apology,

712
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:35,079
it still lacks sincerity.

713
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,239
All right then.

714
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,840
Every year, we gather around

715
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,840
and have a meal for your birthday.

716
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:39,800
I ruined

717
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,079
the mood for you yesterday.

718
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:42,719
I'll make up for you.

719
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:44,599
Since we're already here anyway,

720
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,639
let's have lunch together?

721
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,480
Sure.

722
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,230
(Lunch together?)

723
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:59,070
(Su Xie Yi)

724
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:02,440
(No, thanks.)

725
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,270
(Li Ze Liang)

726
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,519
(Emergency!)

727
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:08,920
(If I have lunch with this bunch)

728
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,599
(of nosy colleagues,)

729
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,159
(my soul will leave my body.)

730
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:21,400
(Deal with it yourself.)

731
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,039
If you're busy, we can pick another day.

732
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:28,280
I just realized

733
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,559
I have a video conference.

734
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,679
Okay then.

735
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,039
Do your work.

736
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,280
I'll make up for you next time.

737
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,719
Why are you this late?

738
00:39:58,119 --> 00:39:58,719
Didn't we agree

739
00:39:58,719 --> 00:39:59,599
to have lunch together at noon?

740
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:01,280
Let's have Japanese.

741
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:02,719
The Japanese restaurant below the hotel

742
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,440
is pretty good.

743
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:04,440
Let's go.

744
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:06,639
Sure.

745
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,559
Anything you like.

746
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,280
I'm off for lunch.

747
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:12,199
Bye.

748
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:14,920
Let's go.

749
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:23,599
Please understand my predicament.

750
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,199
I've been explaining

751
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:25,239
to them for the entire morning.

752
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:26,320
My throat is parched.

753
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:27,320
If I have lunch

754
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,400
with them this noon,

755
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,039
my jaw will dislocate.

756
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:33,079
You have to deal with it.

757
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:34,360
No.

758
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,159
They bombard me with so many questions.

759
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,719
What if I slipped
and said something wrong?

760
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,960
Your body language

761
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,719
suggests that we're strangers.

762
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,880
Please change it.

763
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,599
Excuse me.

764
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:50,679
Here. Thanks.

765
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:53,960
Your food has been served. Bon appetit.

766
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,400
Thanks.

767
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:57,159
I don't like foie gras.

768
00:40:57,519 --> 00:40:59,159
Me neither.

769
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,559
But it's in the lunch set.

770
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,519
We have to make do.

771
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,639
When it comes to food,

772
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:03,840
I never make do.

773
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:06,880
What a coincidence.

774
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:07,719
Uncle.

775
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,519
Mr. Huo.

776
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,000
I mean... Uncle.

777
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:14,159
Care to join us?

778
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,320
Please do.

779
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:16,599
No.

780
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,639
I wouldn't want

781
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:18,280
to disrupt

782
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,360
your romantic lunch.

783
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,480
Please, sit down.

784
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,480
Let's sit.

785
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:23,679
Ze Liang.

786
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:25,320
I thought you never

787
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,239
liked foie gras.

788
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,320
Xie Yi ordered it.

789
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:32,599
She loves it.

790
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,599
Right?

791
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:39,719
I'm too old

792
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,880
for this.

793
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:42,320
Enjoy your lunch.

794
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:45,320
Delicious?

795
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,039
Didn't I say

796
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:47,679
I don't like foie gras?

797
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:50,800
Huo Jian is here

798
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,920
to spy on us.

799
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,280
Can't you see it?

800
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:54,719
Fine.

801
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:55,880
In that case,

802
00:41:56,199 --> 00:41:57,079
I'll return you the same favor.

803
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,559
Delicious?

804
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,599
Very.

805
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,559
Very delicious.

806
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,480
Here, Xie Yi.

807
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,599
Okra, your favorite.

808
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,519
I'll have to disappoint you.

809
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:26,360
I am not afraid of spicy food.

810
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,280
What are you doing?

811
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,159
Come, Ze Liang.

812
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:52,400
You crossed a line.

813
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:09,239
Ze Liang.

814
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,719
It's just a piece of sushi.

815
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,480
No need to get so emotional.

816
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:15,320
Stop crying.

817
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,280
Stupid wasabi.

818
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:42,880
It's so spicy.

819
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:47,760
(Art objects)

820
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,199
are also another gold mine.

821
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:50,719
I have booked an appointment
with Mr. Qin

822
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,719
from Pinxuan Art Gallery.

823
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:52,960
I'll meet him

824
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,800
at 3 PM tomorrow.

825
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,519
One hour and a half left.

826
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:04,320
