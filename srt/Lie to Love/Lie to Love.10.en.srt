00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:03,959
(Mr. Li.)

20
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,319
(Good thing you had me follow Miss Su.)

21
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,040
(Indeed, someone is on her tail.)

22
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,599
Where is she now?

23
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,719
Don't worry.

24
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,120
Miss Su and Mr. Xie

25
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,159
are on their way back to the city.

26
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,000
She's safe now.

27
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,479
You mean Xie Ming Hao?

28
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,520
(That's right.)

29
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:16,840
Did you get a clear view

30
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,710
of the person who's following her?

31
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:18,570
(Rehabilitation Center)

32
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,039
(He was wearing a mask.
I couldn't get a good look.)

33
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,080
(Should I investigate it?)

34
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:25,759
It's fine.

35
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,039
It's probably Huo Jian's guy.

36
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,400
Xie Ming Hao?

37
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,199
Xie Yi.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,919
You staying in the hotel

39
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:42,759
isn't a long-term solution.

40
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,520
I'll find you a new place.

41
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:45,879
You can move in

42
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,759
after you return
from your business trip.

43
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,159
Thanks, Ming Hao.

44
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:49,879
It's hard enough

45
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,039
having to take care of my sister.

46
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,639
Don't worry about me.

47
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,759
Why are you being such a stranger?

48
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,960
Uncle Shen had supported me.

49
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,439
He was like a father to me.

50
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,159
Even without Xie Qing,

51
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,639
I should take care of you too.

52
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,840
Is there anything urgent?

53
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,520
It's Li Ze Liang.

54
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:21,680
He told me to return to the hotel

55
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,680
before dark.

56
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,360
For a fake boyfriend,

57
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,599
he seems so immersed in his role.

58
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:29,719
He's only doing it for my own good.

59
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,159
Besides,

60
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:32,840
if he hadn't helped me

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,120
with Mr. Lin's incident,

62
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,039
who knows

63
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:35,879
what would have happened?

64
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:37,919
That's right.

65
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,599
I should really thank him for that.

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,800
Ming Hao.

67
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,199
Thanks for giving me a ride.

68
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,800
I'll get going now.

69
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:02,840
Go on.

70
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,439
Slow down.

71
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,599
Don't run so fast.

72
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:13,599
I know!

73
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:22,800
Mr. Li.

74
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,399
We meet again.

75
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,279
Mr. Xie, thank you

76
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,920
for sending my girlfriend back.

77
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,800
But next time,

78
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,879
just give me a call will do.

79
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,519
There's no need to trouble you.

80
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,000
Mr. Li.

81
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,160
You and I both know

82
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,199
Xie Yi

83
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,279
is just your girlfriend in name.

84
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,120
Even so,

85
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,480
that still makes her my girlfriend.

86
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:49,959
Just like you.

87
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:51,040
You're her brother-in-law

88
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,519
only in name.

89
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,920
That still makes you her brother-in-law.

90
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:00,879
Mr. Li.

91
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,399
Xie Yi is going on a business trip
to Yunfeng.

92
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:05,399
I hope the incidents like the one
with Mr. Lin

93
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,720
won't happen again.

94
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,759
If anything happens to Xie Yi,

95
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,839
I'm not going

96
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,800
to let the matter drop.

97
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:11,839
Don't worry.

98
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,279
Xie Yi is my special assistant

99
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,639
and also my girlfriend.

100
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,319
I'll take good care of her.

101
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:18,680
Let's hope so.

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,079
These are photos taken from today.

103
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,120
Why does this girl

104
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,079
look so familiar?

105
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,360
Her name is Shen Xie Qing.

106
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,360
That guy is called Xie Ming Hao.

107
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,199
That's right.

108
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,800
It's her.

109
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,480
Shen Zhi Hong's daughter.

110
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:00,920
If so,

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,120
it's not surprising

112
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,360
that Xie Ming Hao shows up here.

113
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,480
They were previously engaged.

114
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,040
I've looked into it.

115
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,839
Shen Xie Qing was admitted
to the hospital

116
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,240
because of a mental disorder.

117
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,040
She disappeared after Zhiwei
went bankrupt

118
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,360
two years ago.

119
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,279
And now, she shows up out of nowhere.

120
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,319
Su Xie Yi even went to see her.

121
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:27,879
Keep digging.

122
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:31,040
Make sure
you get to the bottom of things.

123
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,519
This is a counterfeit painting.

124
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,600
Please discard it for me.

125
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:42,959
Mr. Li.

126
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,240
It took me a lot of effort

127
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,279
to find the co-worker

128
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:45,959
he used to work with.

129
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,160
I found out from him

130
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:47,959
that Liu Ah Wei

131
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,399
engaged in such a dangerous job

132
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,160
entirely for his daughter.

133
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,040
His daughter has a hearing impairment.

134
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:55,160
Is it?

135
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,199
That's right.

136
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,680
According to his co-worker,

137
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,519
he has been talking about a hospital

138
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,439
that specializes
in this type of surgery.

139
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:04,040
But the surgery and the cochlear implant

140
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,240
require a lot of money.

141
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:05,920
He's been worrying

142
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,920
about how to pay off the medical bills.

143
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:08,319
Did you

144
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,600
find out the name of this hospital?

145
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,120
Yes.

146
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,959
He kept talking about it
to his co-worker.

147
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,920
So he remembers the name.

148
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,040
But he disappeared after that.

149
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,480
So we have no idea

150
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,439
if the surgery was done.

151
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:20,480
Perhaps

152
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,240
we should stop

153
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,319
looking.

154
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,600
You mean...

155
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,000
Huo Jian has been looking for so long,

156
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,720
but he didn't find him.

157
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:33,240
It shows that the hope of finding him

158
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,439
is very slim.

159
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,639
We can change our method.

160
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,600
Like

161
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,879
starting with
the cochlear implant surgery.

162
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,439
Are you saying
that he really did take his daughter

163
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,720
to have this surgery?

164
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,199
At least, there's a possibility.

165
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,480
If so, where did he get the money
for it?

166
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:48,839
I did ask around.

167
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,680
This surgery and cochlear implant

168
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,800
require hundreds of thousands.

169
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,800
Imported ones

170
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,600
will be even more expensive.

171
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,240
What if Liu Ah Wei

172
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,480
suddenly has the money

173
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,879
to get this surgery done
for his daughter?

174
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,600
In that case,

175
00:07:59,319 --> 00:07:59,920
his disappearance

176
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,120
will make sense now.

177
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,920
Could it be possible
that he saw something

178
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,759
and used it as a bargaining chip
to extort money?

179
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,279
That will require some digging

180
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,040
before we can be certain.

181
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,639
Understood.

182
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,319
Ying Song, how about this?

183
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,079
Get in touch with that hospital.

184
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,239
I'm willing to donate a sum of money
to them

185
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,199
to set up a special fund

186
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,040
to help children who go to the hospital

187
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,519
for cochlear surgery,

188
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,360
especially those families

189
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,399
with bad financial conditions.

190
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,439
That's great.

191
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,600
Not only can we do our part

192
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,800
to help those children,

193
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,920
but we can also find out

194
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,039
if Liu Ah Wei 
did take his daughter there

195
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,159
to have the surgery done.

196
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:34,360
Remember.

197
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,440
Don't make the donation in Ocean's name

198
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,159
or my name.

199
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,200
Understood.

200
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:50,980
(Yunfeng Hotel)

201
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,320
Hi, Mr. Li.

202
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,120
I'm Li Fei,
Mr. Chen's special assistant.

203
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,039
We just received news

204
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,960
that you would arrive earlier.

205
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,399
Mr. Chen will be right here.

206
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,679
How about this?

207
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,759
Get someone

208
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,519
to deliver the luggage to the room.

209
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,679
We're going to look around.

210
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:20,759
All right.

211
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,879
(Xie Yi, stand here. Don't move.)

212
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,919
(I'll hold it for you, all right?)

213
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:48,360
(Okay.)

214
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,960
(Xie Qing, be careful.)

215
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,600
(I know. Don't move.)

216
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,200
(Xie Qing, you're awesome!)

217
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:16,120
This place

218
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,240
is well laid out.

219
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,720
When the building was built,

220
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,360
my dad

221
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,799
personally designed the landscape.

222
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,080
He had a great love
for flowers and trees.

223
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,240
So the plants here

224
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,480
were selected with care.

225
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,480
Indeed,

226
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,639
Uncle Shen had a really great taste.

227
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,600
Fortunately, this place
wasn't demolished

228
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,559
during the renovation

229
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,960
of the Yunfeng Hotel.

230
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:37,159
If not,

231
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,240
we wouldn't get to see this now.

232
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,159
(The wines at Yunfeng)

233
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,799
(have always been
our major source of earnings.)

234
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,879
(The proceeds are highly stable.)

235
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:56,399
What's the matter?

236
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,159
Have a drink with me.

237
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,200
Isn't it a little early for a drink now?

238
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,240
Let's pick one bottle.

239
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,600
This.

240
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,080
Mr. Li.

241
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,559
Mr. Chen.

242
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,720
Welcome.

243
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,039
Why didn't you tell me

244
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:30,039
that you were coming earlier?

245
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,159
We didn't even prepare

246
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,919
for the welcome ceremony.

247
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,840
Speaking of which,

248
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:33,759
that was the reason 

249
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,039
why I didn't want to give prior notice.

250
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:36,519
Understood.

251
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,679
We're just chilling out here

252
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:39,600
and having a drink.

253
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:40,919
Miss Su.

254
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,600
You sure

255
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:47,879
have a unique taste.

256
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,519
That bottle of wine you picked

257
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:50,879
is indeed a good wine.

258
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:52,159
But

259
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,600
unfortunately,

260
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:54,440
it's a bad vintage.

261
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,120
So it tastes slightly inferior.

262
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,399
I think given Mr. Li's status,

263
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,020
you'll be more particular about this.

264
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,159
Besides,

265
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,159
this is the first time

266
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,759
the two of you have come here.

267
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,840
We should prepare

268
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,759
better wines for you.

269
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:10,679
It's okay, Mr. Chen.

270
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,360
We're just

271
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:13,679
having a casual drink

272
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:14,600
to quench our thirst.

273
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,240
Even so,

274
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:19,000
Mr. Li is different

275
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,519
from other people.

276
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:21,480
Isn't it, Mr. Li?

277
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:26,919
You're right, Mr. Chen.

278
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:29,279
Indeed, this bottle of wine

279
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,200
isn't of the best vintage.

280
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,559
Never mind.

281
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,200
How about this?

282
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,600
I'll get you two

283
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,720
a good wine

284
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:38,080
as a welcoming reception.

285
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:38,879
It's okay.

286
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,240
We're here for work.

287
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:42,639
I want

288
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,679
to hold a meeting at once.

289
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:44,600
Mr. Chen.

290
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,519
Please see to it.

291
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,240
You sure are a man of action, Mr. Li.

292
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,440
All right then.

293
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,440
I'll leave you two alone.

294
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:52,840
I'll get them to prepare it at once.

295
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,679
Go on.

296
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,720
Everyone.

297
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,600
You must have heard some stories

298
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,120
about me.

299
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,919
Those rumors aren't fake,

300
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,519
but they aren't entirely true.

301
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,320
For some reason,

302
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,120
I didn't involve myself too much
in the group's operation.

303
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,279
But this is different.

304
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,039
I came to Yunfeng

305
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:29,559
to host Fujiade Auction.

306
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,000
It's a must to make it a success.

307
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,039
Yunfeng is a subsidiary of Ocean.

308
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:39,320
The success of this auction

309
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:40,559
will directly

310
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:41,600
affect Ocean's reputation.

311
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,840
Should anything go wrong,

312
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,720
I won't be able

313
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:47,919
to protect any of you

314
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,879
even as the deputy general manager
of Ocean.

315
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:51,879
Of course.

316
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,200
With your help

317
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,440
and support,

318
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:58,039
I believe this auction

319
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,279
will be a success.

320
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:02,679
After all, no one knows Yunfeng

321
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,039
better than you.

322
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,240
So I don't care

323
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,240
how you did things back then

324
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,159
or whose order you took.

325
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:16,240
I hope from this moment on

326
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:18,080
you'll understand

327
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,879
what you should do

328
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:23,000
and whose order you should follow.

329
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:29,960
Any objection?

330
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,399
- No.
- No.

331
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,080
Very well.

332
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:35,440
The brochure in front of you

333
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,440
is the introduction to the lot

334
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:37,519
in this auction.

335
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:39,039
Go back

336
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:39,639
and study it.

337
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,399
All right.

338
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:48,200
If there's nothing else,

339
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:49,799
I won't keep you any longer.

340
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,960
Dismissed.

341
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,240
Here, this way, please.

342
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,679
I was fortunate enough

343
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:58,919
to witness the romantic moments

344
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,720
between Mr. Li and Miss Su
at the reception.

345
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,360
It makes people green with envy.

346
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:03,679
So

347
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,960
I specially prepared
this honeymoon suite

348
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,000
for the two of you.

349
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,559
I hope you'll like it.

350
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:11,440
Xie Yi.

351
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:12,519
Look

352
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,360
how thoughtful Mr. Chen is.

353
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,600
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

354
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:17,679
It's what I do.

355
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:20,039
Well, I shall leave you be.

356
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,120
Call me if you need anything.

357
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,120
This way.

358
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,000
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

359
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:25,000
Come on.

360
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:25,840
Let's go.

361
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:35,799
Chen Heng Sheng

362
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,159
is a sly old fox.

363
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,919
Honeymoon suite, huh?

364
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,679
He's obviously trying to feel us out.

365
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,840
Don't say that.

366
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,279
He's quite thoughtful.

367
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,720
Look, this bed

368
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,080
is so beautifully prepared.

369
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,080
I couldn't bring myself
to lie down on it.

370
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:54,440
What are you doing?

371
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,320
The reason they put us

372
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,480
in a room

373
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,039
is to find out

374
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,679
if we're a real couple

375
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:00,840
or a fake one.

376
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:02,399
Then,

377
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,440
they'll use housekeeping as the pretext

378
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:04,440
to look for evidence.

379
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,320
Good thing I came prepared.

380
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,519
I want this room

381
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:10,759
to be filled with the breath of love.

382
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:20,559
Brilliant.

383
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,510
(How to win a woman's/men's heart?)
Done!

384
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:38,600
I'm used to sleeping in a big bed
since I was a kid.

385
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:39,960
You have to let me take the bed.

386
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:41,879
Well,

387
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,960
I've never slept on a couch.

388
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,120

389
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:45,759
But I'm a girl.

390
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:46,799
Men and women are equal.

391
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,480
How about this?

392
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,000
Whoever touches the bed first wins.

393
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,879

any notice

00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:46,920

removed from the shelves.

is for the auction.

Everyone in the company

454
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:02,759
has their eyes set on him.

455
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,079
He won't create unnecessary problems.

456
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:07,839
What worries me

457
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:10,400
is the girl beside him, Su Xie Yi.

458
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,920
She's quite smart.

459
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,960
You should guard against her.

460
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:15,720
Yes.

461
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:17,000
She almost

462
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,079
got me into trouble today.

463
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:20,400
Don't forget.

464
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,039
They are the guests.

Since they are here,

469
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,799
we have to show them great hospitality.

470
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,960
All right. I'm on it right now.

471

472

Why?

474
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:04,440
To write on the invitation cards.

475
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,359
Haven't all the invitation cards
been printed?

476
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,599
It's too stylized.

477
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,480
I want to include
some handwritten wishes.

478
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:13,720
Good thinking.

479
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
But

480
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:16,880
how's your handwriting?

481
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:17,799
Is it okay?

482
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:19,839
If I had no confidence to even do this,

483
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:21,400
how would I dare

484
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:23,119
to become Mr. Li's assistant?

485
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:25,720
Give it to me.

486
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,640
This pen is...

487
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,039
It was a gift from my dad

488
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,799
the year I was enrolled at the college.

489

493
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:46,240
You don't believe me?

494
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:49,119
You can test me.

495
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,759
You talk, and I'll write.

496

I'll talk,

499
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,880
and you write.

500
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,750
"I want to live with you."

Where are you going?

518
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,200
Wait for me.

519
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:34,640
What are you doing?

520
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:35,640
Let me ask you.

521
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:37,720
Two years ago,

522
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:39,039
what was your first impression

523
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,759
of me?

524
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,160
First impression?

525
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:46,079
My heart was racing.

526
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:48,640
We were hanging on the cliff.

527
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:50,200
Whose heart wouldn't be racing?

528
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:51,720
You?

529
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,680
It was different for me.

530
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:57,960
Were you not afraid?

531
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:01,359
I fell in love.

532
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:14,480
To be honest,

533
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:16,079
in the past two years or so,

534
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,000
I often recalled

535
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,640
what happened that night.

536
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,160
It was like playing a movie.

537
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,240
Right now,

538
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:28,319
I still remember that evening,

539
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,519
the starry sky,

540
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,079
and also

541
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:37,119
your smile under the starry sky.

542
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,119
You described everything
in vivid detail.

543
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:02,599
It's been two years already.

544
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,319
After some time,

545
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:06,279
you might come to realize

546
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:08,119
that it was just

547
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:09,720
an insignificant moment

548
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,000
over the course

549
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:11,759
of our lives.

550
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:14,440
But sometimes,

551
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,559
a moment might be short,

552
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,279
but it's long enough
to illuminate a lifetime.

553
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:49,119
You know what?

554
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,119
To me,

555
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,559
that night

556
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,720
was such a moment.

557
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,130
♪I need you. I love you♪

558
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:10,830
♪I'll brave the waves for you♪

559

♪You don't need to act tough.

you feel like crying♪

563
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,040

564
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,119
What are you doing?

565
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:56,440
I...

566
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,960
I...

567
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,079
I'm having a toothache.

568
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:07,960
Su Xie Yi.

569
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:09,480
Calm down.

570
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,279
Calm down.

571
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,519
Did he just confess to me?

572
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:20,279
Why did I run out of there?

573
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,720
Would he see that

574
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:22,839
as a rejection?

575
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,519
Too sloppy.

576
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:50,119
He was so handsome.

577
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,480
Truly handsome.

578
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,519
Su Xie Yi.

579
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,680
What are you doing?

580
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:02,599
Have you forgotten

581
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,079
the reason you're here?

582
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,000
You came here

583
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,319
to find Chen Heng Sheng,

584
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,759
not to find a partner.

585
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,599
Su Xie Yi.

586
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:10,480
Su Xie Yi.

587
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,880
No more toothache?

588
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:13,160
Who are you talking to?

589
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,880
Nothing.

590
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,720
I'm using the washroom.

591
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:22,759
What's taking you so long?

592
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:25,880
I'm feeling sleepy already.

593
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:27,680
I'm going to wash up and go to bed.

594
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,480
So many excuses.

595
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:46,640
Hello?

596
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:47,640
Mr. Li.

597
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:49,519
I've contacted the hospital.

598
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:51,960
How did they respond?

599
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,960
The hospital is happy

600
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,559
with our charity proposal

601
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,279
because there are indeed

602
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,440
too many families in need of funding.

603
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,720
That's great.

604
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,359
It's a good thing to be able

605
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:03,839
to help more people in need.

606
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:04,559
Yes.

607
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:06,119
It's even better

608
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:07,319
if we can get a few leads

609
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,359
on Liu Ah Wei.

610
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,839
You need to speed things up.

611
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:11,720
Okay.

612
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,559
Chestnut, enjoy.

613
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:40,839
Here's your coffee.

614
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,119
Miss Su.

615
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:44,319
This is the sales table

616
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:45,480
for the hotel's food and beverages.

617
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,480
You may have a look.

618
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:49,160
The auction banquet

619
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:50,880
is also a top priority.

620
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:52,830
(Yunfeng Hotel, Food, and Beverages)
We need to pay attention to the food

621
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,240
(Sales Table, Main Course Sales Table)
and beverages served.

622
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:55,119
The sales table

623
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,119
is a good reference.

624
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,079
You're right.

have a unique taste.

630
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,720
That bottle of wine you picked

631
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,359
is indeed a good wine.

632
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,599
But

633
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,119
unfortunately,

634
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:15,839
it's a bad vintage.

635
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:19,519
Can I take this

636
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,640
and show it to Mr. Li?

637
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:23,160
I'm sorry, Miss Su.

638
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:24,400
This is internal information.

639
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:26,000
If Mr. Li wants to see it,

640
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,000
I'll personally send it over

641
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,200
for him to have a look.

642
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:35,119
It's okay.

643
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:36,119
I'll get some tissues.

but you don't have it here?

Yes, it is currently out of stock.

649
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,519
But I saw it

650
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,079
in the lobby bar yesterday.

651
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,119
I'm not sure about that.

652
00:29:58,519 --> 00:29:58,960

Be careful.

659
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,359
Is this the last box?

660
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:34,960
Yes.

Be sure to clean it up.

00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,599
Miss Su, what are you doing here?

676
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,160
I heard that Yunfeng's wine cellar

677
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:14,599
contains a lot of good wines.

678
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,119
How can I not pay a visit?

679
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:19,279
We're honored

680
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:21,079
by your visit, Miss Su.

681
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:22,279
But I wonder

682
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:23,240
what kind of wine

683
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,160
you'd like.

684
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:24,920
How about this?

685
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:26,680
I'll send someone

686
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,200
to deliver the best wine

687
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:29,519
to your room.

688
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,039
Pick a bottle of wine for Miss Su.

689
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:34,400
Make sure it's the best.

690
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,559
Send it over to Miss Su's room.

691
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:36,319
Okay, I'll do it right away.

692
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,279
Hold on.

693
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,680
I heard

694
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:42,839
that Yunfeng's best-selling white wine

695
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:44,240
is called Riesling.

696
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,240
But

697
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,240
I couldn't find it.

698
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:49,359
Why don't you lead the way?

699
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:51,160
We do have it.

700
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,680
But the price of the wine
is awfully high.

701
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:55,599
So we rarely restock it.

702
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,000
It's out of stock now.

703
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,519
Well, what's in the box

704
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,200
that you're holding?

705
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,519
No, Miss Su!

706
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,320
Didn't you say it was out of stock?

707
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:17,400
I must have remembered it wrong.

708
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,239
I'll take this then.

709
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:24,960
Thank you.

710
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:32,840
What do you mean by this?

711
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,760
Miss Su, don't get me wrong.

712
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,639
I think

713
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,119
there is no need to bother you

714
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:41,159
with things like
selecting a bottle of wine, right?

715
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,000
You're a busy man.

716
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,000
There's no need to trouble you

717
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,119
with such a trivial matter.

718
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,840
Don't say that.

719
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,039
Given your status,

720
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:50,960
you don't have to personally

721
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,800
see to this.

722
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:53,800
Besides,

723
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,800
no matter how busy I am,

724
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:57,039
nothing is more important

725
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:58,960
than attending to Mr. Li.

726
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,400
I think

727
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,480
I should

728
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:03,679
personally pick a bottle of wine for you

729
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:04,800
and have it delivered

730
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,599
to your room later.

731
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,280
It's just a bottle of wine.

732
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,519
Are you such a miserly man?

733
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,079
Do you

734
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:17,840
not trust me,

735
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,360
the manager of Yunfeng?

736
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:26,840
Xie Yi.

737
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,079
What's taking you so long?

738
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:33,079
Mr. Li.

739
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:37,719
Mr. Chen, you're here as well.

740
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:38,199
Mr. Li.

741
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:39,320
I was recommending the wine

742
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:41,400
to Miss Su earlier.

743
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,239
Come.

744
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:44,800
What wine?

745
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,199
I picked a bottle of wine.

746
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,400
But Mr. Chen doesn't seem

747
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:50,519
to be willing to give it to me.

748
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:52,159
Is it?

749
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:54,360
Don't get me wrong, Miss Su.

750
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:55,400
But

751
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:56,840
since Mr. Li is here,

752
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,280
I'll just come clean with you.

753
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,360
This wine

754
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,000
is indeed

755
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:04,320
Yunfeng's best-selling wine.

756
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:05,079
But

757
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,280
there's a problem
with our temperature control

758
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,719
for this batch of wine.

759
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,880
So, the taste isn't as great.

760
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,639
I was thinking

761
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,559
that I can't serve

762
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,400
such a wine

763
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,280
to Mr. Li.

764
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,639
So I was telling Miss Su

765
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:16,480
earlier

766
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,480
that I came to pick another type of wine

767
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,000
and have it delivered to you later.

768
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:20,960
Okay.

769
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:23,760
Let me see.

770
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:30,199
Mr. Li!

771
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:30,880
You...

772
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,119
Mr. Li, are you all right?

773
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:32,960
I'm fine.

774
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,519
Didn't Mr. Chen say

775
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,480
that the taste wasn't as great?

776
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:39,639
How about this?

777
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:40,880
Mr. Chen,

778
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:42,360
send a bottle of the finest wine

779
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,280
to my room later.

780
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:44,599
Sure.

781
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:47,000
Let's go.

782
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,039
You did that on purpose earlier.

783
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:11,239
Why?

784
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:18,480
What did you promise me?

785
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:24,719
This wine

786
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,719
is my dad's favorite brand.

787
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:27,159
I remember the logo on it

788
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:28,559
very clearly.

789
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,800
As compared to the wine we saw

790
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,800
in the wine cellar,

791
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:33,400
I'm positive

792
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,760
that those were counterfeit wines.

793
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:37,159
So?

794
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,760
It means Chen Heng Sheng
is selling counterfeit wines.

795
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:45,400
Chen Heng Sheng
is the general manager of Yunfeng.

796
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,719
He has a well-established foundation
in Yunfeng.

797
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,079
The preparation of the Fujiade Auction

798
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,519
requires all the manpower

799
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,719
and material resources of Yunfeng.

800
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,679
No one is a better candidate than him

801
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,639
for the time being.

802
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,800
I know.

803
00:37:58,679 --> 00:37:59,199
I just wanted

804
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,360
to find the dirt on him.

805
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,119
I told you I would continue

806
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,320
to investigate Zhiwei.

807
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,559
And you promised

808
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,519
you wouldn't interfere.

809
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:07,079
I know.

810
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:09,239
But right now,

811
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:10,679
the present is more important.

812
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,920
The auction

813
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,719
is very important to me.

814
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,800
The whole company

815
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,480
has its eyes set on me.

816
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,159
I can't mess things up.

817
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:19,920
Are we going to just let things slide?

818
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:21,480
Of course not.

819
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,559
See for yourself.

820
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,159
For over a year,

821
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:36,639
the police have been secretly

822
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:37,559
investigating Chen Heng Sheng.

823
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,840
I'm trying my best to provide evidence

824
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,639
and work with the police.

825
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,440
Is the evidence sufficient?

826
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,280
That's right.

827
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:44,960
This is great.

828
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:46,559
So, to catch the thief red-handed,

829
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,400
the police

830
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,639
are waiting for the right time.

831
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:51,400
This auction

832
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,119
is the best opportunity.

833
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,840
I can't give it to you just yet.

834
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,920
When can you give it to me then?

835
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,079
After the auction is over,

836
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,519
Cheng Heng Sheng

837
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:08,559
is going to be brought to justice.

838
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,599
The police will give you the answers

839
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,000
to all your questions.

840
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,000
As for now,

841
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,920
just relax

842
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,559
and do your part as my assistant.

843
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,159
Leave the rest to me.

844
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:22,880
Promise?

845
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:23,840
Yes.

846
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:29,960
All right.

847
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:31,400
It's a deal then.

848
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,039
Nice working with you.

849
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:04,519
I've managed to find out

850
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:05,639
Su Xie Yi's true identity.

851
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,159
She's actually the youngest daughter

852
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,000
of Shen Zhi Hong,
the chairman of Zhiwei Corporation.

853
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,960
She used her mother's last name

854
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,480
and went abroad when she was ten.

855
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,800
So, not many people know her.

856
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:22,480
So she's Shen Zhi Hong's daughter?

857
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:25,039
That explains why she wanted
to dig up the files on Zhiwei.

858
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,320
From the looks of it,

859
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,039
her intention of getting into Ocean

860
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:27,920
is pretty clear now,

861
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,280
which is to investigate

862
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:30,800
the bankruptcy of Zhiwei.

863
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:32,960
But why is she

864
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,039
with Li Ze Liang?

865
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,360
The daughter of a bankrupt family

866
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:43,320
suddenly showed up next to the enemy

867
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:45,039
and became his girlfriend.

868
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,159
Don't you

869
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:48,000
find that odd?

870
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,000
Could she be seeking revenge?

871
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,880
It doesn't matter what she thinks.

872
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:55,400
What matters

873
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,920
is that her identity
as Shen Zhi Hong's daughter

874
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,960
can be used to our advantage.

875
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:03,599
So you want to make use of that.

876
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:06,920
Su Xie Yi

877
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,320
may just be

878
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,920
the perfect pawn.

879
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:17,920
(Fujiade Auction Reception)

880
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,960
There are only four waiters

881
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:20,519
at the auction reception.

882
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,320
Not enough.

883
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,280
We need to double the manpower.

884
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,480
There's not much variety
for the pastries.

885
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:26,639
Make it more lavish.

886
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,239
Okay.

887
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:30,480
How is it, Xie Yi?

888
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,119
The preparations

889
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:32,760
for the auction reception

890
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,079
are basically ready.

891
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,840
Tomorrow, Mr. Huo

892
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,880
will accompany the Romans to Yunfeng.

893
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,239
The invited guests

894
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,760
will be arriving soon after.

895
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,280
Miss Su is very capable.

896
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:44,320
Everything is arranged

897
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,239
in an orderly manner.

898
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,400
That's right.

899
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,079
After the auction,

900
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,440
I'll have to reward you.

901
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:52,239
Mr. Chen.

902
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,599
Be my witness.

903
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:55,280
Of course.

904
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,719
It's been hard on you too, Mr. Chen.

905
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,119
Thank you for your support.

906
00:41:59,360 --> 00:41:59,800
Don't say that.

907
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:01,079
Should you have any requests,

908
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,159
don't hesitate to tell us.

909
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:04,360
We'll do our best

910
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:05,440
to cater to your needs.

911
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,440
All right.

912
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,599
I'll leave you be then.

913
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,519
I'm going

914
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:10,440
to check up on the progress
of the banquet.

915
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:12,639
Mr. Li.

916
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:14,039
I have to say.

917
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,119
You have found yourself

918
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,320
a really good partner.

919
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,719
Thank you for your hard work.

920
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:23,920
This is nothing.

921
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,320
All right. Excuse me.

922
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,199
After the auction is over,

923
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,679
don't forget what you promised me.

924
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,000
Don't worry.

925
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:38,480
Oh, right.

926
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,159
As for the opening of the reception,

927
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,079
you said

928
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:42,760
that you've invited
a very talented rock singer.

929
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,519
Which celebrity is that?

930
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:46,800
You'll know when he gets here.

931
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:47,960
Where is he now?

932
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,320
He needs to rehearse in advance.

933
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:54,559
He should be here soon.
