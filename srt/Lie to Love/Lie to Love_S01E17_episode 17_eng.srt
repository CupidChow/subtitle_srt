00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:16,010

2
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:25,000
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,550
♫  Still haunts me now and then in quiet nights  ♫

4
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:41,330
♫  And turn to face all the long lost times  ♫

5
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,370
♫  Brace the pain  ♫

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:51,210
♫  Let memories wake up from oceans deep  ♫

7
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,450
♫  No place to hide  ♫

8
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,450
♫  No way to run  ♫

9
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,820
♫  New dawn counts down  ♫

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,030
♫  I fight  ♫

11
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,110
♫  I cry  ♫

12
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,700
♫  I give up  ♫

13
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:15,710
♫  Memories forgotten, forsaken surround  ♫

14
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:23,930
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

15
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:32,470
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

16
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:40,850
♫  Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

17
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:49,620
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

18
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:57,650

19
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,950

20
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,020
Where do you want to go?

21
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,540
Look at how dirty you are.

22
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,819
Does it hurt?

23
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,240
Be well-behaved.

24
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,360
Be a good girl.

25
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,540
Be a good girl.

26
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,619
Be well-behaved.

27
00:02:24,619 --> 00:02:26,519
She isn't well-behaved.

28
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:28,599
She wants to fly away.

29
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,780
But don't worry.

30
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,900
I'll ensure that she'll stay by our side forever.

31
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,660
Are you hungry?

32
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,160
Come on.

33
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,100
I've made lotus seed pig heart soup.

34
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,719
The doctor said it would help to replenish the brain.

35
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,180
Xieqing, it's me.

36
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,800
The doctor said you're recovering well.

37
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,239
There's hope in regaining health.

38
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,059
Do you know how much I've been looking forward to the day?

39
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:24,120
The day you'll call my name as usual.

40
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,040
And share with me your little secrets.

41
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,840
Did you recall something?

42
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,100
Don't worry.

43
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,099
You'll recall it one day.

44
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:54,700
Open your mouth.

45
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,920
That's right.

46
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,359
Have more.

47
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,762
Sir.

48
00:04:29,762 --> 00:04:31,280
- Yes? 
 - Hello.

49
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,900
I'd like to ask if you sent this message to me.

50
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,600

51
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,079
Why did you come so late? I sent it a few days ago.

52
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:47,027
You know Liu A’Wei?

53
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,940
It's mentioned in the missing person notice that there'll be a reward.

54
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,180
Okay.

55
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,279
I know A'Wei.

56
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:09,600
He used to come here often to buy alcohol.

57
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,000
But later on, I heard he has not been in good health.

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,040
He hasn't been here for almost two months.

59
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,520
Then, do you know where he lives?

60
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,000
I don't know the exact location.

61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,460
But I know that he lives in the neighboring Nanfeng Village.

62
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,659
Nanfeng Village?

63
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:26,160
Okay. Thank you.

64
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,140
Thank you.

65
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,160
Let's go.

66
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,720
Xieyi.

67
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,780
You've been driving all the way.

68
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,559
Let me drive later.

69
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:46,260
I haven't driven for a long time.

70
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,080
I haven't had enough of it.

71
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:52,319
What is it? You have no faith in my driving skills?

72
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,700
Come on. Let's head to Nanfeng Village.

73
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,288

74
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:09,419
This is the place.

75
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:11,019
Come on.

76
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:24,400
This village has a beautiful name and scenery.

77
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,019
That way.

78
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,279
It's so delicious, folks.

79
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:37,779
Our honey is authentic and reasonably priced.

80
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:39,739
Every sip is gold.

81
00:06:39,739 --> 00:06:42,299
Money can't buy health.

82
00:06:42,299 --> 00:06:46,299
Folks, our honey is absolutely homemade.

83
00:06:46,299 --> 00:06:48,000
No middlemen are involved and earn a part.

84
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,820
We are only wild bees keepers.

85
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,900
Folks, come to my live broadcast room and give me a like

86
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,340
- to get a special price right away. 
 - This man speaks quite passionately.

87
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,120
- What about asking him for directions? 
 - Okay.

88
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,499
Thirty-eight yuan a bottle with free shipping.

89
00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:05,220
Come over. Have a look at our honey.

90
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,559

91
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:13,278
Great!

92
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:15,879
Thrilling. But in no danger.

93
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:18,380
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm fine.

94
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,720
Little girl, when you hear the horn next time, you must get out of the way.

95
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,420
Get it?

96
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,360
What a strange girl.

97
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,680
Folks, did you see it?

98
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,399
This place is full of good people.

99
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:41,160
Come and drink our honey.

100
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,519
Drink our honey, and I'll assure you that you'll become

101
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:47,558
beautiful and kind like this lady. Folks.

102
00:07:47,558 --> 00:07:51,240
Sir, we're looking for a person.

103
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,600
Miss, you... You like our honey, right?

104
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,260
That's great.

105
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:01,800
Miss, well, for your kindness, I'll give you an extra 40 percent off

106
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,059
on top of the special price in my live broadcast room.

107
00:08:04,059 --> 00:08:06,519
Sir, we're not here to buy honey.

108
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,039
We'd like to ask you about a person.

109
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,519
Young man, honey is good.

110
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:16,279
Honey makes you healthy and beautiful.

111
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,260
Are you two dating?

112
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:25,140
I can assure you that our honey will get you two closer together and filled with sweetness.

113
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,920
- What do you think? 
 - Okay.

114
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,199
We'll buy the honey.

115
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,560
But can we ask you a question?

116
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,760
You can ask two questions too.

117
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,399
How many would you like to buy?

118
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:36,919
Give us two bottles then.

119
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,159
Great!

120
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,559
Two bottles sound good.

121
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,860
A pair.

122
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,860
Two bottles for sweet love.

123
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,639
Four bottles for a miracle in happiness.

124
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:49,319
Six bottles for a good marriage.

125
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:50,180
Six bottles.

126
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,720
You're magnanimous, young man.

127
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,159
Six bottles. Good.

128
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:55,526
An extra 40 percent off for six bottles.

129
00:08:55,526 --> 00:08:56,779
One hundred and thirty-six and eighty cents.

130
00:08:56,779 --> 00:08:58,799
Come on. What an auspicious number.

131
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:01,399
One hundred and thirty-six and eighty cents. A smooth and prosperous life.

132
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:03,150
Here, scan this code.

133
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,819
Done.

134
00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:07,459
Okay.

135
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:11,439
Sir, do you know where Liu A’Wei lives?

136
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,314
He lives...

137
00:09:13,314 --> 00:09:19,140
Well, turn right after crossing the bridge, and you'll find his house at the end of the road.

138
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:20,559
Okay.

139
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,159
- Thank you, Sir. 
 - Thank you.

140
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,720
Let's go.

141
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,340
Hey, you haven't taken your honey.

142
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,320
Keep them for us. We'll come back for them later.

143
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,320
Thank you. Wish you a booming business.

144
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,460
Wish you sweet love every day!

145
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:10,250

146
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,040
Anybody home?

147
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,040
Anybody home?

148
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,779
A'Yan.

149
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,900
Who are you looking for?

150
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:47,239
Hello. We're looking for...

151
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:49,759
Looking for Liu A’Wei.

152
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:52,880
Didn't you see that he's gone?

153
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,060
May I know the cause of his death?

154
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,059
It was two months ago. He died from alcohol intoxication.

155
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:01,559
He couldn't live without alcohol.

156
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,959
I...

157
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,680
Who are you?

158
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,579
Let me tell you.

159
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:08,799
His debts are written off after his death.

160
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:11,819
What he owed you before has nothing to do with me.

161
00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:12,960
Please don't get us wrong.

162
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,939
We're not here because of his debts.

163
00:11:14,939 --> 00:11:17,519
We just have a few questions to ask him.

164
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,600
What's it about?

165
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,940
Why did he suddenly resign two years ago?

166
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:26,040
How would I know why he resigned?

167
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,980
I have no idea. Please leave.

168
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:37,060
We've met just now.

169
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,459
My name is Su Xieyi.

170
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,000
What's your name?

171
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,260
I'm Liu Xiaoxiao.

172
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,419
Xiaoxiao, you know them?

173
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:45,220
She saved me just now.

174
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,201
Otherwise, I might have been hit by the electric tricycle.

175
00:11:48,201 --> 00:11:50,099
Are you all right?

176
00:11:50,099 --> 00:11:51,499
What's wrong with you?

177
00:11:51,499 --> 00:11:56,159
How many times have I told you to put on your hearing aid when you go out?

178
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:58,620
Sir, Miss, thank you so much.

179
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,040
Don't mention it. It's our responsibility too.

180
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,720
Her hearing aid was broken once.

181
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,120
So, she has been reluctant to wear it now.

182
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,360
Xiaoxiao, get to your room and do your homework.

183
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,579
Sir, Miss, so sorry for what I said just now.

184
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:16,919
Come into the house. I'll make you a pot of tea.

185
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:17,919
- Okay. Come on. 
 - Thank you.

186
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:19,419
Thank you.

187
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,490
♫  Your wishes are the same forever  ♫

188
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:43,900
♫  No matter how sad and difficult it is  ♫

189
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,050
♫  You're still doing what you dream of  ♫

190
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:47,659
Xiaoxiao,

191
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,739
what are you doing?

192
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,140
I'm listening to songs.

193
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,760
Why are you so nervous then?

194
00:12:57,939 --> 00:13:00,740
My mom doesn't allow me to listen to songs.

195
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,000
She'll be upset.

196
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,819
So I can only listen to them in secret.

197
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,760
Don't worry. I won't tell your mom.

198
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,460
Carry on.

199
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,979
By the way, Xiaoxiao.

200
00:13:18,979 --> 00:13:20,320
Xiaoxiao.

201
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,100
When did you get the hearing aid?

202
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,940
My dad bought it for me two years ago.

203
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,240
He'd spent a lot of money on it.

204
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,220
Then, do you know why your dad suddenly resigned and moved here with you?

205
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,020
I don't know.

206
00:13:33,819 --> 00:13:38,279
I heard from my mom that my dad had seen something terrible that had frightened him.

207
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:42,020
That's why he brought my mom and me and moved here.

208
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,999
Then, do you know what happened?

209
00:13:48,999 --> 00:13:50,600
Xiaoxiao!

210
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,360
Sir, Miss, thank you so much for saving Xiaoxiao.

211
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,279
But you don't have to go to great lengths to make Xiaoxiao tell you.

212
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:03,279
We really don't know anything about A'Wei.

213
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,879
You may leave.

214
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,960
Sister Xieyi.

215
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,800
It's fine.

216
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,660
We'll leave now. We'll visit you when we're free.

217
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,320
Sorry for disturbing you.

218
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,740
Let's go.

219
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,100
It seems that Liu A’Wei must have seen what Huo Jian did.

220
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,440
That's why he was frightened.

221
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,479
Well, could he have witnessed Huo Jian killing your dad?

222
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:40,599
Unfortunately, Liu A’Wei has passed away.

223
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:42,299
The trail goes cold now.

224
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:44,120
No.

225
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,460
I think Xiaoxiao's mom does know something.

226
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,840
So, we can't leave now.

227
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,739
But she rebuffed us.

228
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,759
But Xiaoxiao likes us.

229
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,400
I'm afraid it won't be easy to get close to her next time.

230
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,540
It will eventually turn out fine.

231
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,600
It's getting dark.

232
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,199
Let's find a place to spend the night.

233
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,620
Okay.

234
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,960
You're saying that Li Zeliang isn't injured at all?

235
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,560
Yes.

236
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,519
Where are you going? Want me to go with you?

237
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,699
Who is it? It's late at night.

238
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,059
Who is it?

239
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,960
Chairman Huo, why did you come late at night?

240
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,560
Uncle, you're here.

241
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,679
Zeliang, your left leg has grown?

242
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,359
Uncle Huo, you caught me.

243
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:05,820
Look at my costume.

244
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,000
Does it look particularly interesting?

245
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,559
Where's Li Zeliang?

246
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:12,739
Zeliang has woken up and gone to the hospital.

247
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,399
Is that so?

248
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:18,980
Chairman Huo, where are you going?

249
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,680
Chairman Huo.

250
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:27,880
Chairman Huo! Chairman Huo!

251
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:53,299
Chairman Huo.

252
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:51,200

253
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,000
Good.

254
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:08,490
I have a good nephew indeed.

255
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:18,419
 K of Spades. My friend, it's been a while.

256
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:20,219
 You are in trouble.

257
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,559
 Li Zeliang has found Spider's whereabouts.

258
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:41,920
 This is where they are now.

259
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,000
 Stop them if you want to save your life.

260
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:59,199
Sister.

261
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,339
Sister. Sister.

262
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,380
Sister.

263
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,080
Sister.

264
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,340
Hello.

265
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,579
Mr. Li, Huo Jian came

266
00:19:21,579 --> 00:19:23,952
and found your secret room.

267
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,580
I'm sorry. I was too careless.

268
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,180
It's okay.

269
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:36,039
Huo Jian might only know that I'm not injured.

270
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:37,919
He doesn't know where I am.

271
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,720
He's the nervous one now.

272
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,120
Got it.

273
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,659
You have to be careful.

274
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,800
How's it? Is it settled?

275
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,310
Yes.

276
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:00,839
They only have rooms on the first floor.

277
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:02,119
Let's go.

278
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,340
What do you mean by that?

279
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,160
I told you that the second-floor room is good.

280
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,079
It comes with a balcony and a free breakfast. And the room is bigger.

281
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:08,839
You just don't want to take the stairs, do you?

282
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:11,819
- How come I don't—  
 - Xieyi,

283
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:14,100
since the room on the second floor is better,

284
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,840
then let's stay on the second floor.

285
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,120
No. I want to live on the first floor.

286
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,200
Xieyi, this may look small,

287
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,559
but it's quite cozy.

288
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:43,640
A'Yan, are you tired?

289
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,780
- Don't just stand there. 
 - We've been walking the whole day.

290
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,580
Why don't you lie down?

291
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,760
No need.

292
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,559
Stop wiping.

293
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,140
- It's quite clean. 
 - It's fine.

294
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:05,040
Xieyi, you seem to care about my leg a lot.

295
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,580
Of course, I care about you.

296
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,720
It has been a long day today.

297
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,340
These conditions aren't as good as home.

298
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,500
It's better to pay more attention.

299
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,760
Okay.

300
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,200
I'll go out to buy some water.

301
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,419
Take a rest.

302
00:21:22,419 --> 00:21:24,219
Come back soon.

303
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,580
Hello, Brother Ji.

304
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,219
 Miss Su, what's the matter?

305
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,279
We've been walking the whole day.

306
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:42,160
I'm worried A'Yan might have leg pain.

307
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,359
You do know that he often pushes himself.

308
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:47,459
I'm worried he won't say that he's in pain.

309
00:21:47,459 --> 00:21:51,079
Miss Su, you do know Mr. Li well.

310
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:56,119
So, I called to ask about how to take care of his leg.

311
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:59,079
His leg will swell easily after walking for a long time.

312
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:02,559
He needs a hot compress and a massage to promote blood circulation.

313
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,639
Then, can you teach me how to do it in detail?

314
00:22:05,639 --> 00:22:07,639
Just go ahead. I can remember it.

315
00:22:07,639 --> 00:22:11,920
 First, prepare a towel and hot water.

316
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,520
What took her so long to buy some water?

317
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,539
Has something happened to her?

318
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,480
Brother Ji, thank you for taking care of A'Yan.

319
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,280
From now on, let me take care of him.

320
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,899
He injured his leg because of my dad.

321
00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:48,200
Logically and sentimentally, I should repay him.

322
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,500
Besides, I really love him.

323
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,920
I hope he can be healthy and stay by my side forever.

324
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:05,720
 Miss Su, thank you for your concern for Mr. Li.

325
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,140
 I know Xieyi's personality well.

326
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,340
 She is righteous and kind.

327
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:30,539
 She always repays other people's kindness with even more kindness.

328
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:33,507
 Had she not known you injured your leg for trying to save Uncle Shen,

329
00:23:33,507 --> 00:23:36,200
 she would have been out of the picture by now.

330
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:47,299
 Xieyi. Why don't I drive?

331
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:48,519
 It's okay.

332
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:50,779
 You can take over if I feel tired.

333
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:56,690
♫  I need you, I love you  ♫

334
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:00,299
 I haven't driven for a long time. I haven't had enough of it.

335
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:02,340
 No. I want to live on the first floor.

336
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,170
♫  You don't have to be brave all the time  ♫

337
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,700
♫  Please believe that I am by your side  ♫

338
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,270
♫  To embrace the fragility right in front of your eyes  ♫

339
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,820
 He injured his leg because of my dad.

340
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,940
 Logically and sentimentally, I should repay him.

341
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,820
A'Yan, you drank alcohol?

342
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,540
Did your leg hurt again?

343
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,340
Where have you been?

344
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,420
Why did you come back so late?

345
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,599
I went to the convenience store.

346
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:25,480
It's very far. It took me so long to find it.

347
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,240
Look, I bought you a new basin.

348
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,440
Later, I'll give you an expert hot compress.

349
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,099
What do you think? Do you look forward to it?

350
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,700
Are you sure this towel is usable?

351
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,279
I'll buy a new one for you then. Wait for me here.

352
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,719
No need.

353
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:47,320
What's wrong with you today?

354
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,419
You've been talking oddly.

355
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,900
I've thought it through.

356
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,759
You may stay on the second floor. The room there is better.

357
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,899
You don't have to keep me company here.

358
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,880
What's wrong?

359
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,659
- Are you all right? 
 - I'm fine.

360
00:26:08,659 --> 00:26:11,100
Then, why are you chasing me away?

361
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,820
I just feel that you don't have to do all this.

362
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,119
What have I done?

363
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:17,899
Is it wrong to care for you?

364
00:26:17,899 --> 00:26:21,779
Are you concerned about me or my leg?

365
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,440
Is there any difference?

366
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,400
Fine.

367
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,380
If you really mind that I touch your leg, then I'll apologize. I won't touch it.

368
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,140
But can you stop talking to me like this?

369
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:36,849
Su Xieyi, you don't owe me anything.

370
00:26:36,849 --> 00:26:38,419
You don't need to repay me.

371
00:26:38,419 --> 00:26:43,020
Li Zeliang, are you in a bad mood because you were given a cold shoulder?

372
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,920
Or is there any misunderstanding between us?

373
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,900
You can't tell me, right?

374
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:51,320
Then, I'll say it for you.

375
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,279
Ever since the auction, you've been very concerned about my leg

376
00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:00,280
because you know that my leg was amputated for saving your dad.

377
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,480
You blame yourself.

378
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,139
You feel guilty. You feel responsible.

379
00:27:05,139 --> 00:27:07,000
But let me tell you, Su Xieyi.

380
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,240
I don't need your sympathy.

381
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,279
Even if I lack everything in the world, I don't need your sympathy.

382
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,979
I don't need your mercy.

383
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:18,559
I saved your dad voluntarily.

384
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,319
Not to mention a leg.

385
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:24,279
Even if I fell with him, that'd be my own choice.

386
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:26,820
It has nothing to do with you.

387
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,247
- This isn't how it is. 
 - You don't have to explain.

388
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:33,199
You called Ji Yingsong out there. I heard everything.

389
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:43,119
Take some rest.

390
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,320
You don't need to repay me.

391
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,059
We're already tired.

392
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,600
Please.

393
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:01,359
I won't leave.

394
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:05,319
I'll never leave. What can you do?

395
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:09,187
I not only will not leave, but also sleep here today.

396
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:12,160
I can sleep here alone. I don't need to give someone a massage.

397
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,960
I don't need to give someone a hot compress. How great it is.

398
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,200
When I wake up, tomorrow will be another vigorous day.

399
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,700
Good night.

400
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,500
Su Xieyi, did you not hear what I said?

401
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:31,059
Su Xieyi.

402
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,760
You didn't hear me, right?

403
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,779
You refuse to leave, right?

404
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:39,499
Fine. I'll leave then.

405
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,279
Didn't you already leave?

406
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,300
Why did you come back?

407
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,559
I've forgotten my toiletries.

408
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,000
What else have you forgotten?

409
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:11,699
- I've forgotten my game console. 
 - Anything else?

410
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,300
Nothing else.

411
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,739
You've forgotten me.

412
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:37,020
A'Yan, to be honest,

413
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,639
when I knew your leg

414
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:43,079
was amputated because of my dad,

415
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,059
I felt very guilty.

416
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,359
But it wasn't only guilt.

417
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,960
Whenever I looked at your leg,

418
00:29:52,659 --> 00:29:56,439
I'd thought of the person I love

419
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:00,720
had once tried very hard to save my dad.

420
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,079
I'm really grateful for what you did.

421
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:06,299
I guess,

422
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:11,939
at his last breath,

423
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:15,340
my dad was very touched too.

424
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:19,317
Although he'd chosen to give up,

425
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,939
your persuasion

426
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,979
must have dissolved many of his regrets.

427
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:31,039
A'Yan, I want to tell you

428
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:36,859
that when I saw the picture of us kissing under the starry night that you took,

429
00:30:37,459 --> 00:30:39,940
when I saw Chestnut,

430
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,520
when I saw you cutting out pictures of starry night for me,

431
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,734
only did I realize

432
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:53,380
that both of us have never forgotten that beautiful night.

433
00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:00,439
It's just I hid it in the deepest part of my heart.

434
00:31:00,439 --> 00:31:02,640
I didn't want to face it.

435
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:07,180
I don't know whether there's

436
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,960
responsibility and guilt in my love for you.

437
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:16,460
But I know that I love you very much.

438
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:20,240
♫  Time tries to wash away my feelings for you  ♫

439
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,520
I want to be with you.

440
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,159
Whether it was two years ago,

441
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:29,259
now, or in the future,

442
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:35,559
I don't want to be separated from you.

443
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:39,839
I want us to be together forever.

444
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:45,040
I want... you to be by my side forever.

445
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:51,119
I've expressed my heart.

446
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,520
Do you still want to forget me?

447
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:59,120
♫  They tell me every night the stories of your past  ♫

448
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,540
No.

449
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:04,000
♫  I'm sorry I wasn't there for you  ♫

450
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,280
I will never do it again.

451
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:12,499
♫  If I can grow a piece of feather on every scar  ♫

452
00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:15,659
I'm sorry, Xie Yi.

453
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:18,120
I've misunderstood you.

454
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:22,759
I was being blind. It's my fault.

455
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:25,379
I will never forget you again.

456
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:28,219
Then, are you going to stay on the second floor?

457
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,499
No.

458
00:32:32,499 --> 00:32:35,440
Then, are you going to chase me away?

459
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,140
No.

460
00:32:38,019 --> 00:32:41,380
Then, are you going to resent that my towel is dirty?

461
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:43,960
No.

462
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,559
Then... Then, my feet are cold.

463
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:02,679
Then, I'll get you some hot water,

464
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:04,499
so you can soak your feet.

465
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,340
No need.

466
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:10,459
If you listen to me from now on, everything will be okay.

467
00:33:10,459 --> 00:33:11,819
Okay.

468
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:14,540
Stop crying.

469
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,559
I'll listen to you.

470
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:33,659
Excuse me. Have you seen these two friends of mine?

471
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,140
I had a dream yesterday.

472
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,659
I saw a barefoot deity holding a gold ingot.

473
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:44,559
It turns out to be true.

474
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,160
It's mentioned in the missing person notice that there'll be a reward.

475
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:09,159
Sir, you're even more generous than the good-looking man and woman you're looking for.

476
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,719
Where are they?

477
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,419
At the neighboring Nanfeng Village.

478
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:19,420

479
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,520
Auntie, are you making pickled cabbages?

480
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,199
Didn't I tell you that I know nothing?

481
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,619
Stop bothering me.

482
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:39,460
We have no hidden agenda.

483
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:42,800
We just want to say goodbye to Xiaoxiao before we leave.

484
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,220
Xiaoxiao is not at home.

485
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:47,439
Do you think I don't know what's on your mind?

486
00:34:47,439 --> 00:34:52,119
Since you two have saved Xiaoxiao, I don't want to be rude.

487
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:55,619
Just leave. There's no need for a farewell.

488
00:34:55,619 --> 00:35:00,199
Xiaoxiao said her dad resigned because he saw something frightening.

489
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:02,280
Stop talking nonsense.

490
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,639
A'Wei was timid.

491
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:05,679
He was afraid of everything.

492
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:07,179
Timid?

493
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:12,400
How could he be a Spider and clean the windows of high-rise buildings?

494
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,599
To make a living, he had no choice.

495
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:21,200
Xiaoxiao's hearing aid must have cost at least 200,000 yuan.

496
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,639
What does it have to do with you?

497
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:26,259
Liu A’Wei worked as a Spider for less than a year.

498
00:35:26,259 --> 00:35:29,400
He bought a hearing aid for Xiaoxiao and bought this house.

499
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,059
These cost at least 500,000 yuan.

500
00:35:31,059 --> 00:35:33,000
Where did he get so much money from?

501
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,860
He earned it himself.

502
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:38,039
Can you be sure that it was from his legitimate income?

503
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:39,680
What nonsense are you talking about?

504
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,239
Are you done with it yet?

505
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:44,599
Didn't I tell you that his debts are written off after his death?

506
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:46,800
The source of that amount has nothing to do with me.

507
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,499
Please. Let us off, can you?

508
00:35:50,499 --> 00:35:53,280
I really don't know about A'Wei's matter.

509
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,280
As for the money you mentioned, I'd asked him before.

510
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,320
But whenever I did, he'd lost his temper.

511
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,419
After a while, I dared not ask him again.

512
00:36:01,419 --> 00:36:05,360
Now that A'Wei is gone, where can I find the truth for you.

513
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,120
He really didn't say anything at all?

514
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,820
He didn't.

515
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:16,200
The evidence Liu A’Wei possessed is related to the truth of my dad's death.

516
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,560
If you really know something, I hope you will tell us.

517
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:26,439
Auntie...

518
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,099
A'Yan, let her think about it.

519
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:34,340
We won't bother you any longer.

520
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,160
We should leave now.

521
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,300
Don't worry.

522
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,300
There will be a way.

523
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,579
From Li Xia's expression,

524
00:37:06,579 --> 00:37:09,180
she must be keeping something from us.

525
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,400
But we shouldn't push too hard.

526
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,900
We must be patient.

527
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:21,239
But Xiaoxiao is quite friendly with us.

528
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,479
Maybe she'll be able to help us.

529
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,540
You're here to collect your honey!

530
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,439
Great! I've waited for a day.

531
00:37:30,439 --> 00:37:32,879
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you, sir.

532
00:37:34,139 --> 00:37:35,679
What about we get Xiaoxiao some too?

533
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:37,819
Are you talking about Liu Xiaoxiao?

534
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:40,540
She doesn't like honey.

535
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,620
She likes my music.

536
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:45,320
But doesn't she have a hearing disability?

537
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,140
That's not congenital.

538
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,859
If I'm not wrong, she had a high fever when she was nine, and it damaged her hearing.

539
00:37:50,859 --> 00:37:54,840
But she did surgery two years ago and recovered well.

540
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,340
It's not a huge problem now.

541
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,840
In the past, her dad, Liu A’Wei, told us that Liu Xiaoxiao

542
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,440
could sing really well.

543
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,780
We look forward to hearing her sing.

544
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,159
But the girl doesn't want to sing.

545
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:12,840
But based on my observation, she still likes singing very much.

546
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:16,839
Look, when I sell items via a live broadcast and the music begins,

547
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,960
Liu Xiaoxiao will always come over to listen.

548
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,959
Look, Xiaoxiao is here.

549
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,000
Want some sweets?

550
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:42,059
My mom said sweets are bad for teeth.

551
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:47,840
Then, did your mom tell you that sweets can make you feel good?

552
00:38:49,779 --> 00:38:53,320
Right. We shouldn't eat what a stranger gives us.

553
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,519
I understand.

554
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:56,639
Xieyi, you're not a stranger.

555
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:58,780
I like you very much.

556
00:39:07,299 --> 00:39:09,339
By the way, Xiaoxiao.

557
00:39:09,339 --> 00:39:12,059
Did your mom forbid you to sing?

558
00:39:14,879 --> 00:39:16,360
I don't sing well.

559
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:21,620
After I lost my hearing, I kept singing out of tune.

560
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,039
I even got laughed at.

561
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:25,320
When my mom knew about this, she was very mad,

562
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,579
and often argued with those who laughed at me.

563
00:39:27,579 --> 00:39:30,219
So as not to let others bully me,

564
00:39:30,219 --> 00:39:32,740
she doesn't allow me to sing again.

565
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,239
I don't want to see my mom argue with others because of me.

566
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:40,579
After my dad was gone, she suffered a lot to make a living.

567
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,199
What's wrong with singing out of tune?

568
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:46,399
I sing out of tune too.

569
00:39:46,399 --> 00:39:48,159
Listen if you don't believe me.

570
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,420
♪ Sweet ♪

571
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,920
♪ You smile sweetly ♪

572
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,320
♪ Like the blooming flowers in the spring breeze ♪

573
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,400
Xieyi, thank you.

574
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,440
I know you are comforting me.

575
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:09,339
But tone-deaf and hearing loss are two different matters.

576
00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:15,579
Xiaoxiao,

577
00:40:16,779 --> 00:40:20,119
Zeliang and I haven't seen the village yet.

578
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:23,820
Can you be our tour guide and show us around?

579
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,370

580
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,690
♫  Just like that, I'll spoil you more and more  ♫

581
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:42,590
♫  Make you can't help but love me  ♫

582
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:44,280
♫  Your eyes will follow me   ♫

583
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,230
♫  Your heart will beat for me  ♫

584
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:52,700
♫  Don't be surprised, my love comes with spice  ♫

585
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,650
♫  I am your Mrs. Right  ♫

586
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:08,680
Xieyi, this silk scarf looks good. I think it fits you well.

587
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:15,039
It indeed looks good.

588
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,259
Mr. Li, let me ask you a question.

589
00:41:21,259 --> 00:41:22,679
Sure.

590
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:24,980
Which one is better?

591
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,899
Me or the scarf?

592
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,219
Of course, it's you...

593
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,559
The scarf you're holding.

594
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:35,519
Fine. I'm ugly.

595
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:37,760
I don't deserve it. Take it.

596
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,559
You don't want it?

597
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:41,740
Okay. I'll give it to someone then.

598
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:44,360
Let's see who I should give it to.

599
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,860
He's so handsome.

600
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:48,900
- I like him. 
 - What a fangirl.

601
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,720
Give this ugly lady away then.

602
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,299
No way.

603
00:41:53,299 --> 00:41:56,579
I can't bear to give this ugly lady to anyone.

604
00:41:58,879 --> 00:42:02,760
Xieyi, you two are too cheesy.

605
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,800
Is this how adults are when they are in love?

606
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,060
Adults in love aren't for you kids to watch.

607
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,599
Okay. I won't watch. I'll buy some water for you.

608
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:11,860
Okay.

609
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,488
Then, Xiaoxiao, we'll wait for you there.

610
00:42:14,488 --> 00:42:16,319
- Okay. 
 - Go.

611
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:21,059
Madam, I'll take this.

612
00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:22,920
- Twenty-eight yuan. 
 - Thank you, sir.

613
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,420
Bye-bye.

614
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,770
Little girl, watch your step.

615
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:33,890
