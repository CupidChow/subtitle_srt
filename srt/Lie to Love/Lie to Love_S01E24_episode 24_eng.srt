 ''Memory of Last Life'' - Curley Gao

3
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:25,100
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

4
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:33,550
♫  Still haunts me now and then in quiet nights  ♫

5
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:41,330
♫  And turn to face all the long lost times  ♫

6
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,270
♫  Brace the pain  ♫

7
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:51,210
♫  Let memories wake up from oceans deep  ♫

8
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,350
♫  No place to hide  ♫

9
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,450
♫  No way to run  ♫

10
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,820
♫  New dawn counts down  ♫

11
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,030
♫  I fight  ♫

12
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,110
♫  I cry  ♫

13
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,900
♫  I give up  ♫

14
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:15,710
♫  Memories forgotten, forsaken surround  ♫

15
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:24,230
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

16
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:32,970
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

17
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:40,950
♫  Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

18
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:49,820
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

19
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:57,650

20
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,950

21
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,660
Xieyi. If we can't even trust each other on this matter,

22
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,820
how can we spend the rest of our life together?

23
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:19,759
As I said, the whole matter doesn't add up.

24
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:22,779
I ordered the PR department to contact He Jianghua.

25
00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:25,980
But they couldn't reach him. He went on a vacation.

26
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,479
I think he's avoiding us.

27
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:33,299
A’Yan, all I need is your trust.

28
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:35,039
However, there are rumors circling around.

29
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,159
Perhaps you should put my work to a halt for the time being.

30
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,759
No.

31
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:43,659
If I did so before the dust settled,

32
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:46,360
people would be even more suspicious of us.

33
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:51,780
But I'm worried it might cause you more trouble.

34
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,240
As I said, I trust you.

35
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,360
You have all the more reasons to finish your work.

36
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,919
Deliver results and prove your worth to everyone.

37
00:03:07,339 --> 00:03:08,719
Thank you, Lawyer Xie.

38
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:11,660
- Contact me if you need anything. 
 - Sure.

39
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,580
Director Shi. Over here.

40
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,700
Why are you in a hurry to see me?

41
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,440
I watched the press conference. It was a success.

42
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:31,000
You don't seem particularly happy.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,039
Is something wrong?

44
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:36,460
This is Su Xieyi's doing, am I right?

45
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:40,360
Director Shi, calm down.

46
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,619
- Hear me out. 
 - Stop defending her.

47
00:03:42,619 --> 00:03:44,859
Wine is the best truth potion.

48
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:47,879
You already exposed her plan at the bar that night.

49
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:52,939
She is only staying in Ocean Hotel, so she can bring it down, am I right?

50
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:56,499
The files of the Lantian Bay project have been kept inside Zeliang's home.

51
00:03:56,499 --> 00:03:59,139
No one else would have the chance to read them.

52
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:03,960
Not to mention it's already a fact that she secretly contacted He Jianghua.

53
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,319
Even a fool can tell what's going on.

54
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,680
What more is there to be explained?

55
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,580
Lawyer Xie.

56
00:04:11,339 --> 00:04:13,339
I want you to be honest with me today.

57
00:04:13,339 --> 00:04:17,620
Is this Su Xieyi's doing?

58
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:25,759
Did she do it or not? Say something.

59
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,339
Director Shi.

60
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,740
Allow me to apologize on her behalf.

61
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,440
I see. She really is here for revenge.

62
00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:44,339
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

63
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:46,879
Xieyi is Xieqing's only family.

64
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,759
I cannot hurt her.

65
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,640
But she is hurting the others.

66
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:58,680
Director Shi. Two years ago, Uncle Shen passed away.

67
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,980
Zhiwei went bankrupt.

68
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,179
Her sister went mad.

69
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:05,480
Xieyi had already suffered too much.

70
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,820
She blames Ocean Hotel for her loss.

71
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,079
She is filled with hatred.

72
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:15,539
Huo Jian has been arrested, but she refused to give up just yet.

73
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:19,759
She will not stop until Ocean Hotel goes bankrupt.

74
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:26,880
So, she was merely taking advantage of Zeliang's feelings for her.

75
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,540
Am I right?

76
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:38,460
I could only stand there and watch as she uses Director Li's love for her for revenge.

77
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,319
I couldn't do anything.

78
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,700
She's been like a sister to me.

79
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,419
I can't bring myself to betray my family.

80
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:48,048
But I am worried if she stays on this path,

81
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:50,940
there will be damage that can't be undone.

82
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,600
If you know she is playing with fire,

83
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,920
we have all the more reasons to stop her!

84
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,010
What more can we do?

85
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:01,780
Li Zeliang is madly in love with her.

86
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,140
We have no evidence.

87
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,199
No matter what you say, he will never believe you.

88
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,319
It will only make him misunderstand you even more.

89
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,539
The two of you will only grow further apart.

90
00:06:20,299 --> 00:06:21,799
Fine.

91
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:25,400
Su Xieyi can put on an act.

92
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:29,399
But every plan comes with a flaw.

93
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:33,639
Lawyer Xie. Since you agree that she must be stopped,

94
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:36,619
at least our interest aligns.

95
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:38,539
What do you mean?

96
00:06:40,179 --> 00:06:42,420
I don't know Su Xieyi very well,

97
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,480
but I know Li Zeliang.

98
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,500
He never mixes business with personal matters, he's reasonable.

99
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,380
He may love Su Xieyi with his heart and soul,

100
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,636
but with enough evidence to prove Su Xieyi is just using him for revenge

101
00:06:56,637 --> 00:06:59,580
and she does mean to bring Ocean Hotel down,

102
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,480
I believe he will make the right choice.

103
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:06,859
Director Shi. I understand your intention.

104
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:09,900
But I don't have any proof against Xieyi.

105
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,800
Trust me.

106
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,560
Why do I encourage you to win Director Li over?

107
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:19,120
That's because I believe you love him more than anyone else.

108
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,879
You are the right person for him.

109
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:24,260
Director Li's relationship with Xieyi is just a terrible mistake.

110
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,700
But I lack the evidence to put an end to this mistake.

111
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:37,680
How would I know if you are being honest with me?

112
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,140
How about this? Xieyi will not give up on her revenge.

113
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:45,920
If we pay attention, we will find the flaw in her plan.

114
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,419
Are you certain you can pull this off?

115
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:52,620
Director Li and his company will only remind Xieyi of her tragic past

116
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,779
with Uncle Shen and Zhiwei.

117
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:57,080
They will only bring her pain.

118
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,500
I don't want her to live in this constant hatred.

119
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,659
I want her to leave this company.

120
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:08,519
Then, I'll take Xieyi and Xieqing back to Germany.

121
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:11,979
We'll start a new life there and never come back.

122
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:15,899
You and Chairman Li will never see us again.

123
00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:24,119
Aren't you worried that Su Xieyi might hate you after knowing what you've done?

124
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,979
All I ask is for her to let go of this obsession.

125
00:08:29,739 --> 00:08:32,060
But I need something in return.

126
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,840
We can find out the flaw in Xieyi's plan

127
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,800
and let Chairman Li learn the truth,

128
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:42,179
but I don't want her to get hurt.

129
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,599
You really care a lot about her.

130
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,599
We all want to protect our loved ones.

131
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,660
Very well. I agree with your term.

132
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,570
With the two of us joining hands,

133
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,820
I believe we can realize our goal.

134
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,280
Very well. Calm down for the moment.

135
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,579
Once I've dug up some leads on Xieyi, we'll talk again.

136
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,965
Are you still thinking about what happened earlier?

137
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,720
It's behind us.

138
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,419
Don't trouble yourself with it.

139
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:39,941
From what I heard,

140
00:09:39,942 --> 00:09:43,919
Director Shi has never taken a leave ever since she started working at Ocean Hotel.

141
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:48,700
She must be very upset to have taken a leave.

142
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:51,040
Don't be paranoid.

143
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,900
She's been working too hard lately.

144
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,179
A vacation is good for her.

145
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,659
She is a smart person.

146
00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:01,499
Once she's calmed down, she will realize something is amiss.

147
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,419
But now that she is away,

148
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:09,339
you will have even more tasks on your hands.

149
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:11,579
You'll be busier than ever.

150
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,840
Don't worry.

151
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,640
I'll manage.

152
00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:23,460
You said you wanted me to focus on my work.

153
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,000
Is there anything I can help you with?

154
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,900
There is one thing.

155
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,939
What is it?

156
00:10:30,939 --> 00:10:35,080
You mentioned that you want to participate in the Lantian Bay project?

157
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:39,320
The project needs to purchase a batch of wall insulation material.

158
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,279
Director Shi didn't close the deal.

159
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,880
With her away, the purchasing has been set aside.

160
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,400
Can I leave it to you?

161
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,020
Director Shi has been in charge of the Lantian Bay project.

162
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:56,079
Besides, she doesn't want me to intervene.

163
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,440
Xieyi.

164
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:04,128
You are more than just Director Shi's subordinate, you are my girlfriend.

165
00:11:04,128 --> 00:11:07,460
You will be the future wife of Ocean Hotel's President.

166
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,900
You will get involved eventually.

167
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:15,900
This is your chance to prove your worth in the company to Director Shi and everyone else.

168
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,240
I believe in you.

169
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,859
With your capability, you'll do great.

170
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,499
I assure you, I'll give it my best and live up to the name.

171
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,080
Don't push yourself too hard.

172
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,640
Even if the sky was falling down, I'd be there for you.

173
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:37,339
Go to sleep.

174
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,800
You first.

175
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,039
What is it?

176
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:45,820
I need to check the files of the insulation material.

177
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,320
Don't stay up too late.

178
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,500
Our insulation boards are all imported.

179
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,179
They are the finest polystyrene boards.

180
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:01,879
They are great fire retardants.

181
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:03,320
They will satisfy your need.

182
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,279
Do you have a large amount of ready stock?

183
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,559
I need to request from the headquarters.

184
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:10,879
Considering the production and shipping, it will at least take one month.

185
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,679
Thank you, I will consider it.

186
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:13,900
Sure.

187
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,259
- I look forward to it. 
 - Thank you.

188
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,810
Xieyi.

189
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,759
Hello, Brother Minghao.

190
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,960
Sorry, I've been busy with work lately.

191
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,279
It's more convenient for us to meet here.

192
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:37,039
It's all right. I've read the headlines.

193
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:39,960
I was worried about you. So I decided to pay a visit.

194
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,120
How are you doing?

195
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,480
I'm doing just fine. A'Yan was right.

196
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,080
Now is the time for me to prove my worth with results.

197
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,840
I expected as much from you.

198
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,900
You've always been so strong.

199
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,279
I saw you meeting with a client just now.

200
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,979
What was it about?

201
00:12:56,979 --> 00:12:59,339
It was a construction material supplier.

202
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,259
Why would you need construction materials?

203
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:04,000
Are you renovating the house?

204
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:06,039
It's not me.

205
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:07,639
It's company work.

206
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:11,340
The Lantian Bay project requires a batch of insulation boards.

207
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,799
I need a reliable supplier.

208
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:16,340
Insulation board?

209
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,000
Brother Minghao, do you know someone?

210
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,480
I helped a supplier with a lawsuit.

211
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,720
I think they started out as insulation board agents.

212
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,100
They are very respectable.

213
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,679
Really? Could you introduce them to me?

214
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:33,579
I thought Ocean Hotel had its own suppliers.

215
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:38,519
They do, but our dealings with them were handled by Huo Jian.

216
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:41,979
There could be some illicit transactions.

217
00:13:41,979 --> 00:13:46,979
Insulation boards concern the safety of the Lantian Bay project.

218
00:13:46,979 --> 00:13:49,499
I don't trust them.

219
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:53,819
But I need progress and ready stock.

220
00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:56,220
In that case, I'll contact them.

221
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,039
They sell quality products.

222
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,119
We can have a look at their workshop.

223
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:01,759
How about now?

224
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,179
Is it that urgent?

225
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:05,380
Sure. We can go there right now.

226
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,820
- Thank you, Brother Minghao. 
 - You're welcome.

227
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,759
We've been in the business for over a decade.

228
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,220
You can see the quality of our business partners.

229
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,200
Our production lines are top-notch.

230
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,579
The supply won't be a problem.

231
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:23,279
Your products are decent.

232
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,360
You've met all the safety standards.

233
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,759
This is great.

234
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:28,700
I'm flattered, Miss Su.

235
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,679
We've been looking forward to partnering up with Ocean Hotel.

236
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,800
Great. In that case, let's get down to the contract.

237
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,659
I'll get down to business.

238
00:14:38,659 --> 00:14:42,019
As you know, we need a large supply for the project.

239
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:46,159
So I'm hoping the price can go down a little.

240
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,540
Director Fang.

241
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,399
Miss Su here is my family.

242
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:54,260
She came here with goodwill.

243
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,220
If everything goes well, we can close the deal today.

244
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,340
Sure, Miss Su.

245
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,120
I like your straightforward demeanor.

246
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,440
How about this?

247
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,299
I'll give you a ten percent discount.

248
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:09,220
Make it 20 percent, okay?

249
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,600
Miss Su, that is the best I can do.

250
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,039
Do you know how much that ten percent is?

251
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:16,120
It's almost three million yuan.

252
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,120
We still have a business to run here.

253
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:25,759
Okay.

254
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:28,119
I'll have the contract ready for you.

255
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:29,279
Great.

256
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,240
By the way, Director Fang, could I have the address?

257
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,759
It's the end of the year. Ocean Hotel has a gift for every business partner.

258
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:38,939
And now you are one of our business partners.

259
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,539
We want to send you a gift too.

260
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,120
I appreciate the thought.

261
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,340
One kindness for another.

262
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,039
I'd love to have your address too.

263
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,279
I'm sending it now.

264
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,679
Great.

265
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,080
After the project is over, I'll send a gift to that address.

266
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,919
A token of goodwill. I hope you don't mind.

267
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:57,960
Thank you.

268
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,560
- All the best. 
 - All the best.

269
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:06,760
Brother Minghao. Thanks to you,

270
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,360
I managed to get this great supplier.

271
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,100
I'll tell A'Yan the credits go to you.

272
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,801
Let's not tell Chairman Li.

273
00:16:14,802 --> 00:16:15,720
Why not?

274
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,320
I am Ocean Hotel's legal consultant.

275
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,791
There would be negative rumors if people knew that I knew the supplier.

276
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,599
Understood.

277
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,160
After the contract is signed, let me treat you to dinner.

278
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,820
I'm content that I was able to help.

279
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,600
By the way, you mentioned transferring my sister to another hospital.

280
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,159
It's done.

281
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:40,399
Xieqing needs some time to acclimate.

282
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,419
We'll visit her together when we're free.

283
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,899
Sure.

284
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,360
Mr. Li, that man is Old Qin.

285
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,919
He was in charge of fish breeding at Yunxiao Fishery.

286
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,979
Have you contacted him?

287
00:17:02,979 --> 00:17:06,619
Before the owner Tang Zheng ran away with money, he was owed a large sum of salary.

288
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:08,960
I promise to reimburse him.

289
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,979
Let's go.

290
00:17:09,979 --> 00:17:11,379
Okay.

291
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,300
Good morning, Old Qin.

292
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,920
Mr. Ji.

293
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,779
This must be Chairman Li.

294
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:23,219
He does look like a righteous man.

295
00:17:23,219 --> 00:17:25,920
Old Qin, I'll get to the point.

296
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,620
From what I heard, you were very close with Tang Zheng, the owner of Yunxiao Fishery.

297
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:35,079
Yes. We used to drink and fish together.

298
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:38,900
Who would have thought? He ran away after owing me so much money.

299
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,039
Who was Tang Zheng anyway?

300
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,880
How did a new company manage to become Zhiwei's business partner?

301
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,440
I couldn't be sure either.

302
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,659
When I last met him, I wanted to grab a drink with him and get my money back.

303
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:55,699
But in the end, he got drunk and started crying.

304
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:58,039
He told me he wasn't the owner.

305
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:01,440
He also told me someone used him to launder money.

306
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,219
Did he tell you who the real owner was?

307
00:18:05,219 --> 00:18:06,839
He said it was a girl.

308
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:08,860
I don't know the whole story either.

309
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:13,000
If he didn't have the money, where is it then?

310
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,640
I asked.

311
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,700
He said the money went into an anonymous account.

312
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,920
No one knows about it.

313
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,820
Do you know the account number?

314
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:25,000
How could I possibly know? I'm just a fish breeder.

315
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,799
I'm not even sure if the account existed.

316
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:32,340
I bet he made up some stories so he wouldn't have to pay me.

317
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:36,939
But of course, I believe you are nothing like him.

318
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:41,880
You're good people.

319
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,220
Sure. If you need to know anything, just let me know.

320
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,680
Thank you.

321
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,840
- Bye.
- Thanks.

322
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,259
Mr. Li, do you believe Old Qin's story?

323
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:07,019
Tang Zheng had no reason to lie to him.

324
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:09,779
Besides, drunk people tell the truth.

325
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:11,880
I find the story plausible.

326
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:17,440
If Tang Zheng was merely holding the shares for someone, who could that woman be?

327
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,959
Back then, before Mr. Shen jumped off the building,

328
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,960
he told me he was protecting his family.

329
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,280
He asked me to give up on the investigation.

330
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,520
He said everything was over.

331
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:35,059
I found it baffling. I didn't understand why he would say that.

332
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,840
But now, I think I get it.

333
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,160
Do you think he was a scapegoat?

334
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,259
And the person he protected was his family?

335
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:51,259
If the person could manage transactions and receive the stock,

336
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:53,960
there could only be one person.

337
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,039
That person was Shen Xieqing.

338
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:01,240
Do you think Shen Xieqing is K of Spades?

339
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:07,279
After Zhiwei was shut down, Shen Xieqing lost her mind.

340
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:11,000
If Shen Xieqing forced Huo Jian to bring down Zhiwei...

341
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,860
That doesn't add up. It doesn't make sense.

342
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,720
It must be Xie Minghao!

343
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,519
So far, he's the prime suspect.

344
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,799
He is extremely devious.

345
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:27,480
Back then, he must have given Shen Xieqing support for all her underhand dealings.

346
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,480
So now it's pivotal to find out who owned the anonymous account.

347
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,989
If we find it and check its records,

348
00:20:32,989 --> 00:20:35,599
we can track down where Zhiwei's money went to.

349
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:37,733
We'll have solid proof.

350
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,359
But Shen Xieqing has lost her mind.

351
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,200
Perhaps we could ask Miss Su.

352
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,599
After all, she is Xieqing's sister.

353
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:49,500
Perhaps Miss Su knows a thing or two.

354
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,259
Xieyi had been living abroad.

355
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:57,920
She barely had any idea about her family business.

356
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,700
Shen Xieqing is now her only family.

357
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,119
Before we learn the truth,

358
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,279
I won't trouble her with the case.

359
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:14,960
Mr. Li, you once mentioned when you told Shen Xieqing

360
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,519
Zhiwei had gone bankrupt, she seemed triggered.

361
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:21,079
That means she has regained consciousness.

362
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:24,960
Maybe it's possible that she might remember the anonymous account.

363
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,759
The exposé was merely part of the preparation.

364
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:41,400
More importantly, we need Shi Chuchu to be on our side.

365
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,860
The final blow comes later.

366
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,079
What is your plan now?

367
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:47,160
I've set up the stage for this play.

368
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,480
Your job is to enjoy it.

369
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,620
You read my mind.

370
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,400
Come on. Have a drink.

371
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,200
Cheers, Director Dai.

372
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:58,799
Darn you, Dai!

373
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,519
You tricked me!

374
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,500
You told me it was an exclusive scoop!

375
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,180
The Lantian Bay project was abandoned by Ocean Hotel, it was just a pile of junk!

376
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:10,800
Listen up. I'm in this business for the reputation.

377
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,959
And now what?

378
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,640
Li Zeliang showed the world his new plan for the project firsthand.

379
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,400
I was totally embarrassed!

380
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,860
You are responsible for this!

381
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,600
Watch your attitude!

382
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,680
I paid you. I have the record.

383
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,139
You took bribe money to slander Ocean Hotel.

384
00:22:26,139 --> 00:22:27,480
The proof is undeniable.

385
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,680
Let's analyze the consequences for him.

386
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,599
Your reputation will be ruined.

387
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:35,520
You will spend the rest of your life in jail.

388
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:39,979
Let's sing!

389
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,920
♪ You carry the pole ♪

390
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,640
♪ You lead the horse away ♪

391
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,539
Director Dai has a bad temper. Don't mind it.

392
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,210
Don't worry. We already have a plan to counter it.

393
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:02,059
I have a plan that will not only save your reputation but make you famous.

394
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,380
What is your plan?

395
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,380
You'll know soon enough.

396
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:11,819
Director Dai, to your health.

397
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,360
Cheers.

398
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:28,719
It smells great.

399
00:23:28,719 --> 00:23:30,319
Welcome home.

400
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:32,119
The food just arrived.

401
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,519
Are we having hot pot tonight?

402
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:35,580
Yes.

403
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,539
Aren't you touched by this thoughtful gesture?

404
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,319
A'Yan, I have good news for you.

405
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:46,640
I have found a supplier to provide us with the insulation boards.

406
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,040
- Have a look. 
 - That was fast.

407
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,260
Not bad.

408
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,079
Impressive, Miss Su.

409
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:01,559
Great work.

410
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:05,240
If this is enough to earn your compliment, I need to work even harder.

411
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,540
I must live up to your expectation.

412
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,820
Go wash your hands.

413
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,760
- Then, get ready for dinner. 
 - Sure.

414
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:19,599
A'Yan, what are these crayons for?

415
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:22,799
The last time I visited Xieqing, I startled her.

416
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,652
I think I owe her an apology, so I bought some crayons and drawing sheets.

417
00:24:26,652 --> 00:24:30,140
I plan to visit her again.

418
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,440
But you will have to wait.

419
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,200
After our last visit, my sister's mental state has been unstable.

420
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,519
Brother Minghao transferred her to a different sanatorium.

421
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:41,059
We'll visit her another time.

422
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:48,719
Xie Minghao transferred her to a different sanatorium and wouldn't let you visit her?

423
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:51,480
Brother Minghao wants what's best for my sister.

424
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,219
 Xieyi, wait for me at the parking lot.

425
00:24:58,219 --> 00:24:59,920
 I need to use the restroom.

426
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,420
 Okay.

427
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,400
 No! I'm not going back!

428
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,599
 Don't touch me!

429
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:15,119
 - Are you all right? 
 - None of your concern.

430
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:16,658
 - No! I'm not going back! 
 - Come!

431
00:25:16,658 --> 00:25:19,679
 I'm not going back! Don't touch me!

432
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,000
 I'm not going back!

433
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,700
 Don't touch me!

434
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,519
What's on your mind? Dig in.

435
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,640
Go wash your hands.

436
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,880
Then, you can have dinner.

437
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,739
Fine.

438
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,099
What condiments do you want?

439
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:51,619
I want some soy sauce and vinegar, and some tabasco pepper.

440
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,160
Sorry, Chairman Li. I am busy,

441
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,539
so I can't stay here for too long.

442
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:13,559
Even with all your work, you still make time to look after Xieqing.

443
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:14,759
It couldn't have been easy.

444
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:15,920
Not bad.

445
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:21,060
I am not as busy as you are. After all, you have a big hotel to run.

446
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,499
Xieyi told me Xieqing's condition has deteriorated.

447
00:26:28,499 --> 00:26:30,290
I feel bad for what happened.

448
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:34,480
But fortunately, I know a psychologist.

449
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,650
He is coming to Shanghai.

450
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:39,720
We could let him have a look at Xieqing.

451
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,680
You are too kind, Chairman Li. Thank you.

452
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,400
But that won't be necessary.

453
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,599
I transferred her to a top-notched nursing home.

454
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:51,479
The professional staff takes care of her. She is doing much better now.

455
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,519
But this expert has plenty of experience.

456
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:59,119
It'd be such a shame to miss this opportunity.

457
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:03,839
To be honest with you, I've taken Xieqing to many doctors.

458
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,480
Nothing seemed to work.

459
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,199
But then I realized

460
00:27:07,199 --> 00:27:09,920
what she needs isn't more doctors,

461
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,599
she needs my company and protection.

462
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,480
Which sanatorium has she been transferred to?

463
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,700
Xieyi has been talking about how she missed her sister.

464
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:29,440
As the younger sister, she must see her sister at some point.

465
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,579
Once Xieqing is doing better, I will inform her.

466
00:27:33,579 --> 00:27:34,939
How long will it take?

467
00:27:34,939 --> 00:27:36,640
I wouldn't be too sure.

468
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,720
After all, you caused it.

469
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,619
Had you not agitated Xieqing, I wouldn't have gotten my hands full.

470
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,119
Excuse me, I must go now.

471
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:51,319
Thank you for the coffee.

472
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:07,960
Hello?

473
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,000
 Mr. Li, I searched all the sanatoriums in this city,

474
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,200
 Shen Xieqing isn't in any of them.

475
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,860
I suspect Xie Minghao has never sent Xieqing to a sanatorium.

476
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,039
Follow him.

477
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:22,000
He will go see her eventually.

478
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,300
 Yes.

479
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,260
Xie Minghao is very cautious. Use a different car.

480
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,819
 Yes.

481
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,100
 Deep down, you just want to cover up for her.

482
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:47,279
 Director Shi. It's you who shouldn't let emotions get the better of you.

483
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:53,673
 In the past, you could have found out everything that is suspicious about this case.

484
00:28:53,673 --> 00:28:56,159
 Why would I encourage you to win Chairman Li over?

485
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,539
 That's because I believe you love him more than anyone else.

486
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:03,659
 You are the right person for him. Chairman Li's relationship with Xieyi is just a terrible mistake.

487
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:07,079
 But I lack the evidence to put an end to this mistake.

488
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,400

489
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,160
Hello, Hou Xiaodong.

490
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:22,360
Chuchu. Did you forget about our deal?

491
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,200
I contacted the producer for you.

492
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,279
I even set up the equipment for you.

493
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:29,279
Don't you dare stand me up.

494
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,739
I remember now. When is the performance?

495
00:29:32,739 --> 00:29:35,900
When is it? It's 9:00 tonight.

496
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,240
 It's already over 8:00. Come here now.

497
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,799
Okay, understood.

498
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,499
See you there.

499
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,920

500
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:57,519
Hello, Lawyer Xie.

501
00:29:57,519 --> 00:29:59,960
 Director Shi, where are you now?

502
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,140
What is it?

503
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,320
 Do you remember our plan?

504
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,240
 The time has come.

505
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,980
Thanks.

506
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,900
What do you mean the time has come?

507
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,519
Xieyi is participating in the Lantian Bay project.

508
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:20,400
She just closed a deal with the supplier of all insulation boards.

509
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,820
What?

510
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,799
She always wanted to take part in the project.

511
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,540
She didn't have the chance because of me.

512
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:29,640
But as soon as I went away, she's taking charge.

513
00:30:30,499 --> 00:30:32,240
She really is impatient.

514
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,319
I pointed her to the supplier.

515
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:39,219
He told me Xieyi mentioned an underhand deal

516
00:30:39,219 --> 00:30:41,359
when they were discussing the contract.

517
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:44,980
My guess is the material might be faulty.

518
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:48,480
She just wouldn't give up until she gets what she wants.

519
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,380
The insulation boards concern the project's safety.

520
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,780
There will be severe consequences.

521
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,960
No. I must inform Zeliang.

522
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,860
No. Not yet.

523
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,819
Not yet?

524
00:30:58,819 --> 00:31:01,920
Should we wait until she destroys the whole company?

525
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,559
The purchasing hasn't been completed.

526
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:06,700
Confronting her with this accusation is useless.

527
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,559
I understand your concern.

528
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,019
But we must be patient.

529
00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:14,839
Your report will only be meaningful after the purchasing has been completed.

530
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:17,599
You are right. We need to catch her red-handed.

531
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:22,539
Let's wait. This time, I will expose her true nature.

532
00:31:34,699 --> 00:31:36,299
Minghao.

533
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,900
I noticed that lawyers are usually very rational in their relationships.

534
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:48,259
After all, you are Xieyi's brother-in-law.

535
00:31:48,259 --> 00:31:50,559
But you're helping me to bring her down.

536
00:31:51,859 --> 00:31:55,700
Is it because she ruffled your feathers too?

537
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,540
She is my family.

538
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,060
I love my family.

539
00:32:04,219 --> 00:32:06,359
So, I want her to be safe.

540
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:43,060
Boss we're closing.

541
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,600
Go ahead.

542
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,580
No.

543
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,859
No. No!

544
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,220
Minghao...

545
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,620
Minghao?

546
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,880
Minghao, where are you?

547
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,800
Minghao...

548
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,560
Minghao, where are you?

549
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,060
Minghao?

550
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,320
Minghao?

551
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:42,559
Minghao?

552
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,720
Minghao?

553
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,960
Minghao? Are you here?

554
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,560
Dolls.

555
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:22,279
Stop!

556
00:35:22,279 --> 00:35:24,060
Minghao?

557
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,220
Stand aside!

558
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:35,099
Minghao! I'm so scared.

559
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,900
Let go of me!

560
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,459
Minghao is drunk.

561
00:35:39,459 --> 00:35:41,980
He is so scary. I'm scared.

562
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:44,180
You can tell I got drunk.

563
00:35:45,419 --> 00:35:47,639
But do you know why I was drinking?

564
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,919
Do you know why I was drinking?

565
00:35:51,579 --> 00:35:53,479
It hurts!

566
00:35:54,139 --> 00:35:56,380
You know pain.

567
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:59,460
But do you know my pain?

568
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,079
If it weren't for your pestering,

569
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,239
Xieyi and I would have fallen in love!

570
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,799
Minghao is so scary.

571
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,639
So scary.

572
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:13,860
The doll, my doll!

573
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,300
My doll cares about me.

574
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,859
My doll.

575
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:18,079
You are the best.

576
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,559
- My doll...
- Hand it over.

577
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:21,019
- Hand it over!
- No!

578
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:22,400
That is not yours. Hand it over.

579
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,920
This is mine! This is my doll!

580
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,720
Give it back! 
 - No!

581
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,640
Give it back!

582
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,020
- This is my doll!
- Give it back!

583
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,119
Give it back!

584
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,319
- Listen up!
- I...

585
00:36:33,319 --> 00:36:35,180
This doll is meant for Xieyi.

586
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,659
This is not yours!

587
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:39,459
No... This is my doll.

588
00:36:39,459 --> 00:36:41,880
Give it back to me. Give it back!

589
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,100
I'll say this one more time!

590
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,400
This is not yours.

591
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,480
You took it from her.

592
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,079
You took away my entire life!

593
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:52,879
No!

594
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,859
 This is not yours.

595
00:37:11,859 --> 00:37:13,900
 You took it from her.

596
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,079
 You took away my entire life!

597
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:23,199
 It looks nice. Is this for me?

598
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,000
 Do you like stuffed dolls too?

599
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,260
 I love them.

600
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:29,260
 But I tried the toy crane many times and got nothing.

601
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:32,719
 Could you get more for me in the future?

602
00:37:44,939 --> 00:37:47,039
 It'd be great if you were awake.

603
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:50,939
 If you were awake, you could tell me

604
00:37:50,939 --> 00:37:53,920
 the true reasons behind Zhiwei's bankruptcy.

605
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,460
Xieqing.

606
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,160
Xieqing.

607
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:39,159
What are you doing here?

608
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,040
Do you feel cold?

609
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:46,859
What's wrong?

610
00:38:51,459 --> 00:38:53,620
Minghao was drunk.

611
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,939
He was so scary.

612
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:07,360
Xieqing. I got drunk and said something bad to you.

613
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,080
I didn't mean it. Are you all right?

614
00:39:17,979 --> 00:39:23,679
Xieqing. Do you remember the account number and its password?

615
00:39:32,499 --> 00:39:36,920
Why do I have a feeling you can understand me now?

616
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:43,880
Two years ago, you made a grave mistake.

617
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,660
But I kept you safe.

618
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,400
I've never told anyone your secrets.

619
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,900
Therefore, you must learn to protect yourself.

620
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,159
Mind what you say.

621
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,200
Remember, ever since you lost your mind,

622
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,320
no one will believe a word you say.

623
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,860
I am the only one you have left.

624
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:10,960
By the way, you have a younger sister.

625
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,059
But remember, your father sacrificed himself to protect you.

626
00:40:16,059 --> 00:40:19,900
If your sister finds out you caused his death,

627
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,340
she will never forgive you.

628
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:24,919
She will never see you as her family again.

629
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,119
But it doesn't matter.

630
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:34,719
You still have me.

631
00:40:37,419 --> 00:40:39,860
I will never leave you.

632
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:42,560
We are not like Xieyi.

633
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,800
We are both orphans.

634
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:49,280
We can only rely on each other.

635
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,140
We've been looking after each other since we were kids.

636
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,440
Xieqing.

637
00:41:00,059 --> 00:41:02,299
I must admit everything to you.

638
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,439
I was in love with Xieyi.

639
00:41:05,439 --> 00:41:09,800
But ever since I lost you, I realized you are the one

640
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,319
I love the most.

641
00:41:12,939 --> 00:41:16,059
No one else loves me as you do.

642
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:21,760
No one else cares about me and makes sacrifices for me as you do.

643
00:41:27,259 --> 00:41:32,499
Just as I protect you, you will protect me, right?

♫  you've embarked on a journey to happiness  ♫

656
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:41,930
♫  I didn't save your contact information  ♫

657
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:45,090
♫  But in my heart, I secretly ask  ♫

658
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:47,240
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

659
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,920
♫  How's it going with him?  ♫

660
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,730
♫  I bet his temper is better than mine  ♫

661
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:56,610
♫  He's better at guessing your complicated thoughts  ♫

662
00:42:56,610 --> 00:43:00,410
♫  Does he hold you when you're sad?  ♫

663
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:02,290
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

664
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:04,220
♫  Everything must be going well  ♫

665
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:08,050
♫  Do you want to hear what I haven't said?  ♫

666
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:15,740
♫  Do lyrics of love songs stir up your emotions and recall all of our memories?  ♫

667
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:19,640
♫  It doesn't seem to be difficult  ♫

668
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,110
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

669
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:49,850
♫  How's it going with him?  ♫

670
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:53,660
♫  You and fate have not given me an answer  ♫

671
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:57,580
♫  The price of growing up is like a pile of bargaining chip  ♫

672
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:01,330
♫  The wager is who can let go first  ♫

673
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:03,280
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

674
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,360
♫  Everything must be going well  ♫

675
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,430
♫  Life is not as complicated as I thought  ♫

676
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:13,680
♫  Silence is the best that I can do  ♫

677
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,720
♫  Whatever pain and suffering may come,  ♫

678
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,260
♫  I'm not afraid at all  ♫

679
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:30,380
