00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:15,470

2
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:25,000
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,510
♫  Still haunts me now and then in quiet nights  ♫

4
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:41,330
♫  And turn to face all the long lost times  ♫

5
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,370
♫  Brace the pain  ♫

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:51,210
♫  Let memories wake up from oceans deep  ♫

7
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,250
♫  No place to hide  ♫

8
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,450
♫  No way to run  ♫

9
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,820
♫  New dawn counts down  ♫

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,930
♫  I fight  ♫

11
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,010
♫  I cry  ♫

12
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,600
♫  I give up  ♫

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:15,610
♫  Memories forgotten, forsaken surround  ♫

14
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:24,030
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

15
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:32,470
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

16
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:40,850
♫  Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

17
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:49,650
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

18
00:01:49,650 --> 00:02:00,050

19
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,950

20
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,080
Forget it.

21
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,680
Every time we waited for my nephew, it was just a waste of time.

22
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,680
Very well, let's begin.

23
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,560
Everyone, the main agenda of this meeting

24
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,540
is to discuss the auction that will be held at Yunfeng Hotel.

25
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,120
As we all know...

26
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:49,219
My apologies.

27
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:51,299
Sorry for the long wait.

28
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,299
Zeliang.

29
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:56,840
What a surprise.

30
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,660
How did you manage to have the time for this board meeting?

31
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,180
You are right, Uncle.

32
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,520
From now on, I will dedicate my life to work.

33
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:08,340
All right. Let's get down to business.

34
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,600
Yi Fei, explain the main agendas today.

35
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:18,380
Everyone, our main focus today will be the auction of Yunfeng Hotel.

36
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,660
As you all know, the most famous auction company, Fujiade Auction,

37
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:27,360
will soon select one five-star hotel in Shanghai as the venue for their auction.

38
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,010
Our subsidiary Yunfeng Hotel has managed to make it into the top three choices.

39
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:37,460
Yunfeng Hotel is the five-star hotel we spent billions to build.

40
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,530
If we become the auction venue,

41
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,620
it'll be a worldwide advertisement for our hotel.

42
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,700
But unfortunately, based on the information I got,

43
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:54,192
Mr. Roman from Fujiade Auction has decided to partner up with Zhengde Hotel.

44
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:57,860
Zhengde? They've been our rival all along.

45
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,059
 That's right.

46
00:03:59,059 --> 00:04:04,060
Indeed. It was supposed to be a great opportunity, but we ruined it.

47
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,900
Our rival reaped the benefit.

48
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,060
We'll be mocked in the industry for this failure.

49
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,419
Everyone who participated in the tendering will have their bonus deducted.

50
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,840
I want your reflection report.

51
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,540
Chairman Huo.

52
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,839
Don't you think it's too early to draw any conclusion now?

53
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,279
Zeliang.

54
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:32,018
Judging by your tone, you seem to have a plan.

55
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:36,059
Mr. Roman hasn't signed the contract with Zhengde Hotel just yet.

56
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:38,340
At least, we can still give it a try.

57
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,720
If we admit our defeat before the outcome becomes certain,

58
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,100
that will only boost their pride.

59
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,939
The ratification is tomorrow. We won't make it in time.

60
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,360
Zeliang, listen.

61
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,720
Business is nothing like a video game.

62
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,339
The defeated must accept their punishment.

63
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,399
Very well.

64
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:06,730
If I manage to close the deal with this tendering,

65
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,420
I'll ask only one thing from you.

66
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,460
I want full control over Yunfeng Hotel.

67
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:19,580
What if you fail?

68
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,381
If I fail, I'll resign from all the positions in this company.

69
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,480
Very well.

70
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,059
Zeliang doesn't get fired up for a job very often.

71
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:39,179
Is there anyone who is willing to assist him in this undertaking?

72
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,859
I'll help him.

73
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:55,020
Lawyer Xie, this way.

74
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,940
Xieyi, why are you here?

75
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,580
I was told someone broke into your house, and you even got hurt.

76
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,919
I'm all right, so I thought I should come back to work.

77
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:11,039
Allow me to introduce.

78
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,220
This is Xie Minghao, he's a lawyer.

79
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,519
He has been working with Director Shi's Hengye Bank for some time.

80
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:19,279
He is an outstanding commercial lawyer.

81
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,120
Director Shi referred him to help Ocean Hotel.

82
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,520
Lawyer Xie.

83
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,580
Nice to meet you. I am Su Xieyi.

84
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,160
Hello.

85
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,939
By the way, a burglar broke into my house a few days ago.

86
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:38,059
I'm not really sure about damage compensation.

87
00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:39,660
Could you help me out with it?

88
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,059
Sure. I'll be glad to help.

89
00:06:42,059 --> 00:06:44,979
Secretary Gong just told me she would brief me about the company's situation.

90
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:47,559
Maybe Miss Su could do the honor instead?

91
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,260
Will that be a problem?

92
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,920
No problem.

93
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,620
Let's talk at the cafe downstairs.

94
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,139
Sure.  This way.

95
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:08,460
Brother Minghao, you could have given me a heads-up before coming here.

96
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,979
After the cocktail party, you never picked up your phone.

97
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:12,599
You weren't at your house either.

98
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,120
Where else can I find you if not here?

99
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,720
You know why I'm here. We shouldn't meet here.

100
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,200
But now you can talk to me as one of their employees.

101
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,939
Don't worry. Ocean Hotel and I are merely business partners.

102
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:31,060
Sorry.

103
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,430
A lot had happened lately.

104
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,930
I didn't want to make you worry.

105
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,519
Xieyi.

106
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:43,660
You know, when I couldn't reach you, it'd only make me...

107
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:47,480
It'd only make me and your sister worry about you.

108
00:07:48,739 --> 00:07:50,290
But I thought it through.

109
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,890
Since you insist on executing your plan,

110
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,510
I'll do my best to assist you.

111
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:57,560
Okay.

112
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,680
However, you must never keep any secrets from me.

113
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,560
Just discuss your plans with me.

114
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:22,080
By the way, was Li Zeliang's story during the cocktail party actually true?

115
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,600
He almost spotted me when I was tailing Chen Hengsheng.

116
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,401
He was trying to help, so...

117
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:31,260
So this must never happen again.

118
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,760
Xieyi.

119
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,460
I've been looking everywhere for you.

120
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,819
Why are you with Lawyer Xie?

121
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,859
Lawyer Xie is actually my sister's fiancé.

122
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:46,959
He's my future brother-in-law.

123
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:49,759
I see.

124
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,159
Since he's your brother-in-law, he's my brother-in-law as well.

125
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,180
Brother-in-law, nice to meet you.

126
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,240
Xieyi, contact me if there's anything. I should get going.

127
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,779
Director Li, goodbye.

128
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,820
I've known him since I was a kid.

129
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,980
You don't have to pretend. He knows everything.

130
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,060
I didn't know you two are so close.

131
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,720
- Hello? 
 -  Zeliang, I'm ready.

132
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,019
 We can go now.

133
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:37,419
Okay. See you at the entrance.

134
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,580
I need to go out for some work.

135
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,619
As for you, do your job.

136
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,179
Xieyi, do you have the phone number of that dashing lawyer?

137
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:56,919
Does he have a girlfriend?

138
00:09:56,919 --> 00:10:00,120
I was only asking questions about legal compensation.

139
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,080
Why would I pry so hard?

140
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,539
You already have Director Li. There are plenty of single ladies here in the office.

141
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,139
I am the perfect example.

142
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:12,360
Now that you mentioned it,

143
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,000
he told me he has a fiancée

144
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,700
who looks very much like me.

145
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,739
He's already engaged?

146
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,360
Sister Fei.

147
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,240
I wasn't expecting you to start working so soon.

148
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,240
I must thank you and Chairman Huo for my swift recovery.

149
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,040
Mingyue.

150
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:45,985
Where are Director Shi and Director Li? They aren't in their offices.

151
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:51,679
They are trying to secure Yunfeng Hotel's partnership with Fujiade Auction.

152
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,879
Yunfeng Hotel?

153
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:56,479
What's wrong? It's nothing.

154
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:58,420
Don't worry about it.

155
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,300
Director Shi and Director Li make a good team together.

156
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,639
Nothing could go wrong with them working on it.

157
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,979
I bet you haven't heard.

158
00:11:07,979 --> 00:11:12,320
In the past, Director Shi and Director Li were known as the perfect partners within the industry.

159
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,659
But the person that suits Director Li the most is of course you, Miss Su.

160
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,720
But I think we can't afford to take risks

161
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,510
when it comes to a relationship.

162
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,119
Am I right?

163
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,920
All right, I'll leave you to your work. See you around.

164
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,420
Xieyi, don't listen to her nonsense.

165
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,659
Director Li's heart is all yours.

166
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:48,220
But I think Director Li was a little headstrong this time.

167
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,779
From what I heard, he even swore to resign if he failed

168
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:56,080
to secure the deal with Fujiade Auction.

169
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,280
- Seriously? 
 - Yes.

170
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,640
Not to mention Fujiade Auction and Zhengde Hotel are about to close the deal.

171
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,580
To make such a promise now...

172
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:08,760
Do you think he did it because he really doesn't want to go to work?

173
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:13,139
Fujiade Auction?

174
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:20,539
Xieyi? Xieyi?

175
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:25,220
Hello, Brother Ji. Where are you now?

176
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,600
Putting Su Xieyi into our equation...

177
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,280
A brilliant move indeed.

178
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,840
The Shi family has deep roots here.

179
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,920
We'll be at risk if Chuchu is working with Li Zeliang.

180
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,130
We have Zhengde Hotel that is closing a deal,

181
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,520
and now we have Su Xieyi to stir up trouble.

182
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,919
It'll be very challenging for the duo to succeed.

183
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:01,220
Let's not let our guard down. I can feel it's different this time.

184
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,540
Follow them.

185
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,979
Keep me posted on everything.

186
00:13:04,979 --> 00:13:06,379
Yes.

187
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:17,840
Hello, the gin and tonic you ordered.

188
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,440
Thanks.

189
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,080
- I'll have a Mojito. 
 - Sure.

190
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:28,460
Remember, the mint must be crushed until you get the juice.

191
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,819
Use half a lime.

192
00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:34,100
Add the sucrose before the mint.

193
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,859
That will bring out the rum's sugary scent.

194
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:39,720
Different layers of flavors will then be created.

195
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,480
Thanks.

196
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,419
- Hold on. 
 - Yes?

197
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:47,799
I'll have a Mojito just the way she ordered.

198
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:54,200
Hi, I am Nina.

199
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm Cicely.

200
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:06,100
Mr. Roman, I appreciate that you are willing to meet us.

201
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,120
This is our proposal.

202
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,620
Director Li, Director Shi, I agreed to meet you

203
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,739
not because I want to discuss the auction.

204
00:14:15,739 --> 00:14:18,501
I merely want to make some friends.

205
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,850
I know. Ocean is a great hotel. But Zhengde is just as great.

206
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,000
They have a long history as a hotel.

207
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,710
Our objective is to work with the best there is.

208
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:35,580
Mr. Roman, I must thank you for acknowledging Ocean Hotel.

209
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,719
I was told you and your wife would stay in Shanghai for quite a while.

210
00:14:38,719 --> 00:14:43,580
May we have the honor of inviting you and your wife to stay in Ocean?

211
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,499
I appreciate the offer.

212
00:14:45,499 --> 00:14:50,000
But Zhengde Hotel has provided us with remarkable accommodation.

213
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,700
The next time I come to Shanghai,

214
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:56,170
I will be sure to experience the top-notched Ocean Hotel.

215
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,679
This tastes amazing.

216
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,159
Mojito for the first love, gin and tonic for the crush.

217
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:17,540
To create this sweet and sour flavor, the key is none other than

218
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,260
the lime.

219
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:37,859
When Roman proposed to me that night, this is how it felt like.

220
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,480
It was at the venue of the 19th Thomas Cup.

221
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,899
He proposed right before the crowd.

222
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,480
That sounds very romantic.

223
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,139
Was it the time Larson turned the table?

224
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:54,639
Why? Are you interested in badminton too?

225
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,239
Yes.

226
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,100
It seems we can get along very well.

227
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,839
Mr. Roman, please give us five minutes to explain our proposal to you.

228
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:10,420
I'll be honest with you, Director Li.

229
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:15,000
My company has signed the letter of intent with Zhengde.

230
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,221
If nothing goes wrong, we will not make any changes to our plans for the partnership.

231
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,860
Mr. Roman. The reason you chose to hold the auction in Shanghai

232
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:30,119
because you want to open up the market of artwork auctioning in mainland China.

233
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:33,040
You chose to hold the auction in a five-star hotel

234
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,420
because the hotel would have a clientele

235
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:46,440
With all due respect, my father is the current president of Hengye Bank.

236
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:52,259
Our bank also has an outstanding clientele which possesses great resources.

237
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:57,200
Many of them are art enthusiasts and potential buyers.

238
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,820
If you choose to partner up with Ocean Hotel,

239
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,720
I assure you your company will have the best clientele

240
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,380
of both Ocean Hotel and Hengye Bank.

241
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,800
Mr. Roman, I'm sure you know

242
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:26,540
for an auction to be a success, the key is record-breaking selling price.

243
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:32,119
For this upcoming auction, our bank will provide a specialized loan

244
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:35,480
to stimulate and increase the purchasing ability of our clients.

245
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:40,959
I believe it will greatly increase the chance of an item being sold at a record-breaking price.

246
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:44,599
For both parties, this is the best advertisement.

247
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:45,719
That's right.

248
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:50,559
Mr. Roman, you mentioned you wanted to work with the best partner there is.

249
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,679
I believe with Ocean Hotel and Hengye Bank joining hands, we'll be unstoppable.

250
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,160
So I really hope you can reconsider our proposal.

251
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,300
We will make sure the auction is one that makes headlines and history.

252
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:09,939
Honestly, I am tempted.

253
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,500
But Director Li, you must understand.

254
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,740
In business, a promise must never be broken.

255
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:23,319
I gave them my word, so I never change my mind so easily.

256
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,620
Honey.

257
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,619
Honey, let me introduce you.

258
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:34,240
This is Director Li's girlfriend, Miss Su.

259
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,080
- Su Xieyi. 
- She and I get along very well.

260
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,600
Miss Su here is also a fan of Larson.

261
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,039
She also invited both of us to a badminton match.

262
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:47,200
Is that so?

263
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,040
I hope I have the honor. Mr. Roman, will you accept my challenge?

264
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,480
Sure.

265
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,279
I've heard the Romans was crowned the best players in the financial industry.

266
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:06,939
It'll be Xieyi's honor to have a match with both of you.

267
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,699
Why don't we have a double to make it more fun?

268
00:19:10,699 --> 00:19:14,080
I'd love to experience your prowess as badminton players.

269
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,459
If that's fine with you, we'll be glad to.

270
00:19:17,459 --> 00:19:18,519
That's great.

271
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:19,920
Director Li.

272
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,020
Don't worry, I'll manage.

273
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:24,880
See you at the badminton court.

274
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,620
See you there.

275
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,060
Please.

276
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,000
- See you later. 
 - See you.

277
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,800
Let's go, Honey.

278
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,619
We should go too.

279
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:09,640
Hello, Chairman Huo.

280
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,680
A badminton match?

281
00:20:12,899 --> 00:20:14,799
This is interesting.

282
00:20:19,979 --> 00:20:23,119
Miss Su, Zeliang can't play.

283
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:25,079
You must stop him from joining the match.

284
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:29,079
There are things worse than you can imagine.

285
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:33,720
Director Shi, I am well aware of the situation.

286
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,419
If you know the risk, you should stop him from playing.

287
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:37,960
It'll only do him more harm.

288
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,820
I'm not harming him.

289
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,839
It's just that... I believe in him.

290
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:47,039
Perhaps he is much stronger than you think.

291
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,720
You just refuse to believe it.

292
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:12,140
Mr. Roman, see you at the court.

293
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:27,761
Chuchu...

294
00:21:27,761 --> 00:21:29,620
I'll play on your behalf.

295
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,879
Never mind. I'll do it myself.

296
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,820
Are you ready?

297
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,260
You take care of the rear side.

298
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,519
I'll leave the front side to you.

299
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:55,919
- No problem. 
 - Okay.

300
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,280
Director Li.

301
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,240
Mr. Roman.

302
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,400
Are you sure about this?

303
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,319
Of course.

304
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:11,839
Very well. Let's begin.

305
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:14,259
Sure.

306
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:30,130
♫  Perhaps destiny got bored of all of this  ♫

307
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:33,710
♫  The two rivals run into each other  ♫

308
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,410
♫  Passed by, all is forgotten  ♫

309
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:38,960
♫  Showing up after the next corner  ♫

310
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,250
Why is he here?

311
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,600
♫  You're looking for the danger signs  ♫

312
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,039
♫  I was too headstrong and made it worse  ♫

313
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,500
Ignore him. Serve.

314
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,770
♫  So the effort for love doesn't go to waste  ♫

315
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:59,500
♫  The two heartbeats spike  ♫

316
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,000
♫  An alarm for reality sounds  ♫

317
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,620
♫  So why wouldn't I run for my life?  ♫

318
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,420
♫  What should I do with this rivalry   ♫

319
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:15,410
♫  So you wouldn't mistake it for a downplay  ♫

320
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:19,610
♫  I've practiced so many times  ♫

321
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:22,110
♫  I won't lose so soon  ♫

322
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:25,630

♫  Is the proof of me falling for you  ♫

324
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,900
♫  I hope you notice it  ♫

325
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,800
♫  And feel what I feel  ♫

326
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:50,800
♫  This rivalry is far from over  ♫

327
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:55,780
♫  Love is the proof of us underestimating it  ♫

328
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,800
♫  I'm waiting for you to convince yourself  ♫

329
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,070
♫  Please answer as I did  ♫

330
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:12,770
♫  So believe me  ♫

331
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:19,020
♫  All it takes is a little more courage  ♫

332
00:24:30,699 --> 00:24:32,299
He lost.

333
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,040
No. He won.

334
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:01,060
Mr. Roman. I lost.

335
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:06,039
I hope... we can still be business partners.

336
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,520
Let's go.

337
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:20,299
Director Li.

338
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,460
You are truly a strong one. You left me impressed.

339
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:30,680
Congratulations, you've won yourself an overtime.

340
00:25:32,019 --> 00:25:34,559
That's great, Zeliang! We did it!

341
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,499
We've won ourselves an overtime! This is great!

342
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,440
It's great to be young.

343
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,159
Director Li, put on the blanket.

344
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,319
The doctor specifically told you not to partake in sports,

345
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:38,540
especially vigorous sports.

346
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,039
This isn't the first time.

347
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:44,080
Don't get too worked up.

348
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:48,560
Yingsong, you know,

349
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:53,240
this is the happiest day I've had in two years.

350
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:11,700
Over the past two years, I've gotten used to living like a worthless person.

351
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:16,440
All of you took care of me meticulously.

352
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,279
You tried not to hurt my pride.

353
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:19,939
I understand.

354
00:27:19,939 --> 00:27:22,100
You did it for me.

355
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:26,419
That was also why I've never got upset over it.

356
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:32,080
But Su Xieyi is different.

357
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:33,919
 She understands me.

358
00:27:34,659 --> 00:27:39,130
 Only she treated me like a normal person,

359
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,310
 a healthy person.

360
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:46,080
Miss Su is very unique.

361
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,819
Certainly.

362
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,140
I knew she'd be different from the others

363
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,759
 when I first saw her.

364
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,880
Why the long face?

365
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:11,519
By the way, how is the mission I gave you?

366
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:12,699
Don't worry, Mr. Li.

367
00:28:12,699 --> 00:28:15,959
I've ordered my man to get Miss Su a room at Ocean.

368
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:17,939
She'll be living in the hotel lately.

369
00:28:17,939 --> 00:28:21,300
Huo Jian's henchmen wouldn't dare to hurt her there.

370
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,079
I'll get some hot water for the warm compress.

371
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,679
Okay.

372
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:44,170
♫  The flower that's been asleep for too long  ♫

373
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:47,710
♫  Is emanating its fragrance  ♫

374
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,000
♫  Be my lover  ♫

375
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,640
♫  I've wanted to tell you  ♫

376
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:57,630
♫  You're the most beautiful girl that I've ever seen  ♫

377
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:00,900
♫  You're the sunshine for me  ♫

378
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,300
♫  The brilliant moment of the firework  ♫

379
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,920
♫  Is far from a match for me  ♫

380
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,170
♫  How long will it be?  ♫

381
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,770
♫  Before I can finally hold your hand  ♫

382
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:16,850
♫  I'll Waltz and tell you  ♫

383
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:20,120
♫  Because you're my angel  ♫

384
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,270
♫  Baby, I love you  ♫

385
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:24,880
♫  I feel you, I need you  ♫

386
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,450
♫  I want to be happy because of you  ♫

387
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:30,940
 It's been so long since I last played. My entire body is sore.

388
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,970
 How are you holding up?

389
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,720
 I'm fine.

390
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,599
 You need to exercise more.

391
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:41,119
 We should go rock climbing together.

392
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,699
 Sure, I'm game.

393
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,970

394
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:55,139
Hello, Chuchu.

395
00:29:55,139 --> 00:29:56,500
 Hello, Zeliang.

396
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,759
Tomorrow at 9 AM, Mr. Roman will come to our office for a final negotiation.

397
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:04,839
Before that, there are some minor details I wish to discuss with you.

398
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:06,500
Sure.

399
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,559
I just finished making the adjustments.

400
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,880
I marked all the parts that require more attention.

401
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,900
I've sent the file to your inbox.

402
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,500
Sure.

403
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,599

404
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:19,299
I got the file.

405
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,459
How is your leg?

406
00:30:24,459 --> 00:30:26,059
I'm fine.

407
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,680
Zeliang.

408
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,400
I'm glad to see you get it together again.

409
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,839
 But I must say,

410
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:38,160
you were too reckless today.

411
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:42,359
Whatever the case is, your health must always come first. Is that clear?

412
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:45,520
Chuchu. You know me well.

413
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,519
Once I've made up my mind, I'll see it through.

414
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:51,519
 Check the email.

415
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:53,240
 Let me know if there's a problem.

416
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,420
Okay. I...

417
00:31:09,459 --> 00:31:11,279
 I'm not harming him.

418
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:15,039
 It's just that I believe in him.

419
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,200
 Perhaps he is much stronger than you think.

420
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,720
It's just that you refuse to believe it.

421
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,350
♫  I don't know how to win your heart  ♫

422
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:26,200
♫  I don't know how to be the one for you  ♫

423
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,740
♫  To be good enough for you  ♫

424
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:33,039
♫  But you're just like a distant star  ♫

425
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,739
 The heroes in legends will always rise when the world doubts them.

426
00:31:36,739 --> 00:31:38,460
 All the best tomorrow.

427
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,130

428
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:47,770
♫  Before my heart comes apart  ♫

429
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:54,170
♫  Circle of love  ♫

430
00:31:57,699 --> 00:32:01,079
 The most novel part of our proposal is the auctioning.

431
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:05,359
Not only are we combining both online and offline bidding simultaneously,

432
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,617
we will always cooperate with your company to build a collection IP,

433
00:32:09,617 --> 00:32:13,540
uplifting the reputation and the value of your auctioning items.

434
00:32:16,326 --> 00:32:21,100
Aside from the novel approaches for the auction and quality accommodation service,

435
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,075
we will also hire the security that is renowned internationally

436
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,020
to provide protection throughout the auction.

437
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:30,259
Internally, we will start giving training regarding security measures

438
00:32:30,259 --> 00:32:33,920
to make sure the whole process is executed flawlessly.

439
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,519
I hope you can give us a chance to prove our worth, Mr. Roman.

440
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:43,060
Let us present to the world a flawless and historical auction.

441
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:53,400
Director Li, your proposal is indeed filled with refreshing ideas.

442
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,260
It's very comprehensive.

443
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:59,379
As I mentioned before, I want to work with the best there is.

444
00:32:59,379 --> 00:33:02,176
I can say for sure that you

445
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:05,005
are certainly it.

446
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:13,300
Mr. Roman, I appreciate that you chose us over your partnership with Zhengde.

447
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,160
That requires a great capacity on your end.

448
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:19,939
Therefore, we will not let your trust in us go to waste.

449
00:33:21,259 --> 00:33:23,559
On one hand,

450
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:28,619
your proposal and your sincerity are very assuring.

451
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:35,360
On the other hand, I stumbled upon an unpleasant event at the Zhengde Hotel

452
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,300
when I was there yesterday.

453
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,250
 It was lost at this very hotel.

454
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,210
 You must be responsible for this.

455
00:33:42,219 --> 00:33:44,960
 Sorry. We are searching for it as we speak.

456
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,100
 Searching for it? It's been one week, and you've found nothing.

457
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,240
 Please be patient.

458
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,219
 We have a lot of customers, so it takes time to investigate.

459
00:33:53,219 --> 00:33:56,180
 Forget it. You might as well just pay for the loss.

460
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,640
 I'm tired of questioning you.

461
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,960
 Lady, your item was never with us for safekeeping.

462
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,639
 As the policy goes, we are not responsible for the loss.

463
00:34:04,639 --> 00:34:07,359
 Watch your attitude!

464
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,819
Many priceless and exquisite items will be present during the auction.

465
00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:16,100
We need rigorous security measures.

466
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:21,080
I cannot entrust these items to a hotel that is so irresponsible.

467
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,879
I find your security solution very impressive.

468
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,060
It's rigorous and comprehensive.

469
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:32,003
It's assuring to know I can leave the auction in your hand.

470
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,219
Thank you for the acknowledgment.

471
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:37,519
We appreciate the compliment, Mr. Roman.

472
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:41,619
This partnership is pivotal for both of our companies.

473
00:34:41,619 --> 00:34:46,300
Therefore, I will see to everything personally.

474
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,920
I see.

475
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:52,679
Uncle, as the chairman, your hands are full of many works.

476
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:55,679
Perhaps I should be in charge of the auction.

477
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,979
After all, I know the plan best.

478
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,739
Zeliang, I'm glad to know you're so determined.

479
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:07,100
But you are still a recovering patient.

480
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,699
The auction will be a lot of work.

481
00:35:10,699 --> 00:35:13,253
It's best not to let your body take a toll.

482
00:35:13,253 --> 00:35:15,559
- Uncle... 
 - Chairman Huo.

483
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:20,779
Perhaps you should have witnessed the exciting badminton match

484
00:35:20,779 --> 00:35:23,460
Director Li and Mr. Roman had yesterday.

485
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,320
They were evenly matched.

486
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,079
He is in great physical condition.

487
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,540
Preparation for the auction won't be a problem for him at all.

488
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,840
Chairman Huo, I chose Ocean Hotel over Zhengde

489
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,549
not only because of the potential it has,

490
00:35:40,549 --> 00:35:44,760
but also because I personally respect Director Li.

491
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,600
I believe in his capability.

492
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,089
By the way, you might not know it,

493
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:53,580
but Director Li and Miss Su managed

494
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,880
to defeat my wife and me  with a great lead.

495
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:03,260
Since you think so highly of him, Mr. Roman,

496
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:07,800
Zeliang, make sure to give it your best.

497
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,519
Do not ruin it.

498
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,520
Don't worry, Chairman Huo.

499
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,960
I assure you, Mr. Roman, that I won't let you down.

500
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,359
Great.

501
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,845
By the way, Miss Su,

502
00:36:25,845 --> 00:36:31,339
my wife told me you taught her to use lime for cocktails.

503
00:36:31,339 --> 00:36:34,360
The result was superb.

504
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:39,779
I hope to try your cocktail when I'm at Yunfeng Hotel.

505
00:36:39,779 --> 00:36:40,840
Of course.

506
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:45,760
Please let Mrs. Roman know that I will prepare a cocktail for her. She will like it.

507
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,560
Sure.

508
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,359
Li Zeliang was out of line!

509
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:58,860
He sidelined you in front of everyone!

510
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,000
Can't you tell?

511
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,020
As per the rules, a new chairman will be re-elected soon.

512
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,687
If he's trying to get attention now,

513
00:37:04,687 --> 00:37:07,019
his target won't just be Yunfeng Hotel.

514
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:11,659
Those who supported Zeliang's father was displeased that you were elected.

515
00:37:11,659 --> 00:37:13,399
Li Zeliang is in the picture now.

516
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:15,265
If the auction is a success, you might—

517
00:37:15,265 --> 00:37:17,382
It's easier that way.

518
00:37:17,382 --> 00:37:21,159
If it's the attention he wants, let him try.

519
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:23,920
If he flops,

520
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:27,420
he will never rise again.

521
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,360
Indeed.

522
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,300
The auction will be held at Yunfeng Hotel instead of Ocean Hotel,

523
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:37,459
but Yunfeng Hotel's General Manager, Chen Hengsheng, still works for you.

524
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,180
I need to reconsider every step of this game.

525
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:44,000
It could be an opportunity for Li Zeliang,

526
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:47,180
but it could also be mine.

527
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:54,610
Mr. Li, this is the file on the auctioning items

528
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,440
and the guests' registration details.

529
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,800
Are you okay with going to Yunfeng Hotel?

530
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,619
If it's too hard for you, you don't have to go.

531
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:06,960
I must go because it's Yunfeng Hotel.

532
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,499
Very well. Pack up your things. We'll set out tomorrow.

533
00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:11,400
So soon?

534
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,339
What? Is there a problem?

535
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:16,119
No.

536
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:19,420
Director Li, may I apply for a day off?

537
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:23,320
Before we go to Yunfeng Hotel, I want to pay my sister a visit.

538
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,619
She's sick and is in a hospital.

539
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:27,259
Sure.

540
00:38:27,259 --> 00:38:29,119
I'll be going now.

541
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,819
Wait.

542
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,219
Stay safe. Return to the hotel before nightfall.

543
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:39,719
I will.

544
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:54,580
Yingsong, Xieyi is going out this afternoon.

545
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,079
Follow her.

546
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,260
I don't want any trouble before leaving for Yunfeng Hotel.

547
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,660
Yes.

548
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:16,239
Here are your mung bean cakes.

549
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:18,579
Thanks.

550
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:16,360

551
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:35,339
Xieqing, are you drawing Xieyi?

552
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:37,299
What are you two drawing?

553
00:40:37,299 --> 00:40:39,679
Speak of the devil.

554
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:45,400
Xieqing, is that me? I'm not that fat.

555
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:48,060
Fine, that's me.

556
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,519
I'm the fat one, okay?

557
00:40:51,339 --> 00:40:54,039
Check out the snack I brought you.

558
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:57,199
This is your favorite mung bean cake.

559
00:40:57,199 --> 00:40:58,539
Here.

560
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:02,520
Xieqing. Clean your hands before eating.

561
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,059
Come on.

562
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:10,140
- Okay, you can eat now. 
 - Here.

563
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:31,480
You're working today. How did you make it here?

564
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,500
I took a leave to come here.

565
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,020
I'll go on a business trip tomorrow.

566
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:37,639
I can't visit my sister for quite some time.

567
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:38,639
Where are you going?

568
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:41,320
Is it Yunfeng Hotel?

569
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,439
Yes.

570
00:41:43,439 --> 00:41:47,220
It's the same Yunfeng Hotel refurbished from Zhiwei Building.

571
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:51,259
Xieyi, Chen Hengsheng is in charge of Yunfeng Hotel.

572
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:52,820
He's a cunning one.

573
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,679
Make sure you stay safe.

574
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,159
Don't worry.

575
00:41:56,159 --> 00:42:00,239
I am Li Zeliang's personal assistant and his official girlfriend.

576
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:02,799
He wouldn't dare to harm me.

577
00:42:02,799 --> 00:42:08,360
- Besides, he wasn't the true culprit. 
 - What do you mean?

578
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,799
Chen Hengsheng was taking orders from Huo Jian.

579
00:42:12,799 --> 00:42:16,459
Zhiwei was closed down because of Huo Jian's doing.

580
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:21,360
Hou Jian is Ocean Hotel's chairman.

581
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,599
You are no match for him.

582
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:26,679
Whether that's the case or not, we'll have to try to know.

583
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,780
Xieqing? What's wrong?

584
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,079
Were you choking?

585
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,900
Come on.

586
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,579
Have some water.

587
00:42:37,579 --> 00:42:39,079
Here.

588
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:44,579
Sister, be patient.

589
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,360
I will apprehend the culprit that ruined our family from Zhiwei Building.

590
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,020
You will get well by then.

591
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,720
Am I right?

592
00:42:58,199 --> 00:43:01,519
Let's hope that day comes sooner.

593
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:03,319
It will.

594
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:14,190
