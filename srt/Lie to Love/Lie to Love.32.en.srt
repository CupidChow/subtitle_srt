Mr. Dai.

20
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,280
The Finance Department said

21
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,439
that we're running out of funds

22
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,080
to buy back Zhengde's shares.

23
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,159
What?

24
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,479
Why would this happen?

25
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,800
What do I pay you for?

26
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:20,000
Mr. Dai, calm down!

27
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,800
Calm down.

28
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,719
Calm down, Mr. Dai.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,319
Calm down?

30
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,560
How am I to calm down?

31
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:28,960
Does losing your temper
help to solve the problem?

32
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,280
Mr. Xie.

33
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,199
Tell me.

34
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,439
What should I do?

35
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:37,960
Once the stock price

36
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,960
drops below 30 percent,

37
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,240
Aihong Fund

38
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,840
will take back all of my pledged shares.

(Aihong Fund, Mr. Sun)

40
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,039
Speak of the devil.

41
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:58,879
Mr. Sun.

42
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,039
I understand.

43
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,639
It's all just rumors.

44
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:05,759
Okay.

45
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,800
Don't worry.

46
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:07,960
Don't worry.

47
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,039
Sure.

48
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,520
You may hang up.

49
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:11,960
Have tea sometime.

50
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,560
Mr. Sun from Aihong Fund called

51
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:20,840
and made it clear

52
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,680
that once the stock price

53
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:23,800
falls below 30 percent,

54
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,080
I'll have to either meet a margin call

55
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,479
or make an early repayment.

56
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,639
How do I get the money to repay him?

57
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,840
Mr. Xie, say something.

58
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,159
How about this, Mr. Dai?

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,159
Let's hold a meeting with the employees

60
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,039
to prevent any further leaks

61
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,280
that will be detrimental to the company.

62
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,800
Get the PR Department

63
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,039
to take more pictures that show unity

64
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,120
and we'll figure out our next moves.

65
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:53,919
Unity?

66
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,159
Okay. You can get to it.

67
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,599
Okay. I know.

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,839
As expected,

69
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,639
Dai Zi Ang is at his wit's end

70
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,399
and decided to call for a staff meeting

71
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,600
to keep the company on an even keel.

72
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,199
Since

73
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,839
he has had the stage ready for us,

74
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,680
let's join the fun

75
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,120
and give him the final blow.

76
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,879
I hope everyone can stay united

77
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:39,879
to get through this difficult time.

78
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,160
For the people
who started these rumors,

79
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,480
we're going to sue them.

80

(Zhengde Hotel)
(Staff Assembly)

81
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,839
Are you sure you want to do that?

82
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:47,720
Why is Mr. Li here?

83
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:48,720
It's Li Ze Liang.

84
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,480
Why is he here?

85
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,560
I've clarified the issues

86
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,439
that need to be addressed.

87
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,040
The meeting ends here.

88
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:58,720
You're dismissed.

89
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,360
It ended just like that?

90
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,300
(Zhengde Hotel)
(Staff Assembly)

91
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,480
Hold on.

92
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:16,959
Mr. Li.

93
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:18,680
Anything else?

94
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,000
Someone wants to see you.

95
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,240
Save it.

Xie Ming Hao.

97
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,600
You never

98
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,399
saw this coming, right?

99
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:30,959
Xie Qing.

100
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,040
What are you talking about?

101
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:32,920
Do you know

102
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,360
how hard I looked for you?

103
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,160
I even asked the police to help.

104
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:37,079
I didn't expect you

105
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,639
to be with Li Ze Liang.

106
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,360
Xie Ming Hao.

107
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,079
Drop the act.

108
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,560
Back then, you tricked me

109
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,160
into transferring Zhiwei's assets

110
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,959
and made me think I was pregnant

111
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,560
and begged my dad for forgiveness.

112
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,079
But who knew it pushed my dad

113
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,279
to take the blame for me
and ended up taking his own life.

114
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,839
Not too long ago,

115
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,439
you knew I had regained consciousness

116
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,160
and had me put under house arrest.

117
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,199
You even created a fake scene
of my suicide.

118
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,800
You're a lawyer.

119
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,439
You should know better

120
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,480
about the crimes you committed.

121
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,279
I've made the call to turn myself in.

122
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,279
The police will be here soon.

123
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:11,759
You won't get away with it.

124
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:19,040
Xie Qing.

125
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,199
You might be a mental patient.

126
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,879
But you can't just make things up.

127
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,319

130
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,879
Everything I said is the truth.

131
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,240

132
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:34,839
Stop messing around.

Come on.

134
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,199
Let's go home.

135
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,920
The money

136
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,639
went into your account.

137
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,759
You won't get away with it either.

138
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,079
Two years ago,

139
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,399
when I found out
that you were K of Spades,

140
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,079
I've been collecting
the evidence of your crimes.

141
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,040
I went soft-hearted

142
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,120
and wanted to spare you.

143
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,240
That was why

144
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,879
I tried to jump off the balcony.

145
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,000
Very well.

146
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,600
Right now,

147
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,830
(Zhiwei Group Billing Details)
these can be put to use.

148
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,360
Indeed,

149
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,639
Zhiwei's money went into my account.

150
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,560
But there are also transaction details

151
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:05,639
of the money

152
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,480
going into the bank card
under your name.

153
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,279
The recording of you

154
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,439
instigating me
to embezzle Zhiwei's funds

155
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,240
and the screenshots of the messages
that you sent to Huo Jian

156

under the name of K of Spades

157
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:18,240
to force him to commit the crimes.

158
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,319
Are these

159
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,560
considered as evidence?

160
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,959
Xie Ming Hao.

161
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,639
Even at this point,

162
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,560
don't you have an ounce of remorse?

163
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,240
I once loved you.

164
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,079
I hate it the most when you say that!

165
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,120
If it weren't for you,

166
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:39,680
Shen Zhi Hong

167
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,920
wouldn't stop me from pursuing Xie Yi.

168
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,079
All of this

169
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,600
started with you.

170
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,240
Xie Ming Hao.

171
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:46,519
You once took care

of Xie Yi back then.

173
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:48,839
So here's a piece of advice for you.

174
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,639
Turn yourself in.

175
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:52,639
Fine.

176
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,720
It looks like I don't have a choice now.

177
00:07:58,439 --> 00:07:59,199
Don't move!

178
00:07:59,439 --> 00:07:59,879
Xie Ming Hao!

179
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,720
Li Ze Liang!

180
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:01,600
Don't come over!

181
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,079
Or I'll stab her!

182
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,319
Take it easy!

183
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,399
Don't come over.

184
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,000
Don't come over!

185
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:07,920
Xie Ming Hao!

186
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:08,920
Are you out of your mind?

187
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,199
Shut up, Shen Xie Qing!

188
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,160
Move over there.

189
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,319
And you!

190
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,199
- Get out of the way!
- Move over!

191
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,199
Move over!

192
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:15,720
Don't go over there!

193
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,839
Xie Ming Hao,
the police will be here soon.

194
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,279
Stay away from me!

195
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,000
What are you trying to do?

196
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,040
Xie Yi.

197
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,639
I'll save us

198
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:24,800
some alone time to talk later.

199
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,120
Stop taking pictures!

200
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,360
Let go of her!

201
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,160
Get lost!

202
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:32,960
Xie Ming Hao.

203
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,720
It's just the two of us now.

204
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,360
What do you want to talk about?

205
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,279
That's the look.

206
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,840
You keep giving me

207
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,320
that look.

208
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,519
They can look down on me

209
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,679
or despise me.

210
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,799
But not you!

211
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,360
Xie Yi!

212
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,120
Don't come over!

213
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:53,200
Xie Ming Hao.

214
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,919
Let go of Xie Yi.

215
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,679
The police are here.

216
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,679
Are you out of your mind?

217
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,399
So what if I am?

218
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,519
I just want an answer.

219
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:02,960
I was despised and looked down upon

220
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,759
since I was a kid.

221
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,919
I've worked so hard

222
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:06,919
all these years

223
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,159
to be acknowledged by the world.

224
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,240
But why?

225
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,799
Why the person that matters most to me

226
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,519
doesn't notice me?

227
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:14,360
Xie Ming Hao!

228
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:17,360
I'm sorry for what happened to you
during your childhood.

229
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:18,519
Your whole life

230
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,960
is about pursuing a sense of identity,

231
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,799
good grades,

232
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,480
a good job, and good status.

233
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,440
You desperately want

234
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,559
to pursue all the good things

235
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:28,720
to prove your success

236
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,360
and get recognition from others.

237
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:32,399
To you,

238
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:33,799
Xie Yi is the most beautiful gift

239
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,080
in the world for you.

240
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,159
You want to have her

241
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,000
simply

242
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,320
for the same reason!

243
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,120
That's not love!

244
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,799
If you really love her,

245
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,559
how could you bear to hurt her?

246
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,600
Nonsense!

247
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:45,519
Xie Ming Hao!

248
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,559
In this world,

249
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,279
you're the one

250
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,440
who despises yourself the most!

251
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:50,799
Let go of Xie Yi

252
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,840
and set yourself free.

253
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,679
Fine!

254
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,759
Li Ze Liang.

255
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:00,399
You love Su Xie Yi, don't you?

256
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:01,639
I'll give you a chance

257
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:02,960
in exchange for her safety.

258
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,240
Will you take it?

259
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:05,000
Say it!

260
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:06,639
I'll agree to it!

261
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,639
Yan, no!

262
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:08,799
Don't listen to him!

263
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,399
Xie Ming Hao!

264
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,559
Don't try anything!

265
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,679
Jump off from here.

266
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,200
A life for a life.

267
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,279
That's fair enough!

268
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:22,480
Okay.

269
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,039
I'll do it!

270
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,960
Xie Ming Hao.

271
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,279
You're a man.

272
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,759
Remember

273
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:36,240
what you promised me.

274
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:51,799
Jump!

275
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,039
Do it now!

276
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:53,879
Jump.

277
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:57,159
Jump!

278
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,159
Xie Yi!

279
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:07,679

00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,039
Are you Dai Zi Ang?

299
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,120
We're from
the Economic Investigation Corps

300
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:13,159
of the Municipal Public Security Bureau.

301
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,559
You're suspected of inciting another
to commit arson

302
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,360
and involved in the illegal competition.

303
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:18,519
We need you to come down
to the station with us

304
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:19,360
to assist in the investigation.

305
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,870
(One month later)

306
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,519
The Lantian Bay project
went on smoothly

307
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,399
and the stock price soared.

308
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:28,879
All the shareholders

309
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:31,000
are full of praise for you.

310
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:33,440
All thanks to the support from all

311
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,559
that Ocean is able
to overcome the crisis

312
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,360
and everything is back on track now.

313
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,039
Among those, I should thank

314
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,360
is you, Ms. Shi.

315
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,039
Actually, the person you should thank

316
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,399
is Su Xie Yi.

317
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:48,480
You two have quite a lot

318
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,600
in common.

319
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,440
To help shed light on the events,

320
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,879
she could endure so much.

321
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,039
She was right.

322
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,559
There's a reason why

323
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:56,679
you two love each other so deeply.

324
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,600
Thank you for your understanding,
Ms. Shi.

325
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,279
I said this before
when I just came back.

326
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:05,440
If you can find

327
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,759
your own happiness,

328
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,559
I'll surely give you my blessing.

329
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,559
Back then, I've indeed misunderstood

330
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:12,639
Su Xie Yi.

331
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:14,840
But I have to admit

332
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,320
that she's perfect for you.

333
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,559
Thank you, Ms. Shi.

334
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,320
Well, I hope

335
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:25,480
you can

336
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:26,799
find your happiness soon.

337
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,559
Don't you worry about that.

338
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:33,320
Oh, right.

339
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:34,879
You just had surgery.

340
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:36,639
How's your recovery going?

341
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,679
I'm fine now.

342
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,000
Yan.

343
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,080
- Xie Yi.
- Xie Yi.

344
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:47,080
You're here, Ms. Shi.

345
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,080
It's almost time

346
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:49,919
for your appointment with Dr. Wu.

347
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,759
We have to get going now.

348
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:53,639
Are you going
for a follow-up appointment?

349
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:54,879
That's right.

350
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,919
I always have to chivvy him along.

351
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,519
I've completely recovered.

352
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,840
You are only when Dr. Wu says so.

353
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,240
Ze Liang.

354
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,960
I'm on Xie Yi's side with this one.

355
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,360
Now, take him there.

356
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:12,360
Let's go.

357
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:13,720
My dear Mr. Li.

358
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:14,759
Okay.

359
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:15,799
Whatever you say.

360
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:33,639
Xie Yi.

361
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,960
Dr. Wu said

362
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,960
there are no serious problems
with my leg now.

363
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:40,159
But we both know

364
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:42,080
that no one knows

365
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:43,720
what the future holds.

366
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,879
But Dr. Wu also said

367
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,480
that you'd be fine

368
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:49,759
as long as it's well taken care of.

369
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,639
Xie Yi.

370
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,720
Things will be tough for you

371
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,399
in the future.

372
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,480
If you get tired from walking,

373
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,879
I won't be able to carry you.

374
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,000
When it's sunny,

375
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:07,639
I can't go hiking with you.

376
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,519
And when it rains,

377
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,000
I can't hold an umbrella for you.

378
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,080
Not only

379
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:16,080
will you have to take care of me,

380
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:18,440
I don't even have the confidence

381
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,240
that I can grow old

382
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,080
with you.

383
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:25,559
Have you thought about these problems?

384
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,679
Of course, I have.

385
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,879
These aren't the only things

386
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,519
that we can't do together.

387
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,679
But even so, why does it matter?

388
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,240
If I get tired from walking,

389
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,399
we can sit down and have coffee.

390
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,080
If it rains,

391
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:52,840
we can stay home and watch movies.

392
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,799
When it's sunny,

393
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,320
I can take you

394
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,639
to the park for a walk.

395
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,480
Actually, it doesn't matter what we do.

396
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,039
What matters is that from now on,

397
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,200
it's changed from "me" to "us".

398
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,200
Okay.

399
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,920
Well, later,

400
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,119
we can go to the movies.

401
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:22,759
Sure.

402
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,759
Oh, right, Xie Yi.

403
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,720
Xie Ming Hao's verdict

404
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:28,960
has been delivered.

405
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:31,559
Inciting another to commit a crime,

406
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,960
information leakage in trading,

407
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:35,599
unlawful restrictions on others' ability
to move freely,

408
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:36,559
and

409
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,200
other crimes.

410
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,920
He'll get a minimum sentence
of ten years.

411
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,799
Come to think of it,

412
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,920
back on the rooftop,

413
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,720
Xie Ming Hao

414
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,279
seemed to have wavered.

415
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:09,720
There's good news too.

416
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:11,359
Your application for visiting Xie Qing

417
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,720
has been approved.

418
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,279
Really?

419
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,599
This is great.

420
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:17,799
I wonder

421
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,799
how is she doing now.

422
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,640
Well, tomorrow,

423
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:23,359
you can ask her that yourself.

424
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,359
Let's go.

425
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,759
Let's go to the movies.

426
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:32,680
Let's go!

427
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:33,880
Let's go.

428

(Confess and Repent,

430
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,559
Xie Qing.

431
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,039
How are you?

432
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,119
Don't worry.

433
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,720
I'm doing great.

434
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:23,160
I've never felt so relaxed.

435
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:31,440
I'll wait for you to come back.

436
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,079
Thank you.

437
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,720
I'm truly blessed

438
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:40,960
to have a sister

439
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,480
like you.

440
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:44,480
Back then,

441
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,200
I didn't cherish you.

442
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,759
It's all in the past.

443
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:58,559
Let's not talk about it anymore.

444
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,799
Since we were kids,

445
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:05,000
you've always been

446
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,640
the kind one.

447
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:08,240
But

448
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,599
you were innocently

449
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,319
hurt

450
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:15,920
by me

451
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:19,359
and Ming Hao.

452
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:25,640
What brought me to my senses

453
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:29,720
was the guilt that I felt

454
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,240
for you and our dad.

455
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:37,680
But

456
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,519
no matter how I try to make amends

457
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:45,559
or take the punishment,

458
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,079
there's no way to bring back

459
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:50,240
our dad

460
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:53,519
and the house we used to live in.

461
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,759
We've always been a family.

462
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,880
Our dad loved you.

463
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,559
So do I.

464
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,519
That's why

465
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,279
Dad gave up his life to protect you.

466
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,119
That's because

467
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,839
you're his beloved baby girl.

468
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:13,519
You have made the right choice

469
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:15,400
and it's courageous of you

470
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:17,279
to face your mistakes
and take responsibility.

471
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,799
Dad would understand.

472
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:22,680
So do I.

473
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:29,559
Can I really go on

474
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,039
with my life?

475
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:36,599
Of course.

476
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,039
Yan and I

477
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,119
have talked about it.

478
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:43,279
When you come back,

479
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,640
we'll all live together.

480
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:47,279
It'll be lively.

481
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:48,880
How great is that?

482
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:52,359
Okay.

483
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,359
Okay.

484
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,559
Xie Yi.

485
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:01,920
You must stay happy.

486
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,839
You want to ask about him?

487
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,039
You're right.

488
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:27,119
It's all in the past.

489
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,839
He and I

490
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,000
are histories now.

491
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,240
I've thought it through.

492
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,039
I won't make the same mistake again.

493
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,519
Don't worry.

494
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,480
Oh, right.

495
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:50,839
When

496
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,240
are you two getting married?

497
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:54,920
I wish

498
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,160
I could see you in the wedding dress.

499
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:00,039
When you get married,

500
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:02,759
I won't be able to go there

501
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,440
and give you my blessing.

502
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,880
Make sure you take nice pictures

503
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,200
and show them to me.

504
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:13,839
Okay.

505
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,440

Seriously, Yan?

00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,480
Su Xie Yi.

685
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:02,079
That was the qipao
[*a type of Chinese garment]

686
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,240
that I prepared for you.

687
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,960
Don't you know that the IQ of a woman

688
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:06,360
who's in love will drop?

689
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,119
I was in a hurry to see you.

690
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:09,159
That's why I forgot.

691
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,679
I've got to give it to you.

692
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,800
For divorce, please head over there.

693
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:37,119
Get married.

694
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,440
We're here to get married.

695
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,480
I'm sorry.

696
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:41,719
For marriage registration,
please head this way.

697
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:44,960
- Let's go.
- What's wrong with him?

698
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,470
(Shanghai Pudong Civil Affairs Bureau,
Marriage Registry)

699
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:52,290
(We're married)

700
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,880
Still have the nerves to laugh?

701
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:08,840
It's my husband. Why can't I laugh?

702
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,199
What did you call me?

703
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,280
Forget it if you didn't hear it.

704
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,639
No, don't.

705
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:16,800
Say it again.

706
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:17,559
Again.

707
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,280
Not mad at me anymore?

708
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,199
It was too petty of me.

709
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:23,719
It's just a dress.

710
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:24,920
It was nothing.

711
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:25,880
Xie Yi

712
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:26,880
looks good

713
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:27,920
in anything she wears.

714
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,760
That was the qipao

715
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,800
that my husband bought.

716
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:32,239
You can't make casual comments.

717
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:36,760
Who bought it?

718
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,280
My husband.

719
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:44,719
Hubby.

720
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,320
My wife.

721
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,320
Fill up the form already.

722
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,280
All right.

723
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:57,360
We've got the marriage certificate.

724
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,599
Next, let's fill up

725
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,150
(Marriage Certificate)
this household

726
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:00,960
registration booklet.

727
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,320
Why?

728
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:06,360
Why do I look so awful

729
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,159
in this photo

730
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,230
and you look so good?

731
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:08,760
(Su Xie Yi)

732
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,559
It's not.

733
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:11,440
I think we both look great.

734
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,400
Look.

735
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:13,719
Isn't it?

736
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:15,760
It's not if I say so.

737
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:16,840
It's not fair!

738
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:20,280
What can we do?
The photo is already taken.

739
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:23,159
Come with me to the bridal store
and take another shot.

740
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:24,559
I'll decide on the costume and style.

741
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:25,639
Let's go.

742
