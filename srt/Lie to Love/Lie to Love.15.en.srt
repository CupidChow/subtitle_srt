Back then, my father died

20
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,560
because

21
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,439
he saw your true colors, right?

22
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,280
Ze Liang.

23
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,520
You need evidence.

24
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,120
You can't make a baseless accusation.

25
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,319
Your father

26
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,400
must have taught you this.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,479
Evidence?

28
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,039
You were the one

29
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,080
who bought these artworks.

30
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,719
Those who came today

31
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,719
were all experts.

32
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,919
They could tell in a glance

33
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:34,800
if these are worth the money.

34
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,759
All these years,

35
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,960
you have worked so hard

36
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,120
to gain the trust

37
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,479
of all those in Ocean Group,

38
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,719
especially those shareholders.

39
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,159
Well done.

40
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,280
But if I were...

41
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:55,439
to open this door now

42
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,560
and reveal these so-called

43
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,599
artworks,

44
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,240
what do you think
the consequences will be?

45
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,400
The image

46
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,159
that you've tried so hard to build

47
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,120
all these years would be destroyed.

48
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,680
What are you trying to do?

49
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,759
Little by little,

50
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,960
I'll get back what's rightfully mine.

51
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:05,240
Fine.

52
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,800
What do you want?

53
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,600
This is a declaration.

54
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:19,879
Uncle.

55
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,759
Please have a look.

(Declaration)

57
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,550
(From now on, I voluntarily step down
as the chairman of Ocean Group,)

58
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,080
(no longer participate
in the subsequent elections,)

59
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,700
(and sincerely recommend Li Ze Liang
to take over.)

60
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,399
As compared

61
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,360
to the tricks you pulled back then

62
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,199
to steal my father's shares,

63
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,680
what I did today

64
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,800
is nothing.

65
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,040
Whether to open the door

66
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,160
or...

67
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,160
to sign the paper.

68
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,279
Uncle.

69
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,360
It's up to you.

that they went over my head

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,720
I've pleaded with Mr. Huo.

123
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,600
There's no way I could
provide the goods in time.

124
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,200
But he refused

125
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,840
to accept any less of the penalty.

126
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,759
He wants to force Zhiwei into a corner.

127
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,840
It's not like that, Uncle Shen.

128
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,240
We have to believe in the law.

129
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:43,960
No matter what happens,

130
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:44,879
we can solve it

131
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,480
by legal means.

132
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,840
We'll look into it if there's a problem.

133
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,840
- Stop looking into it!
- All right!

134
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,840
I won't.

135
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,120
Don't move!

136
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,000
No investigation.

137
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,720
But think about it.

138
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,679
You still have your family.

139
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:01,759
Right?

140
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,159
You still have your family.

141
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,759
They need you.

142
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:06,480
This is...

143
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:08,759
No matter what the problem is,

144
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:10,240
we can solve it together.

145
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,399
That's right.

146
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,440
For my family's sake.

147
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,799
Uncle Shen!

148
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:32,720
Uncle Shen!

149
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:33,840
Hold on tight!

150
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,159
Don't let go!

151
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,759
I'll hold on to you!

152
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,320
Don't let go!

153
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,320
Promise me.

154
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,960
It all ends here.

155
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:24,720
Dr. Wu said

156
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,240
you injured your leg
trying to save someone.

157
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,759
Rain and rust

158
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:31,960
caused your wounds to become infected.

159
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,879
The day you got injured

160
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,840
was the same day
my dad jumped off the building.

161
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:41,320
If

162
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,039
Dr. Wu hadn't called,

163
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,039
were you planning

164
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:45,759
to keep it a secret

165
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,480
forever?

166
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,120
Sorry, Xie Yi.

167
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,639
I've tried my best.

168
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,600
Sorry, Yan.

169
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,639
I'm sorry.

170
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,759
I was wrong about you.

171
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,440
I'm sorry.

172
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,559
I'm sorry.

173
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:32,399
Sorry.

174
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,360
All right, silly girl.

175
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,080
Stop crying.

176
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,919
I'm fine, aren't I?

177
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,440
Have a seat.

178
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,519
Have a seat.

179
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:14,960
Xie Yi.

180
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,360
You should leave tomorrow.

181
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:20,519
Why?

182
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,600
Because of Huo Jian?

183
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,519
My relationship with Huo Jian

184
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,799
isn't as simple as you thought.

185
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,840
Besides wanting
to take control of Ocean,

186
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,320
he might

187
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,399
have something to do
with my dad's death.

188
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,279
What do you mean?

189
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:47,639
My dad called me

190
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:50,120
the day before he died.

191
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:51,840
He said

192
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,679
Huo Jian is not as simple

193
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,440
as he seems.

194
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:56,840
He also said

195
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,720
he would relieve Huo Jian
of some of his duties

196
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:01,120
after he was discharged
from the hospital.

197
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,120
So by the time you rushed back,

198
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:08,120
your dad had already passed away.

199
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,039
I went to the hospital to investigate

200
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,120
the cause of death.

201
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,799
According to the report
from the hospital,

202
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,320
my dad's condition deteriorated

203
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:19,600
and he died of natural causes.

204
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:21,759
But the last person

205
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:23,039
my dad met before he died

206
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,879
was Huo Jian.

207
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,080
Also,

208
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:28,120
he even signed an equity grant agreement

209
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,159
and awarded Huo Jian

210
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:31,039
10 percent of the shares.

211
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,320
That's very unusual.

212
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:36,960
Later on,

213
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:40,279
I've been secretly
conducting my own investigation.

214
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,440
I've investigated all the people

215
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,919
who might have been in contact
with my dad

216
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,360
before his passing.

217
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,879
I've heard from Ming Hao too.

218
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,200
That's right.

219
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,720
I've looked into almost everyone.

220
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:54,080
But there was no evidence.

221
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:57,960
But there's only one person

222
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:00,039
who hasn't been found.

223
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,399
Who is it?

224
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,600
Spider,

225
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:07,159
a man by the name Liu Ah Wei.

226
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,480
According to the scheduling report,

227
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:12,559
on the day my dad died,

228
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,159
he happened to be cleaning the glass

229
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,240
outside the building.

230
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,600
But after that day,

231
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,440
he resigned

232
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:21,639
and disappeared.

233
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:23,799
So...

234
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,679
I suspect

235
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,480
that he must have seen something
he wasn't meant to see

236
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,879
or

237
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,559
he got his hands on some secrets.

238
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:31,840
That's why he went missing.

239
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,840
Huo Jian has been

240
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,840
looking for this person as well.

241
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,120
This all the more

242
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,600
proves his guilty conscience and fear.

243
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,440
Well, have you found him?

244
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,039
Ying Song has been looking for him.

245
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,559
But so far,

246
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:51,279
there's nothing definite yet.

247
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,639
Yan.

248
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,480
I'll look for him with you.

249
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:03,879
All right?

250
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,559
Only by finding him

251
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:07,519
can we

252
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:09,000
convict Huo Jian.

253
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:11,799
Xie Yi.

254
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:13,679
The kind

255
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:15,159
of things Huo Jian would do

256
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,120
is beyond anything you could imagine.

257
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:18,120
Once he finds out

258
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:19,440
that I'm looking for Spider,

259
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:20,840
it might drive him into a corner

260
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,240
and he'll resort to any means.

261
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,399
So this is what worries you

262
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,720
and that's why you want me to leave?

263
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:41,120
They've all been telling me

264
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,679
that if we stay together,

265
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:44,600
we'll become each other's weak spot.

266
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:45,960
But right now,

267
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,399
there's no more secret between us.

268
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,679
We have a common enemy,

Huo Jian.

270

We, too,

271
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:53,600
can be each other's armor.

272

What a beautiful stage.

299
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,000
I was this close.

300
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,000

00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:09,799
What matters is you're fine now.

305
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,279
Well,

306
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:12,759
you can have any stages you want.

307
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,960
What's the matter?

308
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,720
Why are you being so gentle today?

309
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:17,720
Well,

310
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:19,240
you're our invited guest.

311
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,920
I'm just trying to play nice.

312
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:24,839
Is it because

313
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,119
Xie Yi is back?

314
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:27,359
That's why you can't sleep too?

315
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,519
Why are you so annoying?

316
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:32,599
I can't even have a proper conversation

317
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:33,720
with you.

318
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,240
I remember

319
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:48,920
the last time
we went on such a big stage

320
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:49,759
was when our music club

321
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,960
had a graduation performance.

322
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:51,720
Back then,

323
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,039
you were still a drummer.

324
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,119
Actually,

325
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:59,039
you played the drums well.

326
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,559
If you hadn't quit the music club,

327
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,599
it probably would still exist.

328
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,599
I don't like playing drums.

329
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:07,400
I know.

330
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:09,119
You joined the music club

331
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:10,960
because Liang was there.

332
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:20,559
Do you really hate

333
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:21,839
playing drums that much?

334
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,240
Whenever I saw you

335
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,240
playing the drums,

336
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:25,680
you did quite an awesome job.

337
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,480
Maybe it's because I don't like music.

338
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:31,559
Right.

339
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:33,000
It's very difficult

340
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,359
for people to find something

341
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,440
that they love to do.

342
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,440
But I think you should

343
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:37,160
give yourself more chances

344
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,200
to try things out.

345
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,759
You're right.

346
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:47,759
I should give myself a chance.

347
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:48,799
That's right.

348
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:50,440
It's fine
if you don't like rock and roll.

349
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:51,440
But you have to like

350
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,000
the spirit of rock and roll.

351
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,720
Be brave to explore things,

352
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,960
especially when making journeys
into the unknown.

353
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,240
Or...

354
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:00,559
Or you can try

355
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,920
exploring what's around you.

356
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,160
Thank you

357
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:18,759
for the encouragement.

358
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:20,279
I get it now.

359
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,599
Well, it's getting late.

360
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,880
Rest earlier.

361
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,039
Encouragement?

362
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,119
That's right.

363
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,519
Didn't you tell me

364
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:31,960
to be braver?

365
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,319
I admit.

366
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,279
I was too afraid of failure.

367
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:36,200
That's why

368
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:37,039
I kept putting myself

369
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,680
in a safe spot.

370
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:40,680
But today,

371
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,640
when the moment Su Xie Yi
pushed the door and walked in,

372
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,079
it suddenly hit me.

373
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:47,640
I'm lacking that tiny bit of bravery

374
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,279
as compared to her.

375
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,000
Thank you.

376
00:20:58,359 --> 00:20:59,640
Go back and rest earlier.

377
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,680
Brave?

378
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,920
I clearly emphasized exploring.

379
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,720
Exploring the people around you.

380
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,920
(Xie Yi)

381
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,220
(Xie Yi)

382
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:16,359
Hello?

383
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,880
Ming Hao.

384
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:22,799
Ming Hao.

385
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:25,079
I'm sorry.

386
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:26,880
I'm back in Yunfeng.

387
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:28,559
Is that so?

388
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:30,640
Yan injured his leg

389
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:31,680
trying

390
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,119
to save my dad.

391
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:34,799
When I first

392
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,480
learned the news,

393
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,000
my mind went completely blank.

394
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,400
I couldn't control myself.

395
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:43,440
So...

396
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:45,599
I'm sorry.

397
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,559
I feel relieved now

398
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,799
after hearing your voice.

399
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,720
You left all of a sudden.

400
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,079
I've been worried about you.

401
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:56,759
It felt like

402
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,519
I've just snapped back to reality.

403
00:22:58,839 --> 00:22:59,960
Don't worry.

404
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:01,440
I'm safe now.

405
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,960
I won't go over there then.

406
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,200
See you in Shanghai.

407
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:07,279
Okay.

408
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:01,880
Sister!

409
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:03,680
I grabbed this doll myself.

410
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:04,720
Could you give it back to me?

411
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,680
So what if you grabbed it?

412
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,559
I want to play with it!

413
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,480
Give it back to me!

414
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,480
I will not!

415
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,200
Give it back to me!

416
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:10,240
No!

417
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,960
Give it back to me!

418
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:12,519
I won't!

419
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,359
I'll tell Mom about it!

420
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:15,720
There's no point!

421
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:16,799
I want to play with it!

422
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,920
Dad!

423
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,519
Sister took my doll!

424
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:21,079
That doll is mine!

425
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:22,319
She's the one who tried to take it!

426
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,640
Ming Hao.

427
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:27,960
Uncle Shen.

428
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:29,359
Xie Qing.

429
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,960
We're just having a meal.

430
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,960
Why did you bring all these?

431
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,559
Just a little something from me.

432
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:34,759
Dad.

433
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:36,160
Ming Hao makes a lot of money now.

434
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:37,039
He just won

435
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,599
the Lawyer Rising Star Award.

436
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:39,720
Really?

437
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,440
I've always thought highly of you.

438
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,319
Uncle Shen.

439
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:43,160
Without your support

440
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:44,559
and encouragement over the years,

441
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:45,799
I wouldn't be where I am today.

442
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,519
Please do accept this gift from me.

443
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,119
No more next time, all right?

444
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:50,799
Have a seat.

445
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:51,400
Dad.

446
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,240
Xie Qing.

447
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,599
I'm back.

448
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,400
Where have you been?

449
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:56,599
We're waiting for you.

450
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,640
I went to buy crab noodles.

451
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,039
Look who's here.

452
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:03,519
This is...

453
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,799
That's Ming Hao.

454
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,720
Hi, Ming Hao.

455
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:14,400
Hi.

456
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:16,720
Let's eat.

457
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:18,000
Okay.

458
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,160
Take a seat over here.

459
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,799
You have been abroad all these years.

460
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:28,880
I didn't get to really take care of you.

461
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,319
Your mom is gone now.

462
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,119
Move back in, all right?

463
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:34,640
That's right, Xie Yi.

464
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,920
Dad misses you a lot.

465
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:36,960
Dad.

466
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:39,240
I just enrolled
at the University of Hannover.

467
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,720
After I graduated,

468
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,200
I'll come home
and keep you company every day.

469
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,240
And Xie Qing too.

470
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:46,039
That's great.

471
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,200
Why didn't you discuss it with me

472
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:49,759
before you applied

473
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,640
for the hotel management course?

474
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,400
Hotel management
is a kind of management too.

475
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:54,920
Besides, Xie Qing is helping you

476
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,319
to manage the business now.

477
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:00,359
Sweet talker. Eat up. Hurry.

478
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:01,839
Eat up.

479
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,119
Ming Hao.

480
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,799
Eat up.

481
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,440
Thank you.

482
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:10,960
Here.

483
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:11,960
Eat more.

484
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,839
Thank you, Dad.

485
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,200
Here's the claw.

486
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,960
Okay, that's enough.

487
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,640
Here. Eat more.

488
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,400
Dad, you too.

489
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:16,640
It's beautiful.

490
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,160
It's for me, right?

491
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,480
Do you like dolls?

492
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:23,720
I love them.

493
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,240
I've been trying to grab one,

494
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,680
but I couldn't get any.

495
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,200
Grab more for me next time.

496
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:31,920
Sure.

497
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:36,960
Xie Yi just returned from abroad.

498
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,039
What does she like to eat?

499
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,440
My treat tonight.

500
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,640
Well,

501
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,039
let's go to my favorite restaurant.

502
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,279
All right.

503
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:31,759
How did it go?

504
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:32,640
Mr. Li.

505
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,640
The special fund

506
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:35,079
for the hearing impaired

507
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:35,720
in cooperation

508
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,319
with the hospital
has been formally established.

509
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:39,880
Thank you.

510
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:42,039
Let's hope

511
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,920
it can help more families in need.

512
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:46,599
Oh, right.

513
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,279
Any leads on Liu Ah Wei?

514
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:49,359
The hospital

515
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:51,160
provided us with a list of patients

516
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,039
who had

517
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,000
undergone surgery in their hospital
in the past two years.

518
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:55,440
There's a total of 63 patients.

519
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:57,359
One of them is Liu Xiao Xiao

520
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:58,400
with Liu Ah Wei's name

521
00:28:58,519 --> 00:28:59,400
under the family signature column.

522
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:00,480
Really?

523
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,440
That's right.

524
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,920
Also, the surgery date

525
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,680
is exactly one month

526
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,200
after Liu Ah Wei disappeared.

527
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:07,079
That should be it.

528
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:09,279
Did you find out where they are?

529
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:10,720
One month ago,

530
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,119
Liu Xiao Xiao once went back
to the hospital.

531
00:29:12,518 --> 00:29:13,758
There are follow-up records.

532
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,680
The contact number given
is out of service.

533
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:16,799
There's only one

534
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:17,880
known address,

535
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,279
which is a small town called Yun'an,

536
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,160
with no house number.

537
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:22,759
Good job.

538
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:26,240
It looks like

539
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:27,759
Liu Ah Wei and his family
have moved there.

540
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:28,799
All right.

541
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:29,720
I'll send people

542
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,240
to Yun'an to investigate it.

543
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,519
It's not that big of a town.

544
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,200
We should get something soon.

545
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,519
Be careful.

546
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,279
Take caution.

547
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:40,079
Don't let Huo Jian find out.

548
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:41,920
I just forced him

549
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,279
to sign the withdrawal agreement.

550
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,960
He must be holding a grudge.

551
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:46,039
I don't want

552
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:47,759
to drive him into a corner just yet.

553
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:49,039
Understood.

554
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,519
You may go now.

555
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,839
The auction was a big success.

556
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,480
There is much news reporting on it

557
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,720
not only locally,

558
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,359
but internationally as well.

559
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:09,240
That's right.

560
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:10,799
This is by far

561
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,559
the most successful

562
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:13,880
promotion of Ocean's corporate image
in recent years.

563
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,839
Mr. Li sure lives up to expectations.

564
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:19,240
Don't say that.

565
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:20,119
All thanks

566
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,759
to your support

567
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,519
that makes

568
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,960
this auction a great success.

569
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,839
All right.

570
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,359
Next,

571
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,000
I have an important announcement
to make.

572
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,400
I've decided to officially resign

573
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,759
as the chairman effective today

574
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:35,960
and I will also

575
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:37,440
withdraw myself

576
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,240
from the next chairman
re-election meeting.

577
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:40,680
Mr. Huo.

578
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:42,200
Why is that?

579
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,319
Mr. Li entrusted

580
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:45,079
these burdens to me

581
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:46,920
simply because Ze Liang

582
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,720
was still young back then.

583
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,880
But as you can see,

584
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,319
be it in terms of physical health

585
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,680
or his abilities,

586
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,119
Ze Liang is capable

587
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:57,440
to shoulder these burdens now.

588
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,240
The student has outdone the teacher.

589
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:03,640
My only interests

590
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:05,680
are keeping fish and doing sports.

591
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,559
I can finally take a break now.

592
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:09,839
Right?

593
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:17,799
For you.

594
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:18,759
Thank you.

595
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:21,119
Here. This is for you.

596
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,079
Thank you.

597
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,759
For you, Ming Yue.

598
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,960
Nice one, girl.

599
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,400
What a huge box.

600
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:28,720
I brought these local products

601
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,480
all the way from Jiangcheng.

602
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,759
Have your fill.

603
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,440
Given your appetite,

604
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,599
I'm sure you can finish it.

605
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:35,000
Congratulations!

606
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:37,279
The auction was a big success.

607
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,359
Mr. Li

608
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:39,720
has finally made a name for himself.

609
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,720
You sure are very well-informed.

610
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:43,200
Of course.

611
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,000
We didn't know Mr. Li so well

612
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,880
back then.

613
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:49,519
I'll make it clear.

614
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,519
I have no intention

615
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,920
to curry favor with you.

616
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:54,921
It takes time

617
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,680
to get to know someone.

618
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,119
Most importantly,

619
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,359
knowing

620
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,480
that he's a good person

621
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,440
is all that matters.

622
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,960
Love

623
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,359
really is the best skincare product.

624
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,119
You're glowing now

625
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,160
whenever you talk about Mr. Li.

626
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,759
Am I?

627
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,279
Shocking news!

628
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,319
Shocking news!

629
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,519
What is it?

630
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,440
Mr. Huo

631
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:20,799
resigned ahead of schedule

632
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,759
at the board meeting earlier.

633
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:24,720
What?

634
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:26,039
Xie Yi.

635
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,599
Ms. Shi wants you at her office.

636
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,160
Come in.

637
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,359
Okay. Don't worry.

638
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:42,119
I'll get this taken care of before noon.

639
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,599
Okay.

640
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:49,599
Do you want something to drink?

641
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,759
It's okay.

642
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:01,240
Welcome back.

643
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,359
Miss Su.

644
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,160
I know what you want to ask.

645
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,160
I know it's for my own good.

646
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:10,680
But I think there are many things
in this world

647
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,359
that are more important

648
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:13,759
than one's personal safety.

649
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:15,240
That's why I came back

650
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,119
and I'm not planning to leave.

651
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,039
That's up to you to decide.

652
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,680
It's within your rights as well.

653
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:22,480
No explanation needed.

654
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:25,119
What do you want to ask then?

655
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,000
Do you still remember

656
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,079
what we talked about the other day?

657
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,759
You said that I like Ze Liang.

658
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,799
You were right.

659
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,200
So I want to tell you

660
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,799
that from this moment onward,

661
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,640
I'll officially be competing with you.

662
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:54,279
Sorry, Ms. Shi.

663
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,680
It slipped out of my hands.

664
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,200
I'm here to deliver the documents.

665
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,680
If there's nothing else,
I'll get going then.

666
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,719
Hi, Mr. Li.

667
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,440
Have you seen Xie Yi?

668
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:16,719
She... she's inside.

669
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,159
What are you two talking about?

670
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:38,280
Nothing.

671
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:41,639
Just having a casual chat with Xie Yi.

672
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,400
All right.

673
00:34:58,239 --> 00:34:59,159
It's lunchtime.

674
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:00,599
Join us for lunch.

675
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,599
Go ahead.

676
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,280
I have things to do.

677
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,079
All right.

678
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,280
We'll get going then.

679
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:13,119
Bye, Ms. Shi.

680
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,220
(Yuxing Restaurant)

681
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:32,280
Didn't I say I would treat you
to a rice bowl?

682
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:33,639
Why are you having noodles?

683
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:36,239
I heard that Huo Jian
had resigned ahead of schedule.

684
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,000
Given his character,

685
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:39,320
he wouldn't give up

686
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:40,280
that easily.

687
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,199
Of course.

688
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,360
I found out that he made a quick buck

689
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,480
from the purchase of art
in the company name

690
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:45,920
and used it against him.

691
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:47,480
So he had no choice

692
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:48,239
but to sign the resignation

693
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,840
and withdrawal agreement.

694
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:50,880
That way,

695
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,320
he could at least step down
with dignity.

696
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:55,440
He agreed just like that?

697
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,000
I've said it before.

698
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:58,440
As long as he withdraws himself
from the re-election,

699
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,920
I'll wipe the slate clean.

700
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:01,800
Li Ze Liang.

701
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,079
Have you forgotten

702
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:04,440
what he has done to our families?

703
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,679
The reason I came back

704
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,159
is to deal with him.

705
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,679
For the sake

706
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,280
of the position as a chairman,

707
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,280
you're going to spare him just like?

708
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,840
I didn't say I was going to spare him.

709
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:17,000
Xie Yi.

710
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,880
We can't rush things.

711
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,719
Take it one step at a time.

712
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,880
Besides, Huo Jian's most heinous crime

713
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:25,760
isn't the one

714
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,039
that's financially related,

715
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,480
but murder.

716
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,360
Are you saying

717
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:34,639
that we should hit him where it hurts?

718
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,440
Ying Song will be able

719
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:38,599
to find Spider's whereabouts soon.

720
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,639
This time,

721
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:42,000
I'll show no mercy.

722
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,440
(Shi Chu Chu)

723
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,360
(I've made an appointment with my dad)

724
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,760
(at eight o'clock tonight.)

725
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:54,199
Okay. See you tonight.

726
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,320
Who is it?

727
00:36:58,639 --> 00:36:59,239
Chu Chu.

728
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,599
We received great support

729
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,519
from Hengye Bank

730
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:03,320
for the auction.

731
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:04,519
Whatever it is,

732
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:05,920
I should meet Mr. Shi

733
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,840
and thank him.

734
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,800
So I asked Chu Chu to help me

735
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,679
arrange an appointment with her dad.

736
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:13,559
That's right.

737
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,199
Ms. Shi is quite a nice person.

738
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:19,320
That's right.

739
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,920
I've known her for a long time.

740
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:22,400
She's always been very outstanding.

741
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:25,639
If this is in the novel,

742
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,360
you two will be
the ideal and lovely couple

743
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:30,840
whose families are of equal rank.

744
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,840
That's right.

745
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:45,840
Look.

746
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,800
Chu Chu and I

747
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,280
grew up together.

748
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:53,199
Also, we'd always been classmates.

749
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:54,320
During class,

750
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,119
we would be comparing our grades.

751
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,159
After school,

752
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,400
we would play together.

753
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,679
So the terms "lovely"

754
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:02,480
and "ideal couple"

755
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,599
don't do us justice.

756
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,960
You have to add

757
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,360
"childhood sweethearts" too.

758
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,719
How about adding

759
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,760
"innocent playmates?"

760
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,079
Indeed.

761
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:15,039
But...

762
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,960
Ms. Shi

763
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:19,079
is so highly competent

764
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,639
and she lacks femininity.

765
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:22,199
You probably don't know.

766
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:23,480
Since she was a kid,

767
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:25,360
she was like a tomboy.

768
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:26,840
She had short hair

769
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:27,719
and often

770
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,960
followed me around.

771
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:30,480
I remember there was once

772
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:31,480
a man mistook her

773
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:32,960
for a boy.

774
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,639
She totally went nuts.

775
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,960
Also,

776
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:39,199
Ms. Shi

777
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,960
is an average-looking girl.

778
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,559
Her eyes are too big.

779
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,519
Sometimes,

780
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:46,840
the way she stares at me
gives me the creeps.

781
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,880
Don't you think so?

782
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,559
Most importantly,

783
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,800
she has a great temperament.

784
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,400
I really can't...

785
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:54,480
That's enough.

786
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:56,239
Ms. Shi isn't as bad

787
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:57,199
as you said she is.

788
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,519
So many girls

789
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:00,320
desire to be as outstanding as she is.

790
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:01,280
Besides,

791
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:03,360
she probably has a long queue

792
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:05,199
of potential suitors and admirers.

793
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:06,800
No matter how outstanding she is,

794
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:08,519
you're the only one I like.

795
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,360
Why did you say that all of a sudden?

796
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,320
I didn't ask who you like.

797
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,639
If you're worried,

798
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:28,320
come with me to the dinner.

799
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:29,320
What do you think?

800
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:31,440
Forget it.

801
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:32,840
I'll pass

802
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,199
on the high-end dinner.

803
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,800
I have a date tonight.

804
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:38,000
You do?

805
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:39,400
With whom?

806
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:40,599
Chestnut.

807
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,079
I haven't played with it for some time.

808
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:45,920
All right then.

809
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,079
Keep it company.

810
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,440
I'll be back soon.

811
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,159
Speaking of which,

812
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,400
you added so much vinegar
to the noodles.

813
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:02,559
Is it still edible?

814
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:03,800
Yes.

815
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,920
And it's heavenly.

816
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,599
I should just eat mine.

817
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:25,039
Are you really willing

818
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:26,039
to just give up the position
as chairman?

819
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:28,760
I've said this before.

820
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,599
No matter how high the position is,

821
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,920
it's just a position.

822
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:33,119
What I want

823
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,000
is to become
Ocean's largest shareholder.

824
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:36,840
But I'm worried

825
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:38,199
that once you make way,

826
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,119
it will allow Li Ze Liang

827
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:41,159
to build momentum

828
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,719
and it'll be hard to stop it later on.

829
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:45,639
Do you know what it means
to make concessions to gain advantages?

830
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,000
This is what

831
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,719
we have discovered.

832
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:49,119
Oscar

833
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,519
has been helping Li Ze Liang

834
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:51,480
to find Spider.

835
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:54,719
What a good buddy.

836
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,800
But worry not.

837
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,039
They are just

838
00:40:58,239 --> 00:40:59,480
looking for a needle in a haystack.

839
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,599
They won't find anything.

840
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,559
What if we let them find him?

841
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,920
Are you saying

842
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:08,719
that we give him a fake news

843
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,480
to lure Li Ze Liang out?

844
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,360
This nephew of mine was bedridden
for over a year and a half

845
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:16,800
because of his leg injury.

846
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,199
If anything

847
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,679
happens to his leg again,

848
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,840
he might have to stay in bed

849
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,800
for another one year and a half

850
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,679
or even longer.

851
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:25,400
The chairman re-election is coming.

852
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,559
If he was crippled,

853
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:29,440
you wouldn't be able to resign

854
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:32,199
even if you wanted to.

855
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,400
Today is your birthday, right?

856
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,440
I promised

857
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:48,559
to give you a surprise.

858
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:17,840
About what we discussed earlier,

859
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,800
I'll leave it to you to get it done.

860
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:27,110
♪I feel you, I need you♪

861
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,760
♪I want to be happy because of you♪

862
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:36,740
♪Blindfold your eyes secretly♪

863
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,310

00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:44,620
