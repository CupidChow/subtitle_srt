00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:15,090

2
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:25,100
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

3
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:33,650
♫  Still haunts me now and then in quiet nights  ♫

4
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:41,530
♫  And turn to face all the long lost times  ♫

5
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,270
♫  Brace the pain  ♫

6
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:51,310
♫  Let memories wake up from oceans deep  ♫

7
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,350
♫  No place to hide  ♫

8
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,450
♫  No way to run  ♫

9
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,920
♫  New dawn counts down  ♫

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,030
♫  I fight  ♫

11
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,210
♫  I cry  ♫

12
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,800
♫  I give up  ♫

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:15,810
♫  Memories forgotten, forsaken surround  ♫

14
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:24,330
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

15
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:32,570
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

16
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:41,050
♫  Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

17
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:49,720
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

18
00:01:49,720 --> 00:02:00,150

19
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,050

20
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,159
Wait for me.

21
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:51,260
I'll put down the luggage.

22
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,450

23
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,340
Your seat is so comfortable.

24
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,019
Do you like it?

25
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:14,939
You can have this office if you like it.

26
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:16,360
I'll take the office upstairs.

27
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,759
I don't think this is suitable.

28
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,659
Why not?

29
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:21,500
I'm the current chairman.

30
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,539
And you're my executive secretary.

31
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:26,159
It's perfectly reasonable for you to have your own office.

32
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,559
People will think that you're giving me special treatment.

33
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,840
I am giving you special treatment. So what?

34
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,899
Do you think they can do something about it?

35
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,060
I appreciate your intention.

36
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,199
I still like my original position better.

37
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,159
If not, you won't be able to see me when you raise your head.

38
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,359
I can look downwards.

39
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:51,819
You...

40
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,199
Enough.

41
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:56,539
I'm here to talk about business.

42
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:59,919
I came back to join the Lantian Bay project.

43
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:02,699
Chuchu is in charge of the Lantian Bay project.

44
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:03,780
That's great.

45
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,940
I can learn more from Director Shi.

46
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,440
Really?

47
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:11,359
Come in.

48
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,519
Miss Su, you're back.

49
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,959
Director Shi, it's been a while.

50
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,720
I'll leave the room if you need to speak with Chairman Li.

51
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,239
Have a seat.

52
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,380
What's the matter?

53
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,340
It's like this.

54
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,059
The Lantian Bay project is progressing at full speed.

55
00:04:48,059 --> 00:04:50,519
We need to purchase some construction materials urgently.

56
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,419
Please take a look.

57
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:58,360
I'll leave that to you.

58
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,560
I believe in you.

59
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,160
By the way,

60
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,279
the commercial dispute that Huo Jian had left for the company,

61
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,279
is Mr. Xie handling it right now?

62
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:11,919
Of course. He's our corporate lawyer.

63
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,459
It's like this. For these cases,

64
00:05:14,498 --> 00:05:16,319
I wish to deal with them myself.

65
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,679
You don't need to pass them to Mr. Xie.

66
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:20,379
What do you mean by this?

67
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:23,419
I think these cases are pretty important.

68
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:27,380
That's precisely why I need to handle them myself.

69
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,260
It's better this way.

70
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,260
By the way, Chuchu,

71
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,379
Xieyi wishes to join the Lantian Bay project.

72
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,399
Please lead her and help her out.

73
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:43,360
She does intend to learn from you.

74
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,420
Since Miss Su wants to learn, I will oblige.

75
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:54,900
But Chairman Li, please don't blame me for being too strict on her.

76
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,180
See you.

77
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:12,239
Come in.

78
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,740
Director Shi, I've read the details of the Lantian Bay project.

79
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,119
Just tell me if you need me to do anything.

80
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,680
It's the end of the year now.

81
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,919
We haven't decided the kind of gift we should give to our partners.

82
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,148
You can go and pick several kinds of gifts.

83
00:06:41,148 --> 00:06:45,999
- But... 
 - The gifts represent Chairman Li's image to his partners.

84
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:47,179
You're his girlfriend.

85
00:06:47,179 --> 00:06:49,620
It's most suitable for you to complete this task.

86
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,340
You know this as well.

87
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,119
I wish to contribute to the Lantian Bay project.

88
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,079
Miss Su, since you're truly interested in the Lantian Bay project,

89
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,879
you should learn from me.

90
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,759
Take it one step at a time.

91
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,399
Is there anything else?

92
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:16,079
Director Shi, I've always admired and respected you.

93
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,880
I believe that you're a fair person.

94
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,508
Maybe it's my misconception,

95
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:24,900
but I think you always had a grudge against me.

96
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,519
You can tell me if there's anything on your mind.

97
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,367
- You're the daughter of Shen Zhihong, right? 
 - That's right.

98
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:40,499
So you admit that you hid your identity on purpose,

99
00:07:40,499 --> 00:07:42,660
approached Zeliang and infiltrated Ocean Hotel

100
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,419
for Zhiwei Corporation and your father's sake, right?

101
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:49,079
I admit it, that was the case at the start.

102
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:51,100
But this is over.

103
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,739
Huo Jian has been arrested.

104
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:56,280
And now, I'm staying in Ocean Hotel for a simple reason.

105
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,719
It's because I love the hotel industry.

106
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,839
And I wish to help A'Yan.

107
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,159
Is that it?

108
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:04,859
That's it.

109
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,539
You can ask A'Yan if you don't believe me.

110
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:08,279
He knows about it as well.

111
00:08:11,059 --> 00:08:13,900
I did ask Zeliang about it before.

112
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,680
But love makes people blind.

113
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,399
So I wish to give you some reminders.

114
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,899
I don't care what you're thinking,

115
00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:26,800
but if you dare to hurt Zeliang and Ocean Hotel,

116
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,290
I will never let you off.

117
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,040
Director Shi, I know you detested my relationship with A'Yan.

118
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,760
Indeed.

119
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,300
Hengye Bank, which belongs to your father,

120
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,859
has always been an important financial support for Ocean Hotel.

121
00:08:41,859 --> 00:08:44,499
You're very capable as well.

122
00:08:44,499 --> 00:08:48,559
As for me, I know I lose to you in many aspects.

123
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,100
But A'Yan and I have too many similar life experiences.

124
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,120
That's why we understand each other better.

125
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,000
That's why we're deeply in love.

126
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,840
Very good.

127
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:05,520
Love is more than just fancy words.

128
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,699
You better perform in work.

129
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,520
 Su Xieyi, Ocean Hotel is everything to Zeliang.

130
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,759
 I can't let you ruin it for him.

131
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:26,980
 I will reveal your true colors,

132
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,840
 no matter what I have to do.

133
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,539
Xieqing, time to take your medicine.

134
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:44,679
Where am I?

135
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,539
I'm very scared.

136
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:48,919
I wish to go home.

137
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,719
Where do you want to go?

138
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,559
I wish to go home,

139
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,940
my own home.

140
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:59,919
Don't you like staying here together with me?

141
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,120
From today onward, this will be your new home.

142
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:19,420
Only by staying here and staying by my side will you be safe.

143
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,620
Xieqing, did you remember anything?

144
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,839
For example, the bank account?

145
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:34,039
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know! I don't know!

146
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:36,039
It's fine. It's fine.

147
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:38,240
You can stop thinking. You should take your medicine first.

148
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,080
I don't want to.

149
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,120
Be a good girl.

150
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,520
You can have your mung bean cakes after taking your medicine.

151
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,600
Come.

152
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,060
Take your medicine.

153
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:58,679
Xieqing, you shouldn't have spoken without thinking.

154
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:04,460
If you do remember anything, you must tell me first, okay?

155
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:08,179
Come.

156
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,670

157
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,200
Xieyi?

158
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,720
Hello, Brother Minghao.

159
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,220
How's Xieqing?

160
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,810
Xieqing's emotions are still unstable.

161
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,850
I plan to find her a better sanatorium.

162
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:36,060
Is it that serious? I'll visit her after work then.

163
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,379
No need for that. She suffered a huge shock yesterday.

164
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:41,039
The doctor said she needed to rest and recuperate for the time being.

165
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,600
No one should visit her.

166
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,679
How about this? You can come and visit her after some time.

167
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,379
I don't want her to suffer another shock.

168
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:47,540
All right.

169
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,540
You must contact me if anything happens.

170
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,040
Don't worry.

171
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,740
Xieyi, are you done with your call? Come and join us.

172
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,220
Coming.

173
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:13,240
Xieyi, what's on your mind? You look distracted.

174
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,639
Nothing.

175
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,939
By the way, how were you guys doing when I was on leave?

176
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:22,760
Let's drop the topic. Our company wanted to proceed with the Lantian Bay project.

177
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,159
We were busy every day.

178
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:26,039
Not only do we have to work overtime every day,

179
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:30,979
we had to attend meetings from morning until night.

180
00:12:32,206 --> 00:12:33,498
It must've been tough on you guys.

181
00:12:33,498 --> 00:12:36,500
Eat up, okay? It's my treat.

182
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,179
I was waiting for that, lady boss.

183
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:40,679
Let's dig in.

184
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,140
I heard that you went for a tooth extraction.

185
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,399
Everyone said that extracting your tooth could make your face look smaller.

186
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:51,299
And your face...

187
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,960
I think it did become smaller.

188
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,959
I wish to extract my wisdom tooth as well. But I have none.

189
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,599
Stop teasing me. Isn't it great that you don't have one?

190
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,000
Hello?

191
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,759
Okay.

192
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:15,619
Stop eating. Clean up the table. Our higher-ups want us to attend another meeting.

193
00:13:15,619 --> 00:13:17,639
Let's go.

194
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:23,140
- Xieyi, please pack the food for us. We haven't had our fill yet. 
 - Understood.

195
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,380
- Go now. 
 - Okay, thank you.

196
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,539
Let's go.

197
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:27,120
- Goodbye. 
 - Goodbye.

198
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,620
Goodbye.

199
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:36,899
Waiter, please pack the food for me.

200
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,440
Excuse me, sir.

201
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,320
If you're not a customer, you're not allowed to take pictures here.

202
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,040
Why haven't I heard of that rule before?

203
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,730
Why can't I take pictures of the place?

204
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,678
Are you trying to infringe my personal right?

205
00:14:02,678 --> 00:14:03,860
This is the rule here.

206
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,859
Besides, how did you know that I'm not a customer?

207
00:14:06,859 --> 00:14:08,539
Are you looking down on me?

208
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:09,759
Call your manager here.

209
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:11,819
I want to complain about you.

210
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,040
Hold this for me.

211
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,619
Excuse me, sir. How should I address you?

212
00:14:21,619 --> 00:14:23,139
My surname is He.

213
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:24,499
Are you the manager?

214
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:25,679
Hello, Mr. He.

215
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:28,440
I'm Su Xieyi from the chairman's office.

216
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,579
You did misunderstand our employee just now.

217
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,639
This rule was implemented not long ago.

218
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,399
But please listen to my explanation.

219
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,080
The dining environment here is great.

220
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,059
At first, it became popular because people took pictures of it.

221
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:47,000
More and more influencers and freeloaders came all the way here to take pictures.

222
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,559
It has impacted our business seriously and affected our customers' dining experience.

223
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:57,180
I'm sure you don't want random people to take pictures around you when you're eating.

224
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:01,799
That's why this rule was implemented to protect our customers' rights.

225
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:04,120
Miss Su, I'm glad that you explained it to me in that manner.

226
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,959
I'm not an unreasonable person.

227
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,080
If you don't mind, let me take the pictures for you.

228
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,580
Okay.

229
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,960
Sorry about that. I have rhinitis.

230
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,120

231
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,559
Mr. Li, I've investigated the background of Yunxiao Fishery's owner.

232
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,139
His name is Tang Zheng.

233
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:39,320
He had never done any kind of business before he established this company.

234
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,279
His hobby is fishing.

235
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,120
His past work experiences have nothing to do with fisheries at all.

236
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,360
He sounds unreliable. Where is he?

237
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,319
This person is as slippery as a catfish. He went overseas after his company went bankrupt.

238
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:53,821
I have no idea where he is.

239
00:15:53,821 --> 00:15:55,600
Did you find any other clues?

240
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,100
Oh, yeah.

241
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:00,800
This is Qin.

242
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,120
He worked for Yunxiao Fishery before.

243
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,019
Because of his love for fishing, he was quite close to Tang Zheng.

244
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,759
Let's try to find this Qin first.

245
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,220
Okay.

246
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,520
Mr. Dai!

247
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,920
Hurry! Please come in! Let me introduce him. This is Mr. Xie.

248
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,379
- Mr. Xie. 
 - Hello.

249
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:28,000
This is my secret trump card.

250
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,119
He's the chief editor of Hotel World, Mr. He Jianghua.

251
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:34,259
Mr. He, today… I did everything according to your plan.

252
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:37,040
I've met them, and I've taken pictures of them.

253
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,960
I knew we could rely on you.

254
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,215
Mr. Dai, you'd made a great move.

255
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:44,140
Of course. Come. How about this?

256
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,240
Let us have a toast to prepare for the exciting show tomorrow.

257
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,639
- Cheers! 
 - Come.

258
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,900
Come! Cheers!

259
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,150

260
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:53,419
Cheers!

261
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,080
Director Shi.

262
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,980
Lawyer Xie.

263
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,599
I called you out at this late hour. I'm not troubling you, am I?

264
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:08,659
Not at all. Director Shi, it's my pleasure for you to treat me to a drink.

265
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,020
So you just finished drinking?

266
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,900
I entertained several clients today.

267
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,219
Director Shi, your call actually saved me.

268
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,459
So Director Shi, what do you need from me?

269
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,619
Nothing.

270
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:31,819
The Lantian Bay project is proceeding smoothly, and I have to thank you for that.

271
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,419
That's why I wish to treat you to a drink.

272
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,920
Come.

273
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,740
Now that the project is proceeding smoothly,

274
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,200
Su Xieyi wishes to join the project.

275
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,620
Zeliang wants me to lead her as well.

276
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,780
Mr. Xie, do you have any suggestions?

277
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,079
After all, you know her better.

278
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,579
Su Xieyi? She's not suitable for it.

279
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:06,580
But why?

280
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,640
Is it because of her ability and experience?

281
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,919
Su Xieyi is very intelligent.

282
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,440
It isn't as simple as you think.

283
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,179
Why are you saying that?

284
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,839
No, you see, the Lantian Bay project is too important.

285
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:32,880
Mr. Xie,

286
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,220
there's no need for you to hide it any longer.

287
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:38,240
Actually, I've asked Su Xieyi about it before.

288
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,756
She admitted that

289
00:18:39,757 --> 00:18:44,160
she first joined Ocean Hotel in order to investigate the incident with Zhiwei Corporation.

290
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,599
She said so herself?

291
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:47,299
That's right.

292
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:49,870
She even said that she's working for Ocean Hotel right now

293
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,880
because of her passion for the industry.

294
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,160
At first, I was wondering if I could truly believe her words.

295
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,839
But your attitude has given me the answer I needed.

296
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:03,240
Plus, you don't suggest I use her.

297
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,159
Is this a friendly reminder?

298
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:15,400
Director Shi, we're friends. Can you not...

299
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,920
Can you not make things difficult for me?

300
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,400
We're friends indeed.

301
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,799
But I hope we can become close friends.

302
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:25,499
I wish to know

303
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:31,080
if Su Xieyi has any ulterior motives for staying with Ocean Hotel?

304
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,680
When Su Xieyi wants to do something, she'll do it somehow.

305
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,300
Do you know how she managed to become the Deputy General Manager's Secretary back then?

306
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:47,200
Lin Tai?

307
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,480
She was the one behind that incident?

308
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,059
Sorry, Director Shi.

309
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,620
Miss Su.

310
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,300
Mr. He?

311
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,119
What a coincidence. Are you here to buy books as well?

312
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:43,179
That's right. I often go on business trips.

313
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:45,839
That's why I visit the bookstores near the hotel.

314
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:47,519
I can buy some books as well.

315
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:51,039
Miss Su, what are you buying?

316
00:20:51,699 --> 00:20:55,379
I've been learning how to make soups lately. I wanted to buy some cookbooks.

317
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,300
Soup?

318
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,519
Taking soup before meals works better than medicine.

319
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:03,079
Soups are great.

320
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:06,359
You see, Miss Su, in Guangzhou, they have old fire soup.

321
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:08,020
In Fujian, they have Buddha's temptation.

322
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,920
In Jiangzhe, they have bamboo shoot and salted pork soup.

323
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,440
In this world, there are plenty of great soups.

324
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,780
Miss Su, I wonder what kind of soup you like?

325
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,659
Mr. He, seems like you're very knowledgeable when it comes to soup.

326
00:21:18,659 --> 00:21:20,079
Do you have any recommendations?

327
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:25,400
Miss Su, it depends on whom the soup is meant for.

328
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,880
It's meant for my boyfriend.

329
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,100
I suggest old fire soup then.

330
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,299
Managing a relationship is just like making old fire soup.

331
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:39,235
You need to cook it for a long time.

332
00:21:39,235 --> 00:21:43,959
- Because of that, old fire soup is... 
 - Please wait. Let me jot it down.

333
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:50,960
Miss Su, the word stew means to cook slowly in liquid in a closed dish.

334
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,880
So, the pot meant for making soups is very important.

335
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,240
It's best if you use an aged clay pot.

336
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,160
The soup you make is not just food that can fill up your tummy,

337
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,559
it's also a way of expressing your affection.

338
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,540
So a soup is more than just a soup.

339
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,820
Miss Su, it represents your love as well.

340
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:13,419
Mr. He, your words just gave more meaning to the soup making.

341
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,839
Making soup is a type of attitude towards life.

342
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:21,040
Old fire soup has the nutrition of a tonic and the taste of a savory soup.

343
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,680
So you won't go wrong if you follow my recommendations.

344
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,320
Thank you, Mr. He. You've done me a great favor.

345
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,299
My hobby is eating and playing.

346
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:34,459
Miss Su, if you don't mind, why don't you add me as a friend?

347
00:22:34,459 --> 00:22:36,720
It'll be more convenient for us to contact each other in the future.

348
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,120
Sure.

349
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:56,640
The soup you make is not just food that can fill up your tummy,

350
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,720
it's also a way of expressing your affection.

351
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,779
So a soup is more than just a soup.

352
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:04,880
It represents your love as well.

353
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,980
So that's the case.

354
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,040
It smells nice.

355
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:21,299
Were you referring to the soup or me?

356
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:22,900
Both.

357
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:28,119
On account of your sweet words, I'll let you have a try.

358
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,160
I mean the soup. Why did you kiss me?

359
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,200
Xieyi, let me ask you.

360
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,900
If...

361
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,579
I'm saying if,

362
00:23:55,579 --> 00:23:58,659
a person who's important to you

363
00:23:58,659 --> 00:24:00,719
has done something to hurt you,

364
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,520
what will you do?

365
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:05,559
Of course, I won't forgive him.

366
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:07,319
Didn't you hear of this before?

367
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:10,580
Love well, whip well.

368
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,279
Wait.

369
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:14,079
Li Zeliang,

370
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:16,319
why did you ask me that?

371
00:24:17,217 --> 00:24:18,240
Speak.

372
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,000
Did you do something bad behind my back?

373
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,880
I didn't.

374
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,439
- Really? 
 - Really.

375
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,559
Come here.

376
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,559
Raise your arms.

377
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,839
I'm going to see if you're lying.

378
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:39,260
If you lie to me, your heartbeat will betray you.

379
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:42,859
Ask me then.

380
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:46,240
Who's the woman you love the most?

381
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,840
Su Xieyi.

382
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,999
In the future, no matter what it is, you won't deceive me, am I right?

383
00:24:52,999 --> 00:24:57,419
As long as I know the truth behind them, I won't deceive you.

384
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,900
So, do you want a son or a daughter?

385
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,180
I want both.

386
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,240
Strange.

387
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,020
Your heartbeat is getting faster.

388
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,759
Speak. Did you lie to me?

389
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:19,219
I'm sure you want a daughter.

390
00:25:19,219 --> 00:25:22,359
Everyone wants another little lover.

391
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:28,120
I did lie to you.

392
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,619
It's because I want more than just two children.

393
00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:33,200
I want enough children to form a football team.

394
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,119
- You're so greedy. I'm not that free. 
 - Sit properly.

395
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,319
We don't need to rush.

396
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:42,359
Let's take our time.

397
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:47,160
Let's start withthe goalkeeper.

398
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,160
After that, we can give birth to the strikers,

399
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,880
the defensive midfielders,

400
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,759
and the left midfielders.

401
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:58,740
After that, we'll...

402
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,180
If not, a basketball team works as well.

403
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:05,000
 Director Shi, this morning, someone published an article anonymously.

404
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,620
 It mentioned Huo Jian

405
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,559
 selling fake wine and artwork when he was the chairman.

406
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,459
 And in the article, the Lantian Bay project was mentioned specifically.

407
00:26:13,459 --> 00:26:16,939
 He said he has the project cost estimation list of the Lantian Bay project.

408
00:26:16,939 --> 00:26:18,680
 From the list,

409
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,640
 it states that our company plans to use artificial hot water

410
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,480
 instead of hot spring water to gain maximum profit.

411
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,559
 And he condemns us for deceiving the consumers.

412
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:30,880
Xieyi, let's go.

413
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,499
A'Yan, we're in trouble.

414
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,799
Currently, our industry and the public have known about this.

415
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:40,000
The group's share price is plummeting.

416
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,020
Now, the shareholders are debating whether to acknowledge the news.

417
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:47,779
We have to acknowledge it.

418
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:53,360
If we tell one lie, we need to create more lies to compensate for them.

419
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,880
In the end, it'll only ruin our company's image and trust.

420
00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:00,219
That's what I thought as well.

421
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:03,100
Plenty of press is outside our company.

422
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,500
We need to come out with a PR solution as soon as possible.

423
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:09,899
The best solution is to prevent it before it happens.

424
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,139
As for the fake wine, we've corrected it internally.

425
00:27:16,139 --> 00:27:18,579
As for the clients who had bought those fake wines,

426
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:22,080
I've listed them down and contacted them.

427
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,990
Although we've only compensated some of the clients just yet,

428
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:27,860
this is enough to prove our sincerity.

429
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:39,219
With this compensation list, I hope it can at least produce some positive effects.

430
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,820
But the main point isn't the fake wine and artwork.

431
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,900
It's the Lantian Bay project.

432
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,559
This project is vital to Ocean Hotel.

433
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,459
I know that.

434
00:27:50,459 --> 00:27:52,720
I will think of a way to clarify it.

435
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,279
Director Shi, please arrange for a press conference.

436
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,979
Okay.

437
00:27:56,979 --> 00:27:58,279
There's one more thing.

438
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:02,119
He Jianghua said an anonymous person leaked the news to him.

439
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:04,400
The information that was leaked was accurate and detailed.

440
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:08,640
Does that mean we have a spy among us?

441
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,559
That's possible.

442
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,619
After the press conference, I wish to hold an internal review.

443
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:20,519
I must find out the identity of the person who leaked the information.

444
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:23,580
Okay. I'll assist you.

445
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,700
 It's done.

446
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,720
 Later, I'll ask the Housekeeping Department to send you an air purifier.

447
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,579
 I noticed that your nose was irritated.

448
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:48,719
If I wish to provide him with clues, first, I need to know who he is.

449
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:54,479
Speaking of which, Miss Su, you met He Jianghua in the hotel, right?

450
00:28:54,479 --> 00:28:58,639
I did meet him before. But I only regarded him as an ordinary customer.

451
00:28:58,639 --> 00:29:02,519
And everything I did, I did it to protect the company's image.

452
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:04,739
Director Shi, are you suspecting me?

453
00:29:04,739 --> 00:29:07,039
I'm taking the matter on its merits. I'm just analyzing the situation.

454
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,119
You don't need to be anxious and refute my statement.

455
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:10,619
All right.

456
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:15,760
Chuchu, I believe this is a misunderstanding.

457
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,110
Our current priority is to hold a press conference

458
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:21,120
and clarify that Huo Jian was behind the old proposal.

459
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,480
At the same time, we need to announce our new proposal.

460
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,240
Okay. I'll go and prepare now.

461
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:37,300
A'Yan, I really met him by pure coincidence on that day.

462
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,260
I didn't know his true identity.

463
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:44,019
Don't take it to heart.

464
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:45,519
People are talking about this.

465
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:48,659
Director Shi, she's under huge pressure as well.

466
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,040
I believe in you.

467
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:55,399
I will resolve this.

468
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:58,880
 Hello, Mr. He.

469
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,720
 I'm Su Xieyi, the friend you added in the bookstore last time.

470
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,040
 Are you free to talk right now?

471
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,070
 Mr. He, I saw what you wrote online.

472
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,560
There are many misunderstandings.

473
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,100
 I hope I have the chance to explain the situation to you personally.

474
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,119
 If you're too busy to meet up with me, I hope we can communicate through the phone for now.

475
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,300

476
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,420

477
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,559
This is amazing. The press conference has produced immediate results.

478
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,140
The share price of Ocean Hotel has been stabilized.

479
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:06,700
But, we just initiated the Lantian Bay project, and someone leaked this news to the press.

480
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:10,480
Don't you think it's too much of a coincidence?

481
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,979
Precisely. But that He Jianghua said someone tipped him off anonymously.

482
00:31:15,979 --> 00:31:17,699
Who do you think that person is?

483
00:31:17,699 --> 00:31:19,599
An anonymous tip-off?

484
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:24,880
Who cares? If we find out his identity, he'll be fired.

485
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,679
What an ingrate. I can't understand why.

486
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:33,420

487
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,180
Very good. Strike while the iron is hot,

488
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,570
we should publish the articles that we had prepared before.

489
00:31:42,579 --> 00:31:46,380
That's right. We need to try our best to reverse public opinion.

490
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,090
All right, that's it.

491
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:51,750

492
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:59,519
 Jessica: Director Shi, check the post on the forum. This is huge.

493
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:00,880
 These people are too free.

494
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,899
 They have too much free time on their hands.

495
00:32:02,899 --> 00:32:07,350
 What has it got to do with me? I'm just concerned about the validity of the content.

496
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,460
 Ocean Hotel has always been my favorite hotel.

497
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,470
This is so disappointing.

498
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:13,759
 I'm an avid reader of Hotel World.

499
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:15,720
 The chief editor, He Jianghua, is a man of great taste.

500
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,080
I've been following him on his social accounts.

501
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,980
 That's right. I saw him in the bookstore last time.

502
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,819
 Back then, he was chatting with a beautiful girl.

503
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,700
 I did meet him before.

504
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:31,500
 But I thought he was just an ordinary customer.

505
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,899
 And everything I did, I did it to protect the company's image.

506
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,079
 Director Shi, are you suspecting me?

507
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,779
Xieyi.

508
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:49,639
A'Yan, you're back? How's the situation?

509
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:51,859
I had called the shareholders just now.

510
00:32:51,859 --> 00:32:56,220
Everyone is satisfied with the result of the press conference.

511
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,200
That's good to hear.

512
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,200
Su Xieyi,

513
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,179
when will you stop pretending?

514
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,539
Director Shi, I can explain this.

515
00:33:10,539 --> 00:33:16,099
Explain what? Explain why you leaked information to He Jianghua?

516
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:32,199
Since there are pictures of you and him, there's no way for you to deny it.

517
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,999
Calm down for now. Let's return to our office.

518
00:33:43,999 --> 00:33:47,079
We can clarify any misunderstandings over there.

519
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:51,200
No need for that. Let's make things clear right now.

520
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,730
Fine. Speak.

521
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:56,900
That day, I went to buy some soup cookbooks.

522
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,620
I did meet He Jianghua coincidentally.

523
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,450
He is very knowledgeable when it comes to soup.

524
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:03,550
That's why I asked him some questions.

525
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:07,000
You meet him by accident twice in a row? What a coincidence indeed.

526
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,639
Why would you check your phone if you only asked him questions?

527
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:12,560
Or, were you trying to leak our secrets?

528
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,339
We were just adding each other on social media.

529
00:34:14,339 --> 00:34:19,239
Fine then. Call him right now and ask him to prove your innocence.

530
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,420

531
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:46,139
I have tried to contact him since this morning. But he hasn't replied yet.

532
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:48,100
That means you have no witness to prove your innocence.

533
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:52,559
I think the so-called "adding each other on social media" is a story you came up with.

534
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:54,570
- Mr. Shi. 
 - Chairman Li,

535
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,960
I, Shi Chuchu, do not mess around.

536
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,840
He Jianghua said someone approached him and tipped him off about our company.

537
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,880
That means the person must exist.

538
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,880
Now, we have evidence that Su Xieyi had met him in private.

539
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,580
And, the proposal for the Lantian Bay project, you left it at home, right?

540
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:16,200
That means no one else has the chance to make contact with it, except for Su Xieyi.

541
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,780
With those two points, the truth has been proved.

542
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:22,500
Director. Shi, I've already explained it to you.

543
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,860
We just had an exchange about soups.

544
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,160
I even made notes of his suggestions.

545
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,900
If you don't believe me, I can show it to you.

546
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,059
Besides that, we didn't talk about anything else.

547
00:35:33,059 --> 00:35:37,280
Su Xieyi, do you even believe in your own words?

548
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,920
Director Shi,

549
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:43,640
I believe in Xieyi.

550
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:01,470
That night, Xieyi did buy some soup cookbooks and studied them at home.

551
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:03,390
I've read her notes as well.

552
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:06,300
I can testify for her.

553
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,920
What about the proposal for the Lantian Bay project?

554
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,440
Can you be sure that she hasn't seen it before?

555
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,059
Yes.

556
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:19,880
Although you didn't see it, that doesn't mean it didn't happen.

557
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,460
Now, there's no evidence to prove her innocence.

558
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:26,380
But you have no evidence to prove that it's Su Xieyi. Am I right?

559
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:30,599
Zeliang, both you and I know why Su Xieyi joined Ocean Hotel in the first place.

560
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:32,399
Director Shi!

561
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:37,219
Don't you think there are many points of doubt in this case?

562
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:42,060
Fine. If you don't want me to say it here, I'll keep quiet.

563
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,620
But I hope you can be sober.

564
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,300
This is not the time for you to act emotionally.

565
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,279
I'm very sober. Let me ask you this.

566
00:36:48,279 --> 00:36:51,919
Why did He Jianghua meet Su Xieyi twice in a row?

567
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:55,980
And why did he mention that someone tipped him off deliberately?

568
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:00,619
And at this timing, why would someone post pictures of them seeing each other online?

569
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:03,310
And it was a clear shot as well.

570
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:05,790
When you add everything together,

571
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,000
don't you think someone is trying to frame her?

572
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,059
You're just trying to cover up for her.

573
00:37:11,059 --> 00:37:15,239
Director Shi, this is not the time for you to be emotional.

574
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:16,910
If this took place in the past,

575
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:21,380
I'm sure you could reveal the truth behind the points of doubt.

576
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,900
Now, it's my problem?

577
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:29,859
Fine. I do need to calm down.

578
00:37:29,859 --> 00:37:33,799
I've been too exhausted lately. I need to take a long break.

579
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,520
You want evidence, right?

580
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,619
I'll find them eventually.

581
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,900
A'Yan.

582
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,820
Let's talk in the office.

583
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,410
A'Yan, I did read the proposal for the Lantian Bay project.

584
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:58,880
Why did you deny it just now?

585
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,160
It's because I trust you.

586
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,319
I don't want people to slander or suspect you.

587
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:10,060
You don't suspect me at all?

588
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:18,039
Xieyi. If we can't even trust each other on this matter,

589
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:20,059
how can we spend the rest of our life together?

590
