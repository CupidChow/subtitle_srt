19
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,120
I found something

20
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,560
on the construction site in Lantian Bay.

21
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:08,520
Mr. He.

22
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:10,039
Take a look.

23
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,479
Are you trying to imply

24
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,080
that this inhaler is mine?

25
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,639
You know the reason that I'm here.

26
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,560
We both know what this is about.

27
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,319
Let's have a chat.

28
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,479
What do you want?

29
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,759
I'll hand it over

30
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,280
to the police.

31
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,960
I don't need to remind you

32
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,479
whose fingerprints are on it, right?

33
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,039
Don't keep going down the wrong path.

34
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:38,800
Miss Su.

35
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,800
You dance so gracefully.

36
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,080
Be honest with me.

37
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,120
Have you been learning how to dance
since you were a kid?

38
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:46,800
Oh, right, Mr. Dai.

39
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,840
I saw He Jiang Hua walking out here

40
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,800
with an odd look on his face.

41
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,960
Him?

42
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,960
He's just a lackey.

43
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,080
He refuses to do as told.

44
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,599
Thus, the odd look.

45
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,599
Mr. Lawyer, help Mr. Dai out

46
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,120
and advise him

47
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,879
on how to deal with people like him.

48
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,560
It's okay.

49
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,680
People like He Jiang Hua

50
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,960
would set Ocean on fire

51
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,120
simply by egging him on.

52
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,960
How smart can he be?

53
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,520
He thought we would help him.

54
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,080
Right now,

55
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,159
I have something on him.

56
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:18,159
If I tell him to do something,

57
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,800
he has to do it.

58
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:20,960
When

59
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,800
he's of no value,

60
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,159
I'll set him up

61
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,879
and send him to prison

62
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:28,319
and let him rot in there.

63
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,520
He'll pose a threat to us

64
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,840
if we keep him around.

65
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,520
Mr. Dai

66
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:34,599
is a man of his word.

67
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,719
You're not being yourself today.

68
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,759
Why are you talking so much to him?

69
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,080
Are you trying to help Li Ze Liang
fish for information?

70
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:47,639
You're thinking too much.

71
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,199
Even if I am,

72
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,680
I won't have a chance to tell him.

73
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,560
Good that you know.

74
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,800
Nice!

75
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,960
Come on.

76
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,159
Hurry. Drink up.

77
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,680
Let's drink our fill.

78
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,319
Come on, Mr. Xie.

79
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,360
No, Mr. Dai.

80
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,000
I have a call to make.

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,680
Look at you.

82
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:09,360
I'll be right back.

83
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,039
Mr. Dai, a toast to you.

84
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,800
Sure. Here.

85
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,080
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,000
It's okay.

87
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,279
- I'll do it.
- How nice of you.

88
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:23,720
Xie Yi.

89
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,240
Let me do it.

90
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,720
Wait.

91
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:30,519
She...

92
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,480
I'm sorry.

93
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,519
Let's see. Where did it spill on?

94
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,319
Wait.

95
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,560
It's fine. Really.

96
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,879
Why are you being a stranger?

97
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,439
It's okay now.

98
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,160
This thing doesn't worth a thing.

99
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,480
All right then.

100
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,160
Tell me. What should I do?

101
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,319
Reveal the truth,

102
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,000
including the evil deeds of Xie Ming Hao

103
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,199
and Dai.

104
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,319
If you turn yourself in,
you'll get a lighter sentence.

105
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,800
Mr. Li.

106
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,560
If you think

107
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,759
that I get scared easily,

108
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,000
then, you're wrong.

109
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,240
Many people

110
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,720
use such an inhaler.

111
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,920
You can deal with it

112
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,199
however you want.

113
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,839
I won't see you out.

114
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,199
Look, Mr. Xie.

115
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,240
Don't say I didn't remind you.

116
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,390
(Li Ze Liang)
Things are different

117
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,920
now that you have a girlfriend.

118
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,680
Be sure

119
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,759
to thoroughly remove

120
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,120
(Recording)
the pictures of the girls,

121
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,639
and delete all the chat records

122
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,800
with them.

123
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,319
If she finds out,

124
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,480
you'll have no end of trouble.

125
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,279
Xie Yi, what are you doing?

126
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,399
I'm taking a selfie.

127
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:55,480
Why don't the three of us

128
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,439
take a photo together?

129
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:57,839
Give me the phone.

130
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:15,959
What do you think?

131
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,040
Do I look nice?

132
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,120
It'll be perfect if I'm in it.

133
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,160
Oh, come on.
Showing affection in front of me.

134
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:26,600
All right. Cut the crap.

135
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,560
Come on. Drink up.

136
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,879
I'll fill it up for you.

137
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:29,399
Here, Mr. Dai.

138
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,959
Come on. Let's drink.

139
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,700
(Xie Ming Hao, Recording)

140
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,920
(He would set Ocean on fire)

141
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,199
(simply by egging him on.)

142
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,680
(How smart can he be?)

143
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,639
(He thought we would help him.)

144
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,480
(Right now,)

145
00:06:58,032 --> 00:07:00,152
(I have something on him.)

146
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,040
(If I tell him to do something,)

147
00:07:02,231 --> 00:07:03,791
(he has to do it.)

148
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,199
(When)

149
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,800
(he's of no value,)

150
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,199
(I'll set him up)

151
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,759
(and send him to prison)

152
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,399
(and let him rot in there.)

153
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,839
(Zhiwei's bankruptcy)

154
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,720
(had nothing to do with Liang.)

155
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,000
It was all Shen Xie Qing

156
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:42,680
and Xie Ming Hao's doing.

157
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,079
What do you think I should do?

158
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:46,759
Push all the blame

159
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,959
on Su Xie Yi?

160
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,480
Then, push her out

161
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:50,519
and let her come under fire

162
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,680
in order

163
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:52,759
to protect Ocean's reputation?

164
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,120
(You did this for this woman)

165
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,959
(who's up to no good.)

166
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,920
(Is it worth it?)

167
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,759
(Ms. Shi.)

168
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,560
Don't you think

169
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,560
this whole thing

170
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,879
has many doubtful points?

171
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:02,839
If you don't want me to say it,

172
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,439
I won't.

173
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,920
But I hope you can wake up.

174
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,439
This isn't the time

175
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,600
to let emotions cloud your judgment!

176
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,319
I'm thinking perfectly straight.

177
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,120
(Ze Liang.)

178
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:14,680
(I'm sorry.)

179
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
(All this while,
I'm the one who let emotions)

180
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,319
(cloud my judgment.)

181
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,759
(This mistake that I made
serves as a wake-up call to me.)

182
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,360
(You two)

183
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,879
(are the ones who know each other best.)

184
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,919
(It's time I let go.)

185
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,400
(Ocean Group)

186
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,000
Ze Liang.

187
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,200
It was Mr. Dai

188
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,679
who requested the stockholders' meeting.

189
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,360
He's coming for you.

190
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,080
I know.

191
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,200
There's a total of nine votes
from the board of directors.

192
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,519
As far as I know,

193
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,440
he has four votes in hand.

194
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,279
I'm the only one who can help you now.

195
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:16,320
You know that.

196
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,159
Just say the word,

197
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,399
and I won't say no.

198
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,879
Ms. Shi.

199
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,960
This is my own problem.

200
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,120
I don't want to get you dragged into it.

201
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,720
I'm sorry.

202
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,879
I went out to sea last night to fish.

203
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,720
So I got up late.

204
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:30,600
Good morning, everyone.

205
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,080
(Mr. Dai, you're here.)

206
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,159
(Here. Take a seat.)

207
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,039
(Zhang.)

208
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:34,919
(How is it?)

209
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,440
Did you receive the softshell turtle?

210
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:37,440
Is it good?

211
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,480
I caught it myself.

212
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:40,679
It's very nutritious.

213
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,919
Go on.

214
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,720
This conference room

215
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,440
is a little shabby.

216
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,840
The devil's in the detail.

217
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,559
Like these broken chairs,

218
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,519
the table,

219
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,200
and the people.

220
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,399
They should be weeded out.

221
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:04,320
You're here, Mr. Li.

222
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,879
Sorry, I didn't notice.

223
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:11,840
Now that everyone is here,

224
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,480
let's get onto the agenda.

225
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,759
Hold on.

226
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,510
(Ocean Hotel's meeting of stockholders)
Allow me to introduce.

227
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,080
This is Miss Su Xie Yi.

228
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,720
I'm sure everyone knows her.

229
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,399
She's Mr. Dai's
temporary special assistant.

230
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,480
Let's have her set out Zhengde's plans

231
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,639
to everyone.

232
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,200
Hold on.

233
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,440
Xie Yi.

234
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,240
Here. Come here.

235
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:34,919
Hurry.

236
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,960
Come over.

237
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,600
To make an announcement,

238
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,960
you should do it

239
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,519
at the right place.

240
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:44,480
(Please.)

241
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:53,440
(Zhengde and Diying)

242
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:54,639
(have no objection)

243
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:56,080
to the stockholders meeting process

244
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:57,919
received in the morning.

245
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,480
But before moving on

246
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:01,799
to discuss how to deal
with Ocean's situation,

247
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,399
Diying proposes

248
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,840
to first deal with the accident

249
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,679
that took place in Lantian Bay.

250
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,960
Well, what do Zhengde and Diying propose

251
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,600
that we should do
to deal with the matter

252
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:21,360
before

253
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:22,879
moving on with the procedures?

254
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:42,679
"In view

255
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,000
of the wrong decision

256
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,440
made by Mr. Li Ze Liang
in the Lantian Bay project,

257
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,240
it led

258
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,799
Ocean stock to take a hit.

259
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,600
We suggest

260
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,519
that Mr. Li Ze Liang

261
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:57,759
must be removed from the post
of chairman.

262
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,320
That's because a tainted chairman

263
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:06,279
with bad leadership

264
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,440
will do no good
to the company whatsoever."

265
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,639
Come on. Let's vote.

266
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:13,279
I second that.

267
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,960
Ms. Shi, please take a stand.

268
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,279
It's more than half of the votes.

269
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,919
Mr. Li, I'm so sorry.

270
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,919
You may change seats.

271
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:50,039
I'll pick for you.

272
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,399
The seat over there looks good.

273
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:55,039
Please.

274
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,000
All right.

275
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,720
We can now officially

276
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,600
get onto the agenda.

277
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,600
Ms. Shi.

278
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:34,120
Please preside over the meeting.

279
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,120
- Ming Yue.
- Ming Yue.

280
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,320
- Ming Yue.
- Ming Yue.

281
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:46,960
Mr. Xie

282
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,240
is now Zhengde's business lawyer,

283
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,720
and Su Xie Yi is now

284
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,799
Mr. Dai's

285
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,039
temporary special assistant.

286
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,159
What nonsense is this?

287
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,399
It's true.

288
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:58,240
We heard it

289
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,639
when we went to deliver the tea.

290
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,879
Ming Yue.

291
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,639
Didn't you say

292
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:04,399
that you believed her?

293
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:08,519
If

294
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:09,919
there's nothing else,

295
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:10,960
we'll end the meeting here.

296
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,279
Mr. Li.

297
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:18,519
Are you in a hurry to go home?

298
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:19,639
What will you do at home?

299
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,159
Go home to keep your girlfriend company?

300
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,000
Isn't your girlfriend

301
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:27,279
over there?

302
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,440
I got it messed up.

303
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:33,440
She's your ex-girlfriend now.

304
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,440
Mr. Xie.

305
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,080
If you ask me,

306
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,440
you're indeed a man of charm.

307
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:39,320
Both sisters vied with each other

308
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,679
and fell for you at the same time.

309
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,240
Miss Su, especially.

310
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:43,279
She gave up her position

311
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,600
as the wife of Ocean's chairman,

312
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:46,320
and fell in love with you.

313
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,399
You have to cherish her.

314
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:50,240
Dai Zi Ang.

315
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:51,879
I'm warning you

316
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:53,159
not to discuss
other people's private matters

317
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,679
in public.

318
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,519
Private matters?

319
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:57,919
Is it?

320
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,759
In that case,

321
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:01,200
why not make it public then?

322
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:03,879
Miss Su.

323
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:06,320
Have you broken up

324
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:07,919
with Mr. Li Ze Liang?

325
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,559
Tell them.

326
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,919
That's right.

327
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,559
I broke up with Mr. Li a long time ago.

328
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,600
We have nothing to do
with each other now.

329
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:41,240
Mr. Li.

330
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:42,960
How miserable.

331
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,320
You lost your chairman post

332
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,120
and got dumped by your girlfriend.

333
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,399
What's the saying?

334
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:50,440
Suffering a double loss.

335
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:51,600
A real pity.

336
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:52,320
Meeting's over.

337
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,120
How pitiful!

338
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:54,960
What a real pity!

339
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:28,879
Su Xie Yi.

340
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,399
Don't you think you've gone too far?

341
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,600
When others

342
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:32,519
spoke ill of you,

343
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,360
I foolishly

344
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,120
stood up for you.

345
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,360
From the looks of it,

346
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,799
you had me fooled, hadn't you?

347
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,519
Look what you've done to Mr. Li

348
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:39,720
and Ocean.

349
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,919
You're such a cold-blooded

350
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,080
and ruthless woman.

351
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,080
Was it all

352
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,720
just a show?

353
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:48,960
I'm sorry.

354
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:04,119
I've checked and verified it
through the fund company.

355
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,640
You were right.

356
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,680
In order

357
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,400
to take over Ocean,

358
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,200
Dai has gambled away

359
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,400
his whole fortune

360
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,400
to fight this battle with you.

361
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:16,519
How much did he pledge?

362
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,640
All twenty percent

363
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:19,480
of Zhengde stocks that he owns

364
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,319
was pledged to Aihong Fund.

365
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,160
According
to the performance guarantee ratio,

366
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,359
Zhengde's stock price

367
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,559
cannot fall below 30 percent.

368
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,119
Otherwise, it is likely

369
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,720
to be forced to liquidate.

370
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,759
He sure is aggressive.

371
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,119
That's right.

372
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:36,640
At that time,
Zhengde's stock price will plummet.

373
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,839
That Dai dude

374
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,319
will be forced to liquidate.

375
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,200
Do you think he will jump into the sea?

376
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,759
Hou Xiao Dong.

377
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:47,599
Not only can you sing rock songs,

378
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:48,920
but you're also even
an expert in finance.

379
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:49,839
Of course.

380
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:51,799
Thanks to the influence
from a young age.

381
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,599
I picked it up along the way.

382
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,519
I just

383
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,319
didn't want
to inherit my dad's business.

384
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,039
Ms. Shi.

385
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:01,079
You put on quite a good show today.

386
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:03,519
Likewise.

387
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,440
Mr. Li.

388
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,559
Liang.

389
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,880
This was the first time

390
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:15,559
I begged my dad for something.

391
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:16,759
It was all for you.

392
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:18,039
So?

393
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:19,920
So rock, isn't it?

394
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:21,680
So today's drinks

395
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,880
are on you.

396
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:26,440
No problem.

397
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,880
Oh, right.

398
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,839
How are you coping

399
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,279
with today's incident?

400
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:43,720
Although you guys

401
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,279
told me to believe in Su Xie Yi,

402
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,119
I couldn't wrap my head

403
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:49,079
around her deeds and words today.

404
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,400
That makes me believe her even more.

405
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,720
Besides,

406
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,400
Xie Yi is secretly helping me.

407
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,599
I received a text message

408
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,039
from Xie Ming Hao.

409
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,960
It was a recording.

410
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:07,759
Many people

411
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,000
use such an inhaler.

412
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,616
You can deal with it

413
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:12,880
however you want.

414
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:15,279
I won't see you out.

415
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:26,250
(Xie Ming Hao, Recording)

416
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:29,240
If He Jiang Hua

417
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,960
hears this recording,

418
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,160
he'll go berserk.

419
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,279
But why would it be sent over

420
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,319
by Xie Ming Hao?

421
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,720
Xie Ming Hao would never expose himself.

422
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,839
The only explanation

423
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:43,640
is that someone else used his phone.

424
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:45,880
It could only be Xie Yi.

425
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,640
Xie Ming Hao took Xie Yi

426
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,200
to meet Di Zi Ang yesterday.

427
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:50,960
It's possible that her phone

428
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,279
was taken.

429
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,599
He Jiang Hua

430
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,119
is the deciding factor.

431
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,160
If we can convince him,

432
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,559
there's hope to turn things around.

433
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:09,240
Mr. He.

434
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,880
Why are you here again?

435
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,839
I've said everything
that needs to be said.

436
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,400
Please leave.

437
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:18,720
Listen to this.

438
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,079
After that,

439
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,079
you might

440
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:23,960
get a good picture of things.

441
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,240
(He's just a lackey.)

442
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,400
(He refuses to do as told.)

443
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:31,680
(Thus, the odd look.)

444
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,400
(People like He Jiang Hua)

445
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,440
(would set Ocean on fire)

446
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,720
(simply by egging him on.)

447
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,559
(How smart can he be?)

448
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,759
(Right now,)

449
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,839
(I have something on him.)

450
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,839
(If I tell him to do something,)

451
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,759
(he has to do it.)

452
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:45,759
(When)

453
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,559
(he's of no value,)

454
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:48,799
(I'll set him up)

455
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:50,680
(and send him to prison)

456
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,160
(and let him rot in there.)

457
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,759
(He'll pose a threat to us)

458
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,799
(if we keep him around.)

459
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:56,680
(Mr. Dai)

460
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:57,920
(is a man of his word.)

461
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:03,960
Dai Zi Ang made you commit arson

462
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,559
because

463
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:07,200
he wants to have something on you.

464
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,480
That way,

465
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,720
you would have to play along with them.

466
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,759
I've handed

467
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,160
the rhinitis spray to the police.

468
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:14,079
Do the right thing now.

469
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,160
Mr. Li.

470
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,519
I get what you're saying.

471
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,440
But I can't afford

472
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,839
to mess with these people.

473
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:23,079
Do you think you can hide from them?

474
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,000
Will the police let you get away?

475
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,640
Will Dai Zi Ang let things slide?

476
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:30,440
He won't.

477
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,599
He'll only get worse

478
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,599
and make you their accomplice.

479
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:36,519
At that time,

480
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,640
your sin will keep running deeper.

481
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,640
He could make you commit arson now.

482
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,279
In the future, he can force you to kill.

483
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,039
Right now,

484
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,599
you have only two options.

485
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:53,559
It's either

486
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,920
you stay right down the path you're on,

487
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,559
or

488
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:01,599
you step back from the brink.

489
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,720
Of course.

490
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,200
I can help you.

491
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,839
Just come forward
and testify against them,

492
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,079
then Ocean will call off
the damage claim,

493
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:24,680
and get you the best lawyer.

494
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,160
Cooperate with the police investigation,

495
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,440
and you can obtain leniency.

496
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:38,240
Mr. He.

497
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,880
I believe

498
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:41,400
your original intention

499
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,880
when you got into the media industry

500
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,599
was to become

501
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:45,960
a fighter of justice.

502
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:47,960
You had a momentary lapse in judgment

503
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,240
and were taken advantage of.

504
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:50,240
You don't wish

505
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:51,559
to keep going down
the wrong path either.

506
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,359
Right?

507
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,240
So

508
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,720
as to which path to take,

509
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,240
I believe

510
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,000
you already have the answer
in your heart.

511
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,200
Mr. Li.

512
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:16,640
What should I do?

513
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,839
Do what you do best

514
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,480
and use it to uncover the truth.

515
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,599
Okay.

516
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:31,599
This is great, Ze Liang.

517
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,799
He Jiang Hua

518
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,640
has the video recorded

519
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,279
and is willing

520
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,480
to step forward
and testify against them.

521
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,359
When will you
be making the announcement?

522
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,000
Now isn't the time yet.

523
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,279
We have to find Xie Qing first.

524
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:41,960
I suspect

525
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,480
that Xie Ming Hao hid her somewhere.

526
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:45,680
But I've followed Xie

527
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,799
for a few days now.

528
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,039
Besides his residence and law firm,

529
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:48,759
he hasn't been

530
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,160
to any other places.

531
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:53,599
If Xie Qing is still alive,

532
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:55,799
she has to eat somehow.

533
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:01,680
Is it possible

534
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,279
that Xie Ming Hao has her tucked away
in his own apartment?

535
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:04,880
Mr. Li, I'll investigate it right away.

536
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,000
Coincidentally,

537
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:11,599
Dai Zi Ang and Xie Ming Hao

538
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:12,880
asked me out for dinner tonight.

539
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:13,359
Since they want

540
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:14,720
to rope me in,

541
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,079
I'll see if I can worm anything
out of them

542
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:17,720
and meet up with Xie Yi while I'm at it.

543
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:20,680
Be careful.

544
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,559
It's more than half of the votes.

545
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,200
Mr. Li, I'm so sorry.

546
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,240
You may change seats.

547
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:52,440
I'll pick for you.

548
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,720
(Ms. Shi was acting
out of the ordinary.)

549
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,240
(She couldn't possibly betray Yan.)

550
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:00,480
(Why would it be like this?)

551
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,759
Xie Yi.

552
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,599
Xie Yi.

553
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:09,839
(Get ready to go out.)

554
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:11,400
(Mr. Dai arranged a celebration dinner.)

555
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:12,920
Okay.

556
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:18,160
What's the matter?

557
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:24,400
I'm sorry.

558
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:25,599
I wanted

559
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:26,759
to take a bath.

560
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:28,039
But I got distracted.

561
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,160
(Open up!)

562
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,480
(The water's leaking!)

563
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:37,799
It's you.

564
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:39,200
You're really something.

565
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:40,400
You own two units?

566
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,759
And even two wives.

567
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:43,960
Sorry, let's talk outside.

568
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,799
What's wrong with you?

569
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:49,559
Two days ago,

570
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,720
I just complimented you
for being a good husband.

571
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:53,160
(Look at the water leakage.)

572
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,279
(Our ceiling and wallpaper)

573
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:55,519
(are all wet.)

574
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:56,519
(How are you going to deal with this?)

575
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:57,920
I'm so sorry.

576
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:58,920
The floor drain is clogged.

577
00:25:59,039 --> 00:25:59,559
We didn't know

578
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,319
what had happened.

579
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,079
How about this?

580
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:02,599
I'll compensate you for your loss.

581
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:03,400
(On top of that,)

582
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,759
(I'll pay
for the emotional distress caused.)

583
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,279
(You're a pleasant man to deal with.)

584
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,839
(But you have to keep your word.)

585
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:09,119
Sorry for the trouble.

586
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,680
I'll get going then.

587
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,759
Don't you forget.

588
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:13,240
I'm sorry.

589
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,319
Xie Yi.

590
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,440
Xie Yi?

591
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,400
How did it go?

592
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:36,319
It's taken care of.

593
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:37,920
That's great then.

594
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:44,039
What's wrong?

595
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:45,960
Nothing.

596
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:47,359
Leave it.

597
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,480
Clean yourself up.

598
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:49,559
We're leaving in a bit.

599
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,519
Okay.

600
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,079
(Two units? Two wives?)

601
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:04,160
(Is my sister in the unit below us?)

602
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,799
So the neighbor downstairs

603
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,039
isn't mad anymore?

604
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,079
Why don't

605
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,960
I buy something for her tomorrow
as a token of apology?

606
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,519
We're neighbors after all.

607
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,920
It's better to get along
with each other.

608
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:25,839
It's okay.

609
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:26,920
It's no issue.

610
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,359
That neighbor is a nice person.

611
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,079
Sorry.

612
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:32,960
I'm late.

613
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,599
My VIPs are here.

614
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,160
Sorry to keep you waiting.

615
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,279
Ms. Shi?

616
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:40,440
Are you surprised?

617
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:41,640
Indeed,

618
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,359
there were some misunderstandings
between us.

619
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:44,519
But it's all in the past now.

620
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,279
Let bygones

621
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:47,480
be bygones.

622
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:48,440
That's right.

623
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:49,799
We'll all be friends now.

624
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,240
Come on. Take a seat.

625
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:52,680
Here.

626
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,279
Firstly,

627
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:56,720
I want to express my deepest gratitude

628
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,599
to Ms. Shi.

629
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:00,039
After all, your vote

630
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:02,119
is crucial to me.

631
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,359
Also,

632
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,599
I have one other thing

633
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:06,839
to ask you, Ms. Shi.

634
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,240
Are you really planning

635
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,119
to sell your stocks in Ocean?

636
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:12,839
Of course.

637
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,079
There's nothing else

638
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,480
left for me in Ocean.

639
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,920
After the transfer of the stocks,

640
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:19,559
I'll stop

641
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:21,119
engaging in wishful thinking about him.

642
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:21,880
This is great.

643
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,000
How about this?

644
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,240
You can transfer

645
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:25,559
all your Ocean's stocks to me.

646
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:26,200
Don't worry.

647
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,839
I'll make sure you're well paid for it.

648
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:28,920
Tomorrow, I'll get Mr. Xie

649
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,440
to draw up a contract,

650
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,480
and we can sign it as soon as possible.

651
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:32,799
Nice doing business with you.

652
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,160
Nice doing business with you. Here.

653
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,720
Come on. Let's drink this together.

654
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,000
- Here.
- Bottoms up!

655
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,440
Come on. Let's dig in.

656
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,640
You guys must be starving.

657
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,960
Come on. Dig in.

658
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,720
Let's not wait.

659
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,319
Excuse me.

660
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:46,440
I'm going to the washroom.

661
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,680
Sure. Help yourself.

662
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,680
Perfect. I'm going to.

663
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,319
Let's go together, Ms. Shi.

664
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:52,200
Sure.

665
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:52,799
Okay.

666
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Be my guest.

667
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:56,839
Mr. Xie, let's eat.

668
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:06,920
Can we trust Shi Chu Chu?

669
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,200
That depends

670
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,759
on if she dares to sell her stocks.

671
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:11,680
Just test her out, and we'll know.

672
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:21,720
Ms. Shi.

673
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,079
Don't be fooled by them.

674
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:24,400
Yan needs you now

675
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:25,680
more than ever.

676
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:34,559
I didn't betray Ze Liang.

677
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:37,799
Actually, we've been putting on a show.

678
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:42,079
Ze Liang wants me to tell you

679
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:43,559
not to worry about Ocean.

680
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,359
He's received

681
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:45,200
the recording you sent.

682
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:46,680
This evidence is crucial.

683
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:48,319
But right now,

684
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:49,480
there's something more important

685
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,440
that I have to verify with you.

686
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,359
Is your sister still alive?

687
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:53,319
Is Xie Ming Hao using her

688
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:55,240
to threaten you?

689
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:57,960
That's right.

690
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,839
Indeed, she's still alive.

691
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,839
So Ze Liang is right.

692
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:06,839
He said that your sister
is likely to be locked up

693
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,720
in the apartment building

694
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,759
where Xie Ming Hao lives.

695
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,359
Do you know the exact location?

696
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,680
Ze Liang wants to rescue her.

697
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:13,759
In the last few days,

698
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,440
I've been observing Xie Ming Hao.

699
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,680
Combining with what you just said,

700
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,279
I can basically tell

701
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,839
that my sister is held

702
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,440
in the apartment
below Xie Ming Hao's unit.

703
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:24,519
The neighbor from the unit
below said

704
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:25,759
that Xie Ming Hao

705
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:26,799
owns two units in the building

706
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:28,920
and suspects that he has two wives.

707
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,359
That proves that she has met him

708
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,240
downstairs before.

709
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,759
I don't know which unit it is.

710
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:34,960
But

711
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:38,039
I guess it's not too far from 1503.

712
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:39,519
This is great.

713
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,720
This can help us narrow it down.

714
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:44,319
Xie Ming Hao has been meaning

715
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,559
to take me out for a Western dinner.

716
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:47,559
How about this?

717
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:48,880
Tomorrow, I'll ask him out

718
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,319
at 7:00 in the evening.

719
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,680
Help me inform Yan

720
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,720
and tell him to get my sister
out of there.

721
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,200
Don't worry.

722
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,400
But if we get Xie Qing out,

723
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,599
what about you?

724
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,480
Just give me a call and let me know.

725
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,480
There are more solutions
than there are problems.

726
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:08,440
Be careful.

727
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,319
Mr. Li.

728
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,440
I've checked.

729
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,880
1603 is the only unit in the building

730
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,759
that's registered
under Xie Ming Hao's name.

731
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:22,279
I'm not surprised.

732
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,799
Xie Ming Hao

733
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,039
is always very cautious.

734
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,960
Even if he has rented another unit,

735
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,480
he'll not use his own name.

736
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,519
Should I get people

737
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,240
to check from house to house?

738
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:32,359
No.

739
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,039
This will surely

740
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:34,079
alert Xie Ming Hao.

741
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,359
Before you can find her,

742
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:36,240
he might already

743
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:37,440
have her transferred elsewhere.

744
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:47,440
Xie Yi.

745
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,279
Chu Chu has spoken to me.

746
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,960
I understand whatever you're doing.

747
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:53,559
But I want to tell you this.

748
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,039
My greatest regret in life

749
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,039
is failing to save Uncle Shen

750
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:58,720
on that rainy night.

751
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,160
So, tomorrow,

752
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,000
I'm going to get your sister
out of there.

753
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,279
I won't make you sad anymore.

754
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:13,279
I don't want you to cry

755
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,440
and I won't make you cry again.

756
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:15,880
Xie Yi.

757
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,440
To the world,

758
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:20,119
you may be one person.

759
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,039
But to me,

760
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:23,920
you mean the world.

761
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:25,599
Xie Yi.

762
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:26,839
Come back.

763
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,839
Yan.

764
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,079
Wait for my return.

765
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,440
This way, please.

766
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,720
Sir.

767
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:57,119
I'll ask the kitchen
to get the food ready.

768
00:32:57,599 --> 00:32:58,079
Go on.

769
00:32:58,119 --> 00:32:58,599
Okay.

770
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,880
Do you still remember this song?

771
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:22,799
This is a famous tango

772
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,440
in Spain.

773
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:25,680
"Por una Cabeza."

774
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:26,599
That's right.

775
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,880
"Por una Cabeza."

776
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,000
It's like the distance between us.

777
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:31,039
So near,

778
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,400
yet so far like we're separated
by a galaxy.

779
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:52,880
Do you remember

780
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,640
the first time we met?

781
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:55,119
Of course.

782
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:58,200
It was snowing that day.

783
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,559
You were bullied by people
by the side of the road.

784
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:03,319
Not only were you skinny,
but you were also thinly dressed too.

785
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:05,599
If I say I was frozen

786
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,400
before I met you,

787
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:09,239
well, I was melted

788
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,760
the moment I met you.

789
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:14,320
At that time, the video store behind me

790
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:15,440
was playing this song.

791
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,320
I will never forget

792
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,880
that moment in my life.

793
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,679
How great would it be

794
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,840
if we could go back in time?

795
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,440
If we could go back in time,

796
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,480
if I could

797
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,559
give you that doll back then,

798
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,639
would I be the one you love?

799
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,719
Ming Hao.

800
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,960
There are no ifs in life.

801
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:01,440
(This way, please.)

802
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,760
(Hui Hu Apartment)

803
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,760
I left something in the car.

804
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:05,920
You guys can go ahead.

805
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,440
I'll go and get it.

806
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,280
All right.

807
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:09,960
We'll wait for you
on the third floor then.

808
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:10,639
All right.

809
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,480
Okay.

810
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,480
Sir.

811
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:13,480
Let me introduce this listing.

812
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:14,920
It's really hard to come by.

813
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:39,360
Thank you so much

814
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,280
for spending

815
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,320
such a romantic night with me.

816
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:43,320
Here's a little surprise for you.

817
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:46,559
Your favorite dessert in Germany.

818
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:48,320
Thank you.

819
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:49,559
You're welcome.

820
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:55,440
Hi, who's this?

821
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,639
Hi, is this Mr. Xie?

822
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,960
Yes. What is it?

823
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,199
Are you at home?

824
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,519
I'm not. Why?

825
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,360
Two people

826
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:04,239
came to view the units here.

827
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:05,920
They look like the creditors

828
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:07,039
in the photo you showed me.

829
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:13,800
Are you sure?

830
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,480
It might be a mistake
if it was only one person.

831
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:17,320
But if both guys resemble the creditors,
it won't be wrong.

832
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,639
Okay. I got it.

833
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,480
Thank you.

834
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:31,119
Xie Yi.

835
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,519
It's time to leave.

836
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,199
What's the matter?

837
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,400
Someone broke into the house.

838
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:37,760
I need to go and take a look.

839
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,079
Since someone

840
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,119
gave you a call earlier,

841
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,639
it means they'd take care of it.

842
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,599
At least,

843
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,400
let me finish the dessert first.

844
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,679
I said, go home.

845
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,199
Is anyone in there?

846
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:01,719
Is anyone in there?

847
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,519
Is anyone in there?

848
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,440
What's the matter?

849
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:26,079
Hi.

850
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,880
Have you seen this guy?

851
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:29,119
I don't know him!

852
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:40,039
Xie Qing!

853
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:42,199
Xie Qing!

854
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,960
It's me.

855
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,599
Xie Qing!

856
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:47,840
(I'm here!)

857
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,639
Xie Qing!

858
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,320
Xie Qing!

859
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:54,159
