00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:03,920
Mr. Li,

20
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,120
what did you promise?

21
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,400
You guaranteed that this auction
would be successful.

22
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:09,000
There would be no mistakes.

23
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:09,879
But what is your explanation

24
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,879
for what happened today?

25
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,039
Mr. Roman,

26
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,599
don't worry.

27
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,479
I am sorry for what happened today.

28
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,840
But please trust me.

29
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,560
I will get to the bottom of the matter.

30
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,080
I will give you a satisfactory answer.

31
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,759
Also,

32
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm not sure if the singer was poisoned

33
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:24,439
by the wine?

34
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,439
If so,

35
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:26,360
that glass of wine was originally

36
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,719
served to my wife.

37
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:28,639
You must

38
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,360
get to the bottom of the matter!

39
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,919
I will give you one day.

40
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,199
Within a day,

41
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,840
please give me a reasonable explanation.

42
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:35,560
And it must not affect

43
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:36,759
Fujiade's image.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,199
Or else, I will pull out
of the exhibition.

45
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,240
All losses

46
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,800
shall be borne by you.

47
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,240
Mr. Ro...

48
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,759
Oscar.

49
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,400
How's he now?

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,120
(Ambulance)

51
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,599
Everyone in the trade knows

52
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,759
that it can be used
to wipe the bracelet.

53
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,879
And I

54
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,439
am about to wipe the pick.

55
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,919
I need it in a while.

56
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:35,560
Mr. Huo,

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,360
I have no idea what's going on.

58
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,800
How could it be that guy?

59
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,280
Don't panic.

60
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:41,599
What's most important now

61
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,840
is to get rid of

62
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,319
all evidence and clues.

63
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,639
Yes.

64
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,439
I will deal with it right away.

65
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,800
Chen Heng Sheng?

Mr. Ji.

68
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,600
Give me the car key.

69
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,639
Where are you going?

70
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,040
This is Mr. Li's car.

71
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,120
Inform Li Ze Liang

72
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:51,639
that I've found

73
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,879
the evidence of Oscar's poisoning.

74
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,360
I'll call him later.

75
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,040
Li Ze Liang.

76
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,800
(Fujiade Auction Reception)

77
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,680
Where's Su Xie Yi?

78
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,240
No idea.

79
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,720
I'm also looking for her.

80
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,360
I tried calling her,

81
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,639
but she didn't pick up my call.

82
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,180
I don't know what happened to her.

83
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,000
If anything happens to Xie Yi again,

84
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,240
you will answer for it.

85
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,120
Mr. Li!

86
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,560
Miss Su drove your car away.

87
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,160
She said she had found

88
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,439
the evidence of Oscar's poisoning.

89
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,360
Did she say where she was going?

90
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,120
No.

91
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,879
Su Xie Yi is really...

92
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,820
(Su Xie Yi)

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,639
Su Xie Yi,

94
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,600
where are you?

95
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,160
I'm tailing Chen Heng Sheng.

96
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,199
He must be thinking

97
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,279
of using the fact

98
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:53,600
that Mrs. Roman only drinks
gin and tonic

99
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,319
I made

100
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,759
and laced the lemons with poison.

101
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,480
Now, he's afraid that the matter
will come to light.

102
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,519
He must be getting rid of

103
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,680
the problematic lemons now.

104
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,079
Chen Heng Sheng?

105
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,720
That box of lemons is the evidence.

106
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,000
I can't let him destroy it.

107
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,240
Su Xie Yi,

108
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,240
send me

109
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,120
your location now.

110
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,240
I will come to you right away.

111
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,680
Before I arrive,

112
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,240
don't take any impulsive action.

113
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,120
Do you hear me?

114
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,319
Okay.

115
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,199
Wait for me here.

116
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:17,959
No one

117
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,079
should know about this matter.

118
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:19,959
Got it.

(Chen Heng Sheng)
It's Chen Heng Sheng.

123
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,279
Hello.

124
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,720
It's bad.

125
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,720
I was exposed.

126
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,879
What?

127
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,879
When I was getting rid of the lemons,

128
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,279
Su Xie Yi saw me.

129
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,720
I've knocked her out.

130
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:12,639
Su Xie Yi?

131
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:13,960
She has been knocked out?

132
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,039
Yes.

133
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,039
She saw me.

134
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,000
I had no choice.

135
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:19,200
What should I do now?

136
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,820
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

137
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:23,240
Xie Yi!

138
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,720
Gosh.

139
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,320
Li Ze Liang is here.

What should we do?

142
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,600
The police will suspect me.

143
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,639
I have a long life ahead.

144
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:39,679
I don't want

145
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:40,720
to spend the rest of my life in prison.

146
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:45,039
Xie Yi!

147
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:49,919
Xie Yi!

148
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,799
He's getting nearer.

149
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,639
He'll definitely notice Su Xie Yi.

150
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:54,679
What about

151
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:57,000
we turn ourselves in?

152
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:58,399
Shut up!

153
00:11:58,799 --> 00:11:59,799
Why are you panicking?

154
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:01,679
Isn't this good?

155
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:03,080
What are you talking about?

156
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,279
Su Xie Yi!

157
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:06,639
Have you forgotten

158
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,440
the reason

159
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,360
we did this?

160
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,639
Isn't this

161
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:10,960
a great opportunity?

162
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,120
A great opportunity?

163
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,919
Use your brain

164
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,600
and think carefully.

165
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:18,320
As long as they don't turn up

166
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,559
at the press conference tomorrow,

167
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,320
Roman will officially announce
to pull out of the exhibition.

168
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,519
No matter what they do then,

169
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,519
they won't be able to turn the tables.

170
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,759
But...

171
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,200
But I can't

172
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,360
lock them up forever.

173
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:31,720
They have seen me.

174
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,360
If they testify against me,

175
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,679
I... I will be done for.

176
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:37,759
Of course, if you insist on
turning yourself in,

177
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,360
I can't stop you.

178
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,600
But your son

179
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,320
may also need to call

180
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,240
for a press conference.

181
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:49,519
Hello.

182
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:50,360
Hello.

183
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,399
Hello.

184
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,320
Su Xie Yi!

185
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,879
Xie Yi!

186
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,159
Xie Yi!

187
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,080
I'm here. Over here.

188
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,799
Xie Yi!

189
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,720
Xie Yi!

190
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:34,639
Are you all right?

191
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,000
(Dangerous Pollutants. No Admittance)

192
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:54,399
Chen Heng Sheng!

193
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,159
Chen Heng Sheng.

194
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:57,200
Are you aware of

195
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,519
the consequences of your action?

196
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:00,240
Stop shouting!

197
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,279
I won't hurt you two.

198
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:04,240
I will turn myself in.

199
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:05,960
I was forced to do this.

200
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:07,519
I have no choice!

201
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,960
After the matter is over,

202
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,039
I will come back to release you two!

203
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:12,360
(Dangerous Pollutants)

204
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,320
Chen Heng Sheng!

205
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,510
Chen Heng Sheng!

206
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,879
Chen Heng Sheng!

207
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,320
Come back!

208
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,960
If those two return,

209
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,200
they won't let Chen Heng Sheng go.

210
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,240
Things will get complicated then.

211
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,639
The lemons have been disposed of.

212
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,159
How will they testify?

213
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,840
They need to show the evidence.

214
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:48,600
Besides,

215
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:49,399
Chen Heng Sheng is also

216
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,159
a veteran at Ocean Hotel.

217
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:53,440
Well, do you think the shareholders

218
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:54,240
will believe

219
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,960
Shen Zhi Hong's daughter

220
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,399
or those on their side?

221
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,039
You're right.

222
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,440
I didn't expect Su Xie Yi

223
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,159
to be such a great pawn.

224
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:12,120
Men

225
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:14,600
can't live

226
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:16,120
without women.

227
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,039
Are you talking about yourself

228
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,440
or him?

229
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,440
Once men are trapped by a relationship,

230
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:27,399
they can't achieve great things.

231
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:34,519
If you follow me obediently,

232
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,399
you will be treated well.

233
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,200
There's no signal here either.

234
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:00,759
There isn't any signal

235
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:01,600
in here.

236
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,799
This must be

237
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,159
an abandoned chemical plant.

238
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:16,440
And below here

239
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:18,200
must be

240
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,919
a chemical warehouse.

241
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:22,000
To prevent the radiofrequency radiation

242
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,519
from the mobile phone

243
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,000
from igniting

244
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:26,279
the volatile chemical substances,

245
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,799
the entire warehouse

246
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,799
must have been

247
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,200
installed with a signal jammer.

248
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,279
Looks like

249
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,039
we can only wait here.

250
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,399
Yan,

251
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,720
have I done something very risky?

252
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,080
I rushed over to find you

253
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,840
recklessly.

254
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,679
That's also considered risky.

255
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,240
You just wanted

256
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:49,360
to do something for me.

257
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,320
You have a rather high EQ.

258
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,480
Well, you won't change
even if I scold you.

259
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:01,840
You're right.

260
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,640
Actually, this is considered good too.

261
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,880
There's no signal here.

262
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,759
We can't use our phones.

263
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,519
There's nothing much to bother us.

264
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,519
No one will bother us too.

265
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,079
(Sorry.)

266
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:49,400
(The number you've dialed)

267
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,799
(cannot be reached at the moment.)

268
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:52,160
(Please try again later.)

269
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,000
(Sorry.)

270
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:00,480
Previously, why didn't you

271
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,680
pass the medicine to me directly?

272
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:03,799
Didn't you have

273
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:05,000
Mr. Xie's medicine with you?

274
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
You don't need mine.

275
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:09,920
What are you saying?

276
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,599
I need it.

277
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,400
Ming Hao has always taken care

278
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,319
of my older sister and me.

279
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,839
He's like my family.

280
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:24,160
But you are different.

281
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,160
How so?

282
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,359
You know it well.

283
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,599
I've seen a movie.

284
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,079
In the vast starry sky,

285
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,799
there's a mysterious hole

286
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,480
where people can travel
through time and space.

287
00:18:59,200 --> 00:18:59,920
It's the wormhole.

288
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:02,720
In the movie, it's known by

289
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,839
a very beautiful name,

290
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:05,279
the Rainbow Bridge.

291
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,079
Yan.

292
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,759
I really want to return

293
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,240
to the day we met.

294
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,300
I thought that would be

295
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:20,480
the beginning of my happiness.

296
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,880
I never thought everything
would change after that.

297
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:28,039
At least, there's one thing

298
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,240
that has never changed.

299
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,920
What is it?

300
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,039
I've never forgotten about you.

301
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,420
I've never forgotten about you

302
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,480
for even just one second.

303
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,200
Although I didn't know who you were

304
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,680
and where you went,

305
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,839
I kept looking forward

306
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,920
to your return.

307
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:09,519
If the Rainbow Bridge does exist,

308
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,200
I hope we can return

309
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:13,559
to an earlier time in the past.

310
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,720
This way,

311
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:17,440
I may encounter you earlier.

312
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:22,720
Xie Yi,

313
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,559
am I greedy?

314
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,599
Xie Yi.

315
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,000
What's wrong?

316
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,680
Are you sleepy?

317
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,519
No.

318
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:40,799
Just a little dizzy.

319
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:42,960
Dizzy?

320
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,170
(Toxic)

321
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:54,880
Not good.

322
00:20:58,359 --> 00:20:59,400
There must be some traces

323
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:01,000
of chemicals left in these containers.

324
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:02,599
Let's get out of here first.

325
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,119
Come on. Get up.

326
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,200
Get to the back.

327
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:12,680
Be careful.

328
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,240
Come on. Sit down.

329
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,000
How do you feel?

330
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,079
I'm fine.

331
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:53,400
Here.

332
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:54,759
Hold this.

333
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,000
Wait for me.

334
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,920
The poisonous gas is getting stronger.

335
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:09,759
We must get out of here now.

336
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,519
Xie Yi,

337
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:15,359
did you see

338
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,640
the black pipe?

339
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,279
There must be a transom

340
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:19,839
overhead.

341
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:20,799
Now,

342
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,960
I'll climb up the pipe

343
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:24,759
and break the window

344
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,480
so we can get out of here.

345
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:28,920
Then, I'll pull you up.

346
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:33,559
You must be careful.

347
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,000
Don't worry.

348
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:39,519
I'm a rock climber.

349
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:55,319
Climb slowly.

350
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:21,960

is here.

417
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,830
(Jiangcheng City First People's Hospital)
It is confirmed that bongkrekic acid

418
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:04,759
has caused a toxic reaction.

419
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,960
This toxin

420
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,200
is most commonly found in starchy foods

421
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,720
and fungi that have gone bad.

422
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:10,599
Have you inspected the kitchen?

423
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,839
I've inspected everything.

424
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,359
No such toxin has been found.

425

But what is strange is

426
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:15,799
the toxin is found

427
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,119
in the last glass of wine

428
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:18,599

00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:30,519
want to check out.

436
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,519
Well,

437
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,720

immediately

439
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:37,240

to inspect it personally.

He's recovering well.

525
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,279
But why hasn't he woken up yet?

526
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:47,599
Don't worry.

527
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:48,440
The patient needs

528
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,440
sufficient sleep to regain his strength.

529
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,400
Once he has enough sleep,

530
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:52,559
he'll wake up naturally.

531
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:53,680
You're tired too.

532
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,119
Get some rest.

533
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:56,759
I'm fine.

534
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:58,000
I'll wait for him to wake up.

535
00:32:58,759 --> 00:32:59,240
Okay.

536
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:23,720
Why is there not a single piece of news

537
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,559
on the internet?

538
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,359
I feel uncomfortable.

539
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,400
How's your recovery?

540
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:46,519
I feel dizzy and have a migraine.

541
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,960
I feel drained of energy.

542
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,000
I can't even get out of bed.

543
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,440
Then, who ate those fruits

544
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,640
out there?

545
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,880
The nurse.

546
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,880
Stop pretending.

547
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:00,599
The doctor said you are fine.

548
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,720
Well, you all are quite adept

549
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,400
in public relations.

550
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:09,800
I thought I could create

551
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,000
my first trending topic.

552
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:13,280
If you drank the entire glass of wine,

553
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,559
then it might happen to you.

554
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,960
What do you mean?

555
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:18,280
It has been found

556
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,880
that the toxic reaction

557
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:21,960
was induced

558
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:22,760
by bongkrekic acid.

559
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,039
It was found in the wine you drank.

560
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,960
What's going on?

561
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,480
The specifics are still
under investigation.

562
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,679
This toxin is usually found in foods

563
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,519
that have expired and gone bad.

564
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,519
But it was strange

565
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,039
that it was found

566
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,239
in your wine.

567
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:43,119
It must be the lemon.

568
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:44,800
What lemon?

569
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:45,599
I don't have

570
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,800
any solid evidence now.

571
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,840
It's just my deduction.

572
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,800
But there's one thing

573
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,119
I can be sure of.

574
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,079
Drinking milk tea
really can save your life.

575
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,599
I'll get to the point.

576
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:01,199
This time,

577
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,199
I represent the company

578
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,119
to pay you a visit.

579
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,599
I hope you will cooperate with us

580
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:06,880
to issue a clarification statement.

581
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,119
Sure.

582
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,639
By the way,

583
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:11,800
how are things going for Liang?

584
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,800
I can't reach him by phone.

585
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,440
It's only a minor setback.

586
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:18,679
I believe he can

587
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,639
handle it well.

588
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,159
I brought you some soup

589
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,360
to replenish your body.

590
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:27,480
Thank you.

591
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,880
But I still feel

592
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:32,079
dizzy and have a migraine.

593
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,719
I feel drained of energy.

594
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,119
Phone, spoon,

595
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,960
chopsticks, and bowl.

596
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,840
They are too heavy for me now.

597
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:45,960
I can't hold them.

598
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,000
It's too hard on me.

599
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:50,280
I'll feed you,

600
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:51,199
all right?

601
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,440
Okay.

602
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,280
It's hot.

603
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,440
Be careful.

604
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,960
How come I can suddenly

605
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,280
lift my hands?

606
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:17,360
This must be a miraculous soup.

607
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,239
A miraculous soup.

608
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,639
Well,

609
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:30,119
for a person who drinks milk tea,

610
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:32,199
why did you think of going
for the alcohol?

611
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,519
For many things,

612
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:35,519
we'll only know

613
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,039
whether we like them or not

614
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:38,039
after trying them.

615
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:52,400
Has your phone been fixed?

616
00:36:57,719 --> 00:36:58,800
That's not right.

617
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,599
Who are you here to visit?

618
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,639
Initially, I felt touched

619
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,400
when you came and visited me.

620
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,239
But it turns out

621
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:10,159
that you're still thinking
about the test result

622
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,840
on my phone.

623
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:12,960
I did not.

624
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:14,199
I just feel

625
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,599
that I'm responsible

626
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,599
for your broken phone.

627
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,679
All right.

628
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,800
Stop acting.

629
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,920
The screen was fixed a while ago.

630
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:23,000
I'll show it to you now.

631
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:25,199
But I have to warn you

632
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,440
that there's one good news

633
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,880
and one bad news.

634
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,600
(Love Test)
(Li Ze Liang & Shi Chu Chu)

635
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:43,599
Isn't it good news?

636
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:46,039
It can be considered so.

637
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,119
After all, since childhood,

638
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,760
I achieved high scores
in everything I did.

639
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,480
You're right.

640
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,400
You and Liang

641
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:52,599
were top students.

642
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,119
And it made me look slow-witted

643
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:54,920
in comparison.

644
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:57,480
What about the bad news?

645
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,280
The bad news is

646
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,800
when I entered the data that day,

647
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,159
out of instinct

648
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,559
and conditioned reflex,

649
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,199
I entered

650
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,039
my birth details instead.

651
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,280
What?

652
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,119
What are you doing?

653
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:14,119
It's not accurate.

654
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,599
I didn't say it's accurate.

655
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:16,119
Childish.

656
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,000
I'm leaving.

657
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,440
The doctor said

658
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:20,360
you could be discharged tomorrow.

659
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,559
It's quite accurate.

660
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,079

Are you hungry?

00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:56,960
I'll help you get up
so you can eat something.

682
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:24,480
The doctor said you must eat

683
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,644
(milk)
more high-protein food

684
00:41:25,645 --> 00:41:26,440
to replenish your energy.

685
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:27,400
(Blueberry and Nuts Crispy Cereal)
I've bought you

686
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:28,440
some milk and oatmeal.

687
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,599
Have some later.

688
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:50,320
Are you all right?

689
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,920
I'm fine.

690
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,400
What happened to your hand?

691
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,599
I accidentally scratched it

692
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,679
when I climbed up.

693
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,599
Does it hurt?

694
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,000
I'm fine.

695
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,360
It will recover in a few days.

696
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:24,800
What's most important now

697
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,079
is your health.

698
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,480
Come on.

699
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,480
Xie Yi,

700
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,039
where's your bracelet?

701
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:42,400
Didn't I drop my phone?

702
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:44,679
I traded my bracelet

703
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,079
to the hospital's convenience store.

704
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,519
Otherwise, you won't have these foods.

705
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:49,480
The bracelet was a gift from your dad.

706
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,320
It means a lot to you.

707
00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:54,280
There's something
that means more to me now.

708
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,199
Finishing all these foods

709
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,119
is the greatest respect

710
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,360
for my bracelet.

711
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:08,760
Come on.

712
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:21,719
The doctor said

713
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:23,760
your leg doesn't look like
being caused by a fall.

714
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,159
You fell from such a high place,

715
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:28,159
but your bone was fine.

716
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,639
That's really rare.

717
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:35,639
It's a small hospital.

718
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,599
The doctors have seen fewer cases.

719
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:38,880
That's not surprising.

720
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:47,920
By the way,

721
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,199
the doctor also said

722
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,760
that there's some inflammation
on your leg.

723
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:53,239
He needs to contact
your attending doctor

724
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,079
so he can find a way to treat it.

725
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,440
I know

726
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:00,239
my own body well.

727
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,639
I'm fine.

728
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:03,000
Don't worry.

729
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:04,119
Just leave it

730
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:05,639
to Ying Song to handle it.

731
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:06,719
But...

732
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:07,719
Su Xie Yi,

733
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:10,119
are you here to ask me questions

734
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,320
or to feed me?

735
00:44:17,639 --> 00:44:18,400
