How well do you know Ze Liang?

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,520
Ms. Shi,

21
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,599
if I don't,

22
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:12,639
I don't think

23
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,639
we will be together.

24
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:15,719
Since Ze Liang

25
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,560
chose to make your relationship public,

26
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,919
I'll wish you well.

27
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:21,039
But I heard

28
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:21,719
about you two.

29
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,599
You met two years ago.

30
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,479
You lost touch with each other

31
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:26,960
in between.

32
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:28,360
Yes,

33
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,199
but fate

34
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,199
still let us be together.

35
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,919
So my question is,

36
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,560
do you know

37
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,919
the "Li Ze Liang" now?

38
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,879
You seem to be concerned about Ze Liang.

39
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,120
Of course.

40
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,719
After all,

41
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,120
we're old friends.

42
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:51,159
Was he

43
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,840
the real reason

44
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,479
you fired me?

45
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,159
I'll be frank.

46
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,639
We're women.

47
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,240
I could feel you're too purposeful

48
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,639
from the moment you joined the company

49
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,479
to approaching Ze Liang.

50
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,199
I dislike opportunistic people
with self-interest.

51
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,759
I don't know

52
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:10,319
why you split two years ago.

53
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,039
I only hope,

54
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,439
since you're with him,

55
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,039
you must love all of him.

56
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,159
Don't hurt him

57
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:18,080
the second time.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,479
Sure.

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,080
Thank you for the advice.

60
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,439
I can do it.

61
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:34,360
Good.

62
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:36,599
Ms. Shi,

63
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,919
do I apply for leave from you
in the future

64
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,759
or...?

65
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,319
What's wrong?

66
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,840
Toothache.

67
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,560
It happens from time to time.

68
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:47,919
I want to collect my prescription.

69
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,280
You're working for Mr. Li now.

70
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,560
You can just talk to him directly.

71
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:53,759
Thank you, Ms. Shi.

72
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,039
Mr. Chen!

73
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,199
Mr. Qin,

74
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,080
it's hard

75
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,120
to meet you.

76
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,479
Come on.

77
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,079
Let's have a seat.

78
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,920
Have some tea.

79
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,839
Good things take time.

80
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,959
Selling works of art

81
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,199
isn't like other ordinary businesses.

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,639
We mustn't rush it.

83
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:29,519
Mr. Qin,

84
00:04:30,608 --> 00:04:32,048
I know your concerns.

85
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,199
Mr. Chen,

86
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,199
who used to work with us,

87
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,000
has migrated.

88
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,759
That's why

89
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,600
he recommended me to you.

90
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:39,560
We have worked with Mr. Chen

91
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,920
for quite a long time.

92
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,800
He's also an old friend of yours.

93
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,759
What else do you have to worry about?

94
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,480
In fact,

95
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,199
we're not in a rush either.

96
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,040
But

97
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,560
the hotel has started operating.

98
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,800
We have also received

99
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,279
the budget from the group.

100
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,519
I just think

101
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,600
if we can cut this deal

102
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,279
earlier,

103
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,199
you can feel relieved earlier

104
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,680
when the deal is set in place.

105
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,560
All right.

106
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,959
Same rules, then.

107
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,199
Twenty percent of the deal

108
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,199
will go into your designated account.

109
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:17,600
Mr. Qin,

110
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,240
you're indeed a man of your word.

111
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,480
But...

112
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,240
let me be straight with you.

113
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,959
I may seek profits.

114
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:27,800
But you and I know

115
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,600
the quality of these paintings.

116
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,639
The quotation for the works

117
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,240
is outrageous.

118
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,720
Aren't you afraid of the risk?

119
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,040
These are works of art.

120
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,839
You get it.

121
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,279
There's a way of going around
the quotation.

122
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,240
It's not the first time

123
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,319
we're doing this anyway.

124
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,279
So please

125
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,000
rest assured.

126
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,639
So...

127
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,959
is the rebate negotiable?

128
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,600
To be honest,

129
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:59,399
I'm only acting under orders.

130
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:02,800
I hope you won't make it
difficult for me.

131
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,680
You're an important client.

132
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,000
But I request

133
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,480
a lump sum payment.

134
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,680
No problem.

135
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,399
But...

136
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,399
for my cut...

137
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,439
Have some tea.

138
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,040
I have another request.

139
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,199
Please tell.

140
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:40,000
I want to meet your superior

141
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,680
because I need to know

142
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,040
your financial capacity

143
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,240
is guaranteed.

144
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,959
We may have been

145
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,160
keeping in touch for two months

146
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,360
and have built up

147
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,639
some trust.

148
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:50,600
But after all,

149
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,240
it's our first time working together.

150
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,920
If we don't meet even once,

151
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:58,279
how are we going to talk
about long-term cooperation?

152
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,439
All right.

153
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,319
I'll relay your request

154
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
to my boss.

155
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,439
Great!

156
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,439
I look forward to working with you.

157
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,399
Same here.

00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:45,959
Hello, miss.

161
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,720
Please show me your membership card

162
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,399
or tell me your mobile number.

163
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,759
I'll register for you.

164
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's my first time here.

165
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:55,600
Let me show you around, then.

166
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:57,199
This way, please.

167
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:57,800
Okay.

168
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:59,800
Over here,

169
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,360
we have Gade's paintings.

170
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,560
His forte is landscape painting

171
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,319
and he is the most

172
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,000
outstanding young painter
in recent years.

173
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,040
By the way,

174
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,279
is your boss' surname Qin?

175
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,399
Do you know our boss?

176
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,800
Is he here now?

177
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,120
I'm sorry.

178
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,160
Our boss

179
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,560
doesn't receive random guests.

180
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,079
Unless...

181
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,319
Unless what?

182
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:26,959
Unless you

183
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,240
become our Gold Member.

184
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,800
Only then will our boss provide you

185
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,759
with exclusive services.

186
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,120
What are the terms

187
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,600
to be a member?

188
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,279
A single purchase of one million yuan.

189
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:45,799
This one.

190
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,240
This, this, this,

191
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,440
and that one.

192
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,200
I want all of these.

193
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:51,360
Are these enough?

194
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,639
Yes, it's enough.

195
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:55,559
What's your payment method?

196
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,720
Pack these up for me first.

197
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:59,559
I'll get Li Ze Liang

198
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,159
of Ocean Hotel Corporation

199
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,200
to pay for these.

200
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm sorry.

201
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,799
It's against our policy.

202
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,000
Excuse me.

203
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:06,960
Boss.

204
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:07,480
Hello there.

205
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,919
I'm the owner of this gallery.

206
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,320
Mr. Qin?

207
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,000
Yes, I am.

208
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,720
I heard what you said

209
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:16,639
just now.

210
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,360
May I know

211
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:21,559
who you are to Mr. Li
of Ocean Hotel Corporation?

212
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,639
Ze Liang is my boyfriend.

213
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,519
My name is Su Xie Yi.

214
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,639
Miss Su.

215
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:31,039
How about we go to my office?

216
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,759
We'll chat while having tea.

217
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,720
Sure.

218
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,799
All right. This way, please.

219
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,759
Qin only wants to increase the price

220
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,919
after beating around the bush.

221
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,399
But I rejected him.

222
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,720
If he's only greedy for money,

223
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,320
there's nothing to worry about.

224
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,519
You're right.

225
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,670
(Chen Heng Sheng)
The cut from the rebate

226
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:49,639
remains the same as discussed.

227
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,559
There are no changes.

228
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,399
Get it done quickly, then.

229
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,559
No problem.

230
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,200
Also,

231
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:56,879
he has another request.

232
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,440
He wants to meet you in person.

233
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,039
He seems

234
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,320
to doubt our ability

235
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,200
to pay.

236
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,600
But I think

237
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,840
his request is common

238
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,399
since it's a huge amount.

239
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,960
He's pretty cautious.

240
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:10,519
I'll let you know.

241
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:11,840
Got it.

242
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,279
Why?

243
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,519
Is he scared it's a trap

244
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,399
after giving him so much benefit?

245
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:17,679
It's not wrong for him to be cautious.

246
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,600
After all, this deal

247
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:20,879
concerns a huge amount of money.

248
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,520
(Lin Tai)

249
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:27,480
Mr. Huo.

250
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,480
What's wrong?

251
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,519
Su Xie Yi is odd.

252
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,399
She dressed up differently

253
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:33,720
and went to an art gallery.

254
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,399
Which art gallery?

255
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,919
Pinxuan Art Gallery.

256
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:42,200
Okay.

257
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:43,399
Keep an eye on her.

258
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,399
Okay.

259
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,919
Su Xie Yi also went

260
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:46,679
to that art gallery?

261
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,440
It can't be a coincidence.

262
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:53,759
Hello?

263
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,039
I want you

264
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,039
to contact Mr. Qin now

265
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,639
and tell him I'm going to see him now.

266
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,399
Have a seat, Miss Su.

267
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,320
Have some tea.

268
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,840
Mr. Qin,

269
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,559
this art gallery has been around
for years, right?

270
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,039
More than ten years.

271
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,399
Miss Su,

272
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,639
is there a reason

273
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,759
you want to see me today?

274
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:20,399
Of course,

275
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,360
it's to make a deal with you.

276
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,480
A deal?

277
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,399
Okay.

278
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:25,600
Please tell me.

279
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,120
This deal is related

280
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,879
to the previous client who was here.

281
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,279
I'm sure you know the reason

282
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,440
I'm here.

283
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:39,279
Do you mean Chen Heng Sheng?

284
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,720
That's right.

285
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,000
You should know

286
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,879
he's not the person in charge.

287
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,159
He was only

288
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:48,200
running errands.

289
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:49,480
Are you saying

290
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,120
Chen Heng Sheng

291
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,639
is working for you?

292
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,320
It looks like

293
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,639
he did a good job at being discreet.

294
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:04,919
This is the reason

295
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,120
I've been keeping him.

296
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,759
I would never have thought

297
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,799
that the person

298
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,279
who planned such a huge deal

299
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:16,440
is such...

300
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:19,679
a young woman who's also the girlfriend

301
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,120
of Li Ze Liang

302
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:23,759
from Ocean Hotel Corporation.

303
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,360
Let's cut to the chase.

304
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,360
What were the conditions he laid?

305
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:36,279
Miss Su,

306
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,960
before I answer your question,

307
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,159
shouldn't you

308
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,919
answer my questions first?

309
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:43,600
Why?

310
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,639
You don't believe me?

311
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,759
Of course I do.

312
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:49,759
I'm only curious.

313
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,759
It's a huge deal.

314
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,519
Does your boyfriend, Li Ze Liang,

315
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:54,320
know about this?

316
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:55,639
Why didn't he

317
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:56,840
come with you?

318
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,960
Are you worried

319
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,320
about my financial capacity?

320
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,559
It seems that you don't know much

321
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:07,720
about my relationship with Ze Liang.

322
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,720
You only need to simply ask

323
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,360
to know how conspicuous

324
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,519
is his love affection for me.

325
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,519
I've heard

326
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:16,799
of his show of affection

327
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,240
at the cocktail party.

328
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,399
Let me put it this way.

329
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,600
If I wanted to pick a star,

330
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,519
he would never pick the moon.

331
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,200
I'll be honest.

332
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:28,240
He has proposed to me.

333
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:29,840
So

334
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,879
I'm not only his girlfriend.

335
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,480
To be exact,

336
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,399
I'm his fiancée.

337
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:37,000
So

338
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,159
do you still

339
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:40,080
doubt my financial capacity?

340
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,639
You're a smart person.

341
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,159
There's no need to go against money.

342
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,960
You never showed up before.

343
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,320
Why do you want to see me
out of a sudden?

344
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:56,559
Honestly,

345
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,879
Chen Heng Sheng has been
dealing with you.

346
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,799
I don't know

347
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,279
if anything fishy in this deal.

348
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:04,639
So

349
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,960
it has always been my concern

350
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,000
about the terms he laid out to you.

351
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,840
Are you scared that he's benefiting
from both sides?

352
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,799
Of course, I trust him.

353
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:15,840
But...

354
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,000
what if?

355
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:24,799
So

356
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,879
can you now tell me

357
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:28,679
the terms

358
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,840
Chen Heng Sheng promised you?

359
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:32,360
Of course.

360
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,720
Speaking of the devil.

361
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,320
Hello, Mr. Chen.

362
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,240
Mr. Qin, it's me.

363
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:44,679
I've told my boss

364
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,840
of your request.

365
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,080
That's great.

366
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,759
My boss is thrilled.

367
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,240
He should be there now.

368
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,600
All right.

369
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:00,799
Miss Su,

370
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,919
you know how it works in business.

371
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,279
In our first meeting,

372
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,679
we only have tea.

373
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,440
As for cooperation,

374
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,919
we'll discuss it next time.

375
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:11,720
Okay.

376
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:14,200
But I hope

377
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:16,240
you can keep my identity a secret.

378
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,840
And please don't tell anyone

379
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,679
that I was here.

380
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,519
Of course.

381
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,519
That includes Chen Heng Sheng.

382
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,120
I'll excuse myself, then.

383
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:28,080
Okay.

384
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,159
I won't be seeing you off.

385
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:56,360
I didn't know you were in the mood

386
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,320
to enjoy paintings here.

387
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,480
You're here too, Mr. Huo.

388
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,120
I was passing by,

389
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,240
so I dropped by.

390
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,840
Is that so?

391
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:11,039
As far as I am concerned,

392
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,039
this is a member-only art gallery.

393
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,440
You drop by just because you passed by.

394
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,279
Even the owner received you in person.

395
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:19,759
That doesn't make sense at all.

396
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:21,360
Besides, I'm curious

397
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,159
what were you and the owner

398
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,279
talking about in the office.

399
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,000
Uncle?

400
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,480
You're here too?

401
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,320
Ze Liang, you're here too.

402
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,639
Yes.

403
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,039
Didn't you say to come together?

404
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,559
Why did you come here by yourself?

405
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:52,840
I did say that.

406
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,519
I was afraid you would be busy,

407
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:55,960
so I came here first.

408
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,240
Naughty.

409
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,320
I'm not.

410
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,200
Well, here is the thing.

411
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,279
Xie Yi saw a painting

412
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,440
in this gallery

413
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,160
that she really likes on the internet.

414
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,440
She keeps on telling me
to buy it for her.

415
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,079
I didn't expect you

416
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,160
to remember

417
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,400
what I said casually.

418
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,200
So are you going

419
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,000
to buy it for me?

420
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,240
As long as you like it.

421
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:30,799
Mr. Li is such a great guy.

422
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,960
Miss Su said

423
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:33,160
you'll buy anything

424
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,559
she likes.

425
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,960
So it's true.

426
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,000
Miss Su,

427
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:40,119
you're lucky to have such

428
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:41,359
a doting boyfriend.

429
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:42,799
Of course.

430
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:43,799
You see,

431
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,000
Miss Su

432
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:46,680
chose seven paintings.

433
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,559
All of them are fine works of art.

434
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,359
It costs a total of 10,150,000 yuan.

435
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,480
Didn't you say only one painting?

436
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:04,359
Mr. Li,

437
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,559
so...?

438
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:09,279
Ze Liang,

439
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,839
it's my first time here.

440
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:12,680
So

441
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,119
I chose a few.

442
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:15,680
You don't have to buy them.

443
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:18,359
Moreover, your uncle is also here today.

444
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,200
Let's not make your uncle think

445
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:20,920
that you have a girlfriend

446
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,160
who only knows how to spend money.

447
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:24,759
How about this?

448
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,599
Later,

449
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,319
I'll pick the best painting.

450
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,400
All right.

451
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,400
It's okay, Xie Yi.

452
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,359
I'll buy whatever you want.

453
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,720
Let's go to the mall later.

454
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,359
Let's check out real estate.

455
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,559
Aren't you Mr. Huo and Mr. Li?

456
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,200
I've heard so much about you.

457
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,240
Let me introduce myself.

458
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,319
I'm the owner of this art gallery,

459
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,799
Qin.

460
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:51,279
Hello, Mr. Qin.

461
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,200
Hello.

462
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:52,960
Mr. Qin,

463
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,319
I need to speak

464
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:55,680
to Mr. Li in private.

465
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,519
Do you have any...

466
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:58,519
Yes, we do.

467
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:00,559
Let's head to my office
on the second floor.

468
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,400
It's quieter there.

469
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,160
Okay.

470
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:03,640
Yi Fei,

471
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,240
keep Miss Su company
and pick a good painting.

472
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,440
Okay.

473
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:10,920
Let's go, Ze Liang.

474
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,319
Go ahead.

475
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,039
I'll go to you once I'm done picking.

476
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:20,599
All right. Pick any paintings
that you like.

477
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,759
Yi Fei,

478
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:22,799
take good care of her.

479
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:26,559
Let's go, Uncle.

480
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,200
This way, please.

481
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:36,200
Are you here to buy a painting
for Miss Su?

482
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:37,640
Yes, Uncle.

483
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,559
In that case,

484
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,039
you already know

485
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,240
which painting she likes

486
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,279
before she comes here, right?

487
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,319
Is there any problem with that?

488
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,359
Let's play a game.

489
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:51,480
Let's guess

490
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,200
which painting she'll buy in the end.

491
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:56,480
If you guess it right,

492
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,119
this painting will be a gift

493
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:00,000
from me to both of you.

494
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:05,720
If you want to give a gift,

495
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,279
no need to go through the trouble.

496
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,519
It doesn't matter what you give,

497
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:10,759
Xie Yi and I

498
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,680
will like it.

499
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,799
No. No. No.

500
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,400
The gift itself

501
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,480
doesn't matter.

502
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:18,839
What matters

503
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:20,559
is the interesting process.

504
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,240
I'll be honest with you.

505
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:27,640
Before we came here,

506
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:29,920
Xie Yi already told me

507
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:31,880
that you'd ask me to guess

508
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,480
which painting she'd buy.

509
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,079
The guessing game

510
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:37,440
is no longer interesting anymore.

511
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,000
Why are you hesitating, then?

512
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,119
All right, then.

513
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,880
It's the fifth painting from the left.

514
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:24,680
All right.

515
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:26,559
We shall see.

516
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:44,799
This one...

517
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:45,279
All right.

518
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:52,359
I'll wrap it up for you.

519
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,519
I don't really like it.

520
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:35,759
(Su Xie Yi,)

521
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,839
(have you forgotten about the tree?)

522
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,160
I'll take this one.

523
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:04,039
All right.

524
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,240
Thank you for your gift.

525
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,279
I care about you.

526
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,160
So it's only natural.

527
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:30,960
I won't disturb you enjoying
the paintings, then.

528
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,160
I'll get going now.

529
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:51,759
It's such a pity.

530
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:52,920
I was so close.

531
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:53,799
I almost

532
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,000
got Mr. Qin

533
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
to reveal it.

534
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:57,599
It must be the call he answered

535
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:58,559
that ruined my plan.

536
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,000
Enough!

537
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:02,200
What did you

538
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:03,160
promise me last night?

539
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,279
What's wrong?

540
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,279
I told you

541
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,759
I'd continue investigating it.

542
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,839
You can investigate.

543
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,119
But you would

544
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,279
have been exposed

545
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,519
if I didn't show up today,

546
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,160
do you know that?

547
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:14,000
I didn't know

548
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,480
I'd run into Huo Jian here today.

549
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:16,319
Or was he

550
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,599
the person who talked to Chen Heng Sheng

551
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,519
yesterday?

552
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,039
So do you know

553
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,680
that it's not a coincidence

554
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,480
he showed up there now?

555
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,319
He most probably

556
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:28,519
went to the art gallery

557
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,359
to confirm

558
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,160
whether you were the one

559
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:30,960
who heard their conversation last night.

560
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:33,000
So do you think our act

561
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,480
can deceive him?

562
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,519
I don't know.

563
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:37,440
Let's get in the car first.

564
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,480
Chen Heng Sheng said

565
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:57,759
you wanted to see me.

566
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:01,079
It shows you have doubts

567
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:02,480
about our cooperation.

568
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:06,000
Mr. Huo,

569
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:07,599
what other doubts would I have

570
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,599
now that you're already here in person?

571
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:12,559
Good.

572
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,960
Since you have no doubts,

573
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:16,759
I have a question,

574
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:17,799
which I hope

575
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:19,279
you can answer truthfully.

576
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:20,000
Sure,

577
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,319
I'll tell you what I know.

578
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:23,279
Mr. Qin,

579
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:26,119
do you know Miss Su?

580
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,550
(Incoming call)

581
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:42,880
If it's inconvenient for you
to answer because of me,

582
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,160
you can stop by the roadside.

583
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:45,720
I'll answer it.

584
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,079
Is it convenient to talk?

585
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:56,839
Yes.

586
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,680
Is Su Xie Yi really your girlfriend?

587
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:05,680
Yes.

588
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:06,920
Why is she interfering

589
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:08,119
in Chen Heng Sheng's affair?

590
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,160
It's a long story.

591
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,400
I'll tell you about it next time.

592
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,680
Huo Jian asked me...

593
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
(Do you know Miss Su?)

594
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:23,240
No, I don't.

595
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:24,960
It's my first time meeting her.

596
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:26,400
Isn't it against your policy

597
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,119
for you to receive her in person

598
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:30,279
when it's her first time here?

599
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,359
She said

600
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,920
she's Li Ze Liang's girlfriend.

601
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,680
That's why I invited her to the office.

602
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,079
Chen Heng Sheng

603
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:37,759
has been keeping your identity a secret.

604
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,559
I thought

605
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,119
the person behind Chen Heng Sheng

606
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,559
was her.

607
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:44,920
Don't you think

608
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,200
you're being too careless?

609
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:47,160
Then,

610
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,960
did you tell her

611
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:48,920
about our deals?

612
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:55,440
Here.

613
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,559
Of course not.

614
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:00,720
Before anything else,

615
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:02,920
I asked her purpose here.

616
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:05,920
Then why did she

617
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:07,519
want to see you?

618
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:09,960
To buy paintings.

619
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,359
She said she saw a painting

620
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,039
from my gallery on the internet.

621
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:14,279
She likes it very much

622
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,359
and wanted to buy it.

623
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,279
Mr. Qin,

624
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,079
our deal

625
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,880
costs billions.

626
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,200
I hope you're not lying to me.

627
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,200
Mr. Huo,

628
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:29,720
you know

629
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:31,440
we're dealing with a huge business.

630
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,640
So there's no reason
for me to lie to you.

631
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:36,200
I can't give up something big

632
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:37,920
over something small.

633
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:38,920
Am I right?

634
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,079
Mr. Qin, you're something.

635
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,119
So

636
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,839
about our contract...

637
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:54,119
Wait for my news.

638
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,279
All right, I got it.

639
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,759
In order to find out

640
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:09,599
Huo Jian has been secretly
using art purchases

641
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,640
to seize Ocean's assets,

642
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:13,200
we've set this up

643
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:13,920
for half a year already.

644
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,240
It wasn't easy

645
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,359
to gain Chen Heng Sheng's trust

646
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:18,039
and meet Huo Jian.

647
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:18,960
It's the most

648
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,000
critical time now.

649
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,000
There's must be no mistake.

650
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:22,960
I know.

651
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,599
In fact, for Xie Yi coming to you today

652
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,440
has both disadvantages and advantages.

653
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,319
How so?

654
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:29,519
Huo Jian has been

655
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:30,799
suspecting Su Xie Yi.

656
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:32,119
He was worried

657
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:33,799
that Xie Yi would investigate the matter
at the gallery

658
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:34,720
because she overheard
their conversation.

659
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:37,640
He must have imagined a lot of things

660
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,480
when he ran into Xie Yi
at the gallery today.

661
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,200
But he would never imagine

662
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:43,480
that you're on my side.

663
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,000
So

664
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,000
he'll contact you again.

665
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:48,279
Okay.

666
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,680
Remember to tell me

667
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,079
in advance the next time.

668
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,440
Okay.

669
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,440
Bye-bye.

670
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,000
No wonder

671
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,799
when I told you about this,

672
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,400
you told me not to get involved.

673
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,440
Why are you doing this?

674
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:05,680
What do you think?

675
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:08,920
Find evidence against Huo Jian

676
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:10,839
to bring him down

677
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,119
and take charge of Ocean again.

678
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:24,559
What are the odds of this happening?

679
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:29,880
There's one thing
that's more suspicious.

680
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,200
What do you mean?

681
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,079
When I was

682
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:36,720
accompanying her
picking the paintings...

683
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:38,839
This one, then.

684
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,000
Do you like this painting?

685
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,319
Not bad. It looks pretty.

686
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:53,039
If I didn't see it wrongly,

687
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:55,160
it should be a voice recorder.

688
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,960
Also, she should be the one

689
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,599
who eavesdropped
during Hengye's cocktail party.

690
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,880
I fear she may have recorded
the conversation that day.

691
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:03,720
I don't care if she did.

692
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:06,880
We must destroy it after we make sure.

693
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:07,759
Okay.

694
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,120
(Carpentry)

695
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,599
Thank you for sending me home.

696
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:42,519
I'm sorry about today.

697
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:44,519
I hope it won't

698
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:45,359
happen again.

699
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:46,799
Don't worry.

700
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:47,640
It won't.

701
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:42,359
Mr. Huo,

702
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:44,319
I didn't find any voice recorder.

703
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:45,400
But there are

704
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,559
some audio files on the laptop.

705
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,759
Stop right there.

706
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,680
Give me the voice recorder.

707
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,420
(Xie Yi)

708
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:46,039
Who are you calling?

709
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,400
Are you trying to call the police?

710
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:48,200
Let me go!

711
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:51,640
Give it to me!

712
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:53,079
Hand it over!

713
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:55,000
Give it to me!

714
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:58,680
Xie Yi!

715
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,160
Xie Yi,

716
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:01,319
are you okay?

717
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,400
Xie Yi!

718
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,759
Xie Yi!

719
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,000
Xie Yi!

720
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,800
Trying to be a hero?

721
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:10,159
After you're outside of Ocean,

722
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,000
you're just a piece of trash!

723
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:15,360
Trash!

724
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,079
You wanted to push me

725
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:18,599
to my death, right?

726
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,559
Come on.

727
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:20,719
Come on, then!

728
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,199
Xie Yi.

729
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:58,960
Xie Yi.

730
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:11,900
(In-patient Department)

731
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:27,400
You're up.

732
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,480
I'll leave the medicine here.

733
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,559
Remember to take it, okay?

734
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:31,639
Where's the person who sent me here?

735
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:33,920
Your friend is in Room 603.

736
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:36,199
What happened to him?

737
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,719
He's injured and taking his rest now.

738
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,039
Remember to take
your medicine later, okay?

So you're up.

755
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,199
He didn't take it away, did he?

756
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,519
Don't worry.

757
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:41,119
It was taken care of.

758
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:42,280
It was a recording

759
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,559
of you and Mr. Qin.

760
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:44,960
Good, then.

761
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:48,320
But why was Lin Tai looking for that?

762
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:50,719
Could Huo Jian order him to do it?

763
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,840
I suspected that too.

764
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,039
But

765
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,400
don't try to act tough

766
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,159
no matter what you do in the future.

767
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:01,000
Is this an order of a superior

768
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:02,719
or the concern of a boyfriend?

769
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:04,320
Is there any difference?

770
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,880
Of course, there's a difference.

771
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:09,239
My way of repayment will be different.

772
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:12,559
Even if it's a stranger,

773
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,400
I wouldn't just sit back and do nothing.

774
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:15,519
Moreover,

775
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:19,239
you're

776
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:20,760
my girlfriend in name.

777
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,480
Come in.

778
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:30,559
Miss Su, you're here too.

779
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,559
You should get some rest.

780
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,400
I'll stay here

781
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,400
to take care of Mr. Li.

782
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,079
I'll stay here tonight.

783
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:43,039
Why?

784
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:44,840
Are you his girlfriend

785
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,440
or am I?

786
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,400
Don't worry.

787
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,519
I'll take good care of him.

788
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,450
(In-patient Department)

789
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:28,760
Have you found Mr. Lin?

790
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:29,960
Not yet.

791
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:30,599
But I'm on a stakeout

792
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:32,159
at the hospital his father
is hospitalized.

793
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,000
Even if he's going to flee,

794
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:34,280
he should

795
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,440
visit his father, right?

796
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:37,679
Okay.

797
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:38,880
I understand.

798
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:40,880
Thank you for your hard work.

799
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,760
Lin Tai,

800
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:09,079
I've overestimated you.

801
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,000
I told you to take care of something.

802
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:14,920
Forget that you failed at it.

803
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,519
But you almost killed someone.

804
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,840
Yet, you have the nerve to see me.

805
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,199
It was urgent at the time.

806
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,679
I had to do it.

807
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,119
She wanted to call the police.

808
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,920
I've told you

809
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,440
this is your last chance.

810
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:33,880
It's too bad

811
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:35,599
you've ruined it.

812
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,679
I'm sorry.

813
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,000
Mr. Huo,

814
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,880
about the reward you promised me
at that time...

815
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:44,960
My dad is still at the hospital

816
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,400
waiting for me to bring the money
for his treatment.

817
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,480
Reward?

818
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:05,960
How about this?

819
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,519
I'll play a game with you.

820
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,679
I have darts there.

821
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:11,199
The percentage of the rewards

822
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,760
will be based on how many you can hit.

823
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,400
See?

824
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,800
Even God thinks

825
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,320
you're a fool

826
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,480
who doesn't deserve a cent.

827
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:46,559
Mr. Huo,

828
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:48,159
give me one more chance.

829
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,239
I can hit it.

830
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,000
Just wait.

831
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,480
How do you expect me to trust you?

832
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,119
Go home!

833
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,079
Huo Jian,

834
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,039
if you don't pay me,

835
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,280
I'll tell everyone

836
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,320
about all of you!

837
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:02,800
Do you think I don't know

838
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,599
what dirty business

839
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:04,719
you and Chen Heng Sheng are up to?

840
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:07,159
You two work together
to resell works of art

841
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:10,159
in the name of the hotel.

842
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,519
You know how much you make from this.

843
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,360
Yes,

844
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,679
you asked Yi Fei

845
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:19,239
to find that Spider.

846
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,239
It must be related

847
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,360
