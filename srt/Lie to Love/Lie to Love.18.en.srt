19
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,040
Thank you, sir.

20
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,040
Bye-bye.

21
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,080
Little girl,

22
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,479
watch where you're going, okay?

23
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,479
Thank you, sir.

24
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:18,280
Sir,

25
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:19,639
get me a bottle of water.

26
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,560
Here you go.

27
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,759
Sir,

28
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,159
have you seen

29
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,639
these two friends of mine before?

30
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:30,360
No.

31
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,120
Well,

32
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,840
there's a person called Liu Ah Wei.

33
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,400
Do you know where he lives?

34
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,479
I don't.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,680
Thank you.

36
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:39,599
No worries.

37
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,400
Let's split up and search.

38
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,120
Tell me if you find anything.

39
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,120
Yes, Mr. Huo.

40
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:12,280
Xie Yi.

41
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:26,879
Are you tired?

42
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,879
Nope.

43
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,639
To be honest with you,

44
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,919
I haven't felt this relaxed
for a while.

45
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,719
Yeah.

46
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,680
This place is completely different
from Shanghai.

47
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,439
Wish I could stay here
for a few more days.

48
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:41,400
Sure.

49
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,240
Let's stay here for
a few more days then.

50
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,919
I can do it myself.

51
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:55,759
Let me do it.

52
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,399
It broke two years ago.

53
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:36,839
It's a prosthetic limb.

54
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:41,800
It's done.

55
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,600
Xiao Xiao, come and have a seat.

56
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:48,319
Come here.

57
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,879
Sit here.

58
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,240
Xiao Xiao,

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,079
I'm sure you have many questions

60
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,040
for me.

61
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,439
Li,

62
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,959
how did you manage to do that?

63
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,199
If it weren't for that moment just now,

64
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,120
I would never know

65
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,319
that your leg was...

66
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,079
Xiao Xiao,

67
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,199
do you know 

68
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:16,839
that I love

69
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,120
rock climbing the most?

70
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,199
In the past,

71
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,360
I used to go rock climbing in mountains.

72
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,600
And I got to know Xie Yi

73
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,519
because of rock climbing as well.

74
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,920
That's why

75
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:32,959
rock climbing is inseparable

76
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,800
from my life.

77
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,600
Two years ago,

78
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:41,160
I broke my leg.

79
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,879
At that moment,

80
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,959
I thought

81
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,240
I could never stand up again.

82
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:49,360
(Sorry, we have no choice
but to amputate his leg.)

83
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,600
Doctor,

84
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,399
aren't there

85
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,680
any other solutions to this?

86
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,680
His leg was deeply penetrated

87
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,519
by a rusty pipe.

88
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,360
And it was immersed

89
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,680
in the rain for a long time.

90
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,519
His wound has contracted

91
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,120
clostridial myonecrosis

92
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,360
due to C. difficile infection.

93
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,680
Once this virus enters the body,

94
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,560
after a few hours,

95
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,519
it will start attacking

96
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,560
the neuromuscular junction.

97
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,360
If we don't take any measures,

98
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,240
the patient will face
respiratory paralysis

99
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,439
which may lead to his death.

100
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,000
(Back then, I was in deep grief.)

101
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,680
(I was very negative as well.)

102
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,079
(My friends and family)

103
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,120
(were very cautious about it.)

104
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,759
(They even hid away)

105
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,560
(my rock climbing equipment.)

106
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,480
(They were afraid that I might be upset
if I saw them.)

107
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,639
(One morning,)

108
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,120
(I went to the balcony)

109
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,360
(without telling anyone.)

110
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,560
(That was my first time
seeing the sunrise)

111
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,360
(after my leg was broken.)

112
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:41,439
(It felt)

113
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,480
(mystical)

114
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,040
(and magical.)

115
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,399
(I remembered)

116
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,480
that I once made a promise

117
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,160
to a person

118
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,360
that I would watch the sunrise
together with her.

119
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:57,319
If I continue to be negative about it,

120
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,279
I was afraid that I might not have

121
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,000
the chance to see her again.

122
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,680
But aren't you afraid of

123
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,199
other people's opinions?

124
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,040
Their opinions don't matter.

125
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,519
The most important thing here

126
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:17,319
is the opinion

127
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,680
of the woman I love.

128
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,279
As long as she treats me
like a normal person,

129
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,199
I will be a normal person.

130
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,399
I'm so envious of you two.

131
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,519
If only my mother

132
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,319
could be like Xie Yi.

133
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,040
Xiao Xiao,

134
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,279
your mother didn't do anything wrong.

135
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,399
You're her only child.

136
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,439
Of course,
she would be worried about you

137
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,279
and wanted to protect you.

138
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:54,920
But Xiao Xiao,

139
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:57,319
your mother will grow old one day.

140
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,439
She won't be able
to protect you again by then.

141
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,680
That's why,

142
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:03,800
no matter you're doing it
for your mother

143
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,959
or for yourself,

144
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,199
you need to learn how to be strong

145
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,079
and learn how to accept yourself,

146
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:11,720
understood?

147
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,800
What should I do then?

148
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,680
You love singing, right?

149
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,399
You should do just that.

150
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:20,800
That's right.

151
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,600
At night,

152
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,240
when the stars are out,

153
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,879
you can sing over here.

154
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,519
I believe

155
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:28,480
that your father will surely hear you

156
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,519
from above.

157
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,320
I'm afraid that I might mess it up.

158
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,440
Don't worry.

159
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,519
Look.

160
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,240
Even I

161
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,840
can do rock climbing again.

162
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,000
Of course, you won't mess it up.

163
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:44,440
Xie Yi, am I right?

164
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:45,799
That's right.

165
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:48,320
If so,

166
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,039
you guys need to accompany me.

167
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:51,519
Of course.

168
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,279
We will accompany you.

169
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:05,080
This Shi Chu Chu

170
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,120
promised to visit me today.

171
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,600
Why isn't she here yet?

172
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:13,120
She's not professional at all.

173
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,080
It's just role-playing, right?

174
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,120
Just play your role!

175
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,639
But she quit without telling me.

176
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,039
Quit what?

177
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:30,919
Nothing.

178
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,720
Just now, Mr. Ji called me.

179
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,679
He insisted on making some cold dishes

180
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,559
for me.

181
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:38,000
I told him not to do so.

182
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,080
I told him that.

183
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,799
Since when did you become so courteous?

184
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,799
Now, I'm a patient.

185
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:48,240
If Mr. Ji brings me the cold dishes
that he had made,

186
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:49,759
won't it

187
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,240
arouse suspicion easily?

188
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,080
You're pretty meticulous, huh?

189
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,840
And you.

190
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,080
Now, my role is to play as a patient.

191
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,000
Your role is
to play as my family member.

192
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,840
Next time, if you visit me

193
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,120
empty-handed again,

194
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,960
Huo Jian will surely
be suspicious of us.

195
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,399
When he's suspicious of us,
he'll expose us.

196
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:09,279
Once he has exposed us,

197
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,039
what should we do if he ruins

198
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:11,759
Liang's plan?

199
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,360
Can you bear

200
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,120
that risk?

201
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,840
Fine, I got it.

202
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,600
Good.

203
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,000
Oh yeah,

204
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,720
you were late today.

205
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,360
You should be punctual tomorrow.

206
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,559
Last time,

207
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:32,279
when I was poisoned,

208
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,240
the soup you made for me

209
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,600
was pretty good.

210
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,240
You should make
the same soup for me tomorrow.

211
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:38,919
Don't push your luck!

212
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,279
My face is so itchy

213
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,159
because of the bandage.

214
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:45,519
It's too itchy.

215
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:46,759
It doesn't help no matter
how I scratch it.

216
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:47,759
Fine.

217
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,200
I'll make some soup for you tomorrow.

218
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,440
Speaking of grapes,

219
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:59,399
I do feel like eating some.

220
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,320
No one said grapes just now.

221
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:04,480
You said it just now.

222
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:08,080
Chu Chu, you may not know,

223
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:09,720
but it's so itchy.

224
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,000
It doesn't help no matter
how I scratch it.

225
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,120
Fine.

226
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:15,360
I'll peel some grapes for you.

227
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,360
Xiao Xiao!

228
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,639
Xiao Xiao!

229
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,320
Listen to me.

230
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,320
There were plenty of people today.

231
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:08,720
Our business was pretty good.

232
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,200
That's why I came back late.

233
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,840
Let's grab a bite.

234
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:27,080
(Mom,)

235
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,240
(you've worked hard at the market.)

236
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,240
(I've heated the dishes for you.)

237
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:32,720
(You can have them yourself.)

238
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,960
(Tonight, I decide)

239
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,919
(to head to the riverside that
Dad used to bring me to)

240
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,519
(and sing for him.)

241
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,120
(When you guys named me,)

242
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,600
(I'm sure you)

243
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,240
(wanted me to be happy, right?)

244
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:47,039
(That's why today,)

245
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:49,159
(I wish to do something
that will truly make me happy.)

246
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,360
(Mom, I hope you won't be angry at me.)

247
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,960
Xiao Xiao, take this.

248
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,720
Mr. Cao,

249
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,639
didn't you use this microphone

250
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:09,759
to promote and sell your honey?

251
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,120
That's right.

252
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,200
We borrowed the microphone

253
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,039
Mr. Cao had used to promote
and sell his honey.

254
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:14,720
What do you think?

255
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,720
The equipment is pretty good, right?

256
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,360
I'm not lending it to you.

257
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,399
I'm renting it to you.

258
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:19,759
It costs 50 yuan for an hour.

259
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:21,919
Xiao Xiao,

260
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,279
I believe

261
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:24,720
that you can do a good job.

262
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:26,080
I promise.

263
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,120
As long as you do a good job,

264
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,080
I'll waive the rental fee

265
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,799
for you.

266
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,799
And

267
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:32,080
I will give the microphone to you
for free.

268
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,399
Xiao Xiao,

269
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,320
you can do it.

270
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:43,080
♪As I push open the window of night♪

271
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:47,279
Xiao Xiao,

272
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,799
I believe

273
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:50,120
that your mother

274
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,039
didn't hate your singing.

275
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:55,240
She's just afraid that
you might be influenced

276
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,000
by other people's opinions.

277
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:58,919
But

278
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,240
if singing itself

279
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:02,080
can make you very happy,

280
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:02,840
I believe

281
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:04,639
your mother

282
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:06,240
will surely support you.

283
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:08,440
That's why,

284
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:09,879
don't treat this as a burden.

285
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:11,200
Just give it your all.

286
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:12,679
You can sing if you feel like it.

287
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,080
That's right.

288
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:16,120
Look.

289
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:18,440
The stars are shining tonight.

290
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,240
I believe

291
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,639
your father will surely

292
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:22,519
hear your voice.

293
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,279
Look at how forgetful I am.

294
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,120
I have some backing tracks here.

295
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,919
I'll play the backing tracks for you.

296
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,120

Madam,

345
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,200
sorry about that.

346
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:38,559
Don't blame Xiao Xiao for this.

347
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,400
We were the ones who brought her here.

348
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,240
Thank you.

349
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,960
I'd like to thank you both.

350
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:50,960
Xiao Xiao,

351
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,039
your singing was beautiful.

352
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,119
My Xiao Xiao is the best.

353
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,680
Mom!

354
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:03,279
Sorry.

355
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,960
I shouldn't have stopped you
from singing.

356
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,200
In the future, you can sing
whenever you like.

357
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,680
Thank you, Mom.

358
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:19,039
Xiao Xiao,

359
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,000
go over there

360
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,839
and play with Mr. Cao for a while.

361
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:22,920
I need to have a word

362
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,440
with them.

363
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:40,960
Mr. Huo,

364
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,440
I saw Li Ze Liang.

365
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,839
He's very close

366
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,759
to a pair of mother and daughter.

367
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,200
Mother and daughter?

368
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,839
They might be related to Liu Ah Wei.

369
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:49,920
Follow them.

370
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:51,079
Yes, sir.

371
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,400
Mr. Li, Miss Su,

372
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,039
you see...

373
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:04,359
Madam,

374
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:05,720
don't get us wrong.

375
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:08,119
We didn't mean anything else.

376
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:09,200
We just like

377
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:10,720
Xiao Xiao.

378
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:11,960
You guys misunderstood me.

379
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,440
I was trying to say

380
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,599
that I was especially anxious

381
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,119
when Xiao Xiao lost her hearing.

382
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,960
I was truly worried 

383
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,759
about how she'd cope with life

384
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,359
when I'm gone.

385
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,960
But until today,

386
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,000
I realized

387
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,880
that maybe

388
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,960
I was wrong from the start.

389
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,200
Xiao Xiao

390
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:30,759
can live like an ordinary person.

391
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:31,759
Look.

392
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,839
She did a great job at singing.

393
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:37,440
Mr. Li,

394
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:38,799
thank you.

395
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:39,960
Thank you for everything

396
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:40,920
that you did for Xiao Xiao.

397
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:42,440
Thank you.

398
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:43,799
Please get up.

399
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:49,880
Actually,

400
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,279
we were

401
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:52,400
wrong as well.

402
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,839
We brought Xiao Xiao here

403
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,680
without your permission.

404
00:19:58,039 --> 00:19:59,160
We would like to apologize for that.

405
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:01,559
Please don't say that.

406
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:03,880
Actually, I should be
the one to apologize.

407
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,559
Actually, before Ah Wei left,

408
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,119
he left something for me.

409
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:09,920
He told me to keep it safe.

410
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,559
He said I might need
to use it in the future.

411
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:14,440
But I didn't tell you guys about it.

412
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:18,559
What did he leave for you?

413
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,960
It's a USB drive.

414
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,680
He didn't want me to check it.

415
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,519
And I know nothing about computers.

416
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,160
That's why I don't know

417
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,319
what's inside.

418
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,559
If you guys

419
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:27,839
were looking for this,

420
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,880
I can pass it to you guys.

421
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:32,039
That's great.

422
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,599
So where is the USB drive?

423
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,440
I need to return home and find it.

424
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:37,279
How about this?

425
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,480
You guys can drop by tomorrow morning.

426
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,680
I'll pass it to you guys by then.

427
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,240
Okay, thank you.

428
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,480
Thank you.

429
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:45,920
I'll return with Xiao Xiao first.

430
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,000
Okay.

431
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:54,559
Do you think

432
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,519
that's a piece of evidence?

433
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,279
Xie Yi,

434
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,640
looks like

435
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,839
the heavens are helping us.

436
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:05,880
But we still have
to wait until tomorrow.

437
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,319
Tonight

438
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:09,640
will be a long night.

439
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,519
Xiao Xiao, are you cold?

440
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:22,880
I'm sure you haven't eaten yet, right?

441
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,160
I'll make you some spicy soup later.

442
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,400
Yan,

443
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,440
when you were helping Xiao Xiao out,

444
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:46,279
did you expect

445
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,680
to get anything in return?

446
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:52,839
Actually, at first, I did approach her

447
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:55,799
just so we could get our hands

448
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:57,119
on the things we wanted.

449
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,039
But after that,

450
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,759
when I had truly understood her,

451
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:04,960
I also truly hoped

452
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:06,079
that she could be happy.

453
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,759
Me too.

454
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,640
I guess

455
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,480
being good does have its perks.

456
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,200
What was on your mind

457
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,400
when you were listening to the song?

458
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,440
I was reminded of my father.

459
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:27,319
I was reminded of the times

460
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,440
when he took care of me.

461
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,400
It's a pity that I can't
keep the promise

462
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,119
I've made to him.

463
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:37,519
So when I listened to
Xiao Xiao's singing,

464
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,000
I was touched

465
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,480
and felt regretful at the same time.

466
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:44,720
Yeah.

467
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,680
Just like

468
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:49,480
what we'd said

469
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,680
to Xiao Xiao,

470
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:52,920
your father is in heaven.

471
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,160
I'm sure he wishes for us

472
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,759
to lead a happy life.

473
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,000
I believe

474
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:01,680
that he'll surely

475
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,799
bless us from above

476
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,200
and help us acquire the evidence.

477
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:08,880
What about you?

478
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:10,480
What was on your mind then?

479
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:16,720
I was thinking about

480
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:18,119
what happened two years ago.

481
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,599
It was

482
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:20,519
under the same night sky.

483
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:23,039
A girl and I

484
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:25,240
were sitting on a mountain top.

485
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,279
We were listening to some music.

486
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,240
A girl?

487
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,839
Which girl do you mean?

488
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,759
It's been too long since then.

489
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:38,279
I can't remember clearly.

490
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:40,799
I think her name

491
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,000
was Yi.

492
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:43,759
Or, was it Huang?

493
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,240
Bai?

494
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:46,880
Chen?

495
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,720
Be honest with me.

496
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,519
Have you flirted with any other girls

497
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,400
before you encountered me?

498
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,839
No.

499
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:56,240
Really?

500
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:58,640
Really.

501
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:00,759
I only did one thing

502
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:02,559
during the first half of my life.

503
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,079
That is to wait for your appearance.

504
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,920
You're such a glib talker.

505
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,319
I don't believe you.

00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,060
♪I secretly blindfolded you♪

518
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,620
♪I'll tell you where I am♪

519
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:52,700
♪It's just you and I, forever♪

520
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,279
(Rent a power bank for me!)

521
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,759
(I forgot to bring my charging cable!)

522
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:26,119
Okay.

523
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:40,839
Is this the hotel you've booked for me?

524
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:41,839
That's right.

525
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:44,240
There's not even a single person
at the reception desk.

526
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,759
I'll call them immediately.

527
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,359
Anyone there?

528
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:50,920
Anyone there?

529
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,480
Come back!

530
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,359
Why are you shouting
in the middle of the night?

531
00:25:57,839 --> 00:25:58,400
Let me ask you.

532
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,400
Are you sure you found

533
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,599
Liu Ah Wei's house?

534
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,279
Yes, sir.

535
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,160
I've inquired about them
in the vicinity.

536
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,359
That girl

537
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:06,559
is Liu Ah Wei's daughter.

538
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,279
And I heard

539
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,680
that Liu Ah Wei had passed away.

540
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,319
He passed away?

541
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,440
That's right.

542
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,039
That's good news for me.

543
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:18,640
Mr. Huo,

544
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,400
who exactly is

545
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,519
this Liu Ah Wei?

546
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,519
That's not something you should ask.

547
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,960
Are you heading
to their house right now?

548
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:27,079
Only the mother and the daughter
are in the house.

549
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:29,240
You want me to find them
in the middle of the night?

550
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,640
Are you out of your mind?

551
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:31,640
Understood.

552
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,119
So...

553
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,160
So do you want

554
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,039
to change to another hotel?

555
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:35,839
Of course.

556
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:43,440
You've been away for quite some time.

557
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:44,720
Did some ladies

558
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:45,839
try to flirt with you

559
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:47,279
since you are good-looking?

560
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:48,599
I saw Huo Jian.

561
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,680
Why is he here?

562
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:52,799
I don't know.

563
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:54,279
Will Xiao Xiao and her mother

564
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,319
be in danger then?

565
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,559
He was looking for accommodation.

566
00:26:57,799 --> 00:26:58,920
That means he has just arrived here.

567
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:00,279
At least, he won't

568
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,200
do anything tonight.

569
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:02,119
Let's head to Xiao Xiao's house

570
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,200
early in the morning tomorrow.

571
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:04,319
Alright.

572
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:11,279
Speak.

573
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,000
Speak what?

574
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:15,720
Mr. Ji had told me everything.

575
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,759
Huo Jian knew this was an act long ago.

576
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,279
Why did you lie to me and tell me
to continue the act with you?

577
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,519
I...

578
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,119
Yeah.

579
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,960
Why was I still acting?

580
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:25,880
Let's go.

581
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:27,440
Send me back to the bar.

582
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,079
Stop pretending.

583
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,519
Answer my question.

584
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,680
Okay.

585
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,480
I'm afraid you can't take it

586
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,319
if I tell you the truth.

587
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:37,160
Come here.

588
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,559
What?

589
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,359
Come here and look into my eyes.

590
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:49,440
Closer.

591
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,279
Closer.

592
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,119
In psychology,

593
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,599
when a person

594
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:08,079
looks at someone special to them

595
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,119
with excitement,

596
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:12,359
their pupils will dilate

597
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:13,720
by 45%.

598
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:16,240
So did you detect

599
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:18,880
any changes

600
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,200
in my eyes?

601
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,279
You mean like this?

602
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:28,799
That's not it!

603
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,880
Delete it immediately!

604
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:30,799
Give it to me!

605
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,240
Stop pretending!

606
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:33,880
Chu Chu,

607
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,079
I'm not pretending this time.

608
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:35,960
Look.

609
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:38,039
That night,

610
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,200
Huo Jian came to find Ze Liang.

611
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,240
He even discovered the secret chamber.

612
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:42,400
I sprained my ankle because
I tried to stop Huo Jian.

613
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:43,400
Listen,

614
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:44,920
this time, I was really injured

615
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,160
for helping Liang.

616
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:50,799
By the way, Chu Chu,

617
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,000
Huo Jian has gone to Yun'an as well.

618
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,920
No wonder I didn't see him
for the past few days.

619
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,640
Do you think he will

620
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,920
try to hurt Ze Liang again?

621
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:03,039
Don't worry,

622
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:04,799
Mr. Ji is over there as well.

623
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:06,880
I don't think something bad will happen.

624
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:12,400
Coming!

625
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:14,480
Coming!

626
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:18,559
You are here.

627
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:19,400
Please come in.

628
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,440
Let's go inside.

629
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:39,200
You guys haven't
taken breakfast yet, right?

630
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,359
The spicy soup I had made is still hot.

631
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:42,799
Thank you.

632
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:45,960
Just now, your uncle praised me

633
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,839
after he tried it.

634
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:56,079
Have a seat.

635
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,400
By the way, where's Xiao Xiao?

636
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,480
She's playing outside

637
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,799
together with your uncle.

638
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,880
Xie Yi?

639
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:11,359
Xiao Xiao,

640
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,480
where did you go just now?

641
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:13,839
I went to the backyard.

642
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,319
Ze Liang,

643
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,200
so you were discharged
from the hospital?

644
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,599
Why didn't you notify me about it?

645
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,440
I was worried about you, you know?

646
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:25,240
Look at how courteous your uncle is.

647
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:25,920
Look.

648
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,559
He bought plenty of stuff for me.

649
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,960
It's nothing.

650
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,240
Ze Liang's friends

651
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:31,599
are my friends as well.

652
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:32,839
Oh yeah,

653
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,680
you guys should have it while it's hot.

654
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,319
I'll take something for you guys.

655
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,920
Mr. Huo, have a seat as well.

656
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:37,759
Don't just stand there.

657
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:38,319
Okay.

658
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:44,920
Xiao Xiao,

659
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,720
I have something to tell you.

660
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:56,880
Go now.

661
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,559
What were you whispering about?

662
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,599
You should share it with us.

663
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,200
Let us join in on the fun.

664
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:04,640
So

665
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:06,160
there was Little Red Riding Hood,

666
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,480
and she fell sick.

667
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,960
Her grandmother went to visit her.

668
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:12,039
In the end,

669
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:14,079
her wig was removed.

670
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,559
Actually, it was a wolf.

671
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,720
It wanted to eat Little Red Riding Hood

672
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,920
and take her house for itself.

673
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:24,559
By the way, Yan,

674
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,559
you still don't know the ending yet,
right?

675
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,240
In the end,

676
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,079
that wolf

677
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,039
was captured by
their righteous neighbors.

678
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,519
And they sent it to prison.

679
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,960
The wolf had to spend

680
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,559
its entire life in prison.

681
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,240
That's just a story.

682
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:43,279
But when it comes to reality,

683
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:45,759
the ending is often the opposite.

684
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:55,960
Xiao Xiao,

685
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,680
why are you still here?

686
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,640
Hurry and head to school.

687
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,200
What's the matter, Xiao Xiao?

688
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:07,640
Xie Yi told me

689
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:09,839
not to take this out first.

690
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,240
But why?

691
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:13,000
Xie Yi told me to do so.

692
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,000
We should follow her instruction.

693
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:17,960
Xiao Xiao,

694
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,119
I know

695
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:21,920
that this was left by your father.

696
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:23,880
But since I've promised
to give it to them,

697
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,400
I have to keep my promise.

698
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,079
You should head to school.

699
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:33,920
Ze Liang,

700
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:36,000
the spicy soup
Xiao Xiao's mother had made

701
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,960
was delicious indeed.

702
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,559
I had a few bowls of it just now.

703
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,319
You guys should eat up.

704
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:42,519
How did you know I was here?

705
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:43,920
Didn't I tell you already?

706
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:45,279
I was worried about you.

707
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:47,039
Not only do I know your location,

708
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:49,680
but I also know what you plan to do.

709
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:56,400
So you followed me all the way here

710
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,279
because you felt guilty?

711
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,359
So that means

712
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,519
you were the one who did it.

713
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:07,400
How many times have I told you?

714
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,160
You need to provide evidence
when you speak.

715
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:11,279
When you put it like this,

716
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,200
I feel heartbroken.

717
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,359
You should burn more joss paper for him.

718
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,759
See if

719
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:24,839
he'll tell you about it.

720
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:27,880
Sir,

721
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,839
I found the thing
you guys were looking for.

722
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:33,079
Wait!

723
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:33,440
Stop!

724
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:34,119
Xie Yi.

725
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,319
Don't chase after him.

726
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,160
He can't run away.

727
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,640
Have a seat.

728
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,240
This...

729
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:46,480
What's going on?

730
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:48,880
Madam Xia,

731
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,000
my uncle was right.

732
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:52,359
The spicy soup you made

733
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:53,720
is delicious indeed.

734
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,759
Please get my uncle

735
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:56,799
another bowl.

736
00:33:57,319 --> 00:33:57,839
Sure.

737
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,519
Firewood,

738
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,599
where are you going?

739
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,239
Hello, Ying Song?

740
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:09,960
Mr. Li?

741
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:10,800
What's the matter?

742
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,440
I saw Huo Jian just now.

743
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,519
What?

744
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,519
Are you saying that Huo Jian
has gone to Yun'an as well?

745
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:17,239
That's right.

746
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:18,280
How would he know about

747
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,000
your location?

748
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,840
Don't tell me he has planted other spies
beside you?

749
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:21,920
I'm not sure.

750
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:22,800
Ying Song,

751
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:24,639
tomorrow is a crucial day.

752
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,519
I want you to do something for me.

753
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:18,820
(Ying Song)

754
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,159
(The evidence is gone - Firewood)
Hello, Mr. Li?

755
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,639
That fellow has burned
the USB drive.

756
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:25,719
(The evidence is gone.)

757
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:38,079
Ze Liang,

758
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,280
seems like

759
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,840
you've lost again.

760
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:44,920
Huo Jian,

761
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:46,559
you've committed
so many despicable deeds.

762
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,800
Don't think that
you can escape from this.

763
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,400
If I were you,

764
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:50,639
I would've turned myself in.

765
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:52,719
Maybe, they would show me some leniency.

766
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:55,559
Miss Su, you're so good
at cracking jokes.

767
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:58,760
In reality, I make the call.

768
00:35:59,159 --> 00:35:59,719
Uncle,

769
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:03,000
our current society is ruled by law.

770
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:04,320
Once you've committed a crime,

771
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,320
the law will punish you eventually.

772
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:08,679
The story between us

773
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,800
isn't over yet.

774
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:14,920
Fine.

775
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,480
Let's just wait and see.

776
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:20,199
This place is pretty fun.

777
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,119
You don't visit here often.

778
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:23,320
Enjoy yourselves.

779
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,000
I'll excuse myself.

780
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:27,320
By the way, Ze Liang,

781
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,920
After you've returned to Ocean Hotel,

782
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:30,719
you should play badminton with me again.

783
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:31,760
Let's see

784
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,519
if you can defend against
my serve this time.

785
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,039
Mr. Li,

786
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,679
Mr. Xie got injured 

787
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:50,360
trying to save Xiao Xiao.

788
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,440
Now, both Liu Ah Wei and the evidence

789
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,320
are gone.

790
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,119
You can rest at ease now.

791
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,760
You should have seen 

792
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,599
Li Ze Liang's face today.

793
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,159
He wanted to take me down,

794
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,320
but he couldn't do anything.

795
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:19,559
It was so interesting.

796
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,599
It's because he was no match for you

797
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:22,880
in the first place.

798
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:26,239
How is it? Does it feel good?

799
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,000
I was planning

800
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,360
to make myself feel better.

801
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:38,480
Now that all of your obstacles are gone,

802
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:41,159
you can marry me now, right?

803
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:46,559
Do you know why Li Ze Liang

804
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:47,719
ended up like this?

805
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:50,800
It's because of Su Xie Yi.

806
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,920
Once a person has a weakness

807
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:54,400
that other people can use against them,

808
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:56,920
the person will cease
to be invulnerable.

809
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:58,079
Isn't our current state

810
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,239
pretty good as well?

811
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,679
You promised me this

812
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:03,679
when you told me

813
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:04,880
to abort my child last time.

814
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,639
Last time, you said it wasn't time yet.

815
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,320
What about now?

816
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,480
Haven't I provided you with enough?

817
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,840
Why are you so greedy?

818
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:18,679
I'm greedy?

819
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,320
I've been with you for so many years.

820
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:23,960
I've done so much for you.

821
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:25,760
You should understand

822
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,320
that a title

823
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,800
is the only thing I want.

824
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,199
Be a good girl.

825
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,199
Since I've made you a promise,

826
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,000
I will keep my promise.

827
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,079
Wait for a little longer,

828
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,280
okay?

829
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:42,039
Stop deceiving me.

830
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,880
Why would I deceive you?

831
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,480
Now,

832
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:50,119
I cannot truly rest at ease yet.

833
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,760
If that day does come,

834
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,039
I will surely marry you.

835
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,440
This is my last time trusting you.

836
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:03,480
Why would this
be your last time trusting me?

837
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:07,599
Our relationship hasn't
even started yet.

838
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,360
Mr. Li, Miss Su,

839
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:29,079
I really didn't know

840
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:31,039
that your uncle was hostile towards you.

841
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:33,519
It's fine.

842
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:35,199
Sorry for the trouble.

843
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:37,000
It's all my fault.

844
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:39,280
If I had listened to Xiao Xiao

845
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:40,519
and didn't bring it out,

846
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,079
this wouldn't have happened.

847
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,719
Madam Xia,

848
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,400
you don't need to blame yourself.

849
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,360
I knew you did it out of good intention.

850
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:54,280
How's Mr. Xie?

851
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:55,480
He sprained his elbow.

852
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,559
He has applied medicine to it.

853
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,480
He's fine now.

854
00:39:58,519 --> 00:39:59,039
Mr. Xie

855
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,480
wouldn't have gotten hurt

856
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,719
if he didn't try

857
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,039
to protect Xiao Xiao.

858
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:05,239
I need to make some soup for him.

859
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,519
Have a seat.

860
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:07,599
Let me help you out.

861
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:08,880
Thank you.

862
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:10,199
Go now.

863
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,199
Did you tell Mr. Xie

864
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,159
that you were coming?

865
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:25,239
No, I didn't.

866
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,159
Why is he here then?

867
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,280
Maybe, it's because of Miss Su.

868
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,559
It's not her.

869
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,079
I've already asked her.

870
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:56,800
Please come in.

871
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:02,119
Ming Hao,

872
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,360
are you okay?

873
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:04,760
I'm fine.

874
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:06,960
Madam Xia

875
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:08,280
made this soup especially for you.

876
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:09,480
You should drink it while it's hot.

877
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:10,679
Thanks.

878
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:16,840
Sorry.

879
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,599
I didn't manage to get it back.

880
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,880
Ming Hao, you don't need
to blame yourself.

881
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:23,159
At least, you saved Xiao Xiao.

882
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:25,360
Luckily, your injury wasn't serious.

883
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,199
If not,

884
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:28,679
I wouldn't be able to face Xie Qing.

885
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,400
Have you found

886
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:32,639
any other clues?

887
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,880
Madam Xia had searched the entire house.

888
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:37,679
But the USB drive

889
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,480
was the only thing Liu Ah Wei
had left behind.

890
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,440
Xie Yi,

891
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,559
I wish

892
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:54,920
to speak with Mr. Xie in private.

893
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:57,960
