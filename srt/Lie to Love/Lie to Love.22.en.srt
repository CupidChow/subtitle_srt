00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,120
Xie Yi just went for a tooth extraction.

20
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,040
I'm sure she can't make it.

21
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:08,000
So I need to accompany her more.

22
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,039
Si Xie Yi went to visit Xie Qing?

23
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,319
What's their relationship?

24
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,719
I don't think this is

25
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,520
a secret anymore.

26
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,960
Xie Qing is Xie Yi's elder sister.

27
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,520
Actually, Xie Yi

28
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,120
is Uncle Shen's biological daughter.

29
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,759
What?

30
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,800
Xie Qing was actually adopted.

31
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:30,960
Xie Yi went overseas

32
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,240
together with her mother
when she was young.

33
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,759
That's why only a few people
know about this.

34
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,159
Uncle Shen had told his wife as well.

35
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,599
If there are two children,

36
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,879
one of them will have his surname.

37
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,400
The other one will have
his wife's surname.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,599
After they

39
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,759
adopted Xie Qing,

40
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,800
Xie Yi had her mother's surname.

41
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,199
It's getting late.

42
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,280
I'll be off first.

43
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:12,520
Alright.

44
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,520
Su Xie Yi

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,800
is the daughter of Shen Zhi Hong?

46
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:42,680
Come in.

47
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:54,080
What's the matter, Chu Chu?

48
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:57,520
I have a question.

49
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,879
And I think it's better for me

50
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:00,840
to ask you directly.

51
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,080
What question?

52
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,439
Back then, when you told me

53
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,960
to fire Su Xie Yi,

54
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,879
you said it was because of
your relationship.

55
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,560
That wasn't true, right?

56
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,439
Why are you suddenly asking this?

57
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,600
I just got to know

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,879
that Su Xie Yi is
Shen Zhi Hong's daughter.

59
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,279
If that's the case,

60
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,399
I think I know why

61
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,639
she did what she had done

62
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,319
when she joined Ocean Hotel.

63
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:28,759
So...

64
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,519
I wish to know the true reason

65
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,879
behind her sacking.

66
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,199
If you can't say it out,

67
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,680
I'll say it out for you.

68
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,240
Back then,

69
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,680
when Zhiwei Corporation

70
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:44,920
cooperated with us,

71
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:47,000
as they were suspected of
commercial fraud,

72
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,560
they had no choice

73
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,480
but to compensate Ocean Hotel
with an exorbitant price.

74
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,120
And this was the main reason
why Zhiwei Corporation went bankrupt

75
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,319
and why Shen Zhi Hong

76
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,639
committed suicide.

77
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,000
And you,

78
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:02,560
you were the person
in charge of the project.

79
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,120
That's right.

80
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,319
When Xie Yi first joined Ocean Hotel,

81
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,839
she did so to investigate the truth.

82
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,360
Of course,

83
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,720
that includes investigating me.

84
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,839
So

85
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,439
she had an ulterior motive

86
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,199
for approaching you in the first place.

87
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,079
That's the true reason

88
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,160
behind her sacking, right?

89
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:25,680
Chu Chu,

90
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:29,240
this case is very complicated.

91
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:30,600
On the one hand,

92
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:31,920
I don't want her

93
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,399
to disrupt my plan
on how to deal with Huo Jian.

94
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,680
On the other hand,

95
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,399
I do feel guilty

96
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:38,600
when Uncle Shen committed suicide.

97
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,839
I asked Su Xie Yi to leave the company

98
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,519
in order to protect her.

99
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,040
Li Ze Liang,

100
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,199
you're actually

101
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,800
trying to protect a woman
who suspected you

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,759
and even tried to harm you?

103
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,199
Our relationship started

104
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,000
before the incident

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,959
with Zhiwei Corporation.

106
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,040
That's why

107
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,120
our relationship is sincere and pure.

108
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,480
We've investigated the case.

109
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,120
Huo Jian was the mastermind.

110
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,160
But Zhiwei Corporation was purchased

111
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,279
by Ocean Hotel after all.

112
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,480
And Huo Jian

113
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,360
is your uncle.

114
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,720
How could you be sure

115
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,560
that she has forgotten about
her initial motive?

116
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:12,439
Chu Chu, I understand.

117
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,399
I know it's difficult

118
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,800
for you to trust

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,040
Su Xie Yi completely.

120
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,000
That's why,

121
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:17,959
you just

122
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,839
need to trust my judgment.

123
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,199
Ze Liang,

124
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,399
I hope that you won't
let your relationship

125
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,759
blind your judgment.

126
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,519
No matter when it is,

127
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,240
you should leave some leeway
for yourself.

128
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,639
It's because your interest

129
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,399
is Ocean Hotel's interest.

130
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,040
And Ocean Hotel's interest

131
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,160
is the interest

132
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,000
of me and all the other employees.

133
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,560
I know that.

134
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,199
I'm glad that you know that.

135
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,480
Mr. Xie, this way, please.

136
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,519
Please wait a moment.

137
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,120
Mr. Dai,

138
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,560
your client is here.

139
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,439
What kind of lousy rod is this?

140
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,800
Get me a telescopic fishing rod!

141
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,839
I want to catch a big fish.

142
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:30,199
Mr. Dai, you're using
a telescopic fishing rod.

143
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,206
(Zhengde Group's General Manager,
Dai Zi Ang)

144
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,639
What did you say?

145
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,639
I'll remember that.
I'll change it for you next time.

146
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,680
Go now.

147
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,680
Mr. Xie,

148
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,079
it's been a while.

149
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,480
Yeah.

150
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,439
Mr. Dai, looks like
you're enjoying yourself.

151
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,839
Mr. Xie,

152
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,079
I once admired you.

153
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:07,839
But you just had to work for
Ocean Hotel.

154
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,439
I heard that you wanted
to cooperate with me.

155
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,759
Do you think

156
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,319
I will use the same lawyer

157
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,439
as Ocean Hotel?

158
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:14,680
That's right.

159
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,519
Zhengde Hotel

160
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,079
has always been
at odds with Ocean Hotel.

161
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,480
Ocean Hotel won against Zhengde Hotel

162
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,639
in the case with Fujiade last time.

163
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,879
Mr. Dai, I'm sure you won't
just lie down

164
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,160
and take it in.

165
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,559
Are you teasing me?

166
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,360
Mr. Dai,

167
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,559
I'm glad that you're angry.

168
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,759
Zhengde Hotel

169
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,320
has been suppressed by Ocean Hotel
for many years.

170
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,840
I couldn't stand it any longer.

171
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,080
What do you plan to do?

172
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:55,639
You wish to topple Ocean Hotel
even in your dreams, right?

173
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
I can help you out.

174
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:58,039
You?

175
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,159
Me.

176
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,919
Mr. Dai,

177
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,320
the chairman of Ocean Hotel, Huo Jian,

178
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,720
was just thrown into prison.

179
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,840
This has caused a huge impact
on the industry.

180
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,399
The market

181
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,360
has lost confidence in Ocean Hotel now.

182
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:12,399
Under Huo Jian's management,

183
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
Ocean Hotel may seem perfect,

184
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,440
in reality, it's riddled with holes.

185
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,120
They don't have good cash flow.

186
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:25,279
You're a professional
commercial lawyer indeed.

187
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:26,960
Continue.

188
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,480
A great man cannot brook a rival.

189
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,399
Zhengde Hotel and Ocean Hotel

190
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,360
will have a desperate battle eventually.

191
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,720
If they fight each other,

192
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,320
only a limited number of chances
and weaknesses

193
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,519
will be revealed.

194
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:39,480
If you cannot

195
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,080
cherish your opportunity and strike

196
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,159
when your opponent

197
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,960
gives you the chance to do so,

198
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,440
you'll be defeated

199
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,720
in the end.

200
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,480
But...

201
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,960
since you wish to cooperate with me,

202
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,879
you can't just come empty-handed, right?

203
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,519
If you wish to catch a big fish,

204
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,039
you need to prepare a great lure.

205
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,919
Mr. Dai, you're right.

206
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,120
(Lantian Bay Project Proposal)
The lure is here.

207
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,519
Lantian Bay?

208
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,600
Isn't this

209
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:05,759
Ocean Hotel's most important project?

210
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,519
Will they be able
to proceed with the project

211
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:09,879
after Huo Jian's arrest?

212
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,759
Li Ze Liang just took over his position.

213
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,399
He's desperate to raise their morale.

214
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:14,720
Lantian Bay

215
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:15,559
will be his best choice.

216
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:16,759
But

217
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:18,519
he has to wager

218
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,759
his entire asset as well.

219
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,480
So once the Lantian Bay project

220
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,440
is canceled,

221
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:24,240
it'll be a fatal blow

222
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:26,440
to Ocean Hotel.

223
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:27,879
You got the point.

224
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,639
So how do you plan to help me?

225
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:36,440
On this price list,

226
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,080
there are many places

227
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,720
where they have cut corners.

228
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:40,960
Flip it.

229
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,790
(Project cost estimation and financing)
Li Ze Liang wishes to proceed with it.

230
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,080
But once this price list
is revealed to the public,

231
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,639
Lantian Bay

232
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:49,240
will become the bomb

233
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,879
that Li Ze Liang had lit himself.

234
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,559
Your lure is great.

235
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,559
Mr. Dai.

236
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,679
The fee I'm charging for this

237
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:59,639
is much higher than a lawyer's fee.

238
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:00,919
Fee?

239
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,000
You want money?

240
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,120
You should've told me earlier.
That's easy.

241
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,559
We can negotiate a deal.

242
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,320
So is this a deal?

243
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,240
It's almost time.

244
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,399
Time to set sail.

245
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:20,919
We can talk about it

246
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,440
after the fish

247
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,840
has been enticed by the lure.

248
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,559
See you.

249
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,399
(This is)

250
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,159
(very excruciating.)

251
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,600
(Things to take note of after amputation)
(If it gets worse,)

252
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:40,919
(we'll have no choice)

253
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,679
(but to target the upper part)

254
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:45,679
(and do a second amputation.)

255
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,639
(Yan always)

256
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,279
(walks with his prosthetic leg at home.)

257
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,519
(This will worsen his condition.)

258
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,000
(I need to think of something.)

259
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:18,639
Xie Yi?

260
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,320
Xie Yi?

261
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:37,559
Xie Yi?

262
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,480
You're back?

263
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,320
Just in time.

264
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,480
What are you doing?

265
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,039
Look.

266
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,799
I made this.

267
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,879
And over here.

268
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:55,200
This way,

269
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,799
you can move without

270
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,960
using your prosthetic leg

271
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,799
by using these handles.

272
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,320
Do you know

273
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,440
what's the best thing about it?

274
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:04,360
Step back a little.

275
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,879
This way,

276
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:31,000
you can enter
and exit the kitchen at will.

277
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:33,960
What do you think?

278
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:35,600
Aren't I amazing?

279
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:40,480
What's wrong?

280
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,759
Why are you keeping quiet?

281
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:44,919
Were you too touched?

282
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:46,879
Sorry.

283
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,480
Why are you apologizing to me
all of a sudden?

284
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:58,679
I just...

285
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,039
I just think

286
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,000
that I don't have enough time.

287
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,360
I don't know what I can do

288
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,120
to make you realize

289
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:09,440
how precious you are to me.

290
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,960
I don't know what to do

291
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,240
for me

292
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,080
to make up for
the past two years without you.

293
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:18,879
Xie Yi,

294
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,120
thank you.

295
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,840
Thank you for not forgetting me.

296
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:29,639
Thank you

297
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,960
for everything.

298
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,039
Why are you saying that all of a sudden?

299
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,919
I'm also happy

300
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,200
that I can do these things for you.

301
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,679
Thank you.

302
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Look at you.

303
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,639
Your face is all dirty.

304
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,000
Where is it?

305
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,600
What do you mean?

306
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,399
It's...

307
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:26,960
I mean a kiss.

308
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,000
I was planning to kiss you.

309
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,399
But I controlled myself.

310
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:33,639
But why?

311
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,120
It's because your tooth
hasn't recovered yet.

312
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,320
I was afraid that it might be
painful for you.

313
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,960
It won't be.

314
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,159
How dare you laugh?

315
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:48,440
By the way,

316
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,799
I still have one handle

317
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,399
to install in the corridor.

318
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,240
I forgot to take this.

319
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,480
Wait for me. I'll be done in a second.

320
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,720
I'll wait for you.

321
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,960
Xie Yi,

322
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,360
I'll go to work now.

323
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:29,440
Wait a minute.

324
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,840
Take this. You can eat it
on your way there.

325
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:37,320
Thank you.

326
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,360
Xie Yi,

327
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:40,120
our company is going to restart

328
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:41,440
the Lantian Bay project.

329
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,080
I might get busier.

330
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,080
Even if I'm back home,

331
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,360
I'm afraid I can't keep
accompanying you.

332
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,799
You mustn't blame me for this.

333
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,799
Do I look that insensible to you?

334
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,360
You just need to focus on your work.

335
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,759
Leave the logistic support

336
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,559
to me.

337
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,480
Okay.

338
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,240
You too.

339
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:00,200
You should let your tooth recover.

340
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,200
After that,

341
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,440
I'll take you to have some good food.

342
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:04,440
Okay.

343
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,319

Xie Yi,

for the Lantian Bay project,

370
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:08,519
I plan to install

371
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,519
home automation for each of them.

372
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:11,279
Although the cost will be higher,

373
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,119
this is

374
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,039
the trend of the future.

375
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:15,680
What do you think?

376
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,039
What did you say?

377
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:19,480
Come closer. I can't hear you.

I can't hear you. Come closer.

Since everyone has agreed with it,

next,

394
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,839
we will follow this proposal

395
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:02,880
and proceed

396
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:04,480

403
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,960
from smelling this.

404

Hurry and dig in.

Mr. Li?

406
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:53,559
I think I should call you

407
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:54,720
Chairman Li now.

408
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:55,960
I didn't expect us

409
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,799
to encounter each other here.

410
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:59,319
Are you dating your secretary?

411
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:00,599
Mr. Dai,

412
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,039
this is my girlfriend.

413
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,880
So she's Sister-in-law?

414
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,759
Sister-in-law,

415
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:12,200
you look kind enough.

416
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:13,839
But you must be careful.

417
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:14,519
Chairman Li

418
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,359
has a weird habit

419
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,519
of stealing other people's things.

420
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:20,079
First, he stole my things.

421
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,440
After that, he stole his uncle's things.

422
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,319
Sister-in-law, don't tell me

423
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,759
he stole you from someone else as well?

424
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:30,839
Mr. Dai,

425
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,359
you don't need

426
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,839
to worry about my girlfriend.

427
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,400
I suggest you

428
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,319
spend more time

429
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:37,440
handling Zhengde Hotel.

430
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,839
I suggest

431
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,799
you spend more time handling
Ocean Hotel.

432
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:42,839
Now that Huo Jian is arrested,

433
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,440
it'll be tough for Ocean Hotel.

434
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,400
You need to take care of yourself

435
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,279
so that I can finish you off myself.

436
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,000
Alright.

437
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,599
I'll stop bothering you guys then.

438
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,279
You guys can continue.

439
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:01,400
It smells weird.

440
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,440
Enjoy your meal.

441
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:07,200
Eat up.

442
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,359
Who is that?

443
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,559
Why is he so arrogant?

444
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,160
He's Mr. Dai from Zhengde Group.

445
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,440
He's Dai Zi Ang.

446
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:16,640
Yan,

447
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:18,720
now that I think about it,

448
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,559
you just took over as the chairman.

449
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:22,519
The company and
the people of the industry

450
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,720
are keeping a close eye on you.

451
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,079
The Lantian Bay project

452
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,359
is so important.

453
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:27,240
And now,

454
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,680
Mr. Dai has his eyes on you.

455
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,440
I wish to return to the company
and help you.

456
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,319
Sure.

457
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,240
Great timing.

458
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:37,079
How could I leave my good wife behind

459
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,640
when I'm trying

460
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,480
to expand my territory?

461
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,000
When do you plan to join us?

462
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,440
I've rested for a few days
since extracting my tooth.

463
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:47,880
I'll visit my sister tomorrow.

464
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,240
I can go to work after that.

465
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,400
Great.

466
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:54,240
Speaking of which,

467
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,200
I've never accompanied you

468
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,680
to visit your sister before.

469
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:57,599
How about this?

470
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,279
I'll join you tomorrow.

471
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:00,519
Great.

472
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:02,839
It's time for

473
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,839
my future husband

474
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:05,480
to know my sister.

475
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,359
Dig in.

476
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:10,039
Here.

477
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,359
All these crab roes are yours.

478
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:18,640
Come.

479
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,400
Mr. Xie?

480
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,559
You're pretty punctual.

481
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,519
Mr. Dai, I don't dare to be late
when I'm meeting you.

482
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:30,839
Seems like you're in a good mood.

483
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,880
Do you have good news for me?

484
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,839
Mr. Dai,

485
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,559
the fish has taken the bait.

486
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:36,799
They've proceeded

487
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,720
with the Lantian Bay project.

488
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,119
Your chance is here.

489
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:40,039
Are you serious?

490
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,400
That fast?

491
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,599
Come on.

492
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,839
Finish it for me.

493
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,599
Come on.

494
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,160
Tell me about it.

495
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:49,480
How did you do it?

496
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:52,000
I told you before, Li Ze Liang
just took over the position.

497
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,400
Regarding the Lantian Bay project...

498
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,759
How dare you deceive me?

499
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:55,759
I've done my investigation!

500
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:57,119
Li Ze Liang's girlfriend

501
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,119
is Su Xie Yi.

502
00:23:58,319 --> 00:23:59,519
And you're her brother-in-law.

503
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:00,799
Speak.

504
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,160
What's your motive?

505
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:03,960
If I discover that you and Li Ze Liang

506
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,599
are trying to trick me,

507
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,920
I'll feed you to the fish right now.

508
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:11,160
I'm not deceiving you.

509
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,039
Why are you helping me

510
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,640
to harm your sister-in-law's man?

511
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:21,559
It's because he stole my woman.

512
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,759
I love Su Xie Yi.

513
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,359
I took care of her sister

514
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:35,359
because I hoped
she could stay by my side.

515
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:37,240
I didn't expect her

516
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,240
to be together with Li Ze Liang

517
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:40,839
after all I'd done for her.

518
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,400
I hate him.

519
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,799
My hatred for him is much stronger
than yours.

520
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:51,960
Are you serious?

521
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:53,920
There's only one man
we should feed to the fish.

522
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:56,480
That is Li Ze Liang.

523
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,759
You darned pervert!

524
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,599
How dare you fall in love

525
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:05,799
with your own sister-in-law?

526
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:08,960
But I like it.

527
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:09,960
Look at you.

528
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,519
You're spending so much effort

529
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:12,319
to topple Li Ze Liang

530
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:13,359
for the sake of a woman.

531
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:14,480
Do you think it's worth it?

532
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,920
Since young,

533
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,119
those who hindered me

534
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,359
must pay the price.

535
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,279
He should've

536
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,400
understood that long ago.

537
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:25,319
There's plenty of fish in the sea.

538
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:26,920
I have plenty of women with me.

539
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:28,279
You can pick whoever you like.

540
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:29,240
Come on.

541
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:30,319
Come here.

542
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,119
My secretary is pretty good.

543
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,119
Mr. Dai,

544
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,000
Su Xie Yi will surely return to me.

545
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:38,000
And she'll return to me voluntarily.

546
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:43,000
Are you that confident in yourself?

547
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,559
But that Li Ze Liang

548
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,039
is pretty hard to deal with.

549
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,359
Mr. Dai, don't worry.

550
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:51,799
Besides

551
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,279
the Lantian Bay project,

552
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:55,200
I still have two trump cards
under my sleeves.

553
00:25:58,839 --> 00:25:59,640
The two

554
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:01,480
most important women beside him,

555
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,599
Su Xie Yi and Shi Chu Chu.

556
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:07,519
Su Xie Yi, Shi Chu Chu? Su...

557
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,960
Su Xie Yi is your sister-in-law.

558
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,240
It's possible for you to use her.

559
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,599
But according to my knowledge,

560
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:13,920
Shi Chu Chu

561
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:15,359
is Li Ze Liang's best friend.

562
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:16,599
Why must she help you?

563
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,160
All humans have weaknesses.

564
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:20,440
Shi Chu Chu's biggest weakness

565
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,480
is her love for Li Ze Liang.

566
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:24,599
She wishes to get Li Ze Liang

567
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,720
while I wish to get Su Xie Yi.

568
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,640
With that reason alone,

569
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:30,119
we can cooperate with each other.

570
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,839
Get on the boat.

571
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:44,759
Xie Yi.

572
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:46,119
Why are you here?

573
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:47,319
Who's there?

574
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:52,119
It's Ming Hao.

575
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,839
Let him come in.

576
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:55,960
Please come in.

577
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:04,920
Mr. Xie, what brings you here?

578
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,440
I heard that Xie Yi had just
gone for a tooth extraction.

579
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:07,799
I bought some supplements

580
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:09,000
and I came to visit her.

581
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:10,720
Thank you.

582
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:12,319
You guys can continue.

583
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:13,519
I feel unwell.

584
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:14,839
I'll go to sleep first.

585
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:24,480
I just dropped by to take a look.

586
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:26,599
Since she wants to rest, I...

587
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:28,039
I'll leave first.

588
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:29,519
I'll leave the things here.

589
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,799
Mr. Xie.

590
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,000
You're Xie Yi's brother-in-law.

591
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,200
But you're leaving already?

592
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,079
Other people

593
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,440
will think that we lack hospitality.

594
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,519
This is the fruit juice

595
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,759
I've just made for Xie Yi.

596
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,240
If you don't mind,

597
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,319
you can sit down

598
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,680
and we can have a chat.

599
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,279
Alright.

600
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:53,559
Have a seat.

601
00:27:59,119 --> 00:27:59,839
Try this.

602
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,240
Mr. Li.

603
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:04,440
I've personally witnessed your sincerity

604
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:05,359
towards Xie Yi

605
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:06,839
during this period.

606
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,039
To be honest,

607
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,079
I'm happy for her.

608
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:12,240
Mr. Xie, you're actually
giving me your blessing?

609
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:15,079
I don't think I'm used to that.

610
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:19,599
To be honest,

611
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,200
before this, I felt a sense of hostility

612
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:24,599
from you somehow.

613
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,480
I wish to explain the situation

614
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,839
to you right now.

615
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:29,960
Actually, you'd misunderstood me.

616
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,839
My feelings for Xie Yi

617
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:33,319
aren't what you think they are.

618
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,960
Two years ago,
when Uncle Shen passed away,

619
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:41,599
Xie Qing lost her mind.

620
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,119
Xie Yi lost her memories as well.

621
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:46,720
And I became

622
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,920
the only kin they could rely on.

623
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:53,079
For the past two years,
I've gotten used to the life

624
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:53,880
where the three of us

625
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:55,240
relied on each other for a living.

626
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:57,880
Xie Qing's illness

627
00:28:58,599 --> 00:28:59,960
always strikes without notice.

628
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:01,400
Although I look strong on the surface,

629
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:02,519
actually,

630
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,400
I do feel depressed sometimes.

631
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,440
Xie Yi's existence

632
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:10,319
is a huge consolation to me.

633
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:12,319
That's why, as time passes,

634
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,720
I did develop

635
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,119
a sense of reliance on her.

636
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:17,200
But I know very well.

637
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,559
The only one I truly need is Xie Qing.

638
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:23,920
If she never returns here,

639
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:29,960
I'll never be happy.

640
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:40,680
Mr. Xie,

641
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,839
in psychology, we call this

642
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:49,000
the transference effect.

643
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,359
Actually, I think

644
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:53,599
it's good

645
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:54,640
that you understand

646
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:56,799
what you're thinking.

647
00:29:58,759 --> 00:29:59,799
But let me remind you.

648
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,440
You need to treat Xie Yi well.

649
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,480
Although I'm her brother-in-law,

650
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:04,960
I can be counted as her elder brother.

651
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,480
If you dare to bully her,

652
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,599
I'll make things difficult for you.

653
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:11,640
But what if

654
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:13,200
she bullies me in the future?

655
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:14,799
Should I go to you?

656
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:15,640
Sure.

657
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,880
Try it.

658
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,240
It's pretty fresh.

659
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,440
You made this for Xie Yi,

660
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:24,240
so I'll skip it.

661
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,680
I still have things to do.

662
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,799
I'll return first.

663
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,519
I'll go and call Xie Yi then.

664
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:30,200
No need for that.

665
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,559
Just let her rest.

666
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,000
Mr. Li, you don't need to see me off.
See you.

667
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:36,640
See you, Mr. Xie.

668
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,519
(Just you wait.)

669
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,599
(I'll make you)

670
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:57,680
(stay by my side forever.)

671
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,960
What's wrong, Xie Yi?

672
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,240
You looked upset just now.

673
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:19,440
It's nothing.

674
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,039
My jaw was in pain
after the tooth extraction.

675
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:22,960
I'm fine now.

676
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,160
Really?

677
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,319
I'm glad then.

678
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:28,920
Here,

679
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:30,400
the fruit juice I made for you.

680
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,839
Try it.

681
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,519
It's fresh, right?

682
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:39,960
But

683
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:41,960
I think you put too much water.

684
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:44,200
I'll take note of it next time.

685
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,039
Mr. Li,

686
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:51,119
following your instruction,

687
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:52,000
I've investigated

688
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,440
every dossier of Zhiwei Corporation.

689
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,200
I found

690
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,559
something strange.

691
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,599
Speak.

692
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,200
Ever since its founding,

693
00:31:58,359 --> 00:31:59,279
Zhiwei Corporation

694
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,839
has been developing at a steady rate.

695
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:02,319
But after they changed

696
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:03,960
their food supplier

697
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,200
to a company

698
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,880
called Yunxiao Fishery,

699
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:08,640
their performance declined.

700
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:10,319
Yunxiao Fishery

701
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:12,000
had signed a three-year contract

702
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,279
with Zhiwei Corporation.

703
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,000
But the cash remittance

704
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,880
doesn't match

705
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:17,200
their delivery orders at all.

706
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,319
That means they'd transferred
the money to them,

707
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:20,799
but the goods didn't reach
the warehouse.

708
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,799
And this company

709
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,559
has gone bankrupt two years ago.

710
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:24,440
Go and investigate

711
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:25,599
the owner of this company.

712
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,839
This is very important.

713
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:28,000
Alright.

714
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,160
Mr. Li,

715
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:30,799
if the goods didn't reach the warehouse,

716
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:32,400
I think Shen Xie Qing
should know about this.

717
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:33,519
Great timing.

718
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,039
Xie Yi and I

719
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,599
will visit Xie Qing tomorrow.

720
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,680
Continue your investigation.

721
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,519
Report to me immediately
if anything happens.

722
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,039
My sister is over there.

723
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,759
I'm here.

724
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:13,119
Xie Qing,

725
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:14,680
I'm here to see you.

726
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:16,680
I brought you

727
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:18,359
your favorite mung bean cakes.

728
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:22,559
Wedding gown.

729
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:25,720
My wedding gown looks great.

730
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:27,200
This is her wedding gown?

731
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:28,240
That's right.

732
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:29,319
This is the wedding gown

733
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:30,480
Xie Qing had ordered.

734
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,359
It's a pity that she fell sick

735
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,599
before the wedding could proceed.

736
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:36,200
I think this must be

737
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:37,519
her biggest regret in life.

738
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,680
Xie Qing,

739
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,359
this is my boyfriend.

740
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:48,680
His name is Li Ze Liang.

741
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,839
I think Ming Hao

742
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:51,279
had already told you.

743
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:53,039
The culprit behind
Zhiwei Corporation's demise

744
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,519
is Huo Jian.

745
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:57,359
He has been arrested.

746
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:58,920
Ze Liang

747
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,400
has contributed a lot to this case.

748
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:02,480
Hello.

749
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,039
I'm Li Ze Liang.

750
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,319
In the future,

751
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,840
we'll be a family.

752
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,039
Xie Yi and I will visit you often.

753
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,400
We will always stay by your side.

754
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,559
Yan,

755
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,400
look after Xie Qing for me.

756
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,760
I'll extend her stay
in the hospital for her.

757
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:24,079
I don't think it's good for Ming Hao

758
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:24,840
to fork out all of her medical fees.

759
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,239
Go ahead.

760
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,719
Xie Qing,

761
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,039
Xie Yi often tells me

762
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,559
about your childhood stories with her.

763
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,119
She said although you two

764
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,280
didn't live together for a long time,

765
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,039
you always doted on her

766
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,360
and gave in to her.

767
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:01,840
You're the most important person

768
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,320
to Xie Yi.

769
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Now, I'm a part of your family as well.

770
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,000
I hope you can trust me.

771
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:17,800
When you wake up,

772
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,159
I have plenty of questions

773
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:21,519
for you.

774
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,150
(Li Ze Liang)
This is my business card.

775
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:39,599
You're welcome to contact me

776
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:41,400
if you remember anything.

777
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,800
I've put it in your pocket.

778
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:00,840
Xie Yi.

779
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,599
Ming Hao?

780
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,599
You're here as well?

781
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,320
Her stay in the hospital is almost over.

782
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:06,280
I'm here to extend it for her.

783
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:07,199
No need for that.

784
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,599
I've extended it for her.

785
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,800
Didn't I tell you already?

786
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:10,960
You don't need

787
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:11,559
to worry about

788
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:12,480
her medical fees

789
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:13,239
when I'm around.

790
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,679
Although Xie Qing is your fiancee,

791
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,280
I'm her little sister.

792
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,639
This is my job.

793
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:21,239
Let's go.

794
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,400
Let's go to Xie Qing.

795
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:23,840
Yan is here as well.

796
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:24,840
Okay.

797
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:32,239
Huo Jian has been arrested.

798
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,199
Xie Yi is very happy now.

799
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,239
But I don't know

800
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:37,559
if I should tell her about this.

801
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,400
I'm afraid

802
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,119
this matter isn't over yet.

803
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:45,559
Before this, I comforted her.

804
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,360
Now, I think I should remind her.

805
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:54,039
If only you were awake.

806
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:56,079
If you're awake,

807
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,840
you could tell me

808
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,159
the true reason

809
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:01,000
behind Zhiwei Corporation's bankruptcy.

810
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:10,880
Zhiwei?

811
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,039
Zhiwei?

812
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:15,760
Do you remember something?

813
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:16,679
It wasn't me.

814
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:17,440
Xie Qing.

815
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:18,920
Xie...

816
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,519
Xie Qing!

817
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:22,199
Don't come near me!

818
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,440
Xie Qing, calm down!

819
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:23,920
No! It wasn't me!

820
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,519
Do you know something

821
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:25,199
about Zhiwei Corporation's bankruptcy?

822
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:26,159
Don't touch me!

823
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,000
Xie Qing!

824
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,159
Do you know something about
Zhiwei Corporation's bankruptcy?

825
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,280
I don't know!

826
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,599
Do you know something about
the K of Spades?

827
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,480
Xie Qing!

828
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,679
Li Ze Liang!

829
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,880
What are you doing?

830
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:36,639
I don't know.

831
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,639
- I don't know.
- Xie Qing.

832
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,079
I don't know.

833
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,719
What exactly is going on?

834
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:44,360
I'm sorry.

835
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:45,880
I don't know

836
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,119
why she's acting like this.

837
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:48,119
It's fine now.

838
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:49,159
Don't blame me.

839
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:49,840
It's fine now.

840
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,719
Don't blame me.

841
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,280
Xie Qing's emotion
is unstable right now.

842
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:57,679
You guys should return first.

843
00:37:58,159 --> 00:37:59,000
I'll contact you guys later.

844
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:01,920
Okay.

845
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,119
Let's go.

846
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:16,239
It wasn't me.

847
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,280
It wasn't me!

848
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:20,320
It wasn't me!

849
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:23,880
It wasn't me!

850
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:25,519
Don't blame me!

851
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,599
Don't blame me!

852
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:28,400
Xie Qing,

853
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,239
why do you start

854
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,719
to spout nonsense now?

855
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,440
You promised me

856
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,199
that you'd keep our secret.

857
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,519
Secret!

858
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,880
Seems like I have to take you

859
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,119
somewhere safer.

860
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,639
Here you go.

861
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:00,239
Xie Yi,

862
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,000
when did Xie Qing

863
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,800
arrive at your house?

864
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,159
She was adopted

865
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,239
when she was several months old.

866
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:07,840
Back then, my parents

867
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,199
couldn't give birth to a child.

868
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,840
They gave birth to me after a few years.

869
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,639
But my parents

870
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,880
treated us

871
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:15,280
equally.

872
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,920
Xie Qing

873
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,760
also treated me like her true sister.

874
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:21,960
I can see that.

875
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,559
They actually let her

876
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:24,760
control Zhiwei's purse strings.

877
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:25,800
That means

878
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,679
they trusted her completely.

879
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,159
I feel guilty now that I think about it.

880
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,719
In the past, I stayed abroad.

881
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,360
Xie Qing was the one
who accompanied my dad

882
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:37,199
and shared his burden with him.

883
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,039
When Zhiwei Corporation was
first established,

884
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:40,000
it was very tough.

885
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,360
Xie Qing had hypoglycemia.

886
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:44,840
She fainted several times
because of work.

887
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:46,840
She didn't dare to tell my dad
or me about it.

888
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,239
She was afraid that we might
be worried about him.

889
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:54,880
Yan,

890
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:57,119
do you remember the wish I made

891
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,360
when I went for the tooth extraction?

892
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,360
Are you going to tell me about it now?

893
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,760
Regarding that wish,

894
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:07,000
not only does it include us,

895
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,440
but it also includes Xie Qing.

896
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:10,679
I hope that Xie Qing

897
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,880
can recover as soon as possible

898
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,760
and attend our wedding.

899
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:16,440
It's best if she and Ming Hao

900
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:18,039
can hold their wedding together with us.

901
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:19,760
Wouldn't it be great?

902
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:23,840
(I...)

903
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:25,039
(I won't go back!)

904
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,639
Don't touch me!

905
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,480
No!

906
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:29,239
No!

907
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,760
What's the matter? Let me see.

908
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,880
(Yan.)

909
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:34,119
Yan?

910
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:37,119
What's the matter?

911
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:39,760
What are you hesitating about?

912
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,239
If you don't marry me,

913
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:43,719
I'll become a nun.

914
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,880
It's not that.

915
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:48,000
I was just

916
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,559
reminded of Xie Qing's painting.

917
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,840
It was pretty sorrowful.

918
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,119
You have to shave your head
to become a nun.

919
00:40:57,519 --> 00:40:58,280
Do you dare to do so?

920
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,800
Of course, I do.

921
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:01,599
I shaved my head before
when I was young.

922
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:03,519
Are you serious?

923
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,480
When?

924
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,440
When we were young, Ming Hao
was being bullied by someone.

925
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,519
I blocked

926
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:10,079
the incoming rock for him.

927
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,079
After that, a crack appeared on my head.

928
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:14,239
To do the suturing better,

929
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,880
he shaved my head.

930
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:19,079
(Mr. Xie,)

931
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,599
you've been taking care of Xie Qing
for so many years.

932
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,280
It's touching indeed.

933
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,480
It's just that I'm curious about this.

934
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:28,039
Did you take care of Xie Qing

935
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:29,599
out of love

936
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:31,440
or responsibility?

937
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:32,599
You still don't understand

938
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,840
our story, right?

939
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,639
Back then, right after school,

940
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,320
I was bullied by several hooligans.

941
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:42,440
Suddenly, her small figure

942
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,559
appeared right in front of me.

943
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,519
Not only did she scold them,

944
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,000
but she also blocked

945
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:49,199
the rocks they threw in my direction.

946
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:50,880
There was a crack on her head

947
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,119
and she was bleeding a lot.

948
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,679
To do the suturing better,

949
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:57,960
he even shaved her head.
