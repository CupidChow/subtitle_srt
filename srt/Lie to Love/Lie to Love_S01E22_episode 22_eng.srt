00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:25,000
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,410
♫  Still haunts me now and then in quiet nights  ♫

4
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:41,230
♫  And turn to face all the long lost times  ♫

5
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,370
♫  Brace the pain  ♫

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:51,090
♫  Let memories wake up from oceans deep  ♫

7
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,250
♫  No place to hide  ♫

8
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,450
♫  No way to run  ♫

9
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,820
♫  New dawn counts down  ♫

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,930
♫  I fight  ♫

11
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,010
♫  I cry  ♫

12
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,600
♫  I give up  ♫

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:14,810
♫  Memories forgotten, forsaken surround  ♫

14
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:23,930
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

15
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:32,270
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

16
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:40,850
♫  Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

17
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:49,620
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

18
00:01:49,620 --> 00:02:00,050

19
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,950

20
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,439
Xieyi just went for a tooth extraction. I'm sure she can't make it.

21
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:08,800
I must keep Xieqing company.

22
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,520
Si Xieyi went to visit Xieqing?

23
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,219
What's their relationship?

24
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,280
I don't think this is a secret anymore.

25
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,360
Xieqing is Xieyi's elder sister.

26
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,060
Actually, Xieyi is Uncle Shen's biological daughter.

27
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,580
What?

28
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,700
Xieqing was actually adopted.

29
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,479
Xieyi went overseas together with her mother when she was young.

30
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:34,599
That's why only a few people know about this.

31
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,520
Uncle Shen had told his wife as well.

32
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,319
If there are two children, one of them will have his surname.

33
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:41,100
The other one will have his wife's surname.

34
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,478
After they adopted Xieqing,

35
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:45,862
Xieyi had her mother's surname.

36
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,279
It's getting late. I'll be off first.

37
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,899
All right.

38
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,800
Su Xieyi is the daughter of Shen Zhihong?

39
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:43,379
Come in.

40
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:54,880
What's the matter, Chuchu?

41
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:58,280
I have a question.

42
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,379
And I think it's better for me to ask you directly.

43
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,459
What question?

44
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:12,440
Back then, when you told me to fire Su Xieyi, you said it was because of your relationship.

45
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,120
That wasn't true, right?

46
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,240
Why are you suddenly asking this?

47
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:22,539
I just got to know that Su Xieyi is Shen Zhihong's daughter.

48
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:27,839
If that's the case, I think I know why she did what she had done when she joined Ocean Hotel.

49
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,439
So...

50
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:33,679
I wish to know the true reason behind her sacking.

51
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,380
If you can't say it out, I'll say it out for you.

52
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:45,579
Back then, when Zhiwei Corporation cooperated with us,

53
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:47,659
as they were suspected of commercial fraud,

54
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:51,519
they had no choice to compensate Ocean Hotel with an exorbitant price.

55
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,360
And this was the main reason why Zhiwei Corporation went bankrupt

56
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:57,440
and why Shen Zhihong committed suicide.

57
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,779
And you,

58
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:03,260
you were the person in charge of the project.

59
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,620
That's right.

60
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,639
When Xieyi first joined Ocean Hotel, she did so to investigate the truth.

61
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,320
Of course, that includes investigating me.

62
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:22,199
So she had an ulterior motive for approaching you in the first place.

63
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,839
That's the true reason behind her sacking, right?

64
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,539
Chuchu,

65
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:29,840
this case is very complicated.

66
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,909
On the one hand,

67
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,800
I don't want her to disrupt my plan on how to deal with Huo Jian.

68
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,199
On the other hand, I do feel guilty

69
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,439
when Uncle Shen committed suicide.

70
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,000
I asked Su Xieyi to leave the company in order to protect her.

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,140
Li Zeliang,

72
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,000
you're actually trying to protect a woman who suspected you

73
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,459
and even tried to harm you?

74
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:55,319
Our relationship started before the incident with Zhiwei Corporation.

75
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:58,399
That's why our relationship is sincere and pure.

76
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,559
We've investigated the case. Huo Jian was the mastermind.

77
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:05,460
But Zhiwei Corporation was purchased by Ocean Hotel after all.

78
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,460
And Huo Jian is your uncle.

79
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,220
How could you be sure that she has forgotten about her initial motive?

80
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,219
Chuchu, I know it's difficult for you to trust Su Xieyi completely.

81
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:20,639
That's why, you just need to trust my judgment.

82
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,460
Zeliang, I hope that you won't let your relationship blind your judgment.

83
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,439
No matter when it is, you should leave some leeway for yourself.

84
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:33,580
It's because your interest is Ocean Hotel's interest.

85
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:38,619
And Ocean Hotel's interest is the interest of me and all the other employees.

86
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,179
I know that.

87
00:06:42,179 --> 00:06:44,099
I'm glad that you know that.

88
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:56,480
Lawyer Xie, this way, please.

89
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,419
Please wait a moment.

90
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:22,460
Director Dai, your client is here.

91
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,620
What kind of lousy rod is this? Get me a telescopic fishing rod!

92
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,139
I want to catch a big fish.

93
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,899
Director Dai, you're using a telescopic fishing rod.

94
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,180

95
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,700
What did you say?

96
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,160
I'll remember that. I'll change it for you next time.

97
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,660
Go now.

98
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,780
Lawyer Xie, it's been a while.

99
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,560
Yes. Director Dai, looks like you're enjoying yourself.

100
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,079
Lawyer Xie, I once admired you.

101
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:08,120
But you just had to work for Ocean Hotel.

102
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,680
I heard that you wanted to cooperate with me.

103
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,839
Do you think I will use the same lawyer as Ocean Hotel?

104
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:15,339
That's right.

105
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,280
Zhengde Hotel has always been at odds with Ocean Hotel.

106
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,980
Ocean Hotel won against Zhengde Hotel in the case with Fujiade last time.

107
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:27,160
Director Dai, I'm sure you won't just lie down and take it in.

108
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,559
Are you teasing me?

109
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,159
Director Dai, I'm glad that you're angry.

110
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,420
Zhengde Hotel has been suppressed by Ocean Hotel for many years.

111
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,120
I couldn't stand it any longer.

112
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,639
What do you plan to do?

113
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:56,200
You wish to topple Ocean Hotel even in your dreams, right?

114
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,499
I can help you out.

115
00:08:57,499 --> 00:08:58,580
You?

116
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,080
Me.

117
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,980
Director Dai, the Chairman of Ocean Hotel, Huo Jian, was just thrown into prison.

118
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,120
This has caused a huge impact on the industry.

119
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,739
The market has lost confidence in Ocean Hotel now.

120
00:09:10,739 --> 00:09:13,620
Under Huo Jian's management, Ocean Hotel may seem perfect,

121
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,250
in reality, it's riddled with holes.

122
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:18,620
They don't have good cash flow.

123
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:27,079
You're a professional commercial lawyer indeed. Continue.

124
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:28,679
A great man cannot brook a rival.

125
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:32,060
Zhengde Hotel and Ocean Hotel will have a desperate battle eventually.

126
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,620
If they fight each other,

127
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,919
only a limited number of chances and weaknesses will be revealed.

128
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:41,010
If you cannot cherish your opportunity

129
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:44,760
and strike when your opponent gives you the chance to do so,

130
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,200
you'll be defeated in the end.

131
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,480
But since you wish to cooperate with me,

132
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,100
you can't just come empty-handed, right?

133
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,839
If you wish to catch a big fish, you need to prepare a great lure.

134
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:59,860
Director Dai, you're right.

135
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,760
The lure is here.

136
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,059
Lantian Bay?

137
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:07,039
Isn't this Ocean Hotel's most important project?

138
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,099
Will they be able to proceed with the project after Huo Jian's arrest?

139
00:10:10,099 --> 00:10:12,200
Li Zeliang just took over his position.

140
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,759
He's desperate to raise their morale.

141
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,699
Lantian Bay will be his best choice.

142
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:19,999
But he has to wager his entire asset as well.

143
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:26,640
So once the Lantian Bay project is canceled, it'll be a fatal blow to Ocean Hotel.

144
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,579
You got the point.

145
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,639
So how do you plan to help me?

146
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:39,320
On this price list, there are many places where they have cut corners.

147
00:10:39,979 --> 00:10:42,060
Flip it.

148
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,000
Li Zeliang wishes to proceed with it.

149
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,458
But once this price list is revealed to the public,

150
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:52,940
Lantian Bay will become the bomb that Li Zeliang had lit himself.

151
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,720
Your lure is great.

152
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,120
Director Dai. The fee I'm charging for this is much higher than a lawyer's fee.

153
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,659
Fee?

154
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,360
You want money?

155
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,600
You should've told me earlier. That's easy.

156
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,600
We can negotiate a deal.

157
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:15,320
So is this a deal?

158
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:19,219
It's almost time. Time to set sail.

159
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:24,759
We can talk about it after the fish has been enticed by the lure.

160
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:26,259
See you.

161
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:38,700
 This is very excruciating.

162
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,247
 Things to take note of after amputation If it gets worse, we'll have no choice

163
00:11:41,247 --> 00:11:46,119
 but to target the upper part and do a second amputation.

164
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:48,799
 Yan always walks with his prosthetic leg at home.

165
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:51,219
 This will worsen his condition.

166
00:11:51,219 --> 00:11:53,260
 I need to think of something.

167
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,699
Xieyi?

168
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,460
Xieyi?

169
00:12:36,859 --> 00:12:38,459
Xieyi?

170
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,280
You're back?

171
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,419
Just in time.

172
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:47,319
What are you doing?

173
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:50,240
Look. I made this.

174
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,679
And over here.

175
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:59,660
This way, you can move without using your prosthetic leg by using these handles.

176
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,320
Do you know what's the best thing about it?

177
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,299
Step back a little.

178
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,700
This way, you can enter and exit the kitchen at will.

179
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,679
What do you think?

180
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:36,379
Aren't I amazing?

181
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:41,459
What's wrong?

182
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:43,359
Why are you keeping quiet?

183
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:45,919
Were you too touched?

184
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,420
Sorry.

185
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,180
Why are you apologizing to me all of a sudden?

186
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:59,479
I just...

187
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,939
I just think that I don't have enough time.

188
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,160
I don't know what I can do

189
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,340
to make you realize how precious you are to me.

190
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:13,860
I don't know what to do

191
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:17,980
for me to make up for the past two years without you.

192
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,039
Xieyi,

193
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,920
thank you.

194
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,740
Thank you for not forgetting me.

195
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:34,199
Thank you for everything.

196
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:37,039
Why are you saying that all of a sudden?

197
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:41,540
I'm also happy that I can do these things for you.

198
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,420
Thank you.

199
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,900
Look at you.

200
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,620
Your face is all dirty.

201
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,100
Where is it?

202
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,240
What do you mean?

203
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,999
It's...

204
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,860
I mean a kiss.

205
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,700
I was planning to kiss you.

206
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,999
But I controlled myself.

207
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:34,479
But why?

208
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:36,519
It's because your tooth hasn't recovered yet.

209
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,960
I was afraid that it might be painful for you.

210
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,960
It won't be.

211
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,220
How dare you laugh?

212
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:52,399
By the way, I still have one handle to install in the corridor.

213
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,340
I forgot to take this.

214
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,700
Wait for me. I'll be done in a second.

215
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,420
I'll wait for you.

216
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,679
Xieyi, I'll go to work now.

217
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:30,479
Wait a minute.

218
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,620
Take this. You can eat it on your way there.

219
00:16:36,776 --> 00:16:37,620
Thank you.

220
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,960
Xieyi, our company is going to restart the Lantian Bay project.

221
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,379
I might get busier.

222
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:45,780
Even if I'm back home,

223
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,840
I'm afraid I can't keep accompanying you.

224
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,120
You mustn't blame me for this.

225
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,279
Do I look that insensible to you?

226
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,840
You just need to focus on your work. Leave the logistic support to me.

227
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,320
Okay.

228
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,120
You too.

229
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,440
You should let your tooth recover.

230
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,520
After that, I'll take you to have some good food.

231
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,159
Okay.

232
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,780
Goodbye.

233
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,580
Be careful on the way.

234
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,059
See you.

235
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:27,450
♫  Listen to the stars  ♫

236
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:32,780
♫  They tell me every night the stories of your past  ♫

237
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,530
♫  Your shadows, your brokenness   ♫

238
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:40,010
♫  I'm sorry I wasn't there for you  ♫

239
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:42,310
♫  Listen to my heart  ♫

240
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:47,550
♫  If I can grow a piece of feather on every scar  ♫

241
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:51,330
♫  Then I'd have such wings  ♫

242
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,630
♫  To fly up to the sky  ♫

243
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:58,520
♫  Even if I'll melt away  ♫

244
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,970
♫  To give you love  ♫

245
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:21,780
♫  No one ever asked the sun if he wants to rest  ♫

246
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:27,420
♫  Day and night, he burns so silently  ♫

247
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,950
♫  You've provided the world with a thousand colors  ♫

248
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,540
♫  And me a thousand joys  ♫

249
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:39,800
♫  Though it pierces my eyes to look your way  ♫

250
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,980
♫  I won't move my gaze away  ♫

251
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:48,670
♫  To show you I care  ♫

252
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,400
♫  Listen to the stars  ♫

253
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,700
♫  They tell me every night the stories of your past  ♫

254
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,450
♫  Your shadows, your brokenness  ♫

255
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,800
♫  I'm sorry I wasn't there for you  ♫

256
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,727
Xieyi, for the Lantian Bay project,

257
00:19:07,728 --> 00:19:09,699
I plan to install home automation for each of them.

258
00:19:09,699 --> 00:19:15,039
Although the cost will be higher, this is the trend of the future.

259
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,360
What do you think?

260
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,359
 What did you say? Come closer. I can't hear you.

261
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:22,540
♫  Even if I'll melt away  ♫

262
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:28,060
I said I'd install home automation for the Lantian Bay project. What do you think?

263
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,920
 I can't hear you. Come closer.

264
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,900
I said I'm going to install home automation...

265
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,960
 I said, for the Lantian Bay project...

266
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,000
 To heck with Lantian Bay.

267
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,880
 We'll talk about that after the bath.

268
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:58,079
That concludes the Lantian Bay Resort development project.

269
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,979
Since everyone has agreed with it, next, we will follow this proposal

270
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:05,639
and proceed with Lantian Bay's development at full speed.

271
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,420
   My tooth has recovered. I want to have a feast today.

272
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,580
Dismissed.

273
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,270

274
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:37,580
This smells so nice.

275
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:40,860
The glutton in my tummy is awake from smelling this.

276
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,680
Hurry and dig in.

277
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,340
Mr. Li?

278
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:55,079
I think I should call you Chairman Li now.

279
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:57,599
I didn't expect us to encounter each other here.

280
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:59,839
Are you dating your secretary?

281
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:03,939
Director Dai, this is my girlfriend.

282
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,700
So she's Sister-in-law?

283
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,819
Sister-in-law, you look kind enough. But you must be careful.

284
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:17,159
Chairman Li has a weird habit

285
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:19,079
of stealing other people's things.

286
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:20,580
First, he stole my things.

287
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,940
After that, he stole his uncle's things.

288
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,279
Sister-in-law, don't tell me he stole you from someone else as well?

289
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:34,160
Director Dai, you don't need to worry about my girlfriend.

290
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,880
I suggest you spend more time handling Zhengde Hotel.

291
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,079
I suggest you spend more time handling Ocean Hotel.

292
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:45,147
Now that Huo Jian is arrested, it'll be tough for Ocean Hotel.

293
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,240
You need to take care of yourself so that I can finish you off myself.

294
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,180
Alright. I'll stop bothering you guys then.

295
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,979
You guys can continue.

296
00:22:00,379 --> 00:22:03,340
It smells weird. Enjoy your meal.

297
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:07,779
Eat up.

298
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,620
Who is that? Why is he so arrogant?

299
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,980
He's Director Dai from Zhengde Group. He's Dai Ziang.

300
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:20,999
A'Yan, now that I think about it, you just took over as the chairman.

301
00:22:20,999 --> 00:22:24,340
The company and the people of the industry are keeping a close eye on you.

302
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,799
The Lantian Bay project is so important.

303
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,119
And now, Director Dai has his eyes on you.

304
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:31,179
I wish to return to the company and help you.

305
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,140
Sure. Great timing.

306
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:40,440
How could I leave my good wife behind when I'm trying to expand my territory?

307
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,940
When do you plan to join us?

308
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,400
I've rested for a few days since extracting my tooth.

309
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:50,240
I'll visit my sister tomorrow. I can go to work after that.

310
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,319
Great.

311
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:56,939
Speaking of which, I've never accompanied you to visit your sister before.

312
00:22:56,939 --> 00:22:59,599
How about this? I'll join you tomorrow.

313
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:01,399
Great.

314
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:06,580
It's time for my future husband to know my sister.

315
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,219
Dig in.

316
00:23:09,379 --> 00:23:12,799
Here. All these crab roes are yours.

317
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:19,299
Come.

318
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,940
Lawyer Xie? You're pretty punctual.

319
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,959
Director Dai, I don't dare to be late when I'm meeting you.

320
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:32,160
Seems like you're in a good mood. Do you have good news for me?

321
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,259
Director Dai, the fish has taken the bait.

322
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:39,240
They've proceeded with the Lantian Bay project. Your chance is here.

323
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,959
Are you serious? That fast?

324
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:45,080
Come on. Finish it for me.

325
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,880
Come on. Tell me about it.

326
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,519
How did you do it?

327
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:52,400
I told you before, Li Zeliang just took over the position.

328
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,040
Regarding the Lantian Bay project... How dare you deceive me?

329
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:58,219
I've done my investigation! Li Zeliang's girlfriend is Su Xieyi.

330
00:23:58,219 --> 00:24:00,079
And you're her brother-in-law.

331
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:02,359
Speak. What's your motive?

332
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:06,160
If I discover that you and Li Zeliang are trying to trick me,

333
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,820
I'll feed you to the fish right now.

334
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:11,660
I'm not deceiving you.

335
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,740
Why are you helping me to harm your sister-in-law's man?

336
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,159
It's because he stole my woman.

337
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,359
I love Su Xieyi.

338
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:36,059
I took care of her sister because I hoped she could stay by my side.

339
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:38,839
I didn't expect her to be together with Li Zeliang

340
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:41,439
after all I'd done for her.

341
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,340
I hate him.

342
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,313
My hatred for him is much stronger than yours.

343
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:52,079
Are you serious?

344
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:54,559
There's only one man we should feed to the fish.

345
00:24:55,459 --> 00:24:57,580
That is Li Zeliang.

346
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:07,020
You darned pervert! How dare you fall in love with your own sister-in-law?

347
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:09,519
But I like it.

348
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:14,820
Look at you. You're spending so much effort to topple Li Zeliang for the sake of a woman. Do you think it's worth it?

349
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:18,540
Since young, those who hindered me must pay the price.

350
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:22,100
He should've understood that long ago.

351
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:25,559
There's plenty of fish in the sea.

352
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:28,719
I have plenty of women with me. You can pick whoever you like.

353
00:25:28,719 --> 00:25:30,859
Come on. Come here.

354
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:33,519
My secretary is pretty good.

355
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:36,279
Director Dai, Su Xieyi will surely return to me.

356
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:39,100
And she'll return to me voluntarily.

357
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:43,500
Are you that confident in yourself?

358
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:49,140
But that Li Zeliang is pretty hard to deal with.

359
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,259
Director Dai, don't worry.

360
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:53,859
Besides the Lantian Bay project,

361
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:56,259
I still have two trump cards under my sleeves.

362
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:02,280
The two most important women beside him,

363
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,439
Su Xieyi and Shi Chuchu.

364
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:07,830
Su Xieyi and Shi Chuchu? Su...

365
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,010
Su Xieyi is your sister-in-law.

366
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:11,400
It's possible for you to use her.

367
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,499
But according to my knowledge, Shi Chuchu is Li Zeliang's best friend.

368
00:26:15,499 --> 00:26:16,799
Why must she help you?

369
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,419
All humans have weaknesses.

370
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:23,480
Shi Chuchu's biggest weakness is her love for Li Zeliang.

371
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,820
She wishes to get Li Zeliang while I wish to get Su Xieyi.

372
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:31,099
With that reason alone, we can cooperate with each other.

373
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,660
Get on the boat.

374
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:45,419
Xieyi.

375
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:46,559
Why are you here?

376
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,259
Who's there?

377
00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:52,919
It's Brother Minghao.

378
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:54,980
Let him come in.

379
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,939
Please come in.

380
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:05,400
Lawyer Xie, what brings you here?

381
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,759
I heard that Xieyi had just gone for a tooth extraction.

382
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:10,079
I bought some supplements and I came to visit her.

383
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:11,559
Thank you.

384
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:13,799
You guys can continue.  I feel unwell.

385
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,739
I'll go to sleep first.

386
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:25,080
I just dropped by to take a look.

387
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,299
Since she wants to rest, I... I'll leave first.

388
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:30,319
I'll leave the things here.

389
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,520
Lawyer Xie.

390
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,459
You're Xieyi's brother-in-law. But you're leaving already?

391
00:27:38,459 --> 00:27:41,680
Other people will think that we lack hospitality.

392
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,900
This is the fruit juice I've just made for Xieyi.

393
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:50,860
If you don't mind, you can sit down, and we can have a chat.

394
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,280
All right.

395
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:54,259
Have a seat.

396
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:00,719
Try this.

397
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:07,059
Mr. Li. I've personally witnessed your sincerity towards Xieyi during this period.

398
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:10,019
To be honest, I'm happy for her.

399
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:13,040
Lawyer Xie, you're actually giving me your blessing?

400
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:15,879
I don't think I'm used to that.

401
00:28:18,899 --> 00:28:22,930
To be honest, before this,

402
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:25,400
I felt a sense of hostility from you somehow.

403
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,179
I wish to explain the situation to you right now.

404
00:28:28,179 --> 00:28:30,660
Actually, you'd misunderstood me.

405
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:34,119
My feelings for Xieyi aren't what you think they are.

406
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,660
Two years ago, when Uncle Shen passed away,

407
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:42,399
Xieqing lost her mind.

408
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,119
Xieyi lost her memories as well.

409
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:49,820
And I became the only kin they could rely on.

410
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:53,160
For the past two years, I've gotten used to the life

411
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,899
where the three of us relied on each other for a living.

412
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,319
Xieqing's illness always strikes without notice.

413
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:06,399
Although I look strong on the surface, actually, I do feel depressed sometimes.

414
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,759
Xieyi's existence is a huge consolation to me.

415
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:15,719
That's why, as time passes, I did develop a sense of reliance on her.

416
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:18,100
But I know very well.

417
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,459
The only one I truly need is Xieqing.

418
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,720
If she never returns here,

419
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:30,660
I'll never be happy.

420
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:41,559
Lawyer Xie,

421
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:49,700
in psychology, we call this the transference effect.

422
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:58,840
Actually, I think it's good that you understand what you're thinking.

423
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,000
But let me remind you.

424
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,140
You need to treat Xieyi well.

425
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:05,519
Although I'm her brother-in-law, I can be counted as her elder brother.

426
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:09,399
If you dare to bully her, I'll make things difficult for you.

427
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:13,899
But what if she bullies me in the future?

428
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:15,039
Should I go to you?

429
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,539
Sure.

430
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,360
Try it. It's pretty fresh.

431
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,960
You made this for Xieyi, so I'll skip it.

432
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,279
I still have things to do. I'll return first.

433
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,619
I'll go and call Xieyi then.

434
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:32,039
No need for that. Just let her rest.

435
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,700
Mr. Li, you don't need to see me off. See you.

436
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:37,640
See you, Lawyer Xie.

437
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,380
 Just you wait.

438
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,380
 I'll make you stay by my side forever.

439
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,060
What's wrong, Xieyi?

440
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:18,440
You looked upset just now.

441
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,319
It's nothing.

442
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:23,179
My jaw was in pain after the tooth extraction. I'm fine now.

443
00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:24,840
Really?

444
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,040
I'm glad then.

445
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:31,100
Here, the fruit juice I made for you.

446
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,420
Try it.

447
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,380
It's fresh, right?

448
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,860
But I think you put too much water.

449
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,900
I'll take note of it next time.

450
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:53,700
Mr. Li, following your instruction, I've investigated every dossier of Zhiwei Corporation.

451
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,880
-  I found something strange.  
 - Speak.

452
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,480
 Ever since its founding, Zhiwei Corporation

453
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,079
 has been developing at a steady rate.

454
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:05,400
But after they changed their food supplier to a company

455
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,739
called Yunxiao Fishery, their performance declined.

456
00:32:08,739 --> 00:32:13,460
Yunxiao Fishery had signed a three-year contract with Zhiwei Corporation.

457
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:17,780
But the cash remittance doesn't match their delivery orders at all.

458
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:20,859
That means they'd transferred the money to them, but the goods didn't reach the warehouse.

459
00:32:20,859 --> 00:32:24,039
And this company has gone bankrupt two years ago.

460
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:27,560
Go and investigate the owner of this company. This is very important.

461
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,979
Alright. Mr. Li, if the goods didn't reach the warehouse,

462
00:32:30,979 --> 00:32:32,799
I think Shen Xieqing should know about this.

463
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:37,180
Great timing. Xieyi and I will visit Xieqing tomorrow.

464
00:32:37,926 --> 00:32:41,320
Continue your investigation. Report to me immediately if anything happens.

465
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,839
My sister is over there.

466
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,560
I'm here.

467
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,580
Xieqing, I'm here to see you.

468
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,259
I brought you your favorite mung bean cakes.

469
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,399
Wedding gown.

470
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:26,239
My wedding gown looks great.

471
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:27,459
This is her wedding gown?

472
00:33:27,459 --> 00:33:31,759
That's right. This is the wedding gown Xieqing had ordered.

473
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:35,559
It's a pity that she fell sick before the wedding could proceed.

474
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:38,619
I think this must be her biggest regret in life.

475
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,599
Xieqing, this is my boyfriend.

476
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:49,100
His name is Li Zeliang.

477
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,559
I think Minghao had already told you.

478
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:55,819
The culprit behind Zhiwei Corporation's demise is Huo Jian.

479
00:33:55,819 --> 00:33:58,159
He has been arrested.

480
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,839
Zeliang has contributed a lot to this case.

481
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:04,900
Hello. I'm Li Zeliang.

482
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,500
In the future, we'll be a family.

483
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,400
Xieyi and I will visit you often.

484
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,420
We will always stay by your side.

485
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,819
A'Yan, look after Xieqing for me.

486
00:34:20,819 --> 00:34:23,039
I'll extend her stay in the hospital for her.

487
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:25,320
I don't think it's good for Brother Minghao to fork out all of her medical fees.

488
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,920
Go ahead.

489
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,840
Xieqing, Xieyi often tells me about your childhood stories with her.

490
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:56,060
She said although you two didn't live together for a long time,

491
00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:00,619
you always doted on her and gave in to her.

492
00:35:00,619 --> 00:35:04,899
You're the most important person to Xieyi.

493
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,900
Now, I'm a part of your family as well.

494
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,300
I hope you can trust me.

495
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:19,000
When you wake up,

496
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,519
I have plenty of questions for you.

497
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,739
This is my business card.

498
00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:42,200
You're welcome to contact me if you remember anything.

499
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,640
I've put it in your pocket.

500
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,859
Xieyi.

501
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:04,020
Brother Minghao? You're here as well?

502
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,699
Her stay in the hospital is almost over. I'm here to extend it for her.

503
00:36:06,699 --> 00:36:08,900
No need for that. I've extended it for her.

504
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,079
Didn't I tell you already?

505
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,759
You don't need to worry about her medical fees when I'm around.

506
00:36:14,759 --> 00:36:18,280
Although Xieqing is your fiancee, I'm her little sister.

507
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,739
This is my job.

508
00:36:20,739 --> 00:36:22,719
Let's go. Let's go to Xieqing.

509
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:24,280
A'Yan is here as well.

510
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,880
Okay.

511
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,839
Huo Jian has been arrested.

512
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:35,499
Xieyi is very happy now.

513
00:36:35,499 --> 00:36:38,359
But I don't know if I should tell her about this.

514
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:43,100
I'm afraid this matter isn't over yet.

515
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,259
Before this, I comforted her.

516
00:36:46,259 --> 00:36:50,360
Now, I think I should remind her.

517
00:36:52,459 --> 00:36:55,139
If only you were awake.

518
00:36:55,139 --> 00:36:58,500
If you're awake, you could tell me

519
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,400
the true reason behind Zhiwei Corporation's bankruptcy.

520
00:37:09,739 --> 00:37:11,380
Zhiwei?

521
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,339
Zhiwei?

522
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:15,839
Do you remember something?

523
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,579
- It wasn't me. 
 - Xieqing.

524
00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:20,939
Xie...

525
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:22,300
- Xieqing! 
 - Don't come near me!

526
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,120
- Xieqing, calm down! 
 - No! It wasn't me!

527
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,419
Do you know something about Zhiwei Corporation's bankruptcy?

528
00:37:25,419 --> 00:37:27,119
- Don't touch me! 
 - Xieqing!

529
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,181
- Do you know something about Zhiwei Corporation's bankruptcy? 
 - I don't know!

530
00:37:29,181 --> 00:37:30,940
Do you know something about the K of Spades?

531
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:34,000
- Xieqing! 
 - Li Zeliang!

532
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,260
What are you doing?

533
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,780
- I don't know. I don't know. 
 - Xieqing.

534
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,440
I don't know.

535
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,619
What exactly is going on?

536
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:45,539
I'm sorry.

537
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:47,559
I don't know why she's acting like this.

538
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:51,980
- It's fine now. 
 - Don't blame me.

539
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,699
Xieqing's emotion is unstable right now.

540
00:37:56,699 --> 00:37:58,159
You guys should return first.

541
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:00,279
I'll contact you guys later.

542
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,679
Okay.

543
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,820
Let's go.

544
00:38:15,619 --> 00:38:17,419
It wasn't me.

545
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,299
It wasn't me! It wasn't me!

546
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:24,580
It wasn't me!

547
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:27,679
Don't blame me!

548
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:29,499
Xieqing,

549
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:33,119
why do you start to spout nonsense now?

550
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,940
You promised me that you'd keep our secret.

551
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,380
Secret!

552
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:48,119
Seems like I have to take you somewhere safer.

553
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,460
Here you go.

554
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:03,500
Xieyi, when did Xieqing arrive at your house?

555
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,619
She was adopted when she was several months old.

556
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:09,580
Back then, my parents couldn't give birth to a child.

557
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,940
They gave birth to me after a few years.

558
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,880
But my parents treated us equally.

559
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,460
Xieqing also treated me like her true sister.

560
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:22,400
I can see that.

561
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,159
They actually let her control Zhiwei's purse strings.

562
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:28,579
That means they trusted her completely.

563
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,020
I feel guilty now that I think about it.

564
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,060
In the past, I stayed abroad.

565
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:37,540
Xieqing was the one who accompanied my dad and shared his burden with him.

566
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,360
When Zhiwei Corporation was first established, it was very tough.

567
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,419
Xieqing had hypoglycemia.

568
00:39:42,419 --> 00:39:45,079
She fainted several times because of work.

569
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:47,119
She didn't dare to tell my dad or me about it.

570
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,279
She was afraid that we might be worried about him.

571
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:59,420
A'Yan, do you remember the wish I made when I went for the tooth extraction?

572
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,299
Are you going to tell me about it now?

573
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,760
Regarding that wish, not only does it include us, but it also includes Xieqing.

574
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,560
I hope that Xieqing can recover as soon as possible and attend our wedding.

575
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,659
It's best if she and Bother Minghao can hold their wedding together with us.

576
00:40:18,659 --> 00:40:20,460
Wouldn't it be great?

577
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,440
 I... I won't go back!

578
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,100
 Don't touch me!

579
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,460
 No! No!

580
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,020
 What's the matter? Let me see.

581
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:34,859
A'Yan. A'Yan?

582
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:38,399
What's the matter?

583
00:40:38,399 --> 00:40:40,420
What are you hesitating about?

584
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:45,019
If you don't marry me, I'll become a nun.

585
00:40:45,019 --> 00:40:47,180
It's not that.

586
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:51,359
I was just reminded of Xieqing's painting.

587
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,640
It was pretty sorrowful.

588
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:59,019
You have to shave your head to become a nun. Do you dare to do so?

589
00:40:59,019 --> 00:41:02,639
Of course, I do. I shaved my head before when I was young.

590
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:04,760
Are you serious? When?

591
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,800
When we were young, Brother Minghao was being bullied by someone.

592
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,380
I blocked the incoming rock for him.

593
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,779
After that, a crack appeared on my head.

594
00:41:12,779 --> 00:41:16,980
To do the suturing better, he shaved my head.

595
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:21,740
 Lawyer Xie, you've been taking care of Xieqing for so many years.

596
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:24,380
 It's touching indeed.

597
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,239
 It's just that I'm curious about this.

598
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:32,040
 Did you take care of Xieqing out of love or responsibility?

599
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,578
 You still don't understand our story, right?

600
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,639
 Back then, right after school,

601
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:40,220
 I was bullied by several hooligans.

602
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:44,940
 Suddenly, her small figure appeared right in front of me.

603
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,219
 Not only did she scold them,

604
00:41:47,219 --> 00:41:49,519
 but she also blocked the rocks they threw in my direction.

605
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:53,019
 There was a crack on her head and she was bleeding a lot.

606
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,960
 To do the suturing better, he even shaved her head.

607
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,050
