=Episode 20=

19
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,079
Have you ever confessed your feelings?

20
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,959
A love confession?

21
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:09,840
Never mind.

22
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,960
Forget I asked.

23
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:12,960
Do you not trust me

24
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,039
in this matter, Mr. Li?

25
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,080
How many relationships have you had?

26
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,639
There you have it.

27
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,919
I'm going to the toilet.

28
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:28,639
Okay.

29
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,520
That was quick.

30
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,840
It's me.

31
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,199
Mr. Ji.

32
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,000
You can call me Ying Song.

33
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,080
Mr. Ying Song.

34
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,240
Have you ever been in a relationship?

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,080
Of course. I...

36
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,879
I've been in one, two, three...

37
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,719
Why should I tell you

38
00:02:58,719 --> 00:02:59,840
how many relationships I've had?

39
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,560
What kind of love confession
do you prefer?

40
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,560
Love confession?

41
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:05,599
You've dated before

42
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,960
so you must have received
love confessions.

43
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,159
What kind do you like?

44
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:10,800
Why are you

45
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,120
suddenly asking me this?

46
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,439
If you want to know,

47
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,199
you should think hard about it
on your own.

48
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,960
You shouldn't be so direct.

49
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:18,120
I couldn't figure it out.

50
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,360
That's why I'm asking you directly.

51
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:20,479
I don't have the time.

52
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,039
I need to know the answer immediately.

53
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:23,960
You have no time?

54
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,719
But I do.

55
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,039
There's no rush for such matters.

56
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,960
The two parties need time
to get to know each other.

57
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,080
From meeting to understanding,

58
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,240
to falling in love.

59
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,960
The confession comes after all that.

60
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,639
It sounds complicated.

61
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,520
How old are you?

62
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:40,840
I'm 28.

63
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,039
How much do you make a month?

64
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:42,879
6,000.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,800
That's less than me.

66
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:46,800
But Mr. Li

67
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,159
gives us a handsome year-end bonus.

68
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,000
At least 10,000.

69
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,800
That makes it more than mine.

70
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,319
Why are you asking that?

71
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,319
I want to know how to confess.

72
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,840
Why are you in such a rush?

73
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,759
Alright.

74
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,840
We can skip

75
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,599
the meeting, understanding,
falling in love,

76
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,479
and head straight to the eighth episode.

77
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,560
The eighth episode?

78
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,120
What eighth episode?

79
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,120
Haven't you watched
a drama series before?

80
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,159
Idol dramas

81
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,360
always follow a typical plot.

82
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,280
When you reach episode eight,

83
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,520
the characters usually appear

84
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,319
in standard fashion

85
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,840
with typical dialogues.

86
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,439
You just have to follow it.

87
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,720
I got it.

88
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,000
Got what?

89
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,199
The eighth episode.

90
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,160
Thanks a lot.

91
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,000
I've paid your bill.

92
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,000
Goodbye.

93
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,199
Wasn't that Mr. Ji?

94
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,759
Why did he pay for us?

95
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,360
Not Mr. Ji.

96
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,519
He's Ying Song.

97
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:43,000
So you and Mr. Ying Song are...

98
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,680
I think I'm getting a love confession.

99
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,759
(Lin Xing Ran.)

100
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,360
(You are the person I like the most.)

101
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,240
(Yeah, sure.)

102
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,720
(I'm the person you like the most.)

103
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,439
(Look at you.)

104
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,319
(You got yourself drunk
because you drank on my behalf.)

105
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,480
(Don't worry.)

106
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,879
(We cleared out the bar today.)

107
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,000
(It's reserved only for your big event.)

108
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,720
The music?

109
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:40,879
Smooth jazz.

110
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:42,759
I'm singing.

111
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,800
It has been 752 days

112
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,560
since the day

113
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,720
I met Xie Yi

114
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,040
beneath that tree.

115
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:01,240
Is it not grand enough?

116
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,240
You really are nervous.

117
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,639
As if you're about to get married.

118
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:05,759
For sure.

119
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,759
When Xie Yi

120
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,240
remembers this love confession,

121
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,839
I want her to feel utter happiness.

122
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:11,959
Listen.

123
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,279
Women

124
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,800
cares more about the effort

125
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,800
when it comes to this.

126
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,920
As long as you put effort into it,

127
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,680
she will definitely be touched.

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,839
You didn't tell her, did you?

129
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,879
Of course not.

130
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,399
If I had told her,
then where's the surprise?

131
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,199
I told her we were meeting
with a client.

132
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:39,519
This is the key.

133
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,360
You didn't tell Mr. Li, right?

134
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,319
No, I didn't.

135
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,480
Wait.

136
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,439
Didn't you come to feed Chestnut?

137
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,000
Why can't I tell him about it?

138
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,120
Besides that,

139
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,480
I'm planning

140
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,639
to tidy up the place for him.

141
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,079
I see.

142
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,000
Are you sure

143
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,959
Mr. Li won't be coming home today?

144
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:03,879
Don't worry.

145
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,879
He has a full day today.

146
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,279
That's good.

147
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:10,560
As for my absence from the office,

148
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,519
don't tell him either.

149
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,480
I will get back
before the end of the day.

150
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,360
Sure thing.

151
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,600
Thanks.

152
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,240
Finally done.

153
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,680
Chestnut.

154
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,240
You are pretty much

155
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,560
our matchmaker, aren't you?

156
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,240
You can eat lots today.

157
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,800
Consider it a bribe to keep quiet.

158
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,300
(Yan)

159
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,480
Hello, Yan.

160
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:07,720
Xie Yi.

161
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,319
Are you in the office?

162
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,519
Yes, I am.

163
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:12,319
Okay.

164
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,319
I'll go pick you up for dinner.

165
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:15,399
See you in half an hour.

166
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,639
Half an hour?

167
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,560
This is bad.

168
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,039
Remember.

169
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,600
When I smash the glass,

170
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:03,919
the music,

171
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:04,840
lights,

172
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,559
balloons

173
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,600
will all come on.

174
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,480
Then, you'll appear

175
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,840
and say your line.

176
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:11,960
Perfect.

177
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:13,799
Yes, it's perfect.

178
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,720
But this is a love confession.

179
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:16,879
Why smash the glass?

180
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,279
This isn't some assassination.

181
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,159
The signal has to be clear.

182
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:21,519
Got it.

183
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:22,960
Rock!

184
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:36,919
Lovely.

185
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:44,919
Hou Xiao Dong.

186
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:46,720
You're standing.

187
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,399
Chu Chu.

188
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,639
I am practicing.

189
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,799
Don't come near.

190
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,000
There's just one more step.

191
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,600
I just have to take one more step.

192
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,200
The last step.

193
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,919
What are you doing?

194
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,080
Come here.

195
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,440
Sit down.

196
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,000
Be careful.

197
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,679
My leg...

198
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:21,960
It's still not working.

199
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,919
You can't rush it.

200
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,120
You'll be able to walk

201
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,320
when you are fully recovered.

202
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,120
It's my bad.

203
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,279
I shouldn't push myself so hard.

204
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:32,679
But this darn leg.

205
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,279
Why won't it work?

206
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,159
Okay, okay.

207
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,000
Don't give up.

208
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,399
You'll get through this.

209
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,759
I've made you bone soup.

210
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,559
You should drink more.

211
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,360
Anyway,

212
00:10:58,679 --> 00:10:59,440
why is the bar

213
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,879
decorated in this manner?

214
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,440
Are you having a themed party?

215
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,639
(Oh, no. Liang is about to be here.)

216
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,240
(It's going to be a battlefield.)

217
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,399
About that...

218
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,879
I can explain.

219
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,320
I'll tell you another day.

220
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,720
Aren't we going for dinner?

221
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:20,120
Why did we come to Oscar's?

222
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,000
Let's go in.

223
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:24,320
There's a surprise.

224
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,120
Let's go somewhere else.

225
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,320
Where are you going?

226
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,039
You haven't drunk the soup.

227
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm sure you're busy.

228
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,240
I can drink it on my own.

229
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,000
Watch out!

230
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:30,559
Congrats on the love confession!

231
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,159
A great success!

232
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:58,279
This is the surprise you meant?

233
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,600
Thanks.

234
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,080
Thanks.

235
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,320
So you were being mysterious

236
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,519
because you wanted me

237
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:17,720
to witness Oscar's love confession?

238
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,639
I didn't expect it to be like that.

239
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,759
When did Oscar

240
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:27,240
start having a crush on Ms. Shi?

241
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,480
Did you already know?

242
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,960
I only just found out.

243
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,200
That Oscar.

244
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:36,240
He seemed like a flippant guy.

245
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:38,879
I didn't expect him
to have this side to him.

246
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:41,440
Xie Yi.

247
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,720
What did you think

248
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,679
of the confession venue?

249
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:47,279
It's not bad.

250
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,120
But it was a little old-fashioned.

251
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,360
Okay.

252
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,279
Guess it wasn't a pity then.

253
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,799
What do you mean?

254
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,679
It's nothing.

255
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,279
Let's order.

256
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:01,919
Pick anything you like.

257
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,799
Excuse me.

258
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,720
Hello.

259
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:08,000
We'd like to order.

260
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,679
What would you like, Miss?

261
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,360
I'd like to start with a salad.

262
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,039
Sure.

263
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,940
(Ying Song)

264
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,360
Hello?

265
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,320
Hello, Mr. Li.

266
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:24,720
Check your WeChat.

267
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,420
(Ying Song:
Document, Love confession 101)

268
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:32,159
I'd also like the burger.

269
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,919
Thanks.

270
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,320
Chu Chu.

271
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,519
I can explain

272
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,600
all of this.

273
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,039
Explain what?

274
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:50,120
Explain about your leg

275
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,360
or this flashy set?

276
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,840
Both.

277
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,960
You don't have to say anything.

278
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,159
Right now,

279
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,679
I'm not ready

280
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:09,519
to step into a new relationship.

281
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,000
Did you think I didn't know

282
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,679
just because you didn't say anything?

283
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,360
Your leg had healed
but you pretended to be lame.

284
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,200
It couldn't have been because

285
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,279
you wanted free soup.

286
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,000
The last time

287
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,240
when you wanted me
to look into your eyes,

288
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,039
I already felt it.

289
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,279
But we have always

290
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,360
been friends.

291
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:45,240
You suddenly act like this...

292
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,200
What are you thinking?

293
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,720
Did you think I was confessing
my feelings to you?

294
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,919
Don't be silly.

295
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,399
This is the set I prepared

296
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,720
for Liang to confess to Xie Yi.

297
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:56,480
This is how it ended up.

298
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,399
So I ruined

299
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:26,000
Ze Liang's love confession?

300
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:32,679
Chu Chu!

301
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:44,120
Here you go.

302
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,200
I haven't finished the one I have.

303
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,519
Why did you order another drink?

304
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,559
Their cappuccino

305
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,279
is really good.

306
00:16:58,519 --> 00:16:59,320
Why don't you

307
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:00,759
try it?

308
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,000
(After she drinks the cappuccino,)

309
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,079
(there will be foam)

310
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,519
(left on her lips.)

311
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,839
(At this moment,)

312
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,200
(kiss her)

313
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,880
(before she can react.)

314
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,359
(Clean off the foam on her lips.)

315
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,279
(Then confess your feelings
to her affectionately.)

316
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,039
That's odd.

317
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:20,319
Why is the foam so thick?

318
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:41,480
What is it?

319
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,920
Is this embarrassing for you?

320
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:46,319
No.

321
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,000
If that's what you prefer.

322
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:04,079
What is it?

323
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:05,880
Nothing.

324
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:11,759
(Gift her a wallet.)

325
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:13,519
(It means you're giving her
power over your money.)

326
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,559
(You'll take care of
all her expenditures.)

327
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,839
(Nothing is more pragmatic)

328
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,160
(than that.)

329
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:19,400
My dear.

330
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:21,039
This is the card for my salary account,

331
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,119
my identification card

332
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,599
and my bankbook.

333
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:24,160
From now on,

334
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:25,599
be it my money

335
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:26,400
or me,

336
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,079
they're all yours to keep.

337
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,039
What are you doing?

338
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,839
This is only our first meeting.

339
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,400
Miss, where are you going?

340
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,599
What era are we living in?

341
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:40,359
He used such an outdated way.

342
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:43,279
Nowadays, payment is made
by swiping cards.

343
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:45,359
Who brings a wallet out with them?

344
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,319
At most, we bring a card holder.

345
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:50,319
Where are you going?

346
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm going to check the view.

347
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,240
Xie Yi, go ask them about our order.

348
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,759
What other options are there?

349
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:07,680
Buy her

350
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,119
a nice ice cream.

351
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,720
When she asks you

352
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:12,200
if you'd like to try it,

353
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,640
you then kiss her.

354
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,759
Buy everything

355
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:18,480
she likes.

356
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:19,839
Let me see.

357
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,759
Xie Yi.

358
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,920
So many tips and tricks.

359
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,480
Give it back.

360
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,000
Actually,

361
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,240
you had wanted

362
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:32,359
to confess to me

363
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,160
when you brought me to the bar, right?

364
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,920
You knew?

365
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,200
The number at the bar.

366
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,480
I saw it.

367
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,279
752.

368
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,640
Today happens to be

369
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:47,920
the 752nd day

370
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,079
since we met on the hill.

371
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,200
I'm sorry, Xie Yi.

372
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,799
I didn't manage to give you

373
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,200
a proper love confession.

374
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,279
You're not angry, are you?

375
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,279
I'm not.

376
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:01,799
Because

377
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,519
you've already confessed to me long ago.

378
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,799
When Lin Tai knocked me unconscious,

379
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:10,359
you had carried me to the hospital.

380
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:15,680
(When I was a quivering wreck,)

381
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,759
(you carried me)

382
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:19,279
(at the beef noodle shop.)

383
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:22,759
(When you let me call you Yan)

384
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:24,640
(while you dried my hair at home.)

385
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,319
(When you said)

386
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,160
that is a name

387
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:30,279
reserved for only the closest person.

388
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:34,319
When you cleared away the broken glass
with your hands

389
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,400
(and pulled me up with all your might)

390
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:38,079
(from the poisonous basement.)

391
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:47,880
Yan.

392
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,039
You've given me

393
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:52,160
so many confessions.

394
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,400
Every one of them

395
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,200
was more sincere than any of these.

396
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,680
I never thought

397
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,440
there would be another person

398
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:04,640
aside from my father and family

399
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,599
that could love me this much.

400
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,079
So,

401
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,640
I'll be the one

402
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:14,839
to confess my love to you.

403
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,279
Yan.

404
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,680
If you're willing,

405
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:24,960
may I be your girlfriend?

406
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,640
I'd use the rest of my life

407
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,519
to protect you.

408
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,680
I do.

409
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:43,420
♪You are my everything, my everything♪

410
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:47,100
♪How I want to tell you♪

411
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:53,180
♪I want to be your moon♪

412
00:21:53,300 --> 00:22:03,900
♪Be mine, my love♪

413
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,820
(Hou Xiao Dong)

414
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:27,880
Hello?

415
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,400
Where are you?

416
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:31,799
What is it?

417
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,279
You left your soup container here.

418
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,920
I'll return it to you.

419
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:39,400
It's okay.

420
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,359
I am occupied right now.

421
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,960
Occupied?

422
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:44,839
You mean drinking

423
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,119
by your lonesome self here?

424
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,720
How did you know I was here?

425
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:56,799
I, Oscar, am well connected.

426
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:57,960
I'm all-powerful.

427
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,440
Wanting to find you

428
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,160
is no more than a cakewalk.

429
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,799
Look at yourself.

430
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,680
Drinking alone like this

431
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:10,400
isn't going to solve anything.

432
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,119
I'm fine.

433
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,240
I just wanted to vent a little.

434
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,720
I'm going home after I finish.

435
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:20,440
Don't worry about me. You can go.

436
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,039
This beer is awful.

437
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:34,880
See?

438
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,440
I finished the beer.

439
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,000
Venting like this

440
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,079
won't make you feel better.

441
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:39,839
Come on.

442
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,400
I'll take you to a place.

443
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,319
Come with me.

444
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,279
This is the place

445
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,079
you want to bring me to?

446
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:51,359
That's right.

447
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,519
Let's go.

448
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:56,240
Let's go.

449
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:02,759
Chu Chu.

450
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,359
Jerk!

451
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,400
Just let out all the frustrations

452
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,400
you've been feeling!

453
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:07,039
Let everything out!

454
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:11,240
Screw him for being dumb.

455
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,680
He's blind!

456
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,039
Throw at it hard, Chu Chu!

457
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,200
What exam?

458
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,039
Don't want to work.
Don't want to be busy!

459
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:18,680
Smash it!

460
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,260
♪Who isn't new at defense?♪

461
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,220
♪Yet we still betray ourselves♪

462
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:29,920
Have some milk tea.

463
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,920
Drink something sweet.

464
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:33,559
This way, your brain

465
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:35,240
will release dopamine

466
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:36,720
that makes you feel happy.

467
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:37,960
The thing is,

468
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:39,920
humans should never

469
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:41,440
let themselves

470
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,799
be stripped of happiness.

471
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:50,359
You know what?

472
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,319
The place where you found me just now

473
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,279
was where I went after my confession

474
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,240
to Li Ze Liang was rejected.

475
00:24:58,839 --> 00:24:59,400
Chu Chu.

476
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,359
In this world,

477
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,599
the most unfair thing is love.

478
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:06,839
Because whether it is studies

479
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,519
or work,

480
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:08,680
as long as you put in the effort,

481
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,279
you will get the result in the end.

482
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,799
But that doesn't apply to love.

483
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,400
So long as one side is not interested,

484
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:17,799
you won't get the result.

485
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:20,720
However,

486
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,519
as long as you've done your best,

487
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:25,119
it will always be a good memory.

488
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:26,160
So,

489
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:27,920
don't be too sad about it.

490
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:28,799
Okay?

491
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,319
Who is sad?

492
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,039
I was trying to say,

493
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:37,480
this place

494
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:39,960
is a much better place to vent
than that place.

495
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:43,400
I don't feel as bad

496
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:44,519
as the last time.

497
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,839
Thank you.

498
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:50,400
Don't mention it.

499
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:52,480
We're friends, right?

500
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,480
It's only right
to be there for each other.

501
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:57,920
But,

502
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,240
if you really want to thank me,

503
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,240
a music producer is coming

504
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:03,640
to watch me perform next week.

505
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,240
I'm missing a drummer.

506
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:06,720
Can you help me out?

507
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,519
What do you say?

508
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,240
Okay.

509
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:12,279
It's a deal then.

510
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,559
Where are you going?

511
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:18,440
I want to ask the boss

512
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,799
if they offer annual membership.

513
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,559
As expected,

514
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,960
it's hard for people

515
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:27,599
to ignore trends.

516
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,319
Going to sign up for membership?

517
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:35,640
Wait a minute.

518
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,359
Did I unleash

519
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,039
her preference for violence?

520
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,079
Chu Chu.

521
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,119
Chu Chu!

522
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,039
Chestnut.

523
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,680
I've been tidying the whole day.

524
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,200
It's finally your turn.

525
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:04,720
Let me help you

526
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,960
clean up your little house.

527
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,920
Have some water, lady boss.

528
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,200
Thank you, boss.

529
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,480
Let me do it.

530
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,079
Are you tired?

531
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,960
A little bit.

532
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:30,519
You've worked hard.

533
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:33,640
Yan.

534
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,680
I used to imagine

535
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:39,359
what perfect love is.

536
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:42,319
I finally have the answer now.

537
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,000
It is now.

538
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:48,000
This present moment.

539
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:56,599
When we

540
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,079
first met Chestnut,

541
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,160
it was still so small.

542
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:01,160
It has grown up healthy and big.

543
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,839
You must have put in a lot of effort.

544
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,000
In the beginning,

545
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,680
it was pretty tough.

546
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,000
But

547
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,799
it was Chestnut

548
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,039
that accompanied me

549
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:13,319
through the toughest times.

550
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:15,359
You know what?

551
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:17,200
Hedgehogs don't bite.

552
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,039
Their only way to protect themselves

553
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,079
is the spines all over their body.

554
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,720
But if it likes you,

555
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,039
even the spines

556
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,799
become surprisingly soft.

557
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,160
Just like...

558
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:38,599
Just like when I met you.

559
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:48,640
You seemed to have improved
your talking skills.

560
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,079
Such a sweet talker.

561
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,519
I think Chestnut

562
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,519
just made a sound.

563
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:58,000
Chestnut.

564
00:28:59,279 --> 00:28:59,920
Chestnut?

565
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,839
What is it, Chestnut?

566
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,519
Are you jealous of us?

567
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,480
According to the life cycle

568
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,319
of hedgehogs,

569
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:08,400
Chestnut

570
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,359
is a 30 plus old guy
who is still single.

571
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,440
I'll find you a girlfriend soon.

572
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,440
How about that?

573
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:15,640
Look how happy it is.

574
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,440
By the way.

575
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,799
Chestnut's food has run out.

576
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,279
There's more there.

577
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,720
You're going to have a girlfriend.

578
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,000
You must be delighted.

579
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,680
Yan.

580
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,920
This is a nice box.

581
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,079
What's inside?

582
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,960
Open it and see.

583
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,839
You like carving?

584
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:06,880
When I was young,

585
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,000
I was very naughty.

586
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:11,960
I could never sit still in class.

587
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:13,599
I had no patience.

588
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:16,720
In order to teach me

589
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,759
to be more patient,

590
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:19,400
my father taught me seal carving.

591
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,079
Later on, whenever I am free,

592
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:26,119
I would carve some things.

593
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,680
To calm my mind.

594
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,079
Until my dad passed away.

595
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,319
Since he died,

596
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:39,359
I have never picked up these tools

597
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,359
again.

598
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:51,359
Why don't you teach me?

599
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,359
I'd like to learn.

600
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:56,839
This isn't anything fun.

601
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,519
You might cut yourself

602
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:00,359
playing with knives.

603
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,799
Then make one for me.

604
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,559
What should I carve?

605
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:10,559
Carve both our names

606
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,359
together.

607
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,519
Call it

608
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,279
Liang Yan Xie Yi.

609
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:22,640
Liang Yan Xie Yi?

610
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,839
It means both Ze Liang and Yan

611
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,960
belong to Su Xie Yi.

612
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,359
Then I'm going to use the seal

613
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,440
on all the places we've been to.

614
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:31,960
Here.

615
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:32,799
Here.

616
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,000
Here...

617
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:35,839
And here.

618
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,720
And here.

619
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:44,640
What are you doing?

620
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:47,680
Since you're the lady boss,

621
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:49,720
you should do what a lady boss does.

622
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:51,880
What's that?

623
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,279
Stamp the seal.

624
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:02,580
♪Sailing on the sea of life♪

625
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:09,500
♪All alone lost on the tide♪

626
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:15,140
♪Waves of silver glitters blind my eyes♪

627
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:22,920
Congrats.

628
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,400
For the restructuring
of the Board of Directors,

629
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,480
everyone voted for you.

630
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:28,880
Even the few Huo Jian supporters

631
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:29,920
backed down.

632
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,480
I will soon have to call you

633
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:34,279
Chairman Li.

634
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:37,839
I don't normally

635
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:38,640
drink in the office.

636
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,759
What about

637
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:42,319
a little gesture?

638
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:47,680
The fact that they voted for me

639
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,759
to head the Board of Directors

640
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:51,480
is a form of encouragement for me.

641
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,440
Ocean Hotel is a big family.

642
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:56,359
To ensure smooth progress,

643
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,519
we cannot forsake

644
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,000
the unity and trust between members.

645
00:32:59,400 --> 00:32:59,960
In addition,

646
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,279
starting from today,

647
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,519
I will not ask about the past.

648
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:05,759
I will only look towards the future.

649
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,640
Those who remain at the hotel

650
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,039
are all part of the family.

651
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,319
Listen to yourself.

652
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:13,240
It's only you and me here.

653
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,079
Did you have to proclaim our motto?

654
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,119
Honestly speaking,

655
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,000
I really want to thank you.

656
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:23,039
After all that has happened,

657
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,640
you never stopped believing in me.

658
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,480
You've always stood by me.

659
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,440
You're really giving a speech now,

660
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:29,240
aren't you?

661
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,480
Listen carefully.

662
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:31,960
I didn't do it for you.

663
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,680
I did it for Ocean.

664
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:36,680
Now you're proclaiming the motto.

665
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:41,759
It's because you influenced me.

666
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,559
Ze Liang.

667
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:46,960
Everyone recognizes

668
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,960
your capabilities.

669
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,160
So be it the past

670
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,319
or the future,

671
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,680
my dad and I

672
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,400
will always support you unconditionally.

673
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,000
Thank you.

674
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:06,519
By the way.

675
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:08,199
Huo Jian's office

676
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,440
has been cleared.

677
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,159
You can move in any time.

678
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,199
I'm happy with this space.

679
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,760
I don't plan to move yet.

680
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:19,800
Alright then.

681
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,760
As long as Chairman Li is happy.

682
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,440
Okay.

683
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:26,639
Huo Jian left behind a huge mess.

684
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:27,920
I need to get busy.

685
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,119
Okay.

686
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,039
I better get going too.

687
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:36,079
Xie Yi.

688
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,960
This is for Mr. Li.

689
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:39,119
Make sure he signs it.

690
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,840
(Li Ze Liang)

691
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,559
(I need your help urgently.)

692
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:03,800
What's the urgent matter?

693
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,159
I'm picking out a present for Xiao Xiao.

694
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,679
I need you to give me some ideas.

695
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:10,559
I've already picked one.

696
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,880
Stand up.

697
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:12,679
Let me sit.

698
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:16,679
Can't you be more gentle?

699
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,360
No.

700
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:24,000
This one.

701
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:25,800
A microphone?

702
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,360
How smart you are.

703
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,239
Of course.

704
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,239
This is perfect for Xiao Xiao.

705
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,400
Which one should we pick?

706
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:35,880
This one.

707
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,440
This is expensive. It has to be good.

708
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,360
A higher price doesn't mean it's good.

709
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,679
What about this one?

710
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:43,960
It's on sale.

711
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,440
The color doesn't look nice.

712
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,599
Young girls like pink.

713
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:48,280
You know nothing.

714
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:49,719
We will buy

715
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:50,519
this and this then.

716
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:51,920
That's wasting money.

717
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:53,079
Not at all.

718
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:55,280
We'll buy two and keep one for you.

719
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:57,159
You are a great singer.

720
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,199
♪As sweet as honey♪

721

722
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:05,159
Stop singing.

726
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:13,360
Mr. Li, this is the document
you asked for.

727
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:20,840
Do you

728
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:22,360
still want it?

729
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,440
I can

730
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:36,960
come back later.

731
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,920
I've added it to the cart.

732
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:45,840
You can buy it.

733
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:51,360
I'm going to buy both then.

734
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:52,559
(As you please.)

735
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,760
(I'm so hungry.)

736
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:05,719
Come and sit.

737
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,840
Check out
the scrumptious breakfast I made.

738
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,760
You made so much.

739
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:12,159
Try it.

740
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:14,320
This is your favorite

741
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,079
waffle.

742
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,360
How is it?

743
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,320
What's wrong?

744
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,679
I think my wisdom tooth
is inflamed again.

745
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,159
Xie Yi.

746
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:26,840
You can't ignore

747
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:27,960
the constant inflammation.

748
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,000
You should get it extracted.

749
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,320
It's fine.

750
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:32,800
I just need to take some medication.

751
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:33,880
Oh, right.

752
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,679
I haven't finished the medicine

753
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,079
Ming Hao gave me.

754
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,400
It's here.

755
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,679
You know?

756
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,199
This medicine is amazing.

757
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,079
Right after I take it,

758
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,480
the pain goes away.

759
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,159
But you're not treating
the root of the problem.

760
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,880
Still, it's better
than a tooth extraction.

761
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:54,880
I heard

762
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:57,320
that wisdom tooth extraction
is a minor surgery.

763
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,440
They use a clamp

764
00:37:58,639 --> 00:37:59,880
to break and pull the teeth.

765
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:01,400
Just thinking about it is scary.

766
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,760
I'd rather take medicine.

767
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,039
It's not as scary as you think.

768
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:08,239
They give you an anesthetic
before the extraction.

769
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:09,400
With the anesthetic,

770
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,679
you'll hardly feel anything.

771
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:13,079
I'd still rather not.

772
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,239
How about this?

773
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,800
Today is the weekend.

774
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,079
I'll take you to Movie World.

775
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,199
There is

776
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:21,159
a pink-colored bus.

777
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,239
It's lovely.

778
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:24,360
Maybe you'll forget about the pain

779
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:25,719
when you're busy having fun.

780
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:27,079
Divert your attention.

781
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:28,519
You won't feel the pain.

782
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,400
I can't.

783
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,079
Mr. Ji told me

784
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,880
you have to check up on your leg today.

785
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:34,280
I need to supervise you.

786
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,159
Hurry up and eat.

787
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,960
Is your tooth okay?

788
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,280
Can you chew on it?

789
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,000
I can use the other side.

790
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:53,039
Miss.

791
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,719
When will my teeth be better?

792
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,840
You still have two wisdom teeth.

793
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,880
You'll feel better
after you remove them.

794
00:38:58,039 --> 00:38:59,199
I have to remove two more?

795
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:00,559
This is too painful.

796
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:03,679
Xie Yi.

797
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:05,599
Why not we take a number
at the dentistry too?

798
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,480
No need.

799
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:09,360
We should hurry up.

800
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:10,639
Dr. Wu is waiting.

801
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:11,719
Let's go.

802
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,340
(Director's Office)

803
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,000
Dr. Wu.

804
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:19,159
You're here.

805
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:20,920
Come and sit.

806
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:22,079
Sit.

807
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:23,639
I was about to call you to remind you.

808
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,880
I didn't expect

809
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:26,760
you'd be on time this time around.

810
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:28,840
Who is this?

811
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:30,360
Hello, Mr. Wu.

812
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:31,639
I'm Su Xie Yi.

813
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,239
We spoke before on the phone.

814
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,079
I see. Take a seat.

815
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:36,039
Sit.

816
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:37,280
I remember now.

817
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:38,280
We've met.

818
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:40,000
That time, Ze Liang

819
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,760
asked me to put on a show with him,

820
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,760
pretending his leg was hurt.

821
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,400
You barged into the room then,

822
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,159
almost in tears.

823
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:50,440
I wonder

824
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:52,599
why he's so punctual today.

825
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,199
Is it because you urged him to come?

826
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,480
Ze Liang.

827
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,840
Who would have expected

828
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,599
a stubborn person like you

829
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:04,039
would be so obedient to your wife?

830
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:07,000
Stop it, Dr. Wu.

831
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:09,159
Stop teasing me.

832
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,119
I've already submitted the request.

833
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,760
Let's go and take an x-ray.

834
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,519
I'll get you a wheelchair.

835
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:18,199
It's okay.

836
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:21,880
I don't need a wheelchair.

837
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,400
I can walk there.

838
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:25,079
Xie Yi.

839
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,320
Wait for me here.

840
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,679
I'm going.

841
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,320
Okay.

842
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,599
Wait for me.

843
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:43,320
Dr. Wu.

844
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,119
About Yan's leg,

845
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,000
I have a few questions to ask you.

846
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:47,960
Go ahead.

847
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,960
He had the amputation two years ago.

848
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:51,639
But Yan still feels pain

849
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,360
in the leg often.

850
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,920
