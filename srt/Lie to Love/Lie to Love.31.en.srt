Before we came back,

46
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,319
Ying Song had given her some medicine.

47
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:30,879
For her safety,

48
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,000
I arranged for her
to settle down here first.

49
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,720
Don't worry.

50
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,680
Xie Qing will be all right.

51
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,480
She just took the medicine.

52
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,680
After having a good rest for two days,

53
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,040
she'll get better.

54
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,199
Here, Xie Yi.

55
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,439
Yan.

56
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:36,639
Sorry.

57
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,680
I have hurt you previously.

58
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:41,040
Silly.

59
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,600
Actually, I figured it out a while ago.

60
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,319
You must have your reasons.

61
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,079
We might be apart.

62
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,160
But the thought of us

63
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:53,959
fighting

64
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,720
for the same goal

65
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:56,879
makes it

66
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,800
more bearable.

67
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,480
It even

68
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,759
gave me a shred of courage.

69
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,040
You know what?

70
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:09,000
Actually,

71
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,000
seeing you suffer
and be given a hard time

72
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,600
pained me more than it pained you.

73
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:17,759
I know.

74
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,079
Xie Ming Hao imprisoned my sister

75
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,680
and used her to threaten me.

76
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,199
I had to save my sister
and help you at the same time.

77
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,920
I didn't mean to hurt you.

78
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,759
Also, I found out that all those things
that happened to Ocean back then

79
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:35,800
were all his doings as well.

80
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,959
I'm aware of that.

81
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:43,079
Actually, what you'd gone through

82
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,319
was no less than me.

83
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,519
Yan.

84
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,399
You took all the blame

85
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,199
for

86
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,519
the external wall insulation materials

87
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:56,319
because Xie Ming Hao threatened you,

88
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,560
right?

89
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,560
He showed me a lot of evidence.

90
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,319
Among them was a recording,
which is the key evidence,

91
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,480
in which there was a conversation
between you and the supplier

92
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,519
about rebates.

93
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,959
This jerk.

94
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,800
That recording

95
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,560
must have been edited.

96
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,759
Of course, I'm not that foolish.

97
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,480
I'm aware of that

98
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,480
and I believed in you.

99
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Xie Yi.

100
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,079
To be honest,

101
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,120
during this period of time,

102
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,680
I've been thinking of you every minute
and every second of the day.

103
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,480
Now,

104
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,759
we can finally

105
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,040
be together again.

106
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:47,120
I don't ever want
to be apart from you again.

107
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,920
I, too, don't want to be apart from you
ever again.

108
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,040
Take a nap if you're tired.

109
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,480
Xie Qing.

110
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,399
I don't know what you like to eat.

111
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,799
So I prepared more dishes.

112
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,480
There are western-style waffles,

113
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,759
Chinese-style pot stickers,

114
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:55,679
and shumai.
[*a dim sum snack]

115
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,039
Help yourself.

116
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,639
Thank you.

117
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,720
Do you have no appetite?

118
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,519
Let's have some appetizers.

119
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,759
I guess

120
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,759
Xie Qing doesn't like to have porridge.

121
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:15,399
Xie Qing.

122
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,919
I'll pour you a glass of milk.

123
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,000
Here.

124
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:33,679
Sorry.

125
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,159
Sorry, Xie Yi.

126
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,279
I was such a fool.

127
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:41,200
That's why I fell for his tricks.

128
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,960
Xie Yi.

129
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,559
Sorry.

130
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:49,840
It was all my fault.

131
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,720
I've been so selfish.

132
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,120
Ever since you were born,

133
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:56,759
I have felt

134
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,919
so insecure.

135
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,879
The moment

136
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,600
I heard that you were graduating

137
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,600
and coming back from Germany,

138
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,720
Xie Ming Hao caught and firmly held

139
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,600
onto this sense of insecurity of mine.

140
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,639
It kept growing

141
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,639
and ended up devouring me

142
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,600
like a black hole.

143
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,759
At Xie Ming Hao's instigation,

144
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,080
I transferred Zhiwei's assets

145
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,399
in the name of procurement.

146
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:32,360
There was no food

147
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,120
in the warehouse at that time.

148
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,799
That's why our dad

149
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,279
was unable to deliver the goods to Ocean

150
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:46,440
and pay the liquidated damages.

151
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,399
I was the one

152
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,840
who drove our dad into a corner.

153
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,600
Ming Hao!

154
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,360
This is bad!

155
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:01,320
What's wrong?

156
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:01,720
I just

157
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,639
passed by my dad's office

158
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,519
and heard him checking the accounts.

159
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,240
If he found out

160
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,399
that I secretly embezzled public funds

161
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,559
to transfer assets,

162
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,120
I would definitely
be kicked out of the house.

163
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,320
It's all right.

164
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:12,759
You're his daughter.

165
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,559
If he finds out,

166
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:14,840
he'll only give you an earful at most.

167
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,879
What else would he do?

168
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:16,799
No.

169
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,480
If he asked me

170
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,559
where did all the money go,

171
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,159
how should I answer him?

172
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:20,879
Say you lost the money

173
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,279
when you traded futures.

174
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,399
So you temporarily

175
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,120
took Zhiwei's funds

176
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,360
to fill up the gaping hole.

177
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:26,320
You were the one

178
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,440
who earned the money for Zhiwei.

179
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,080
What's there to worry about?

180
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,279
No.

181
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,679
I did it out of spite.

182
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,240
All I have to do is return the money

183
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,200
and my dad won't blame me for that.

184
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,000
That's right.

185
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,639
Come to your senses, Xie Qing.

186
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,360
There's no turning back now.

187
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:54,440
Have you

188
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,679
considered our future?

189
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,519
I want

190
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:58,039
to help you put on a wedding dress

191
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,639
and give you a lifetime of happiness.

192
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,559
Had you returned the money,

193
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,399
what about us?

194
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:07,399
We would have nothing.

195
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:10,600
Even if it weren't for me,

196
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,919
you couldn't do that either.

197
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,360
What do you mean?

198
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,360
Wait a second.

199
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,570
(Medical Examination Report)

200
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,360
This is your medical report

201
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:43,799
from the checkup done a few days ago.

202
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:46,519
I collected it for you today.

203
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,670
(Medical Report
of Shanghai Kang'en People's Hospital)

204
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,240
You're going to be a mother.

205
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:03,000
Aren't you happy?

206
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,799
My goodness.

207
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,120
We're going to have our own kid.

208
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,000
We really

209
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,559
are going to have our own kid.

210
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,720
Xie Qing, I'm so happy.

211
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,480
We'll watch him grow up together.

212
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:22,000
We'll give him all our love.

213
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,320
If you return the money,

214
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,519
we might go to jail.

215
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,200
Do you want our kid

216
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,320
to become an orphan
just like how we were

217
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,559
when we were young?

218
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:45,480
Tell me.

219
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,200
What's going on?

220
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:47,799
Did you

221
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,440
transfer the company's funds?

222
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,039
Yes.

223
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,000
Where to?

224
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,639
I traded futures

225
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,639
and lost a lot of money.

226
00:13:59,039 --> 00:13:59,720
So I thought

227
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:01,519
of using the company's funds

228
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,879
to fill up the gaping hole.

229
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,639
I thought...

230
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:07,320
I thought...

231
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:08,519
What were you thinking?

232
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:10,720
How dare you embezzle
the company's funds

233
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:11,919
to trade futures?

234
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,759
Tell me!

235
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,159
Was it Xie Ming Hao?

236
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:15,240
Did he

237
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:16,840
instigate you to do this?

238
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,039
You're being biased.

239
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:23,240
What did you say?

240
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:25,159
He was right.

241
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,159
You're biased.

242
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:30,960
Deep in your bones, you despise him.

243
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,480
You dislike him,

244
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,799
including me!

245
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,519
No matter how hard we try

246
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:36,600
and how good we are,

247
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,639
you always treat us as outsiders.

248
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
We are just the orphans you adopted

249
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,919
and sponsored!

250
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:44,080
Right from the start,

251
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,799
you've never

252
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,799
considered us your own!

253
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,519
All you care about is your own daughter.

254
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:50,039
Su Xie Yi!

255
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,240
You...

256
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:53,919
What nonsense is this?

257
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,639
It's not.

258
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,759
If you hadn't been biased

259
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,919
and wanted to pass Zhiwei down
to Xie Yi,

260
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,039
would I do all these?

261
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,039
Don't forget.

262
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:09,440
When Zhiwei was at its lowest,

263
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:11,440
I was the one who helped you

264
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,440
to get it on its feet!

265
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,360
Shut up!

266
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,919
And you wouldn't admit
that you are biased?

267
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,639
If this was Su Xie Yi,

268
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,919
could you bring yourself to hit her?

269
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,559
Why would you think this way?

270
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,840
I've always

271
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,840
considered you my own.

272
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,080
In my heart,

273
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,320
there's no difference
between you and Xie Yi.

274
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,240
Xie Ming Hao must be the one

275
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,919
who orchestrated this.

276
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,440
My child.

277
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,039
Do you know?

278
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,120
Because

279
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,240
you transferred the company's funds,

280
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,519
Zhiwei is about to go bankrupt.

281
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,279
Did you not think

282
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,279
of the consequences of your action?

283
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,159
Have you thought about it?

284
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:29,120
Dad.

285
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:30,840
I know I was wrong.

286
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,759
I'm begging you, Dad.

287
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,039
Please spare us, will you?

288
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:37,159
I can spare you.

289
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,000
But not Xie Ming Hao.

290
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:41,879
No, Dad.

291
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,919
Dad.

292
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:44,919
Nothing can happen to Ming Hao.

293
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,840
I'm pregnant with his baby.

294
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,759
Dad.

295
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,080
You wouldn't want

296
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,440
your grandchild to be born

297
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:05,680
without a father, right?

298
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,519
Get up first.

299
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:10,680
No.

300
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,839
If you don't agree,

301
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,839
I'll keep kneeling.

302
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:20,119
I've told you.

303
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:21,880
In my heart,

304
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,400
you and Xie Yi are the same.

305
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,880
You're both my daughters.

306
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,839
Both of you are dear to me.

307
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,319
I hope for the best for all of you.

308
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:37,640
Thank you.

309
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,079
Thank you, Dad.

310
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,680
Dad, thank you

311
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,319
for still treating me as your daughter.

312
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:49,319
But...

313
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:53,119
But what do we do now, Dad?

314
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:55,680
I've emptied the company's funds.

315
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,599
I'll figure out a way.

316
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,359
I'll find Mr. Huo

317
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,880
and sit down with him.

318
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:11,559
Let's hope he'll bend the rules

319
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,640
and let Zhiwei off the hook.

320
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,599
I didn't know

321
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:28,559
that the situation for Zhiwei
was so dire back then.

322
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,000
After Dad left,

323
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,640
he never came back.

324
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,119
He chose

325
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:38,680
to take all the blame

326
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,160
for my sake.

327
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:44,559
I've wronged my dad.

328
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,720
Never did I expect

329
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:49,759
that all these

330
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,160
were a trap
that Xie Ming Hao had set up.

331
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,440
He's the K of Spades.

332
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:01,200
You disguised as K of Spades

333
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,839
and ordered Huo Jian
to take down Zhiwei,

334
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,640
didn't you?

335
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:05,839
It's me.

336
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:08,680
It was my plan to have Huo Jian

337
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,640
take down Zhiwei.

338
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:10,880
Also,

339
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm the one who pushed Shen Zhi Hong
over the edge.

340
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,519
It was you, Shen Xie Qing.

341
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,599
Your dad died because of you.

342
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:45,480
Are you out of your mind?

343
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:47,920
Let go of me! Let me die!

344
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:49,519
Let me die!

345
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:50,920
Let go of me!

346
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:52,880
Tell me the account number and password.

347
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:53,519
I can't end up

348
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,599
getting nothing, can I?

349
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,039
I'll never give it to you.

350
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,160
Let me die!

351
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,759
Tell me the password.

352
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:07,680
You're not

353
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,240
the man that I loved.

354
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:11,160
Didn't I tell you?

355
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,319
All these years,

356
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,880
I've never loved you.

357
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,240
The one I love is Xie Yi.

358
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,920
You hardly even qualify

359
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:18,920
as a substitute for Xie Yi.

360
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,519
Stop talking!

361
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,279
I'm not going to stop.

362
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:24,920
If it wasn't

363
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:26,119
because you're still of some use to me,

364
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,039
I wouldn't even

365
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,359
look you in the eye.

366
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,279
I have to thank you
for playing along with me.

367
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,720
If not,

368
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,920
that scumbag Shen Zhi Hong

369
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:34,759
wouldn't have met his end so quickly.

370
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,200
I don't want to listen to you!

371
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,759
Listen up!

372
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,039
In this world,

373
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,759
he was the one who despised me the most!

374
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:43,960
Back then, he adopted me

375
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:45,960
just

376
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,640
to gain a good reputation.

377
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,279
I've worked hard all my life

378
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:55,000
so that no one
will despise me ever again

379
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:58,400
and to gain his approval.

380
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,799
But in the end?

381
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:02,880
He thought

382
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,119
I am not even qualified to love Xie Yi!

383
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,519
This was all your dad's fault.

384
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,079
Very well.

385
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:16,119
If so, I'm begging you to let me die.

386
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:21,519
Just let me die

387
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:24,440
along with my baby.

388
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,759
You were never

389
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,640
pregnant with our child.

390
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,519
The report was fake.

391
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:34,759
Fake?

392
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,440
How could I possibly

393
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,200
have a child with someone like you?

394
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:41,119
I've been lying to you all these years!

395
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:45,799
You lied to me?

396
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:52,200
It was all a lie?

397
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:01,440
A lie?

398
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,960
Xie Qing.

399
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm sorry, Xie Yi.

400
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,599
I'm sorry.

401
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,279
It was all my fault.

402
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:38,200
I shouldn't be jealous.

403
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:40,000
You're our dad's biological daughter.

404
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,839
I shouldn't

405
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,839
have listened to Xie Ming Hao

406
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,559
and transferred Zhiwei's assets either.

407
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:48,759
I've wronged our dad.

408
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,880
Back then, when he chose
to jump off the building

409
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,880
just to protect me,

410
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,240
only then I realized

411
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:01,160
how important I was to him.

412
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,440
I'm sorry, Xie Yi.

413
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,039
I have only myself to blame.

414
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,000
Don't worry.

415
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,400
I'll turn myself in.

416
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,119
Why?

417
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:24,200
Why did you do that?

418
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,039
I'm sorry.

419
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,480
It was all my fault.

420
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,400
You can hit me or scold me.

421
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:31,279
I'm begging you.

422
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:34,000
It was all my fault. I'm sorry.

423
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,559
So what if it was your fault?

424
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,920
Will it bring our dad back to life?

425
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,319
I'm sorry.

426
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,640
Our dad's gone.

427
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,960
So is our family.

428
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,440
I'm sorry.

429
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,000
The sister I loved most

430
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:50,400
is gone too.

431
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,359
There's nothing left now!

432
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,920
I'm sorry!

433
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:56,279
I'm sorry.

434
00:23:57,799 --> 00:23:58,880
I'm sorry.

435
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:00,039
I'm sorry.

436
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:03,720
I'm sorry.

437
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:06,839
I'm sorry.

438
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,839
I'm sorry.

439
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,559
I'm sorry.

440
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,599
Li Ze Liang!

441
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,480
Li Ze Liang, open the door!

442
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,119
Li Ze Liang!

443
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,599
Li Ze Liang!

444
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:26,519
Come out here, Li Ze Liang!

445
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,160
Xie Yi.

446
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,720
Take Xie Qing into the secret room.

447
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,920
Come on.

448
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,359
Come out here, Li Ze Liang!

449
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,920
- Li Ze Liang!
- Get inside.

450
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:39,079
I know you're in there!

451
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:40,799
Li Ze Liang, come out here!

452
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,319
Mr. Xie, what brings you here

453
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,160
to my house?

454
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,599
Anything?

455
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,759
I'm looking for Su Xie Yi.

456
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:51,720
Is she in there?

457
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:53,079
She is.

458
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,559
But I wonder why

459
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,960
you want to see my girlfriend.

460
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,640
So Shen Xie Qing is in there as well?

461
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,759
Xie Qing?

462
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,240
Didn't Xie Qing jump into the river
and commit suicide?

463
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:07,079
What's the matter?

464
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,200
Are you hiding something?

465
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,200
Drop the act!

466
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:15,279
Mr. Xie.

467
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,000
Are you trying to break into my house?

468
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,279
Entry without consent
is against the law.

469
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,000
As a lawyer,

470
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,400
you should know that, right?

471
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:24,200
Hand both of them over

472
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:24,839
to me now.

473
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:25,359
Don't forget

474
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,200
the evidence that I have.

475
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,839
That recording?

476
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:30,240
Xie Yi has told me everything.

477
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,720
The recording

478
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,920
was edited, right?

479
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,000
If you dare to release it,

480
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:36,640
I'll hire a professional

481
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,880
to conduct a technical appraisal.

482
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:38,920
Also,

483
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,160
all the evidence that you have

484
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,880
won't pass the examination.

485
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,039
Listen up, Xie Ming Hao.

486
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,160
Right now,

487
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:46,079
you have nothing

488
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,519
that can be used as a threat anymore.

489
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:49,319
On the contrary,

490
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,880
you should think about the things

491
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:51,960
that are going to happen to you.

492
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:54,279
Are you talking about Shen Xie Qing?

493
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:55,960
No one will believe her words

494
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:56,640
given that she's a lunatic.

495
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,039
So what if people believe her?

496
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,400
I'm a lawyer.

497
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:00,839
I know how to play with the system.

498
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,720
The funds from Zhiwei

499
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,759
went straight to her account.

500
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,279
It has nothing to do with me at all!

501
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:07,160
Xie Ming Hao.

502
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,079
Xie Yi.

503
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:10,799
You're a monster.

504
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,839
My dad was kind enough
to provide you with financial aid.

505
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:14,079
But you forced him

506
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,519
to commit suicide.

507
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:17,119
My sister loved you so much,

508
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:19,000
but you drove her crazy,
made her take her own life,

509
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,359
and ruined her life

510
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,720
and my family!

511
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:22,759
How do you

512
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,279
have the cheek to show up
in front of me?

513
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,400
Xie Yi, what are you talking about?

514
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:27,680
I did all this

515
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:28,839
for you.

516
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:29,960
You used to be the first person

517
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,319
who protected me.

518
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,240
Why are you...

519
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,319
Why are you standing

520
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,240
on the opposite side now?

521
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,039
Come here.

522
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,440
Listen up!

523
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:37,400
Try taking another step forward

524
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:38,759
and I'll call the police!

525
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,920
Xie Yi, come back...

526
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,680
Every word that you utter right now

527
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:46,279
just makes me hate you even more.

528
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,000
Very well, Su Xie Yi.

529
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,880
You'll regret this.

530
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:56,680
You can only

531
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:58,000
be mine!

532
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,880
As long as you two are together,

533
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,359
I'm not going to spare him.

534
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,559
Just you wait!

535
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,279
I'll destroy Ocean

536
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:06,039
and trample

537
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,160
Li Ze Liang under my feet

538
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,000
until you come begging me

539
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,480
and come back to my side.

540
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:18,960
Lunatic.

541
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:24,279
Yan.

542
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:28,759
Given

543
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,200
Xie Ming Hao's extreme behavior,

544
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,039
I'm afraid

545
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,119
he might do something to hurt you.

546
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,680
Now that you and Xie Qing are back,

547
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:38,240
I have nothing to worry about now.

548
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,160
The one who should be afraid

549
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:41,640
is him.

550
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:45,000
What do you mean?

551
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,759
Go and get changed.

552
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,599
I'm taking you to meet my friends.

553
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:53,160
What about my sister?

554
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:54,759
It's all right.

555
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,960
I'll ask Ying Song to come
and watch over her.

556
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:58,920
If Xie Ming Hao comes back,

557
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:00,319
I'll get the security

558
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,640
to kick him out.

559
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,759
All right.

560
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,440
Don't worry.

561
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,519
Mr. He.

562
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:18,599
Mr. Li.

563
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:19,839
You're here.

564
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,839
Hi, Miss Su.

565
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,160
Hi.

566
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,440
Miss Su.

567
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,720
I'm sorry about last time.

568
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:28,079
No offense.

569
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:31,200
Xie Yi.

570
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,880
Ms. Shi, why are you here?

571
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,799
Oscar.

572
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:38,640
Why are you dressed differently now?

573
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,279
You should call him Mr. Hou now.

574
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,240
He's now the new vice president

575
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,559
of Zhengda Fund.

576
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:45,279
Don't listen to her.

577
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,279
Xie Yi.

578
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,519
Just stick to Oscar will do.

579
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:50,799
Ze Liang.

580
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,799
Now that Xie Yi and Xie Qing are back,

581
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:53,680
you have nothing

582
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:54,839
to worry about now.

583
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:58,079
Mr. He.

584
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,759
Have you made up your mind?

585
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,599
No regrets?

586
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,839
No regrets.

587
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:06,119
I can't keep going down the wrong path.

588
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,279
What's going on here?

589
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:10,640
Liang.

590
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:13,000
Haven't you told Xie Yi?

591
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:21,100
(Mian Bao Hao Le)

592
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,440
That explains why you were so calm.

593
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,559
So you've been secretly

594
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:31,039
having a big plan set in motion.

595
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,279
All's fair in love and war.

596
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,000
That's the man that I love.

597
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:35,880
Smart, forbearing,

598
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:37,119
and visionary.

599
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:40,200
After hearing your compliments,

600
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,240
I suddenly realized

601
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:43,279
I'm actually that great.

602
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,960
I'm just being polite.

603
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:48,880
Yan.

604
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:49,759
Let's have this

605
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,200
for tomorrow's breakfast, all right?

606
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,519
And this.

607
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,680
Excuse me.

608
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,000
Yes?

609
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,240
Please get me

610
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,240
a box of mung bean cakes.

611
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,480
Sure. A moment, please.

612
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,119
I didn't say I wanted that.

613
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,599
Xie Yi.

614
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,079
I know

615
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,240
that you're worried about Xie Qing

616
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,240
and you actually care about her.

617
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:31,640
Xie Qing asked me to relay the message.

618
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,720
She'll take responsibility

619
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,160
for the things she has done.

620
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:39,400
She doesn't expect you to forgive her.

621
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:40,799
But

622
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,039
she hopes you won't hate her anymore.

623
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:45,799
Because it's a great torment

624
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:47,960
to hate a person.

625
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,920
She doesn't want you to suffer.

626
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,839
She wants you to be happy.

627
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:56,880
Xie Yi.

628
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,960
Xie Qing

629
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,680
is your only family.

630
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,200
To forgive her

631
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,759
is to set yourself free.

632
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:26,440
Xie Yi.

633
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,880
I'm sorry.

634
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:06,880
I've failed you.

635
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:13,039
Dad had always

636
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,359
considered me as his own.

637
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,839
But I felt inferior

638
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:18,839
because of my status

639
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,240
as an adopted child

640
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,680
and I always tried to compare to you.

641
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,279
That's how I went astray.

642
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,759
Thank you for coming here.

643
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:40,279
I am sorry.

644
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:43,519
You can hate me.

645
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,559
This is the punishment I deserve.

646
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,279
Xie Qing.

647
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,279
You've suffered enough

648
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,039
in the past two years.

649
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,920
I don't hate you.

650
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,640
Right now,

651
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:07,599
you're my only family.

652
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,599
I think our dad,
who's up there in heaven,

653
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:13,400
doesn't hate you either.

654
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Thank you.

655
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,519
I'm sorry.

656
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,039
Yan.

657
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:52,720
Thank you.

658
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,559
If it hadn't been
for your encouragement,

659
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:56,799
I wouldn't

660
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,240
be able to fix things so quickly
with my sister.

661
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:02,920
You care a lot about Xie Qing.

662
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:06,079
That's something you can't hide.

663
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:09,639
But I was insensible when I was a kid

664
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
and made my sister misunderstand things.

665
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:13,920
Had I

666
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,760
been more sensitive,

667
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,039
my sister

668
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,880
wouldn't have been brainwashed
by Xie Ming Hao.

669
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,000
The status as an adopted daughter

670
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,960
had always been an issue
to Shen Xie Qing.

671
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,800
If she couldn't get over it,

672
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:30,320
no matter how nice

673
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:31,480
and thoughtful you were,

674
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,119
it would be of no use.

675
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:36,199
It's just...

676
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,760
it was a huge price to pay
to finally find closure.

677
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,400
That's right.

678
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:47,159
My sister said she will turn herself in

679
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,039
after this is all over.

680
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,000
But she just regained her consciousness.

681
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:53,880
I can't bear to let her go.

682
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,760
Don't worry.

683
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,239
It will be okay.

684
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:06,639
Oh, right.

685
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:08,039
That day, Xie Ming Hao said

686
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,559
he wants to destroy Ocean's reputation.

687
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,360
We must find a way to stop him.

688
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:13,079
Don't worry.

689
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,199
He won't succeed.

690
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,480
So

691
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,199
are you going to fight back now?

692
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:27,480
Of course.

693
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:30,719
But before that,

694
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,519
there's something more important
that I have to do.

695
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:35,360
What is it?

696
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:38,159
Stamp the papers.

697
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:46,400
(Ocean Group)

698
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,119
Mr. Dai.

699
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,000
You said you want
to change Ocean's name to Zhengcai.

700
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:51,559
Is that true?

701
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:54,199
Back then,

702
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,800
Zhengde and Ocean

703
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,000
were rivals

704
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,199
and enemies.

705
00:35:58,519 --> 00:35:59,719
But things are different now.

706
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:01,119
We're a family.

707
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,239
So we have to act like one.

708
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:05,440
What do you say?

709
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:07,400
Everyone.

710
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:09,440
If there's no other problem,

711
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:10,719
please sign

712
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,639
the shareholder resolution.

713
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:14,159
This is huge.

714
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,880
Mr. Li isn't here yet.

715
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:17,719
All of us...

716
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:27,039
A wise man submits to circumstances.

717
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,360
Sign it.

718
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,519
Sign it.

719
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,360
The meeting is held
before everyone arrives.

720
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,280
Mr. Dai, aren't you being too impatient?

721
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,320
(General Meeting of
Ocean Hotel Corporation's Stockholders)

722
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:46,960
Chairman Li.

723
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:48,559
Oh, not right.

724
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,800
You are no longer

725
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,639
the chairman of Ocean.

726
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,119
I should just call you Mr. Li.

727
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:55,639
Mr. Li, you came just in time.

728
00:36:57,039 --> 00:36:59,119
Please take a look
at the shareholder resolution.

729
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:04,360
You can vote against it.

730
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:05,440
But your vote

731
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,840
won't change anything anyway.

732
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,079
Don't push too far.

733
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:11,679
You know

734
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:12,760
how to make me stop.

735
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:14,599
Xie Ming Hao.

736
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Your threat is no longer valid.

737
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,639
All right.

738
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:20,679
Same old rules.

739
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,000
Let's vote.

740
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,400
Vote.

741
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,840
Think no more. Let's vote.

742
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,800
I'm against it.

743
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,159
It's 10 AM.

744
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,280
Mr. Dai.

745
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,559
It's my turn now.

746
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,519
What does that mean?

747
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:41,639
Your turn? My turn?

748
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,039
What are you saying?

749
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,440
Mr. Dai, this is bad.

750
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,199
He Jiang Hua made an exposé

751
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:49,760
on the Internet.

752
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:51,320
Zhengde is in trouble.

753
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,000
(I'm He Jiang Hua.)

754
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:56,199
(I'm making this video)

755
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:57,679
(to solemnly)

756
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,440
(apologize to my fans)

757
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,199
(who have always supported me)

758
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:03,920
(and trusted me.)

759
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,400
(I've made a grave mistake.)

760
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,559
(I previously made an exposé)

761
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,559
(of Lantian Bay
construction project proposal.)

762
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,000
(It was actually)

763
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:13,559
(obtained from Dai Zi Ang,)

764
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,599
(the chairman of Zhengde Group.)

765
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,960
(Later on, the fire
at the Lantian Bay construction site)

766
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:19,760
(was also)

767
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,760
(done by me
at Dai Zi Ang's instigation.)

768
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,920
(In order to get exclusive stories,)

769
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:26,880
(I've stooped to becoming)

770
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:28,639
(an accomplice to discredit Ocean.)

771
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:30,079
(This went against my conscience)

772
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,760
(as a human being)

773
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:33,400
(and my original aspiration)

774
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:35,000
(when first getting into this industry.)

775
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,880
(To Ocean and those whom)

776
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:38,800
(I've hurt,)

777
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,239
(I hereby)

778
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:42,519
(sincerely apologize)

779
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:45,000
(with all of my heart.)

780
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:46,559
(After this,)

781
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,280
(I'll turn myself in to the police)

782
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,199
(and take responsibility
for what I've done.)

783
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,559
(Let my fate)

784
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:52,679
(be a lesson to all of you.)

785
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,800
Nonsense!

786
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:55,920
Li Ze Liang.

787
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:57,639
You must have a death wish.

788
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,719
Mr. Dai.

789
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:00,920
There's a conflict close to home now.

790
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,480
If I were you,

791
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,639
I wouldn't waste a single minute.

792
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:06,760
That makes sense. Move!

793
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,719
Call off the meeting.

794
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,719
Just you wait.

795
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,639
That's all for today.

796
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,000
We'll continue at another time.

797
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:25,840
Go on.

798
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,000
Hang in there.

799
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,360
Buy back all of Zhengde's stocks.

800
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:36,480
(Zhengde Group)
Buy all that there is in the market.

801
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:37,679
Be sure to stabilize the stock price

802
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:38,880
to avoid panic in the market.

803
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,000
Shut up! Get it done!

804
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,190
Here.

805
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:47,070
(Board Chairman)
Thank you.

806
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,039
What's the situation

807
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:50,199
with Zhengde's stock price now?

808
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,760
It's down by 10 percent.

809
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:53,440
They've noticed

810
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,639
and they're frantically

811
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:55,280
buying back their own shares

812
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,800
to delay the fall in stock prices.

813
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:58,960
But someone
in the Hong Kong, China stock market

814
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:00,840
took the opportunity
to short their stocks.

815
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,519
What a surprise!

816
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:04,920
Dai Zi Ang is arrogant and bossy.

817
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:06,119
He has offended many people

818
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,599
in the business world.

819
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,960
It's normal if people

820
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:10,400
kick him while he's down.

821
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:13,920
That's what they say.
What goes around comes around.

822
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:15,760
Previously,

823
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,159
they spent a lot of money

824
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,679
to acquire Ocean's equity.

825
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,239
I'm afraid they won't be able
to hold out any longer.

826
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,360
Oscar.

827
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:23,840
The rest is on you.

828
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,079
Okay.

829
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,800
It has dropped
almost below 20 percent now.

830
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:38,039
Dai Zi Ang couldn't resist the pressure

831
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:39,119
and started to sell

832
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:39,880
Ocean's stock

833
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:40,800
to save Zhengde.

834
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:42,280
Oscar.

835
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,679
It's showtime.

836
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:45,000
Buy all of Ocean stocks

837
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:45,679
that Dai Zi Ang sold

838
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,360
under Zhengda Fund.

839
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:48,639
Won't you reconsider it?

840
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,639
If that's the case,

841
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:51,159
Zhengda

842
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,239
will be Ocean's

843
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,400
largest shareholder.

844
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,199
I have you, don't I?

845
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,159
