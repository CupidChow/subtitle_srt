00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:15,040

2
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:25,100
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

3
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:33,610
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

4
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:41,330
♫  And turn to face all the long lost times  ♫

5
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,370
♫  Brace the pain  ♫

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:51,210
♫  Let memories wake up from oceans deep  ♫

7
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,250
♫  No place to hide  ♫

8
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,450
♫  No way to run  ♫

9
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,820
♫  New dawn counts down  ♫

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,930
♫  I fight  ♫

11
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,010
♫  I cry  ♫

12
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,600
♫  I give up  ♫

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:15,710
♫  Memories forgotten, forsaken surround  ♫

14
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:24,030
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

15
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:32,270
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

16
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:40,850
♫  Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

17
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:49,650
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

18
00:01:49,650 --> 00:02:00,020

19
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,040

20
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:10,040
I'm here mainly

21
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:14,259
to apologize to you.

22
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:20,600
I shouldn't have doubted you.

23
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:27,360
Actually, I already recognized you from the first day we met.

24
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,560
But when I knew you lost your memories,

25
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,919
I was worried you would forget about me

26
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,479
and I was scared I would behave recklessly.

27
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:41,179
So I couldn't tell you the truth,

28
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:44,380
which led to testing you.

29
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:50,680
But I'm here to tell you

30
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,120
that I'm certain you're still the same girl I knew.

31
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,880
Mr. Li, I've given it thought.

32
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:14,340
About me being the girl you've met, I'm going to let that pass.

33
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,019
After all, we need to move forward.

34
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:20,419
Even if I was involved with you in the past,

35
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:24,200
but I'm sure it wasn't a pleasant one, judging from how you were resisting me.

36
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,599
Since it wasn't a pleasant one, why bring trouble to yourself?

37
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:33,260
So I've decided to stop thinking about the past.

38
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,500
Okay.

39
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,340
Since you're not willing to remember the past,

40
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,619
you can consider we're getting to know each other again. Am I right?

41
00:03:48,619 --> 00:03:51,019
You may be my subordinate.

42
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:55,900
Don't tell me we can't be friends again.

43
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,879
- What are you doing? 
 - Didn't you say to be friends?

44
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,020
Is there a need to sit so close, then?

45
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,480
I live here. I'm used to sitting here.

46
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,740
Fine.

47
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:42,100
Miss Su, the design and furnishings of your house

48
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,670
bring a sense of nostalgia.

49
00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:49,810
Why would a young and fashionable lady like you

50
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,530
choose to live in a house like this?

51
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:55,059
 There he goes again.

52
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,720
My dad left his house for me. I lived here when I was a kid.

53
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,819
He bought all the furniture in this house. So I want to keep it the same.

54
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,640
I see.

55
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:15,020
By the way, do you still remember how you lost your memories?

56
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,319
I know some friends from the medical industry.

57
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,260
They might be able to help.

58
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,439
I said it was an accident.

59
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:25,590
As for the details, I don't remember

60
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,580
and I don't want to remember.

61
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:36,319
Do you remember I've given you a business card with my contact details?

62
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,060
Haven't you thought of contacting me for the past two years?

63
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:47,279
I'm sorry.

64
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:49,920
I don't remember about this.

65
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,279
If you think I'm lying to you, there's nothing I can do.

66
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:56,299
You are lying to me.

67
00:05:56,299 --> 00:05:58,499
What?

68
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:02,800
I see you have a coffee machine.

69
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,660
All right.

70
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,399
If you want to have some coffee, I can brew a cup for you.

71
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,999
Okay.

72
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:23,480
After you finish your coffee, please leave my house.

73
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,180
Okay.

74
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,950

75
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,879
Your coffee is here.

76
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,479
Thank you.

77
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,519
It tastes good.

78
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,979
The good thing about coffee is you'll feel more awake after drinking it.

79
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,859
That way, you won't get lost when you go home.

80
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,920
Okay. Thank you, Miss Su.

81
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,060
I'll get going, then.

82
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,919
I won't see you off.

83
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,979
Take good care of the coat.

84
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:57,340
Thank you, Director Li.

85
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:01,220
It's the current season's limited edition. It suits you. Remember to wear it tomorrow.

86
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,179
- Okay, Director Li. 
  - I'm leaving now.

87
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:06,260
Director Li, see you.

88
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,600
See you.

89
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,319
He must be up to no good for giving me the coat.

90
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:26,179
Could he have installed something in my house?

91
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,680

92
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,840
 My dad had always wanted to watch the sunrise here.

93
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,159
 But he was busy working all the time.

94
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:31,300
 That's why I come here secretly to snap a picture of the sunrise

95
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,280
 and give it to him as a birthday present.

96
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,240
 He'll love it.

97
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,940
Xie Ming Hao was Zhiwei's commercial lawyer.

98
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,820
No wonder they know each other.

99
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:51,379
Mr. Li, do you think Miss Su is related to Zhiwei?

100
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:52,979
It's possible.

101
00:09:52,979 --> 00:09:56,139
Will she get in the way of our plan?

102
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,100
Keep an eye on her.

103
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,500
Okay.

104
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,520
Mr. Li, Uncle Bai knows a lot about Zhiwei, right?

105
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,859
You can ask him tomorrow.

106
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,659
- Good morning. 
 - Morning.

107
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,580
- Morning. 
 - Morning.

108
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,280
Wait a minute.

109
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:23,579
Wait.

110
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:27,919
 I'm so sorry.

111
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,440
 I'm sorry.

112
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:37,980
Your clothes look pretty.

113
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,619
Thank you.

114
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:42,460
How does it feel to have an admirer?

115
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,639
What?

116
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:48,539
I saw someone carrying these clothes into the office.

117
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:53,300
So are you going to admit it or let me expose you?

118
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,600
What nonsense are you talking about?

119
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,779
If I'm not mistaken, he must be Director Li's

120
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:05,639
driver, Ji Yingsong.

121
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,179
Bingo!

122
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:08,959
Is there no one else you can think of?

123
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,220
Driver?

124
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,899
What driver?

125
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:14,879
This little lady has an admirer.

126
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:20,300
We can see Miss Su Xieyi usually keeps a poker face.

127
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,639
But she's passionate deep down.

128
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:29,460
You're chattering instead of getting changed during work time.

129
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,200
Do you want to get fired?

130
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,700
We'll have a meeting in the meeting room in five minutes.

131
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,600
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

132
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,060
I've read the bidding plan of the Fujiade Auction.

133
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,200
Yunfeng Hotel is Ocean's new signature hotel.

134
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,499
Its advantages are not reflected in the plan at all.

135
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,379
Redo it. I'll give you one day.

136
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:18,760
Other than that, the sales of the minibar have been decreasing.

137
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,639
Why?

138
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,059
Su Xieyi, what do you think?

139
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:31,160
I've looked into it.

140
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,539
There was no decrease in the sales of the minibar.

141
00:12:34,539 --> 00:12:38,440
But the guest's single consumption is not high.

142
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,300
It only meets the minimum cost.

143
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,580
This is exactly what I want you to know.

144
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:48,220
One expensive product can increase the overall performance.

145
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,279
I don't care what methods you're going to use.

146
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,340
I want you to sell the bar's expensive champagne and red wine!

147
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,120
Also, the minibar snack sales are terrible.

148
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,440
The types of snacks are too outdated now.

149
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,779
Can't you survey the market to find new products?

150
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:07,220
It must be savory, so the alcohol can sell.

151
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,640
Stop trying to pass off with dessert and wafers.

152
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,659
Find something more interesting, understand?

153
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:16,679
 Yes.

154
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:20,000
Su Xieyi.

155
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,580
I'll leave the market research to you.

156
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,159
Okay.

157
00:13:43,595 --> 00:13:45,550
Uncle Bai.

158
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,140
You're here. Sit.

159
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:02,219
This watch has been with Old Li for decades.

160
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,899
It's as old as me. I won't be useful anymore.

161
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,339
People are nostalgic.

162
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:19,799
I disagree with that. Only those who cherish relationships are like that.

163
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:29,379
Uncle Bai,

164
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:36,339
were you the one who set up the deal between my dad and Zhiwei?

165
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:38,559
It was decades ago.

166
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,300
At that time, we were still a small company.

167
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,060
So what do you want to know?

168
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,259
Well, here is the thing.

169
00:14:54,259 --> 00:15:00,780
Do you recall any of Zhiwei's top management or anyone

170
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,020
with the last name Su?

171
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:07,899
I can't recall any for a moment there.

172
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,399
How about anyone related to Shen Zhihong?

173
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,139
Shen Zhihong's wife. His wife's last name is Su.

174
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:23,519
But she passed away from illness more than ten years ago.

175
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,420
 They had a daughter.

176
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,139
 But they took her to live abroad a long time ago.

177
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:40,679
 Is his daughter's name Su Xieyi?

178
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:43,340
 I think so.

179
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,259
 Su Xieyi,

180
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:09,420
 you came to Ocean to investigate your dad's cause of death.

181
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:27,759
It's lunchtime. Someone owes me a meal.

182
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,080
When?

183
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,540
It was on the day of Miss Shi's welcoming party.

184
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,120
You were gone and came back.

185
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,919
You even asked me to keep it a secret. Have you forgotten?

186
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:40,759
Ah, I remember now.

187
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:42,919
Okay, I'll treat you today.

188
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,419
Let's go.

189
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,379

190
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:50,540
I said I'm treating you to a meal. Why are we eating at the cafeteria?

191
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:54,619
I'm someone with principle. A driver is pursuing you.

192
00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:55,899
I'm not going to empty your pocket.

193
00:16:55,899 --> 00:17:00,740
If an executive likes you someday, it won't be too late to treat me to a big meal, then.

194
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,499
You got it all wrong.

195
00:17:10,499 --> 00:17:12,819
See that?

196
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:18,699
Fine, I get it. If I were you, I'd not be willing to admit it too.

197
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,019
Just eat.

198
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:29,020
By the way, I watched Yunfeng Hotel's promotional video today. It was done very well.

199
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,879
Of course. We spent a lot on it.

200
00:17:31,879 --> 00:17:35,500
It's going to be Ocean Hotel Corporation's new image.

201
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,419
It's such a great project.

202
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:40,060
The person in charge must be capable.

203
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,340
Do you mean Chen Hengsheng?

204
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,139
Do you mean Chen Hengsheng?

205
00:17:45,139 --> 00:17:47,319
He is a legend.

206
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:50,680
When it comes to luck, no one can beat him.

207
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,440
Why?

208
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,240
You might not believe it if I tell you.

209
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,079
He was only Director Li's assistant two years ago.

210
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:03,139
For these two years, he suddenly became Yunfeng Hotel's General Manager.

211
00:18:03,139 --> 00:18:08,880
If it was in ancient times, he had been promoted three ranks at one go.

212
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,859
I see.

213
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:12,479
Yes.

214
00:18:12,479 --> 00:18:15,680
I'm still sorting out Hengye Bank's cocktail party list for the day after tomorrow.

215
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,299
He is also invited.

216
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,899
I suddenly remembered I need to send an urgent email.

217
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:26,480
I'll get back to work first.

218
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,160
Okay. I'll treat you to a big meal some other day.

219
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,260
Bye-bye.

220
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,960
You're pretty obsessed.

221
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:55,640
- Let me clean it for you. 
 - Stop!

222
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,899
I'll do it myself.

223
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,039
I'm here to tell you one thing.

224
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:11,359
You can't solve some gaps with haute couture.

225
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,040

226
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,720

227
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,350

228
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,799
Do the clothes fit you?

229
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,680
Yes.

230
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:23,640
What's wrong with him?

231
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,179
Did he come here just to ask that one question?

232
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:28,200
What does that mean?

233
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:33,259
I even answered him. There's something wrong with me too.

234
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:39,440
Why do you want to see me?

235
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,300
Can't I have a chat with you?

236
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,599
I mean, you have never come to work before.

237
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:51,000
Not only are you coming now, you even come early.

238
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,419
Why is that, Director Li?

239
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,599
I thought you always wanted me to come to work.

240
00:20:56,599 --> 00:21:01,300
So you'll be attending the cocktail party the day after tomorrow, right?

241
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:05,339
You know I'm never interested in parties like these.

242
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,780
What are you doing?

243
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,599
It's work.

244
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:14,839
You won't forget it this way.

245
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:17,879
Fine.

246
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,559
After you come back, we haven't had a proper catch-up.

247
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,359
Let's meet at the usual place tonight.

248
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:25,919
Okay. My treat.

249
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,200
I happen to have something to tell you.

250
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,000
What is it?

251
00:21:38,379 --> 00:21:40,079
I'll tell you tonight.

252
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,679
See you tonight.

253
00:21:57,699 --> 00:22:02,160
When do you think we can attend such a high-end cocktail party?

254
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:06,619
If it's like you said,

255
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,359
Thanks.

256
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:12,270
Just perform well. If Director Shi is satisfied,

257
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:15,300
she might take us along.

258
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,179
- Director Shi? 
 - Yes.

259
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:19,419
Her family owns Hengye Bank.

260
00:22:19,419 --> 00:22:21,959
It's also our company's important partner.

261
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:26,100
When they were organizing events, some of us were asked to help out.

262
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:33,479
But speaking of which, Miss Shi asked you to do market research on snacks.

263
00:22:33,479 --> 00:22:36,920
I find it a waste of your talent.

264
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,400
Not at all. Details determine one's success or failure.

265
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,920
I think Director Shi is right.

266
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,000
So I must do my job seriously.

267
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,920
Where are you going?

268
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,160
Going back to work.

269
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,379
You really know what you're doing.

270
00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:56,479
If this goes on, Director Shi will take you to the cocktail party sooner or later.

271
00:22:56,479 --> 00:22:57,559
Listen.

272
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:04,079
Anyone you can attract at the cocktail party is better than that driver.

273
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,700
Oh, right. The employee handbook states

274
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,480
that new employees have a free night's stay at the hotel.

275
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,519
Is it true?

276
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:20,880
Of course. You can let me have it if you don't use it.

277
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,581
Or are you... Are you going to spend the night with that driver?

278
00:23:23,581 --> 00:23:24,839
Stop it right there.

279
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:29,819
My house is far from here. I need to work overtime, so I won't be going home.

280
00:23:29,819 --> 00:23:31,960
Everything is for efficiency.

281
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:41,420

282
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,240
Mr. Li, other than having lunch with Gong Mingyue,

283
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,019
Miss Su had been busy working. She made no contact with Huojian.

284
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:15,060
You can stop watching her. I already know her identity.

285
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,799
Uncle Bai sent a message and said she booked a room at the hotel.

286
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,860
She booked a room?

287
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:24,379
What room?

288
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,640
A double room.

289
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,359
Uncle Bai also said he saw some man get in.

290
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:32,359
Who?

291
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:34,279
Not only one.

292
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:36,120
Countless men are going in and out of the room.

293
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,840
- Room number? 
 - 0308.

294
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,520
Coming!

295
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,039
Director Li?

296
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:48,740
- You... 
 - Hello, did you call for FlashEx?

297
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,559
- Yes. 
 - Please show me your Flash code.

298
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,159
Thanks.

299
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:55,620
- Here you go. 
-  Thank you.

300
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,780
Why are you here?

301
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,759
What are you doing here?

302
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,379
I'm working.

303
00:25:10,379 --> 00:25:12,679
All by yourself?

304
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:14,259
Two.

305
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,820
You're alone. Why didn't you go home and book a hotel room here?

306
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,759
Instead of going home after work, why do you care if I booked a hotel room?

307
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:22,699
You're an employee of the General Manager's Office.

308
00:25:22,699 --> 00:25:24,720
You should take care of your reputation.

309
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,020
Can't an employee stay at their company's hotel?

310
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,219
That's not what I meant.

311
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:41,659
Are those men here to deliver all these?

312
00:25:41,659 --> 00:25:43,459
What else?

313
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,440
Did you think I booked a hotel room to sleep with someone?

314
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,699
Wait.

315
00:25:52,699 --> 00:25:54,720
How did you know I'm here?

316
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,759
Are you... Are you going to say you happened to pass by,

317
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:02,919
or are you testing me and investigating me again?

318
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:07,539
I...

319
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:13,020
 But she died from illness more than ten years ago.

320
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,619
 She had a daughter with Shen Zhihong.

321
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,160
 The child is really pitiful.

322
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,279
 She lived with her mom abroad since young.

323
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,899
 She has lost her father and has no one to lean on now.

324
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:40,799
Director Li, are you okay?

325
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:51,059
I'm fine.

326
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,459
Let's go.

327
00:26:58,459 --> 00:27:00,939
I'll book another room for you.

328
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:14,760
As expected from you. You can get a room just like that.

329
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,960
Did you only have snacks for dinner tonight?

330
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:21,419
Yes. That's a task Director Shi assigned to me.

331
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:23,459
Do you want to help me?

332
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,000
I don't know anything about snacks.

333
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,620
I should order some food for you.

334
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:35,459
You don't know snacks, but you know Director Shi.

335
00:27:35,459 --> 00:27:37,780
Everyone here knows about your relationship.

336
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:42,319
You're old friends and a match made in heaven in everyone's eyes.

337
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:45,540
You're new here, so you might not know this.

338
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,359
Nothing is going on between Chuchu and me.

339
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:51,640
Director Li, you don't have to explain this matter to me.

340
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,720
Have some.

341
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:01,930
 It's the invitation to Hengye Bank's cocktail party.

342
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,720
 I don't have to spare any effort to look for it at all.

343
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,119
Miss Su, how long have you lived in Germany?

344
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:12,520
I have lived there since I was young. I lived with my mom.

345
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:17,559
But... I graduated alone there afterward.

346
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:23,680
 I must find ways to get a hold of his invitation.

347
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:28,240
You must have felt lonely being in a foreign country alone.

348
00:28:28,899 --> 00:28:30,440
Lonely?

349
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,600
Loneliness comes after luxury in life.

350
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:39,600
If a person works seven days a week and is too busy to make a living,

351
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,799
he won't have the time to feel lonely.

352
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,760
So loneliness is a rich person's disease.

353
00:28:45,899 --> 00:28:47,859
That's enough.

354
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:49,419
Stop eating these.

355
00:28:49,419 --> 00:28:54,960
It may be for work. But it's not good for your health to eat like this.

356
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,000
 This guy doesn't have any good intentions every time he pretends to care about me.

357
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,500
 Just look at him.

358
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,219
 After you passed out from drinking, I'm going to take the invitation.

359
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,270
Director Li, if you really sympathize with your employees,

360
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:12,720
why don't you accompany me to relax for a bit?

361
00:29:12,721 --> 00:29:14,540
How about we have some alcohol?

362
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:18,800
My work has been giving me a lot of pressure lately. What do you think?

363
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,880
Sure.

364
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,380
All right.

365
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:33,979
Director Li, let's drink until we drop.

366
00:29:38,899 --> 00:29:41,060
Here, cheers!

367
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:46,880
Director Li, I get drunk easily.

368
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:52,300
Besides, it's dangerous for a woman to get drunk outside.

369
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,459
Don't worry.

370
00:29:57,459 --> 00:30:00,640
I won't let you drink a lot or let you be in danger.

371
00:30:27,699 --> 00:30:31,300
Director Li, are you okay?

372
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:38,380
Miss Su, do you have anything you like

373
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:42,619
or perhaps any wishes?

374
00:30:42,619 --> 00:30:44,279
You can tell me.

375
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:46,520
Maybe I can help you fulfill it.

376
00:30:47,619 --> 00:30:50,780
 Seriously? He's already drunk?

377
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:54,020
 Can you give me your invitation card?

378
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:02,319
You want this?

379
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,540
I can give it to you if you want it.

380
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,720
I don't want it.

381
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,500
What am I going to do with this?

382
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,859
I can't eat it.

383
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,680
You're right.

384
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,000
Tell me after you've thought about it.

385
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:21,799
I'm sorry.

386
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:24,620
I have plans. So I'll get going first.

387
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,419
Director Li, drink one more glass.

388
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:34,240
It's a waste of this liquor.

389
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,619
You can drink anything from the bar.

390
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:40,080
Just put it on my tab. I'll pay for it.

391
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:45,400
Also, when you work overtime in the future, let me know.

392
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,820
I'll keep this room vacant for you.

393
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,920
You can stay anytime you want.

394
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,559
Director Li, goodbye.

395
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,379
What's wrong with him?

396
00:32:04,379 --> 00:32:08,999
How come the gentler he is, the more afraid I am?

397
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:17,020
Director Shi, I've already completed the survey on snacks in the market as you've asked.

398
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,820
That's fast.

399
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,300
I don't dare to slack off.

400
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:24,160
If I can complete it a day earlier, the sales volume can increase a day earlier.

401
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,000
These snacks are my recommendations.

402
00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:32,340
I also have the online reviews and a report on my personal experience

403
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,799
during the taste test.

404
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:44,139
Well done. You're really efficient.

405
00:32:44,139 --> 00:32:45,770
Good timing.

406
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:46,790
I happen to have a decision to inform you.

407
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:52,280
From tomorrow on, you don't have to come to work anymore.

408
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,240
You're fired.

409
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:04,199
Why?

410
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,540
Sorry about that.

411
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:10,200
Your compensation will be paid accordingly to the employee agreement.

412
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,820
You can work at another company.

413
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,659
I'll write a recommendation letter for you.

414
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:17,600
Don't worry. It won't be worse than Ocean.

415
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,400
May I know the reason?

416
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,899
No reason.

417
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:24,139
It's my personal decision.

418
00:33:24,139 --> 00:33:26,839
All right. The meeting is over.

419
00:33:42,699 --> 00:33:44,979
It's because of Director Li, right?

420
00:33:46,699 --> 00:33:48,920
You like Director Li.

421
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,319
I don't think it concerns you.

422
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:58,779
You can leave now. I have a meeting with Chairman Huo later.

423
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:03,279
If this is the reason, it does concern me.

424
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,379
Miss Su, let me repeat this.

425
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:10,659
You're fired. Please get out.

426
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,599
Who are you firing?

427
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,979
- Chairman Huo. 
 - Chairman.

428
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:22,580
Chuchu, this isn't your way of doing things.

429
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,760
Whose idea was it?

430
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,719
The General Manager's Office is fully staffed now.

431
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:32,039
It's the procedure of terminating those who performed poorly, that's all.

432
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:33,900
Okay.

433
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:38,219
But I do admire Miss Su's capabilities.

434
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:39,759
How about this?

435
00:34:39,759 --> 00:34:43,739
On my side, Yi Fei happens to need an assistant.

436
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:47,400
Transfer her to my office first, okay?

437
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:52,180
Since you asked, of course, it's okay.

438
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:56,680
By the way, I've received the invitation to Hengye Bank's cocktail party.

439
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,259
Thank your dad for me. I'll be there tomorrow.

440
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:14,380
What's going on?

441
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,440
I want to know too.

442
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,040
 I've failed.

443
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:30,021
 Huo Jian kept Su Xieyi.

444
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:36,819
 You're finally here.

445
00:35:36,819 --> 00:35:37,860
 Here.

446
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,139
 Didn't you say you wanted to tell me something?

447
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:43,919
 Do you know Su Xieyi, your subordinate?

448
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:47,219
 Fire her.

449
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:49,740
 Are you kidding? Why?

450
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,539
 I'm curious too.

451
00:35:52,539 --> 00:35:56,080
 What's your relationship with her?

452
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:59,139
 No relationship at all.

453
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:04,539
 In any case, I don't want to see her at Ocean anymore.

454
00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:07,660
 I still need a reason, right?

455
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,159
 What about poor performance?

456
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:14,119
 She's the most outstanding among the newcomers.

457
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:17,599
 I can't take this reason.

458
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,919
 Just consider doing me a favor, then.

459
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:27,019
 I have my own principle.

460
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:31,060
 I can't fire an innocent employee for no reason at all.

461
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:35,820
 She has already disrupted my work arrangement.

462
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,460
 I can only tell you this.

463
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,830
 If she continues working at Ocean,

464
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:42,580
 I won't come to work anymore.

465
00:36:43,439 --> 00:36:45,779
 You're making it sound so serious.

466
00:36:45,779 --> 00:36:48,920
 A'Liang must have his reason for doing this.

467
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,700
 Besides, no one can change the decision he has made.

468
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,240
 I'll leave it to you.

469
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:13,260
 It'll be the first and the last.

470
00:37:23,459 --> 00:37:25,799
What's wrong, Mr. Li?

471
00:37:25,799 --> 00:37:27,880
Huo Jian transferred Su Xieyi to his office.

472
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,360
It seems we have to carry out our plan earlier.

473
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,139
Will Miss Su be in danger?

474
00:37:35,939 --> 00:37:40,560
To be honest, I don't know why you made that decision.

475
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,060
Can't you see?

476
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,559
Firing Su Xieyi is Li Zeliang's order.

477
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,360
Since you think Li Zeliang

478
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,679
arranged Su Xieyi to work at the General Manager's Office

479
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:57,020
to go against you, wouldn't it be better for her to leave?

480
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,740
That's the weird part.

481
00:38:01,699 --> 00:38:06,079
She was transferred there and here.

482
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,139
Now, he wants to fire her.

483
00:38:08,139 --> 00:38:09,920
It's indeed weird.

484
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,540
Given the fact that Secretary Lin and her sneaked into the Archive,

485
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,760
if your assumption is right,

486
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,960
that means Li Zeliang wants to use Zhiwei Corporation through Su Xieyi

487
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,800
to go against you.

488
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,260
But everything is just our assumption.

489
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,939
See this?

490
00:38:25,939 --> 00:38:29,939
No matter what kind of fish you keep watching for a few days,

491
00:38:29,939 --> 00:38:32,319
you'll naturally see

492
00:38:32,319 --> 00:38:34,599
what's wrong with it.

493
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,579
Shi Chuchu wanted to fire you, but Huo Jian kept you?

494
00:38:42,579 --> 00:38:45,919
Yes. Isn't that interesting?

495
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:49,920
Have you thought of the reason?

496
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,679
As for the specifics, I don't know.

497
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:55,039
But there's one thing I'm certain of.

498
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:57,760
Huo Jian is showing his power.

499
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,940
Don't you find yourself falling into a game?

500
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,239
The outcome is more important to me.

501
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:08,250
To have Huo Jian think highly of me

502
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,840
might give me more advantages for my investigation.

503
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:15,800
Xieyi, it doesn't matter if it's Li Zeliang or anyone from Ocean.

504
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,400
They could do that to Zhiwei.

505
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:22,500
If they find out your identity, can't you imagine the consequences?

506
00:39:28,939 --> 00:39:30,639
Brother Ming Hao,

507
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,139
I came here to ask a favor from you.

508
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,779
I want to attend Hengye Bank's cocktail party.

509
00:39:39,779 --> 00:39:42,239
Your law firm is also their partner.

510
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:46,420
I'm sure they invited you to their thank-you reception, right?

511
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:49,920
I know you've always been very opposed to my plan.

512
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,800
So I wouldn't have come to you if I had no choice.

513
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,000
But this is important to me.

514
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,159
I need to find someone.

515
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:03,119
Who's that?

516
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,260
Chen Hengsheng.

517
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,780
He's also on the invitation list of Hengye Bank this time.

518
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:12,239
Two years ago, he was the manager of the Ocean's Food and Beverage Department.

519
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:14,679
He was the one who signed the contract.

520
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,320
He must know something.

521
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:23,119
Xieyi, you can't back out once you start on some things.

522
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,439
But you still have a chance to back out now.

523
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,760
I know that.

524
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,320
But I don't want to stop now.

525
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:38,360
Perhaps you can try to let go of your hatred and relax a bit.

526
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,320
You're still young and there are many paths you can take.

527
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,280
But the opportunity is right in front of me.

528
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,039
I'm not willing to give it up.

529
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:49,580
Brother Ming Hao, please help me with this once.

530
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:55,760
I promise I'll stop after I'm done investigating Chen Hengsheng.

531
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,160
You'll need to promise me

532
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,220
not to do anything reckless tomorrow.

533
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,619
Okay, I promise.

534
00:41:03,619 --> 00:41:05,519
Thank you, Brother Ming Hao.

535
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,471
Since you're sure of Miss Su's identity,

536
00:41:58,471 --> 00:42:01,780
don't you think it's better to reveal it to her?

537
00:42:03,139 --> 00:42:05,079
You don't know her.

538
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:10,359
If I tell her the truth, she'll go straight to Huo Jian.

539
00:42:11,059 --> 00:42:13,539
Are you worried about her safety?

540
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:20,619
I'm worried it'll alert Huo Jian and ruin my plan.

541
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:29,299
The day my dad passed away two years ago,

542
00:42:29,299 --> 00:42:32,280
the security cameras at the hospital happened to be out of order.

543
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:38,560
But my dad clearly told me over the phone that he would only give

544
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,680
one percent of the shares to Huo Jian.

545
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:45,019
But when I came back, there was

546
00:42:45,019 --> 00:42:47,879
ten percent of the shares in the agreement.

547
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:52,779
There are too many questionable things in here.

548
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:58,439
Even if he's the biggest suspect, we have no direct evidence, after all.

549
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:04,779
So I don't want to alert Huo Jian just yet.

550
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:10,159
Mr. Li, what do we do now?

551
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:13,739
Huo Jian keeps Miss Su by his side must be because he wants to look into her.

552
00:43:13,739 --> 00:43:20,559
Huo Jian is suspecting Su Xieyi now because she's close to me.

553
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:24,040
So he won't do anything reckless to her.

554
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,019
It's just...

555
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,280
that Su Xieyi still doesn't know

556
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,620
how terrible the enemy she has to face is.
