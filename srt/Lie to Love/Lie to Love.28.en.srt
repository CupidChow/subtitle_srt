19
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:14,479
Xie Yi?

20
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:16,240
What brings you here?

21
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,360
Why didn't you give me a call?

22
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,120
I thought you'd be at home.

23
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,759
Where have you been?

24
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,879
To discard the trash.

25
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,039
What is it? Did something happen?

26
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:29,360
Let's talk inside.

27
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:35,960
I'll pour you some water.

28
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:44,800
Did you

29
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,840
meet Li Ze Liang yesterday?

30
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,680
Did he tell you that?

31
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,800
Did they also tell you

32
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:53,719
that I was the one

33
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,840
who introduced the supplier?

34
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,199
And that I'm related

35
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,280
to the guy they suspected, He Jiang Hua?

36
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,919
That I'm the mastermind?

37
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:00,879
Are you trying to say

38
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,439
that you didn't do any of these?

39
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:03,840
Indeed,

40
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,039
I went to see Li Ze Liang yesterday.

41
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,439
But I just wanted

42
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,479
to ask him

43
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,520
what really went down,

44
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,400
and if there was anything 

45
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,560
I could do to help.

46
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,080
I don't know

47
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,680
what's Li Ze Liang's motive

48
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,919
for telling you this.

49
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,960
Here. Sit down and talk.

50
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,039
You're lying.

51
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,439
You've been lying to me all along.

52
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,759
Why would I lie to you?

53
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:27,520
All these years,

54
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,599
how have I treated you

55
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,599
and Xie Qing?

56
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,759
You should know better, right?

57
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,199
Drop the act already.

58
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,840
All these years,

59
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,120
you've been playing

60
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:37,479
a perfect and affectionate fiance.

61
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,960
It's so foolish of me

62
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,400
to be deceived

63
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,719
by this facade that you put on.

64
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,520
My sister

65
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,719
had been with you for so long.

66
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:46,919
But she didn't sense

67
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,680
the slightest bit of love.

68
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:49,759
Instead,

69
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,000
she was controlled

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,520
by a dangerous lunatic!

71
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,080
Well,

72
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:01,960
do you know

73
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,520
why I did all this?

74
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,360
That's because

75
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,439
Xie Qing is the bond
that ties us together.

76
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,439
Once I leave her,

77
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,080
you'll drift further away from me.

78
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,360
I'm doing all this

79
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,360
for you.

80
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,439
Tell me.

81
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,240
The things that happened to my sister.

82
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,319
Was it your doing?

83
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,040
The things that happened to Zhiwei
two years ago.

84
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,639
Was it you too?

85
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,079
Okay.

86
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,639
You can tell that to the police.

87
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,120
Su Xie Yi.

88
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,800
Do you still want to see your sister?

89
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,399
What do you mean?

90
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,680
As I said,

91
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,480
she's the bond that ties us together.

92
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,439
How could I bear to let her die?

93
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,240
You can go to the police.

94
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,360
But I promise you.

95
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:55,079
You're not going

96
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,319
to see your sister ever again.

97
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,079
She'll starve to death.

98
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,600
Where is she?

99
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,360
What did you do to her?

100
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,519
You really do love your sister dearly.

101
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,519
Promise me one thing,

102
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,360
and you'll get to see her.

103
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,240
Break up with Li Ze Liang.

104
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,920
Promise me you'll never see him again,

105
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,759
and you'll stay by my side forever.

106
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,639
You wish!

107
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,319
Fine.

108
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,079
If so, you're going to lose your sister

109
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,240
for real.

110
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,480
Why should I believe you?

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,560
How do I know

112
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,199
if you're not lying to me again?

113
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:42,519
It's been so long,

114
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,680
and they didn't recover her body.

115
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:44,920
Do you think that's normal?

116
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,040
Also,

117
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,639
the mung bean cakes you saw last time,

118
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,399
I prepared them for Shen Xie Qing.

119
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,040
Well, you can choose

120
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,959
not to believe me.

121
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:53,480
But before

122
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,399
the two of you break up,

123
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:56,519
I'll let your sister starve.

124
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,000
Let's see if you'll take the chances.

125
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:05,759
Before I see any proof

126
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:07,279
that my sister is still alive,

127
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,079
I won't agree to anything.

128
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:11,839
Okay.

129
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,319
I'll show you proof.

130
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,399
But that depends on how you behave.

131
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,959
I'll give you time to think about it.

132
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,959
I've waited for you
for this long anyway.

133
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,160
I can wait a little longer.

134
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:56,639
Mr. Li.

135
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,040
Before this, He Jiang Hua
and Xie Ming Hao

136
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,560
didn't cross paths.

137
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
Besides, He Jiang Hua

138
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,519
is a well-known
Weibo verified account user.

139
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,680
Why would he help Xie Ming Hao
to set the fire?

140
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,279
This is what puzzles me.

141
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,040
All the clues

142
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,079
point to He Jiang Hua.

143
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,160
For us to turn the tables around,

144
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,759
he'll be the key.

145
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:17,560
Understood.

146
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,040
Mr. Li.

147
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,199
There's something

148
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,240
that I have to let you know.

149
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,240
I took the liberty

150
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,079
to tell Miss Su

151
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,959
about your encounter with Xie Ming Hao

152
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:36,920
when investigating He Jiang Hua.

153
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,879
Ji Ying Song.

154
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,680
Who told you to do that?

155
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:46,800
Mr. Li.

156
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,639
I don't know

157
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,800
what Xie Ming Hao told you.

158
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,439
But I do know

159
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,680
that you made the public apology

160
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,439
because of Miss Su.

161
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,759
Even if I didn't tell her,

162
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,040
Miss Su

163
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,199
would have sensed that herself.

164
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,439
I made the public apology

165
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,839
because Xie Ming Hao

166
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,120
has the recording and dual contract

167
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,319
that can prove Xie Yi accepted bribes.

168
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,680
Once these pieces of evidences
are made public,

169
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,759
Xie Yi will inevitably become
a lightning conductor for criticism.

170
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,800
I have to protect her. Do you get it?

171
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,680
But given Xie Yi's character,

172
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,160
once she found out

173
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,720
that I was threatened by Xie Ming Hao,

174
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,639
she wouldn't just let things slide.

175
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,879
If so,

176
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
everything I did
would have been in vain, wouldn't it?

177
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:23,319
Mr. Li.

178
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:24,720
I'm sorry.

179
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,800
I didn't think of that.

180
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:28,439
I just didn't want Miss Su

181
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,680
to misunderstand you.

182
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,679
Forget it.

183
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,480
You did it for my sake.

184
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,759
How did Xie Yi react to that?

185
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,879
Miss Su didn't say it,

186
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,039
but I could tell

187
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,080
that she was very touched

188
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,320
and that she believes in you.

189
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,799
(You can go to the police.)

190
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,840
(But I promise you.)

191
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,600
(You're not going)

192
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,840
to see your sister ever again.

193
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,720
She'll starve to death.

194
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,679
Break up with Li Ze Liang.

195
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,360
Promise me you'll never see him again,

196
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,200
and you'll stay by my side forever.

197
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,600
(Hedgehogs will not bite.)

198
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,320
Its only defense is the thorns

199
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:54,120
all over its body.

200
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,080
But if it likes you,

201
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,240
even its spines

202
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:01,960
will become very soft.

203
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,320
(Yan.)

204
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,720
(Soon, I'll be covered)

205
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,600
(with soft spines just like Chestnut.)

206
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,679
(Will you understand?)

207
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,480
Thank you for the other day.

208
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:22,200
My sister has a mental disorder.

209
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:23,879
Thank you for the notice.

210
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:25,399
This is a gift

211
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,279
from my client.

212
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,840
I bet it'll come in useful for you.

213
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,360
Take it as a token of appreciation
from me.

214
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:31,840
Mr. Xie.

215
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,240
You're being so courteous.

216
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,519
We'll surely bear in mind

217
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,960
the things that you've told us to do.

218
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:36,919
Besides,

219
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,639
it's our responsibility
to protect the safety

220
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:39,720
of the residents.

221
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,120
Next time,

222
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,080
if anything comes up,

223
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,960
feel free to come to me.

224
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,240
There is something

225
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,919
that I might

226
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,120
need your help with.

227
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,159
Ask away.

228
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:51,559
These two.

229
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,559
My sister

230
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,799
owed them a sum of money.

231
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,360
I'm trying to raise funds,

232
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,559
but they don't believe me.

233
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,039
They've been looking for my sister.

234
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,519
I'm afraid that my sister
will suffer an emotional shock

235
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:03,360
if she runs into them.

236
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,360
If they come

237
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,279
here,

238
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,200
please

239
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:07,960
inform me at once.

240
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,679
Sure, Mr. Xie.

241
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:10,559
Don't worry.

242
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,600
I'll remember their faces.

243
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:13,360
If they come,

244
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,720
I'll surely notify you.

245
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:16,159
Thank you.

246
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:16,879
No worries.

247
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:17,879
Thank you for the trouble.

248
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:18,879
Take care.

249
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:31,559
Yes, Dr. Wu.

250
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,879
You're right.

251
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,600
We'll come over at once.

252
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,000
Okay.

253
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,360
Thank you.

254
00:11:59,279 --> 00:11:59,879
Mr. Li?

255
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,720
Mr. Li?

256
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,279
Did you call me?

257
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,159
I just made an appointment

258
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,120
with Dr. Wu.

259
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,919
He's very concerned about your leg.

260
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,840
He suggested

261
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,159
that we go over now for a checkup.

262
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:13,679
Wait.

263
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,039
Why did you act on your own again?

264
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,960
Your health is the top priority.

265
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,440
I noticed you often have leg pain.

266
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,720
It can't be delayed any longer.

267
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,399
Besides, Miss Su reminded me

268
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:22,879
to keep a lookout for you.

269
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:25,320
I'm fine.

270
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,360
This can wait until I'm done
with Xie Yi's matters.

271
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:36,440
Su Xie Yi.

272
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,960
Congrats!

273
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:39,919
You've got what you wished for.

274
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:40,960
Ms. Shi.

275
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:42,440
What do you mean?

276
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,480
Ze Liang made a public apology for you

277
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:47,279
because of the fire at Lantian Bay.

278
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,279
Look what has happened to Ocean.

279
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:51,440
Isn't that what you'd wished for?

280
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:54,799
If it's my fault,
I won't shirk responsibility.

281
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,559
But it wasn't my fault.

282
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,279
So I won't take the blame.

283
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,279
So you're saying

284
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,559
that I've wrongly accused you?

285
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,440
Did you really think

286
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,759
the fire at Lantian Bay was an accident?

287
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,679
There are so many ventilators.

288
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:08,759
Of all warehouses, why did the one

289
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,799
where the external wall
insulation materials

290
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,639
were stored caught fire?

291
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,519
The fire was extinguished

292
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,559
almost immediately.

293
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:16,440
Why would the news of the fire

294
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,519
break

295
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,000
so promptly?

296
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,879
And the person

297
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:19,960
who covered the news is He Jiang Hua.

298
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:21,440
Have you

299
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:22,679
given all this careful thought?

300
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,120
According to what you said,

301
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,480
if someone

302
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,120
deliberately set the fire,

303
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,080
why didn't Ze Liang

304
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,759
continue the investigation?

305
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:32,960
Instead, he chose to
conclude it so quickly.

306
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,440
He did it to protect you.

307
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,960
At this point,

308
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,039
I hope you'll leave Ocean.

309
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,639
Otherwise,

310
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,080
Ze Liang might not pursue

311
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,200
the matter on the insulation boards,

312
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,799
but not me.

313
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,600
Don't worry.

314
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,440
I came

315
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,080
to tender my resignation.

316
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,030
Ms. Shi.

317
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:56,910
(Resignation Letter)

318
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,240
I know you have always had

319
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,000
a strong prejudice and misunderstanding
against me.

320
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,360
But I get it.

321
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,080
After all, you want what's best

322
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,879
for Ocean and Yan.

323
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,080
I hope that after I leave,

324
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,000
you'll continue to protect Yan.

325
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,000
If you still remember

326
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,159
the good thing he has done for you,

327
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,679
I hope

328
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:21,320
you won't live with hatred anymore.

329
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,840
Live a good life after you leave Ocean.

330
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,279
Don't bother him again.

331
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,360
What did you say?

332
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:28,879
Revenge?

333
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,679
That's right.

334
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,360
The fire in Lantian Bay

335
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,759
was just an accident.

336
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,240
Mr. Xie did all this

337
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,120
to stop you from taking revenge.

338
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,360
He didn't want to see you

339
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,600
keep walking down the wrong path.

340
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,000
Xie Ming Hao?

341
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,320
How could you believe what he said?

342
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:47,320
There's something

343
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:48,440
I have to tell you.

344
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,480
The supplier

345
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,399
of the external wall
insulation materials

346
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,399
that I purchased from
was introduced by him.

347
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,440
And Xie Ming Hao

348
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,399
happens to know He Jiang Hua,
the guy who covered the news.

349
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,120
I bet it's not difficult for you

350
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:02,399
to connect the dots, right?

351
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,679
All I can say

352
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,639
is that I was wrong about him.

353
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,360
Here's a piece of advice.

354
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,799
For Ocean's future plan

355
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:10,919
in this business world,

356
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,720
it's best you steer clear
of this person.

357
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:33,200
Dr. Wu.

358
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,039
I've exhausted all options

359
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,279
to persuade him.

360
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,240
But he wouldn't go to the hospital
for treatment,

361
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,600
and he wouldn't let me
tell Miss Su about it.

362
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,200
We detected osteomyelitis,

363
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,879
and this is a serious condition.

364
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,000
Delays in treatment
might lead to cancer.

365
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:46,919
I know.

366
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,120
(Pain in the affected limb
caused by osteomyelitis)

367
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,519
(You said it yourself.)

368
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,679
What we need now

369
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,879
is to communicate

370
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:15,399
and solve the problem together.

371
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:17,759
(Let me)

372
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:18,720
(briefly explain it to you.)

373
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Three million

374
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,399
meets corresponding standards

375
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,039
of extremely large monetary amount.

376
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,279
Based on

377
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,600
the amount of remittance
from the supplier to Xie Yi,

378
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:27,519
the sentence should be
at least ten years

379
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:28,759
or even life imprisonment.

380
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:31,919
Now, I have the evidence, witness,

381
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,360
and Xie Yi's motive

382
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,279
for revenge.

383
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,399
Xie Ming Hao.

384
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,799
I never thought you would do

385
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,440
something like this to Xie Yi.

386
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,159
You don't want her to suffer?

387
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,360
The choice is yours.

388
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:48,320
You can either protect Xie Yi

389
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,440
and take the blame.

390
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:50,080
That

391
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,600
will cost Ocean its reputation

392
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:53,000
and lead to bankruptcy. You know better.

393
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,120
Or you can rat Xie Yi out,

394
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:56,559
and I'll hand over the evidence.

395
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:57,600
In that case,

396
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:58,759
I'm afraid

397
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,799
you can only visit her in jail.

398
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,000
Come to me again

399
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,960
when you feel like telling me the truth.

400
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:07,640
Please

401
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:08,400
don't tell Xie Yi anything

402
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,839
about me, all right?

403
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,359
I don't want her

404
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,440
to be upset

405
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:14,319
because of what happened in the past.

406
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,839
(Xie Yi.)

407
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,400
(About He Jiang Hua
working with Xie Ming Hao)

408
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,279
(to stitch you up,)

409
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,559
(the police have stepped in.)

410
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,920
(I believe it won't be long now.)

411
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,599
Hi, Mr. Xie.

412
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,240
Mr. Dai is waiting for you inside.

413
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:49,799
Mr. Xie.

414
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,599
Mr. Dai.

415
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,640
Come over.

416
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:55,480
Mr. Xie.

417
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:57,720
Take a look.

418
00:17:58,039 --> 00:17:58,759
As per your request,

419
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,480
I've registered a new company

420
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,119
and gave you 10 percent of shares

421
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:03,440
in this company.

422
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,079
Mr. Dai, you sure
are a man of your word.

423
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,880
Well, you're very honest yourself.

424
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,079
Indeed, your fee

425
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,240
is a lot higher

426
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:16,640
than those ordinary lawyers.

427
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,319
I've secretly bought
some of Ocean shares

428
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,039
through Diying and Zhengde.

429
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:22,720
This sum of money
can last you a lifetime.

430
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:23,839
Thank you, Mr. Dai.

431
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:25,680
By the time

432
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:26,559
we hold more than five percent

433
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,160
of Ocean shares,

434
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:28,720
we can then show ourselves.

435
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,200
Then, we'll take him

436
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,759
by surprise.

437
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,720
Isn't it exciting?

438
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:36,920
I have thought about it.

439
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:38,759
I want to be the largest shareholder.

440
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,599
I have always hated

441
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:41,359
the name "Ocean".

442
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:42,559
After the acquisition,

443
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm going to change the name.

444
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,440
What should I name it?

445
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,000
Zhengcai?

446
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:49,720
Zhengde?

447
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:50,720
Zhengcai?

448
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,319
The combination of virtue and talent.

449
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:55,559
To become

450
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:56,240
Ocean's largest shareholder

451
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,599
requires a huge sum of money.

452
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,880
Have you prepared the money?

453
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,440
I like to play big.

454
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,480
I have contacted Aihong Fund

455
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:04,920
and pledged

456
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,880
all of Zhengde shares

457
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,839
to raise funds.

458
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,119
Prepare enough ammunition

459
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,000
for war.

460
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,200
We have only one goal

461
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:16,599
which is to take down Li Ze Liang.

462
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:37,880
Yan.

463
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:49,279
Xie Yi.

464
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,680
You look nice today.

465
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,440
Thank you.

466
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,960
I have heard about your resignation

467
00:19:59,039 --> 00:19:59,559
from Ocean.

468
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:00,640
I...

469
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,240
Yan.

470
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:02,880
We're out to have fun.

471
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:04,759
Let's not talk about this.

472
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:06,599
Come on.

473
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,039
There'll be a huge crowd

474
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:09,119
if we're late for certain activities.

475
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:10,519
Let's get inside first.

476
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:12,480
Okay.

477
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:02,519
What's the matter? Does your leg hurt?

478
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:05,240
I'm fine.

479
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:06,119
Look.

480
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,480
It's all good.

481
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:13,000
Oh, right, Xie Yi.

482
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,200
Wait for me.

483
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,240
I'll buy you a bottle of water.

484
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:17,400
I'll go.

485
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,799
It's not convenient for you.

486
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,200
Just sit tight.

487
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:23,519
Look.

488
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,599
I have this mini bike.

489
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:29,640
Wait for me.

490
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:33,880
Off we go!

491
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:03,870
(Huayi Grand Cinema)

492
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,680
You have such a good figure.

493
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,440
What do you think?

494
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,160
Can I become a spokesperson

495
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,440
for pin art sculpture now?

496
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:25,880
Xie Yi.

497
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:27,880
I feel so happy today.

498
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,359
If you like it here,

499
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,864
we can come here more often.

500
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,440
There's a cinema over there.

501
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,160
I think

502
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:38,440
the two of us

503
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,880
haven't gone to the movies together.

504
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,200
How about this?

505
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:44,039
Next time,

506
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:46,200
we can go together.

507
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,160
We did.

508
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,960
Are you talking about Yunfeng Hotel?

509
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,440
"Roman Holiday"?

510
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:00,960
I remember

511
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,599
you watched it at least five times
that day.

512
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:04,400
I bet

513
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,599
you can recite all the lines in it.

514
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:09,400
That's right.

515
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:14,960
Do you remember

516
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,640
their lines

517
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:18,079
in the car?

518
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,160
"I have to leave you...

519
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,680
now."

520
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:35,279
"I'm going

521
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:38,519
to that corner there

522
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,000
and turn."

523
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:45,039
"You must stay in the car."

524
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:47,920
"Promise me

525
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,960
not to watch me

526
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,359
go beyond the corner."

527
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,319
"Just drive away."

528
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,279
"Don't mind me."

529
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:14,480
"Just leave me as I leave you."

530
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,680
These were the lines

531
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,799
that Ann said to Joe

532
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:38,480
before returning to the palace.

533
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:44,079
But I prefer the lines

534
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,960
that she said towards the end.

535
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:48,559
She said,

536
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,319
"My favorite city is Rome."

537
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,880
"By all means, Rome."

538
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:00,920
"Because..."

539
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:08,640
"Because this place

540
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,279
holds the most special memories
for me."

541
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,640
(I take)

542
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,559
(your resignation from Ocean)

543
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:34,720
(as a gesture of goodwill.)

544
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,759
What about my sister?

545
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,880
Your sister is holding

546
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,799
today's morning paper.

547
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,559
It's enough to prove
that she's still alive.

548
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:50,440
I told you.

549
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,319
What I want

550
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:52,599
is for you to break up with Li Ze Liang.

551
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,640
Before that happens,

552
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:55,119
I've decided to let her starve.

553
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,200
If you love your sister,

554
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,119
just do as I say.

555
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:06,000
Okay.

556
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,920
I'll break up with Li Ze Liang.

557
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:09,920
Very well.

558
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,119
Let's break up.

559
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:37,720
Xie Yi.

560
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:41,160
Are you doing this because of Xie Qing?

561
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,359
If it's because of Xie Qing,

562
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,559
I can explain.

563
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:47,160
When I met Xie Qing the other day,

564
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:49,039
she did tell me something.

565
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:50,920
Back then, Zhiwei went bankrupt

566
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:53,559
because of her.

567
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,880
But at that time,

568
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:58,400
something happened to Xie Qing.

569
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,480
I was afraid

570
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,160
that it would crush you.

571
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,720
That's why I didn't tell you.

572
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:04,960
That was so long ago.

573
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,279
What's the point of bringing it up now?

574
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,319
So are you going to break up with me

575
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,039
over this?

576
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,200
Xie Yi.

577
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,279
If you have any difficulties,

578
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,839
you can just tell me.

579
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:22,599
Li Ze Liang.

580
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,240
Don't you get it?

581
00:27:27,515 --> 00:27:28,240
The sight of you

582
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,640
reminds me

583
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,240
of how

584
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,440
my dad and sister left me.

585
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:37,880
Let's not see each other again.

586
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:40,279
Don't contact me anymore.

587
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,200
From now on,
we have nothing to do with each other.

588
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:49,839
Where are you going?

589
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,400
Are you going to see Xie Ming Hao?

590
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,680
He's not a good person!

591
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,160
Believe me, Xie Yi.

592
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:58,160
Do you remember

593
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,720
the K of Spades

594
00:27:58,759 --> 00:27:59,799
that Huo Jian told you about?

595
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:02,240
Xie Ming Hao is K of Spades.

596
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,279
It was Xie Ming Hao
who instructed your sister

597
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,119
to bankrupt Zhiwei,

598
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:07,119
and got Huo Jian

599
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,400
to drive Zhiwei to a corner.

600
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,720
It was him, Xie Ming Hao!

601
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:13,000
I'm well aware

602
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,720
of the kind of person he is.

603
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:19,400
I hope you can get things straight.

604
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,200
There's no more future for us.

605
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,319

I just don't understand.

638
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,480
Why would Miss Su

639
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,440
suddenly

640
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,720
want to break up with you?

641
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:05,160
She said

642
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:08,920
the sight of me

643
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,200
reminds her of Xie Qing

644
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,960
and Uncle Shen.

645
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:19,720
That's why

646
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:23,759
she couldn't face me.

647
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,039
Mr. Li.

648
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,200
Do you actually believe that?

649
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,880
I do have the inescapable responsibility

650
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:48,359
for the death

651
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,119
of Uncle Shen and Xie Qing.

652
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,319
Had I stopped it sooner,

653
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:02,759
such tragedy wouldn't have happened.

654
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:10,640
They had a death wish.

655
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,720
You might be able to save them once.

656
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:14,039
But there's no telling

657
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,680
you can save them the second time.

658
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:18,279
I think Miss Su knows this

659
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,240
better than I do.

660
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:23,200
I think there must be some other reasons

661
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,960
Miss Su insisted on breaking up.

662
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:38,279
I'm well aware

663
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:40,319
of the kind of person he is.

664
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,759
I hope you can get things straight.

665
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,519
Is it because of Xie Ming Hao?

666
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,079
He used the recording and contract

667
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:05,559
to threaten Xie Yi

668
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,280
after threatening me.

669
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,800
If that's really the case,

670
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,760
Miss Su will be in great danger.

671
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,199
I'll get to the bottom of things.

672
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,000
I've broken up with Li Ze Liang.

673
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:33,960
It's time

674
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,440
to make good on your promise.

675
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,400
It's not the time yet.

676
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:41,280
Xie Ming Hao.

677
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,079
You have to keep your word.

678
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,159
I promised I would let you see Xie Qing,

679
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,679
but I didn't say when.

680
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:47,440
You...

681
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:49,800
You must be hungry.

682
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,119
Drink up.

683
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,480
Are you mad?

684
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,639
Why are you mad?

685
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,719
Look, I even prepared

686
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,599
a little surprise for you.

687
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:52,920
These dolls

688
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,039
are prepared specially for you.

689
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:55,000
From now on,

690
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:56,280
this will be your room.

691
00:35:57,159 --> 00:35:57,880
Do you like it?

692
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:00,360
I won't stay here.

693
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:01,880
You can choose to decline

694
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,400
if you don't want to see Xie Qing.

695
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,960
Why are you doing this?

696
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:09,719
I'll never love you.

697
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,440
I don't care what you do.

698
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:12,679
As long as you're with me,

699
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,079
you have to love me.

700
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:16,800
See these dolls?

701
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,119
From now on,

702
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:18,880
you'll stay by my side

703
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:20,519
just like them.

704
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:23,400
Put on a show if you have to.

705
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:26,639
Look, I kept Xie Qing

706
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:27,679
in the dark for so many years.

707
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:28,880
But she was happy, wasn't she?

708
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:29,719
So

709
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:30,840
just act that you love me

710
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:32,719
when you're with me, and that will do.

711
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:34,519
Otherwise, you know

712
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:35,639
what I would do to Xie Qing
and Li Ze Liang, right?

713
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:42,159
I can play along with you
and put on a show.

714
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:43,679
But

715
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:44,880
on one condition.

716
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,360
What is it?

717
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:47,480
I want

718
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,559
to see a new picture of my sister

719
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,159
every day.

720
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,639
I want to make sure
that she's still alive

721
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,360
and that she's doing well.

722
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:56,559
It's a deal.

723
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,320
I have a condition too.

724
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,960
You can't see

725
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:01,119
or contact Li Ze Liang anymore.

726
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,159
Believe me when I say I have my own way.

727
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,320
If you contact him,

728
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:04,679
I'm going to find out.

729
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:07,119
There'll be dire consequences then.

730
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,079
Don't worry.

731
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:15,159
Very well.

732
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,039
Rest earlier.

733
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:20,119
I'll help you fetch your luggage.

734
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,480
Xie Yi.

735
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,840
Where are you going?

736
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,199
I was planning

737
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:06,400
to send food to your sister.

738
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:07,639
But you foiled my plan.

739
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,119
She'll starve for another day
because of you.

740
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,199
How could you do this to her?

741
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:16,880
I've told you.

742
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,320
No rush.

743
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,679
I'll let you see her

744
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,840
when it's time.

745
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,239
If you push it,

746
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,519
your sister will have to suffer.

747
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:33,079
I was wrong.

748
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:34,800
I promise

749
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,239
I won't follow you anymore.

750
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,000
Go and meet my sister.

751
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,280
Bring her some food.

752
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,840
Do you think I'll still believe you?

753
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,920
What are you trying to do?

754
00:40:57,639 --> 00:40:59,360
Want to make it up to me?

755
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:11,760
There are a lot of things

756
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,280
that I want to do with you.

757
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,519
Let's start with dating.

758
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:16,840
Rest earlier.

759
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:31,239
(From the looks of it, I'll have
to play along with him for now.)

760
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:33,280
(When opportunity knocks,)

761
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,840
