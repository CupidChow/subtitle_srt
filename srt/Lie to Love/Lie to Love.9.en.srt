20
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,360
Every time we waited for my nephew,

21
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,680
it was just a waste of time.

22
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,360
Very well, let's begin.

23
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,199
Everyone,

24
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,800
the main agenda of this meeting

25
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,680
is to discuss the auction

26
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,360
(Ocean Hotel Corporation Board Meeting)
that will be held at Yunfeng Hotel.

27
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,120
As we all know...

28
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:47,919
My apologies.

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,199
Sorry for the long wait.

30
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:53,879
Ze Liang.

31
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,080
What a surprise.

32
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,800
How did you manage to have

33
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,159
the time for this board meeting?

34
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,599
You are right, Uncle.

35
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,080
From now on,

36
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,080
I will

37
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,520
dedicate my life to work.

38
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:06,520
All right.

39
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,879
Let's get down to business.

40
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:08,840
Yi Fei.

41
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,000
Explain

42
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,039
the main agendas today.

43
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:13,800
Everyone,

44
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,800
our main focus today

45
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:16,919
will be

46
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,159
the auction of Yunfeng Hotel.

47
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,199
As you all know,

48
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,759
(Yunfeng Hotel Auction Tendering Report)
the most famous auction company,

49
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,280
Fujiade Auction,

50
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,240
(Fujiade Company)
will soon select

51
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,199
one five-star hotel in Shanghai
as the venue

52
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,280
for their auction.

53
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,800
Our subsidiary Yunfeng Hotel

54
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,080
(Yunfeng Hotel)
has managed to make it

55
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,919
(One of the top three choices)
into the top three choices.

56
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,159
Yunfeng Hotel

57
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,039
is the five-star hotel

58
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:35,639
we spent

59
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:37,199
billions to build.

60
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,960
If we become the auction venue,

61
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,120
it'll be a worldwide advertisement

62
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,960
for our hotel.

63
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,479
But unfortunately,

64
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,360
based on the information I got,

65
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,159
Mr. Roman from Fujiade Auction

66
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,159
has decided to

67
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,240
partner up with Zhengde Hotel.

68
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,000
Zhengde?

69
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,759
They've been our rival

70
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,680
all along.

71
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:58,520
That's right.

72
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,479
Indeed.

73
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,520
It was supposed to
be a great opportunity,

74
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,319
but we ruined it.

75
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,000
Our rival reaped the benefit.

76
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,319
We'll be mocked in the industry
for this failure.

77
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,960
Everyone who participated

78
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,039
in the tendering

79
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,680
will have their bonus deducted.

80
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,039
I want your reflection report.

81
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,240
Mr. Huo.

82
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,439
Don't you think it's too early

83
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,839
to draw any conclusion now?

84
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:25,839
Ze Liang.

85
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,199
Judging by your tone,

86
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,519
you seem to have a plan.

87
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,920
Mr. Roman hasn't signed the contract

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,160
with Zhengde Hotel just yet.

89
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:36,759
At least,

90
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:37,720
we can still give it a try.

91
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,600
If we admit our defeat

92
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,360
before the outcome becomes certain,

93
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,439
that will only bolster their pride.

94
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,680
The ratification is tomorrow.

95
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,879
We won't make it in time.

96
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,360
Ze Liang, listen.

97
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,160
Business

98
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,199
is nothing like a video game.

99
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,439
The defeated must
accept their punishment.

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,480
Very well.

101
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,759
If I manage to close the deal

102
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,600
with this tendering,

103
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,839
I'll ask only one thing from you.

104
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,360
I want full control over Yunfeng Hotel.

105
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,480
What if you fail?

106
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,639
If I fail,

107
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,920
I'll resign

108
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,399
from all the positions in this company.

109
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:30,800
Very well.

110
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,120
Ze Liang doesn't

111
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,000
get fired up for a job very often.

112
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,000
Is there anyone

113
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,000
who is willing to assist him

114
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,000
in this undertaking?

115
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,959
I'll help him.

116
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:53,920
Mr. Xie, this way.

117
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,759
Xie Yi, why are you here?

118
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,399
I was told someone broke into your house

119
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,399
and you even got hurt.

120
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,639
I got well, so I thought

121
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:05,839
I should come back to work.

122
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,480
Allow me to introduce.

123
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,680
This is Xie Ming Hao, he's a lawyer.

124
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,360
He has been working with

125
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,879
Ms. Shi's Hengye Bank for some time.

126
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,959
He is an outstanding

127
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,120
commercial lawyer.

128
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,160
Ms. Shi referred him

129
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,439
to help Ocean Hotel.

130
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,839
Mr. Xie.

131
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:25,000
Nice to meet you.

132
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,480
I am Su Xie Yi.

133
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,079
Hello.

134
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:31,720
By the way,

135
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,480
a burglar broke into my house
a few days ago.

136
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,480
I'm not really sure

137
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,000
about damage compensation.

138
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,199
Could you help me out with it?

139
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,040
Sure.

140
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:41,199
I'll be glad to help.

141
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:42,879
Miss Gong just told me

142
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:43,920
she would brief me about

143
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,800
the company's situation.

144
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,759
Maybe Miss Su could
do the honor instead?

145
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,759
Will that be a problem?

146
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,959
No problem.

147
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,160
Let's talk at the cafe downstairs.

148
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,040
Sure.

149
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,079
This way.

150
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,240
Ming Hao,

151
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:06,560
you could have given me a heads-up

152
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,560
before coming here.

153
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,519
After the cocktail party,

154
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,680
you never picked up your phone.

155
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,120
You weren't at your house either.

156
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,120
Where else

157
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,319
can I find you if not here?

158
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,480
You know why I'm here.

159
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,279
We shouldn't meet here.

160
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,839
But now you can

161
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,120
talk to me as one of their employees.

162
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,279
Don't worry.

163
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,600
Ocean Hotel and I are merely

164
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,839
business partners.

165
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,279
Sorry.

166
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,920
A lot had happened lately.

167
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,839
I didn't want to make you worry.

168
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,199
Xie Yi.

169
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,079
You know,

170
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,800
when I couldn't reach you,

171
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,360
it'd only make me...

172
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,600
It'd only make me and your sister

173
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,480
worry about you.

174
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,600
But I thought it through.

175
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,279
Since you insist on

176
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,160
executing your plan,

177
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
I'll do my best

178
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:54,439
to assist you.

179
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:56,800
Okay.

180
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,120
However,

181
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,040
you must never

182
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,040
keep any secrets from me.

183
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,560
Just discuss your plans with me.

184
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:17,199
By the way,

185
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,199
was Li Ze Liang's story

186
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,920
during the cocktail party

187
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,240
actually true?

188
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,680
He almost spotted me

189
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,079
when I was tailing Chen Heng Sheng.

190
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,240
He was trying to help,

191
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:27,800
so...

192
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,800
So this must

193
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,199
never happen again.

194
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,639
Xie Yi.

195
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,759
I've been looking everywhere for you.

196
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,919
Why are you with Mr. Xie?

197
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:42,679
Mr. Xie

198
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,480
is actually my sister's fiance.

199
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,679
He's my future brother-in-law.

200
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:48,720
I see.

201
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,840
Since he's your brother-in-law,

202
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,639
he's my brother-in-law as well.

203
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:54,639
Brother-in-law,

204
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:55,960
nice to meet you.

205
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,120
Xie Yi.

206
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,559
Contact me if there's anything.

207
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,440
I should get going.

208
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:05,639
Mr. Li.

209
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:06,720
Goodbye.

210
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,080
I've known him since I was a kid.

211
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,759
You don't have to pretend.

212
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,840
He knows everything.

213
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,960
I didn't know you two are so close.

214
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,679
Hello?

215
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,399
Ze Liang.

216
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,519
I'm ready.

217
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:33,679
We can go now.

218
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:35,240
Okay.

219
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,159
See you at the entrance.

220
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,039
I need to go out for some work.

221
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,000
As for you,

222
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,519
do your job.

223
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:51,679
Xie Yi,

224
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:52,879
do you have

225
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:53,799
the phone number

226
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:54,720
of that dashing lawyer?

227
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,120
Does he have a girlfriend?

228
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:58,039
I was only asking

229
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,399
questions about legal compensation.

230
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,000
Why would I pry so hard?

231
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,879
You already

232
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:03,480
have Mr. Li.

233
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:04,720
There are plenty of

234
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:06,000
single ladies here in the office.

235
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,039
I am the perfect example.

236
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,879
Now that

237
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,399
you mentioned it,

238
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,000
he told me

239
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,480
he has a fiancee

240
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,600
who looks very much like me.

241
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,639
He's already engaged?

242
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,120
Ms. Yi.

243
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,960
I wasn't expecting you
to start working so soon.

244
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,399
I must thank you

245
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,840
and Mr. Huo

246
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,240
for my swift recovery.

247
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,840
Ming Yue.

248
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:43,759
Where are Ms. Shi and Mr. Li?

249
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:44,919
They aren't in their offices.

250
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,240
They are trying to secure

251
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,159
Yunfeng Hotel's partnership

252
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,679
with Fujiade Auction.

253
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,360
Yunfeng Hotel?

254
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:54,399
What's wrong?

255
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:55,519
It's nothing.

256
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:57,679
Don't worry about it.

257
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,360
Ms. Shi and Mr. Li

258
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,840
make a good team together.

259
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,480
Nothing could go wrong with them

260
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:03,600
working on it.

261
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,159
I bet you haven't heard.

262
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:09,159
In the past, Ms. Shi and Mr. Li

263
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,200
were known as

264
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,840
the perfect partners
within the industry.

265
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,399
But the person that suits

266
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,639
Mr. Li the most

267
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,559
is of course you, Miss Su.

268
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,399
But I think

269
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,080
we can't afford to take risks

270
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:22,440
when it comes to

271
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,840
a relationship.

272
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:25,200
Am I right?

273
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,480
All right,

274
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:29,879
I'll leave you to your work.

275
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,759
See you around.

276
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:37,960
Xie Yi,

277
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,960
don't listen to her nonsense.

278
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,600
Mr. Li's heart is all yours.

279
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:46,039
But I think Mr. Li was

280
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,519
a little headstrong this time.

281
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,960
From what I heard,

282
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,600
he even swore to resign

283
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:51,519
if he failed

284
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,360
to secure the deal

285
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,559
with Fujiade Auction.

286
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,799
Seriously?

287
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,720
Yes.

288
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,559
Not to mention Fujiade Auction
and Zhengde Hotel

289
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,240
are about to close the deal.

290
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:04,240
To make such a promise now...

291
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,440
Do you think he did it

292
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:06,559
because he really

293
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,960
doesn't want to go to work?

294
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:12,039
Fujiade Auction?

295
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:18,039
Xie Yi?

296
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:19,559
Xie Yi?

297
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,240
Hello, Mr. Ji.

298
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,080
Where are you now?

299
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:35,600
Putting Su Xie Yi into our equation...

300
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,279
A brilliant move indeed.

301
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,759
The Shi family has deep roots here.

302
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,080
We'll be at risk if Chu Chu

303
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,039
is working with Li Ze Liang.

304
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:50,759
We have Zhengde Hotel
that is closing a deal,

305
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,799
and now we have Su Xie Yi
to stir up trouble.

306
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,480
It'll be very challenging

307
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,919
for the duo to succeed.

308
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,399
Let's not let our guard down.

309
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,559
I can feel it's different this time.

310
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,840
Follow them.

311
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,360
Keep me posted

312
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,279
on everything.

313
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:05,279
Yes.

314
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:17,480
Hello, the gin and tonic you ordered.

315
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,360
Thanks.

316
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,080
I'll have a Mojito.

317
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:23,759
Sure.

318
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,600
Remember,

319
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,080
the mint

320
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,960
must be crushed until you get the juice.

321
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,080
Use half a lime.

322
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:33,080
Add the sucrose before the mint.

323
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,960
That will bring out

324
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:36,240
the rum's sugary scent.

325
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:37,919
Different layers of flavors

326
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,840
will then be created.

327
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,159
Thanks.

328
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,000
Hold on.

329
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:43,279
Yes?

330
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,679
I'll have a Mojito

331
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,799
just the way she ordered.

332
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:53,679
Hi, I am Nina.

333
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,960
I'm Cicely.

334
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,799
Mr. Roman,

335
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,200
I appreciate

336
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,159
that you are willing

337
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,039
to meet us.

338
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,120
This is our proposal.

339
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,720
Mr. Li, Ms. Shi.

340
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,200
I agreed to meet you

341
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:13,480
not because

342
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:14,759
I want to discuss the auction.

343
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,360
I merely

344
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,399
want to make some friends.

345
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,759
I know.

346
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:22,960
Ocean is a great hotel.

347
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,440
But Zhengde is just as great.

348
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,200
They have a long history as a hotel.

349
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:27,879
Our objective

350
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,120
is to work with the best there is.

351
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,320
Mr. Roman.

352
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,799
I must thank you

353
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,960
for acknowledging Ocean Hotel.

354
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,519
I was told you and your wife
would stay in Shanghai

355
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,360
for quite a while.

356
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,799
May we have the honor

357
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:41,159
of inviting you and your wife

358
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,320
to stay in Ocean?

359
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,759
I appreciate the offer.

360
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:47,639
But Zhengde Hotel

361
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:48,360
has provided us

362
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,480
with remarkable accommodation.

363
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,240
The next time I come to Shanghai,

364
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,720
I will be sure to experience

365
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:53,919
the top-notched

366
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:55,039
Ocean Hotel.

367
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,679
This tastes amazing.

368
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,600
Mojito for the first love,

369
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:11,720
gin and tonic for the crush.

370
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:12,679
To create

371
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,440
this sweet and sour flavor,

372
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,440
the key is none other than...

373
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,039
the lime.

374
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,879
When Roman

375
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:35,200
proposed to me that night,

376
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,759
this is how it felt like.

377
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,519
It was at the venue

378
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,080
of the 19th Thomas Cup.

379
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,759
He proposed right before the crowd.

380
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:47,639
That sounds very romantic.

381
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,519
Was it the time Larson turned the table?

382
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,519
Why?

383
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:54,039
Are you interested in badminton too?

384
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,080
Yes.

385
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,759
It seems

386
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:59,000
we can get along very well.

387
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,080
Mr. Roman,

388
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:04,840
please give us

389
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,720
five minutes

390
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:06,840
to explain our proposal

391
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,600
to you.

392
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,840
I'll be honest with you, Mr. Li.

393
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,039
My company has signed

394
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,240
the letter of intent with Zhengde.

395
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,720
If nothing goes wrong,

396
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,000
we will not make any changes

397
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,159
to our plans for the partnership.

398
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,879
Mr. Roman.

399
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,559
The reason you chose to hold

400
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,639
the auction in Shanghai

401
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,399
because you want to open up

402
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:28,840
the market of artwork auctioning

403
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,639
in mainland China.

404
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,080
You chose to hold the auction

405
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,759
in a five-star hotel

406
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:33,720
because

407
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,360
the hotel would have a clientele

408
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,440
that possesses the necessary resources.

409
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:41,600
With all due respect,

410
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,200
my father is the current president

411
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,200
of Hengye Bank.

412
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:47,600
Our bank also has

413
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,000
an outstanding clientele

414
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,159
which possesses great resources.

415
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,799
Many of them

416
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,639
are art enthusiasts

417
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:56,480
and potential buyers.

418
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,240
If you choose to partner up

419
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,320
with Ocean Hotel,

420
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,120
I assure you your company

421
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:05,279
will have the best clientele

422
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,200
of both Ocean Hotel and Hengye Bank.

423
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,400
Mr. Roman, I'm sure you know

424
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:22,000
for an auction to be a success,

425
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,599
the key is

426
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:25,640
record-breaking selling price.

427
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,720
For this upcoming auction,

428
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,599
our bank will provide

429
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,279
a specialized loan

430
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,319
to stimulate and increase

431
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,720
the purchasing ability of our clients.

432
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,039
I believe it will greatly increase
the chance of an item

433
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:40,160
being sold at a record-breaking price.

434
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,359
For both parties,

435
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,960
this is the best advertisement.

436
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:45,000
That's right.

437
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:46,240
Mr. Roman,

438
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,640
you mentioned

439
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,720
you wanted to work

440
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,119
with the best partner there is.

441
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,599
I believe with Ocean Hotel
and Hengye Bank

442
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:53,920
joining hands,

443
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,400
we'll be unstoppable.

444
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,400
So I really hope

445
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,200
you can reconsider

446
00:17:58,279 --> 00:17:59,160
our proposal.

447
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,920
We will make sure

448
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,880
the auction is one

449
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,200
that makes headlines and history.

450
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,640
Honestly,

451
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,839
I am tempted.

452
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,640
But Mr. Li,

453
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,759
you must understand.

454
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,160
In business,

455
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:18,279
a promise must never be broken.

456
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,319
I gave them my word,

457
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:22,319
so I never change my mind so easily.

458
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,480
Honey.

459
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,039
Honey, let me introduce you.

460
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:32,119
This is Mr. Li's girlfriend,

461
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,119
Miss Su.

462
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:36,440
Su Xie Yi.

463
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,000
She and I get along very well.

464
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,160
Miss Su here

465
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,920
is also a fan of Larson.

466
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,160
She also invited both of us

467
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,960
to a badminton match.

468
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:46,599
Is that so?

469
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,440
I hope I have the honor.

470
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,359
Mr. Roman,

471
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,960
will you accept my challenge?

472
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,400
Sure.

473
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,480
I've heard the Romans
was crowned the best players

474
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,880
in the financial industry.

475
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:03,079
It'll be

476
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,839
Xie Yi's honor

477
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:04,759
to have a match

478
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:05,799
with both of you.

479
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,359
Why don't we have a double

480
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,400
to make it more fun?

481
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:11,759
I'd love to experience

482
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:13,519
your prowess as badminton players.

483
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,359
If that's fine with you,

484
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:17,039
we'll be glad to.

485
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,240
That's great.

486
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:18,920
Mr. Li.

487
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,920
Don't worry, I'll manage.

488
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:24,680
See you at the badminton court.

489
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,640
See you there.

490
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,079
Please.

491
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,640
See you later.

492
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,599
See you.

493
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,720
Let's go, Honey.

494
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:45,559
We should go too.

495
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:08,240
Hello, Mr. Huo.

496
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,480
A badminton match?

497
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:13,799
This is interesting.

498
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:20,519
Miss Su.

499
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:22,680
Ze Liang can't play.

500
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:23,960
You must stop him

501
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:24,880
from joining the match.

502
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:25,880
There are things

503
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:27,640
worse than you can imagine.

504
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:29,680
Ms. Shi.

505
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,920
I am well aware of the situation.

506
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:34,400
If you know the risk,

507
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,960
you should stop him from playing.

508
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,519
It'll only do him more harm.

509
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm not harming him.

510
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,759
It's just that...

511
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:42,839
I believe in him.

512
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,480
Perhaps he is much stronger

513
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:46,519
than you think.

514
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,720
You just refuse to believe it.

515
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:09,920
Mr. Roman.

516
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,079
See you at the court.

517
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:26,759
Chu Chu...

518
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,480
I'll play on your behalf.

519
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,039
Never mind.

520
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:34,839
I'll do it myself.

521
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,759
Are you ready?

522
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,640
You take care of the rear side.

523
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,240
I'll leave the front side to you.

524
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:54,160

Mr. Li.

571
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,559
You are truly a strong one.

572
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,119
You left me impressed.

573
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:26,279
Congratulations,

574
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:27,000
you've won yourself

575
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:29,680

576
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:33,119
That's great, Ze Liang!

577
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:34,359
We did it!

578
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:35,000

This is great!

It's great to be young.

582
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,359
Mr. Li, put on the blanket.

583
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,960
The doctor specifically told you

584
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:35,839
not to partake in sports,

585
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:37,640
especially vigorous sports.

586
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,119
This isn't the first time.

587
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:43,480
Don't get too worked up.

588
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:46,200
Ying Song,

589
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:47,480
you know,

590
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:49,960
this is the happiest day I've had

591
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:52,240
in two years.

592
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:06,960
Over the past two years,

593
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:08,759
I've gotten used to

594
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:10,400
living like a worthless person.

595
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,559
All of you

596
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,200
took care of me

597
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,559
meticulously.

598
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,680
You tried not to hurt my pride.

599
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:19,119
I understand.

600
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:20,960
You did it for me.

601
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,319
That was also why I've never

602
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:25,240
got upset over it.

603
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:30,680
But Su Xie Yi is different.

604
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:33,079
(She understands me.)

605
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,519
(Only she treated me)

606
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,319
(like a normal person,)

607
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:40,319
(a healthy person.)

608
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,440
Miss Su

609
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,799
is very unique.

610
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:46,839
Certainly.

611
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,880
I knew she'd be different

612
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,680
from the others

613
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,759
(when I first saw her.)

614
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,880
Why the long face?

615
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:08,480
By the way,

616
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,079
how is the mission

617
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:10,720
I gave you?

618
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:12,319
Don't worry, Mr. Li.

619
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:13,839
I've ordered my man

620
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,480
to get Miss Su a room at Ocean.

621
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:17,440
She'll be living in the hotel lately.

(of our proposal is the auctioning.)

704
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:02,119
Not only are we combining

705
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:04,119
both online and offline bidding

706
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:05,079
simultaneously,

707
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,000
we will always cooperate

708
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
with your company

709
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,400
to build a collection IP,

00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:10,799
uplifting the reputation

711
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,359
and the value of your auctioning items.

712
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:17,200
Aside from the novel approaches

713
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,079
for the auction

714
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:19,559

716
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,039
we will also hire

717
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:23,720
the security that is
renowned internationally

718
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,880
to provide protection

719
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,720
throughout the auction.

720
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,440
Internally, we will start

721
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,200
giving training
regarding security measures

722
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:31,880
to make sure the whole process

723
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:33,000
is executed flawlessly.

724
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,559
(International Security Detail)
I hope you can give us

725
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:37,200
a chance to prove our worth, Mr. Roman.

726
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,200
Let us

727
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,359
present to the world

728
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:40,400
a flawless

729
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:41,960
and historical auction.

730
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,559
Mr. Li,

731
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,880
your proposal is indeed
filled with refreshing ideas.

732
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,319
It's very comprehensive.

733
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,039
As I mentioned before,

734
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,559
I want to work with the best there is.

735
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,039
I can say for sure that you

736
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:03,839
are certainly it.

737
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,160
Mr. Roman,

738
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,119
I appreciate that you chose us

739
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:12,480
over your partnership with Zhengde.

740
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,920
That requires a great capacity
on your end.

741
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,720
Therefore,

742
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:17,279
we will not let

743
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,039
your trust in us goes to waste.

744
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:22,200
On one hand,

745
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:24,240
your proposal

746
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:26,079
and your sincerity

747
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,960
are very assuring.

748
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:29,400
On the other hand,

749
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:30,920
I stumbled upon

750
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,079
an unpleasant event

751
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:33,839
at the Zhengde Hotel

752
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:37,000
when I was there yesterday.

753
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:39,960
It was lost at this very hotel.

754
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,480
You must be responsible for this.

755
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:42,680
Sorry.

756
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,559
We are searching for it as we speak.

757
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,720
Searching for it?

758
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,039
It's been one week

759
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:47,839
and you've found nothing.

760
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,960
Please be patient.

761
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,519
We have a lot of customers,

762
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,079
so it takes time to investigate.

763
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:53,839
Forget it.

764
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,079
You might as well

765
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:55,880
just pay for the loss.

766
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,400
I'm tired of questioning you.

767
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,480
Lady,

768
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,599
your item was never

769
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,759
with us for safekeeping.

770
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,680
As the policy goes,

771
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:03,839
we are not responsible for the loss.

772
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,359
Watch your attitude!

773
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,280
Many priceless

774
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,000
and exquisite items will be present
during the auction.

775
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,760
We need rigorous

776
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,480
security measures.

777
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,400
I cannot entrust these items

778
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,599
to a hotel

779
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,880
that is so irresponsible.

780
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:23,679
I find your security solution
very impressive.

781
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,440
It's rigorous and comprehensive.

782
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,639
It's assuring to know I can leave

783
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:31,079
the auction in your hand.

784
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,320
Thank you for the acknowledgment.

785
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,039
We appreciate the compliment, Mr. Roman.

786
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:38,679
This partnership

787
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,400
is pivotal for both

788
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,360
of our companies.

789
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:43,199
Therefore, I will

790
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,800
see to everything personally.

791
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:46,880
I see.

792
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,360
Uncle,

793
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,440
as the chairman,

794
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,960
your hands are full of many works.

795
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:53,639
Perhaps I should

796
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,360
be in charge of the auction.

797
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,199
After all,

798
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,079
I know the plan best.

799
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,400
Ze Liang.

800
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:02,079
I'm glad to know

801
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,239
you're so determined.

802
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,639
But you are

803
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,280
still a recovering patient.

804
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,199
The auction

805
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,960
will be a lot of work.

806
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:12,239
It's best not to let
your body take a toll.

807
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:13,760
Uncle...

808
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:14,679
Mr. Huo.

809
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:16,559
Perhaps

810
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:18,559
you should have witnessed

811
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,440
the exciting badminton match

812
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:21,440
Mr. Li and Mr. Roman

813
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:22,800
had yesterday.

814
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,639
They were evenly matched.

815
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,400
He is in great physical condition.

816
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,079
Preparation for the auction

817
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,599
won't be a problem for him at all.

818
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,480
Mr. Huo.

819
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,440
I chose Ocean Hotel

820
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,320
over Zhengde

821
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,639
not only because

822
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,760
of the potential it has,

823
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,800
but also because

824
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,760
I personally respect Mr. Li.

825
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,800
I believe in his capability.

826
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,239
By the way,

827
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:49,639
you should

828
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:52,840
Mr. Li and Miss Su managed

829
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:54,880
to defeat my wife and me

830
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,880
with a great lead.

831
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:02,039
Since you think so highly of him,
Mr. Roman,

832
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,760
Ze Liang,

833
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:05,719
make sure

834
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:07,079
to give it your best.

835
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,519
Do not ruin it.

836
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:12,920
Don't worry,

837
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,440
Mr. Huo.

838
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,880
I assure you, Mr. Roman,

839
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,320
that I won't let you down.

840
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,599
Great.

841
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:24,360
By the way, Miss Su,

842
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,199
my wife told me

843
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,679
you taught her to use lime

844
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,480
for cocktails.

845
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:33,400
The result was superb.

846
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,039
I hope to try your cocktail

847
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:38,880
when I'm at Yunfeng Hotel.

848
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:40,400
Of course.

849
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,400
Please let Mrs. Roman know

850
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,159
that I will prepare a cocktail for her.

851
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:45,400
She will like it.

852
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,360
Sure.

853
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,199
Li Ze Liang

854
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:57,159
was out of line!

855
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:57,920
He sidelined you

856
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,679
in front of everyone!

857
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,800
Can't you tell?

858
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,559
As per the rules,

859
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:01,320
a new chairman

860
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,679
will be re-elected soon.

861
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,280
If he's trying to get attention now,

862
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:05,840
his target won't just be

863
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,639
Yunfeng Hotel.

864
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,280
Those who supported

865
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,159
Ze Liang's father was displeased

866
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:11,360
that you were elected.

867
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:12,960
Li Ze Liang is in the picture now.

868
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:13,880
If the auction

869
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,599
is a success,

870
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:15,199
you might...

871
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,000
It's easier that way.

872
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,079
If it's the attention he wants,

873
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,519
let him try.

874
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:22,920
If he flops,

875
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:26,320
he will never rise again.

876
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:29,159
Indeed.

877
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,280
The auction will be held

878
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:32,760
at Yunfeng Hotel instead of Ocean Hotel,

879
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,599
but Yunfeng Hotel's 

880
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:36,400
general manager, Chen Heng Sheng,
still works for you.

881
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,440
I need to reconsider

882
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,559
every step of this game.

883
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,000
It could be an opportunity
for Li Ze Liang,

884
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,280
but it could also be mine.

885
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,519
Mr. Li,

886
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,480
this is the file
on the auctioning items

887
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,039
(Fujiade Auction)
and the guests' registration details.

888
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,440
Are you okay

889
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:58,800
with going to Yunfeng Hotel?

890
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,079
If it's too hard for you,

891
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,239
you don't have to go.

892
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:03,760
I must go

893
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:05,360
because it's Yunfeng Hotel.

894
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:07,400
Very well.

895
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:08,559
Pack up your things.

896
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,599
We'll set out tomorrow.

897
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:11,119
So soon?

898
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,039
What? Is there a problem?

899
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:14,880
No.

900
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:16,599
Mr. Li.

901
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,559
May I apply for leave?

902
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,800
Before we go to Yunfeng Hotel,

903
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:22,639
I want to pay my sister a visit.

904
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,119
She's sick

905
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:25,239
and is in a hospital.

906
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:26,079
Sure.

907
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:28,119
I'll be going now.

908
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:29,599
Wait.

909
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,639
Stay safe.

910
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,320
Return to the hotel before nightfall.

911
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:38,559
I will.

912
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:52,280
Ying Song,

913
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:54,119
Xie Yi is going out this afternoon.

914
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,159
Follow her.

915
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:56,960
I don't want

916
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,199
any trouble before leaving
for Yunfeng Hotel.

917
00:38:59,360 --> 00:38:59,920
Yes.

918
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:15,119
Here are your mung bean cakes.

919
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:17,599
Thanks.

920
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:25,300
(Psychiatric Rehab Center)

921
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,280
Xie Qing, are you drawing Xie Yi?

922
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:36,679
What are you two drawing?

923
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:38,679
Speak of the devil.

924
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:42,679
Xie Qing, is that me?

925
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,440
I'm not that fat.

926
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:46,760
Fine,

927
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:47,840
that's me.

928
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,519
I'm the fat one, okay?

929
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:51,920
Check out

930
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,119
the snack I brought you.

931
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:55,599
This is your favorite mung bean cake.

932
00:40:57,199 --> 00:40:57,559
Here.

933
00:40:58,639 --> 00:40:59,079
Xie Qing.

934
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,840
Clean your hands before eating.

935
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:03,039
Come on.

936
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:08,599
Okay, you can eat now.

937
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,199
Here.

938
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:30,039
You're working today.

939
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,039
How did you make it here?

940
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,519
I took a leave to come here.

941
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,679
I'll go on a business trip tomorrow.

942
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,639
I can't visit my sister

943
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:36,719
for quite some time.

944
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:38,079
Where are you going?

945
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:40,719
Is it Yunfeng Hotel?

946
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:41,760
Yes.

947
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:44,880
It's the same Yunfeng Hotel

948
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,880
refurbished from Zhiwei Building.

949
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:47,760
Xie Yi,

950
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,719
Chen Heng Sheng is
in charge of Yunfeng Hotel.

951
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:52,360
He's a cunning one.

952
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,039
Make sure you stay safe.

953
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:55,320
Don't worry.

954
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:57,840
I am Li Ze Liang's personal assistant

955
00:41:58,239 --> 00:41:59,880
and his official girlfriend.

956
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:01,599
He wouldn't dare to harm me.

957
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,559
Besides,

958
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:06,599
he wasn't the true culprit.

959
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:07,760
What do you mean?

960
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,639
Chen Heng Sheng was taking orders

961
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:11,440
from Huo Jian.

962
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:15,559
Zhiwei was closed down
because of Huo Jian's doing.

963
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:20,400
Hou Jian is Ocean Hotel's chairman.

964
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,320
You are no match for him.

965
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:23,559
Whether that's the case or not,

966
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,679
we'll have to try to know.

967
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:30,119
Xie Qing?

968
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,440
What's wrong?

969
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,440
Were you choking?

970
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:34,440
Come on.

971
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,360
Have some water.

972
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:38,079
Here.

973
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:41,440
Xie Qing.

974
00:42:42,679 --> 00:42:43,559
Be patient.

975
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,000
I will apprehend the culprit

976
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:48,119
that ruined our family

977
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:49,360
from Zhiwei Building.

978
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:51,960
You will get well

979
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,960
by then.

980
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,519
Am I right?

981
00:42:58,199 --> 00:43:00,519
Let's hope that day comes sooner.

982
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:02,440
