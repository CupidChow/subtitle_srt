=Episode 8=

19
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,680
You even sent Yi Fei

20
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,079
to find that Spider?

21
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,240
It must have something to do
with Mr. Li Senior's death,

22
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,120
right?

23
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,120
Of course,

24
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,840
if you can make good on your promise,

25
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,599
I will keep my mouth shut

26
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,680
and continue to work for you,

27
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:29,080
Mr. Huo.

28
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,400
Now that I've thought about it,

29
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,039
I think you make a lot of sense.

30
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,080
Cooperation will benefit both of us.

31
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,719
I will handle the compensation.

32
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,639
It will be in your account tomorrow.

33
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:49,919
Mr. Huo.

34
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:51,840
Just now, I shouldn't have

35
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,759
spoken to you in that manner.

36
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,039
I was just...

37
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,000
We've been friends for so many years.

38
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,599
Of course, I know you.

39
00:02:59,039 --> 00:02:59,639
Later,

40
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,159
I'll have Miss Yi put a few boxes

41
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,280
of fine wine in the trunk of your car.

42
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:03,680
Go back now.

43
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,719
No, Mr. Huo...

44
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,120
You deserve it.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,520
Go on.

46
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,199
Thank you.

47
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,400
(Chairman)

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,240
(As the new)

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,319
(Chairman of Ocean Hotel,)

50
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,000
(I will lead Ocean Hotel)

51
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:41,639
(to glory once again.)

52
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,479
(As the new)

53
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,599
(Chairman of Ocean Hotel,)

54
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,199
(I will lead Ocean Hotel)

55
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,960
(to glory once again.)

56
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,520
(The focus of the industry)
As the new 

57
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,630
(Huo Jian as the Chairman of Ocean Group)
Chairman of Ocean Hotel,

58
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,280
I will lead Ocean Hotel

59
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:54,960
to glory once again.

60
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,310
(If you don't want anyone
to find out about your secret,)

61
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,839
(King of Spades)
(then do as I say.)

62
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,279
Now that you've found out

63
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,839
about the last thing you should know,

64
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,920
you can't stay alive any longer. 

65
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
(She even wanted to call the police.)

66
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,839
I told you.

67
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,360
This was your last chance.

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,800
What a pity.

69
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,519
You messed it up.

70
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,160
(Look.)

71
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,399
Even the heavens think

72
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,920
that you are a fool.

73
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,879
You don't deserve a single penny.

74
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,199
That's enough.

75
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:45,279
If you drink any more,
I'll have to send you back.

76
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:47,240
You might even throw up in my car.

77
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,720
Who asked you to send me back?

78
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,560
I'll get you a glass of milk tea.

79
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,160
No need.

80
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:53,680
Do you think I'm still a baby

81
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,639
that suckles milk like you?

82
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,519
Never mind then.

83
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,160
When I saw you playing drums earlier,

84
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,759
I knew there was something
troubling you.

85
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,480
Liang did

86
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,000
go a bit far this time.

87
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,079
He didn't even tell us

88
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,439
about such a big thing.

89
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,879
But what's worse

90
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:11,959
is that

91
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,759
he actually announced it
at your family's party.

92
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,720
There must be something wrong
with his brain.

93
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,920
That said,

94
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,360
there must be

95
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,959
a reason why Liang didn't tell us.

96
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:20,720
Think about it.

97
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,480
We grew up together.

98
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:23,639
When has he ever managed

99
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:24,560
to hide something from us?

100
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:26,680
Maybe

101
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,759
he never even wanted

102
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,519
to get along with that Su Xie Yi.

103
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,319
Today, he introduced her to us.

104
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,560
Tomorrow,
they might have already broken up.

105
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,600
Why bother?

106
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,120
What's your score for her last time?

107
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:41,439
What score?

108
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,759
What's the score?

109
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:44,480
90.

110
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:46,720
What about me?

111
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,480
100.

112
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,680
Don't lie. Be serious.

113
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,040
90.

114
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,879
Pretending to be impartial here,

115
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:56,480
aren't you?

116
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,800
Miss Shi,

117
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:00,160
you are incredibly hard to console.

118
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,120
Hou Xiao Dong!

119
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,199
Do I need you to console me?

120
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,199
This is silly.

121
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,680
This is dumb!

122
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,040
I...

123
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,360
Wait! I'll send you back.

124
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:12,920
(At 4 PM today,)

125
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,600
(the traffic police department
received a report)

126
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:15,959
(that a wrecked vehicle was recovered)

127
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,959
(from the river.)

128
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:17,959
(According to the preliminary judgment)

129
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,920
(of the investigation,
the cause of the accident)

130
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,519
(is believed to be drunk driving...)

131
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,920
It was raining quite heavily
a few days ago.

132
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,480
The water level of the river
is much higher than it was years ago.

133
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:28,839
(We would like to remind)

134
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,120
(all drivers)

135
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,480
(to avoid drunk driving)

136
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,720
(and drowsy driving.)

137
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:34,240
(In addition, police were unable
to locate the driver)

138
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:34,839
(at the scene.)

139
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:40,120
(Based on the car's license plate,)

140
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:41,519
(police have contacted the driver)

141
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,639
(and asked him
to help with the investigation)

142
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,759
(to find out the cause of the accident.)

143
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,720
Someone saved him.

144
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,439
(We also hope that viewers)

145
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,120
(who know the owner of the car)

146
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,319
(can contact the police
to provide information.)

147
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,040
Liang.

148
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,639
Ever since that Su Xie Yi

149
00:07:58,759 --> 00:07:59,759
appeared,

150
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,120
you've been getting more

151
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,240
and more mysterious.

152
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
Be honest with me.

153
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,160
Do you sincerely

154
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:06,959
like her,

155
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,000
or are you just trying to pass the time?

156
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,160
If I wanted to pass the time,

157
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,800
I could just play games.

158
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:22,279
Mr. Li,

159
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,240
he is awake.

160
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,120
Let's go.

161
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,720
Mr. Li.

162
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,840
You sure got lucky today.

163
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:45,519
If Liang hadn't asked

164
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,559
Ji Ying Song to follow you,

165
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,080
you would be

166
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,320
at the bridge to the other world by now.

167
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,480
Mr. Li.

168
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:52,960
You saved me?

169
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,159
Who else could it be?

170
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,919
Huo Jian?

171
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,679
You attacked Xie Yi.

172
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,440
I had Ji Ying Song follow you

173
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,320
to capture you.

174
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,519
That's my fault.

175
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,720
Before this, Huo Jian

176
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,279
wanted me to investigate Miss Su.

177
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,840
However, she found out.

178
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,559
I had no choice but to...

179
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:17,320
This...

180
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,559
I know.

181
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:19,919
You were only working for Huo Jian

182
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,840
because of your father.

183
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,639
I put some money on this card.

184
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:24,759
It's enough

185
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,840
to cover the rest of your father's
medical expenses.

186
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:34,720
I'm sorry, Mr. Li.

187
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,039
I was wrong.

188
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:37,200
Thank you.

189
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:38,759
Thank you.

190
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,200
Thank you.

191
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:45,639
You should know

192
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:46,679
that I didn't just save you

193
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,919
out of kindness.

194
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,360
I need you to repay the favor.

195
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,720
You've been working for Huo Jian
for all these years.

196
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,240
You've done many
of his dirty deeds for him.

197
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:56,720
I'm sure you must know

198
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,360
some of his unspeakable secrets.

199
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,240
I want to know the real reason.

200
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,320
You even sent Yi Fei

201
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,799
to find that Spider?

202
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,240
It must have something to do
with Mr. Li Senior's death,

203
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,240
right?

204
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,159
Could it be

205
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,679
that I got it right?

206
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,360
What did you say?

207
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:24,559
I overheard it as well.

208
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:25,919
He sent Yi Fei

209
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,279
to find someone known as the "Spider".

210
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,919
Spider?

211
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,120
This "Spider" guy is the one

212
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:33,080
who cleaned the windows
for the hospital Mr. Li Senior was in.

213
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,320
It was very strange indeed.

214
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,120
I only made it up
in the heat of the moment too.

215
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:39,879
Right.

216
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,399
It must be because of that.

217
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:44,240
However,

218
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,559
it seems he disappeared two years ago.

219
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,480
The "Spiders"

220
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,679
hang outside the wall.

221
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,519
They are not within
the surveillance zone.

222
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,480
Liang.

223
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,600
You've been investigating

224
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,279
the people who appeared inside,

225
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,519
but you found nothing.

226
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,919
Could it be that it was someone outside

227
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,919
who discovered something about Huo Jian?

228
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:08,679
Now it makes sense.

229
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,519
Liang.

230
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:11,200
We have hope now.

231
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:13,440
I'll go

232
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,840
and search for clues
about the Spider right now.

233
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,720
You and Ying Song

234
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,399
take him away from here right now.

235
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,559
This place isn't safe.

236
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,679
Remember to leave from the back door.

237
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,399
All right.

238
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,799
(According to the preliminary judgment
of the investigation,)

239
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,120
(the cause of the accident)

240
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,279
(is believed to be drunk driving)

241
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,200
(or drowsy driving)

242
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,639
(by the driver) 

243
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,120
(and the slippery roads)

244
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,960
(caused by recent rainfall)

245
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,480
(and other weather-related causes.)

246
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:36,879
(We would like to remind)

247
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,120
(all drivers)

248
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,480
(to obey the traffic rules)

249
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,200
(and to avoid drunk driving)

250
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,759
(and drowsy driving.)

251
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,480
(In addition, police were unable
to locate the driver)

252
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,120
(at the scene.)

253
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,360
(Based on the car's license plate,)

254
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:48,879
(police have contacted the driver)

255
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:50,080
(and asked him
to help with the investigation)

256
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,000
(to find out the cause of the accident.)

257
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,600
You don't like to go to the company.

258
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,240
It turns out

259
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,399
you prefer to hang around here, huh?

260
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,039
It's more fun to drink here.

261
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:19,159
You have a girlfriend now.

262
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:24,039
You should spend more time with her.

263
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,480
Why are you here, Uncle?

264
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,879
This belongs to Miss Su, right?

265
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,639
Yi Fei found it.

266
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:50,799
Back then, I wouldn't dare to say

267
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,240
I didn't like such alcohol

268
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,480
for fear that others would say
I had no taste or class.

269
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,879
Now that I'm old,

270
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:58,960
I've decided to stop pretending.

271
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,399
If I don't like it, I don't.

272
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,159
After all, no matter how well I pretend,

273
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:03,919
I will be found out

274
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:05,120
sooner or later,

275
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:07,440
isn't that right?

276
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,720
You're right, Uncle.

277
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:13,519
Don't worry.

278
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,320
She is perfectly safe right now.

279
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,120
It's inevitable

280
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,559
that people would sometimes
misplace things.

281
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:28,720
I lost something yesterday too.

282
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:32,399
Have you seen it?

283
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,120
Miss Yi?

284
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:21,000
You're awake, Miss Su.

285
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,120
How do you feel?

286
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,240
Miss Yi.

287
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,720
What is this place?

288
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,080
Why am I here?

289
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,600
This is our group's clubhouse.

290
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,559
Mr. Li was worried
that the hospital would be too crowded

291
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,799
and disturb your rest,

292
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,679
so he had me

293
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,679
bring you here.

294
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,480
You mean, Mr. Li...

295
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,240
Ze Liang told you

296
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,320
to bring me here?

297
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:43,759
Of course.

298
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,159
Then where is he?

299
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,080
Mr. Li is in a meeting right now.

300
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,559
You must be hungry.

301
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,879
Try our clubhouse's soup.

302
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,039
It's delicious.

303
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,200
Thank you, Ms. Yi.

304
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:20,840
Oh, right.

305
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,480
Have you seen my bracelet?

306
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,559
The one I always wear on my left wrist.

307
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,200
Your bracelet?

308
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:29,320
No, I haven't.

309
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:33,279
Then what about my phone?

310
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,559
I want to give Ze Liang a call.

311
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:36,440
He should know

312
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,720
where my bracelet is.

313
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:40,120
I haven't seen your phone either.

314
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,399
Then what about yours?

315
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,759
Can I borrow it?

316
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,679
Miss Su.

317
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,039
I've told you

318
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,080
Mr. Li is in a meeting right now.

319
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,600
He doesn't have time

320
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,799
to answer your call.

321
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,279
The most important thing

322
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,679
you should do right now
is rest and take care of your body.

323
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,600
You're right.

324
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,679
Ms. Yi.

325
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,240
When will Ze Liang

326
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,960
finish his meeting?

327
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:10,159
I miss him.

328
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I don't know.

329
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,039
Wait for the notification.

330
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,919
Sorry.

331
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:27,480
I just recovered.
My hands are still weak.

332
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,720
Can I take a shower?

333
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,279
Where is the darn lock?

334
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,919
Is something the matter?

335
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,159
This... This door...

336
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,200
This door has no lock.

337
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:56,960
If you need anything,

338
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,519
tell me.

339
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:58,960
I'll be right outside the door.

340
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,279
Hurry up and shower.

341
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,880
It's my first time here.

342
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,559
Aren't you going to give me a tour?

343
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,720
You have quite a lot
of private rooms here.

344
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:08,599
Who is it? Are you asking for trouble?

345
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,680
Mr. Huo?

346
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,759
Mr. Huo.

347
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:16,400
Why... Why are you here?

348
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:23,839
My girlfriend.

349
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,240
You have a girlfriend now?

350
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,519
Well, introduce her to me.

351
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:30,359
Mr. Huo,

352
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:32,359
I don't think the circumstances

353
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,680
are appropriate.

354
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:36,920
Nothing of the sort.

355
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,240
We'll have to meet someday either way.

356
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:40,839
Besides, I am your senior

357
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:41,960
as well.

358
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:42,720
Mr. Huo.

359
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:45,160
How about this?

360
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,319
I'll introduce you guys another day.

361
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:49,759
Girls are shy.

362
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:51,200
She doesn't have makeup on either.

363
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:54,440
Next time, I'll bring her

364
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:56,519
to visit you personally.

365
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:57,720
Is that all right, honey?

366
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,599
Be good now.

367
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:03,359
Feisty, isn't she?

368
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:04,279
Look.

369
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,920
She's embarrassed.

370
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,119
All right.

371
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,440
Another day then.

372
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,160
Why is she taking so long in the shower?

373
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,880
Miss Su.

374
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:03,680
Miss Su?

375
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,400
She mustn't have gone far.

376
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,319
What exactly

377
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:39,480
did you lose, Uncle?

378
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,079
Why don't I help you look for it?

379
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,440
Think.

380
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,880
You should know what it is.

381
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:51,160
Certain items have grave consequences

382
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,799
if you lose them.

383
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:56,000
Just like Miss Su's bracelet.

384
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:59,359
It's important to her,

385
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,640
but if someone else picked it up,

386
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:04,920
they might not appreciate it.

387
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,720
Hello?

388
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:16,559
Hello?

389
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:17,240
Li Ze Liang.

390
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,559
I was locked up by Yi Fei.

391
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:22,880
I finally managed to escape.

392
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,000
Hurry up and come and pick me up.

393
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,680
Stay where you are.

394
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,880
I'll head over right now.

395
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:33,680
Uncle,

396
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,319
I don't know

397
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:36,359
where the thing you want is,

398
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:37,920
but I've found

399
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,880
what I've been looking for.

400
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,960
I won't keep you company any longer.

401
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:42,160
Put it on my tab.

402
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:43,680
I'll be leaving now.

403
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,680
Tell me your location.

404
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:54,880
Hello?

405
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,319
I apologize, Mr. Huo.

406
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,400
She slipped out.

407
00:21:58,599 --> 00:21:59,480
We're looking for her right now.

408
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,319
Thank you.

409
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,759
Owner,

410
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,640
do you serve noodles here?

411
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,599
Do you have money?

412
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:42,480
I'm here.

413
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,559
Wait.

414
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,440
Help me pay for my noodles first.

415
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,319
Keep the change.

416
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,839
Their noodles are good.

417
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,960
Do you want a bowl of noodles too?

418
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,839
I'm fine.

419
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:27,960
Thanks.

420
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:30,720
What exactly happened?

421
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:32,160
When I woke up,

422
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,519
I found myself in a huge villa.

423
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,880
My phone and my bracelet were missing.

424
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:39,319
Yi Fei said you took me there

425
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:40,799
and told her to take care of me.

426
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:43,200
But she wouldn't let me contact you,

427
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:44,720
and she followed me everywhere.

428
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,720
She even

429
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,759
stood guard outside while I showered.

430
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,359
Fortunately, I was smart.

431
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,400
I noticed something was off right away.

432
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,920
That was practically a house arrest.

433
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:54,240
Something must be up.

434
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:55,799
So I tricked them

435
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,599
and got out.

436
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,880
You didn't take me there, did you?

437
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:07,240
No.

438
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:08,960
Why did Yi Fei

439
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,559
lie to me?

440
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,559
Could it be Huo Jian that's behind this?

441
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,279
Finish your noodles first.

442
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,799
It won't taste good once it gets lumpy.

443
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:38,680
Sorry.

444
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:42,519
Xie Yi.

445
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,559
I said

446
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,079
I would protect you,

447
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,079
but I failed to.

448
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,279
I'm sorry.

449
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,039
I'm fine.

450
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,599
I'm all right.

451
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,039
I'm just a little hungry.

452
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:23,680
Eat slowly.

453
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:27,200
I'm done.

454
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,119
Let's go.

455
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,960
I left in a hurry earlier.

456
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:39,200
I lost one of my slippers.

457
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:40,720
But that's all right.

458
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I can still walk.

459
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:42,839
Let's go.

460
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:47,310
♪You are my everything, my everything♪

461
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:47,920
Wait.

462
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:48,680
What is it?

463
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:51,750
46.9.

00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,880

00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,559
It's more than that.

470
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:09,680
You had a bowl of noodles.

471

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:13,480
I'm sorry.

476
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,720
I messed up.

477
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,039
That's not important anymore.

478
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:18,039
Did you find out where Lin Tai is?

479
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:18,839
I didn't see him

480
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,920
at the entrance of the bar,

481
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,720
but I checked
the surveillance cameras nearby.

482
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:26,720
This is surveillance footage

483
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,960
from a cafe behind the bar.

484
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,680
This was when I went to the bar.

485
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,400
But I haven't managed to find out

486
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,359
where Ji Ying Song

487
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:36,200
took Lin Tai.

488
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,400
They are deliberately hiding.

489
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:40,720
You won't be able to find them.

490
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,960
But this isn't entirely a bad thing.

491
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:45,000
On the contrary,

492
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,519
it revealed my nephew's true colors.

493
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,680
He...

494
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:50,960
Could it be

495
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,039
that he has found the Spider?

496
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,880
That shouldn't be the case.

497
00:27:57,799 --> 00:27:58,400
We've been looking for him
for two years,

498
00:27:58,519 --> 00:27:59,400
and we haven't even managed to find him.

499
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:00,759
Even if he is searching for the Spider,

500
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,039
he won't find him that easily.

501
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:05,839
Continue to keep an eye
on the people around him.

502
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,200
If you find out
that they are searching for the Spider,

503
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:09,559
alert me immediately.

504
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:23,200
I made you some ginger tea.

505
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:25,720
Drink it and warm yourself up.

506
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:28,319
Thank you.

507
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,279
You're welcome.

508
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:31,799
Be careful. It's hot.

509
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,200
It's very spicy.

510
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:38,480
The spiciness drives away the cold.

511
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,559
Use this.

512
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,319
Your place isn't safe anymore.

513
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:50,079
You should stay in a hotel for now.

514
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:58,400
You bought me a new phone

515
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,200
and paid for me to stay at a hotel.

516
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,319
Is this what they call

517
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:03,880
a blessing in disguise?

518
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,119
There are

519
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:11,160
no grudges between Yi Fei and me.

520
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:12,920
Why did she do this to me?

521
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,880
She must have been acting
under Huo Jian's orders.

522
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:18,680
But why does Huo Jian
want to imprison me?

523
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,440
Could it be that he wants to use me

524
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,400
to threaten you?

525
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,680
Or...

526
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,440
Could it be that he is involved
with my family's matter as well?

527
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:28,960
And he is warning me?

528
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,440
Look.

529
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,279
Chen Heng Sheng may have been the one

530
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,480
to have signed the contract for Zhiwei,

531
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,440
but Huo Jian

532
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,000
could still get Chen Heng Sheng

533
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:39,240
to sell the fakes.

534
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:40,920
It would make sense
that he could order him

535
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,960
to ruin Zhiwei too.

536
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,039
Why aren't you saying anything?

537
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:48,720
Did I get it right?

538
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:55,160
You got it right.

539
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,880
It was Huo Jian.

540
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,160
Then why didn't you

541
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,079
tell me this sooner?

542
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,400
Is it fun watching me

543
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:01,400
chase after Chen Heng Sheng?

544
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,839
You don't know Huo Jian.

545
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,920
He is ruthless and merciless

546
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,880
to anyone who gets in his way.

547
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:09,759
He is a terrifying man.

548
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:11,640
But I'm not scared of him.

549
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,599
I'm scared.

550
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:16,559
Don't worry.

551
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,720
I won't drag you down.

552
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,559
I'm not afraid of being dragged down.

553
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:21,519
I'm afraid he would hurt you.

554
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:22,839
I'm worried

555
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:24,079
that you would act impulsively,

556
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:24,880
given

557
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,319
your reckless personality.

558
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,440
If that happens,

559
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,640
not only would we not be able
to get anything on him,

560
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,359
but we would also alert him instead.

561
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,400
Then

562
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,680
why are you telling me this now?

563
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,519
I'm telling you this

564
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,000
because I want you to stay alert
and be more cautious,

565
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:37,440
not because

566
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:38,519
I want you to go after him.

567
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:40,480
I don't think he knows
about your relationship

568
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,640
with Zhiwei right now.

569
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,920
He only wants to use you

570
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:43,920
to get to me.

571
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,319
So you should

572
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:46,519
still be safe right now.

573
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,680
As long as you don't do anything rash,

574
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,400
he won't actually hurt you.

575
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:53,160
So you want me

576
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,640
just to stay put and do nothing?

577
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:55,960
I can't do that.

578
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,400
I will help you.

579
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,480
Huo Jian is your uncle

580
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:02,319
and the Chairman of Ocean Group.

581
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,440
Why should I believe

582
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,279
that you would help me?

583
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:06,039
My father

584
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,720
founded Ocean Group

585
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,079
with his blood and tears.

586
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,400
Huo Jian wants to acquire Ocean Group
all for himself.

587
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:13,960
He is currently using Yuanfeng

588
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,400
to make money and buy up 
Ocean Hotel's shares.

589
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,200
That is why I want to help you.

590
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,240
(So Huo Jian)

591
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,680
(laid his hands on Ocean Hotel as well.)

592
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,319
But given your current position
at Ocean Hotel,

593
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,799
it's hard enough
for you to protect yourself.

594
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,920
How are you going to take on Huo Jian?

595
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,079
I'll take you to a place.

596
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,519
Come with me.

597
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,400
This is...

598
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,720
Welcome to my secret world.

599
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:51,690
(Chen Heng Sheng, Yi Fei)

600
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,570
(Huo Jian appointed
as the Chairman of Ocean Group)

601
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,359
What do you think?

602
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,319
This is incredible.

603
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:11,880
Apart from Ji Ying Song,

604
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:12,680
you're the first person

605
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,599
to have entered here.

606
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,400
You practiced rock climbing here?

607
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,559
That means

608
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:20,759
everything you did

609
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:22,160
back at the hotel

610
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:23,519
was just for show.

611
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,559
I pretended to be incapable

612
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,200
to let Huo Jian's guard down.

613
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:31,200
I know

614
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,400
all of the tricks up his sleeves now.

615
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:33,440
However,

616
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:35,559
this is still not the right time

617
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:37,000
to confront him.

618
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,039
Xie Yi.

619
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,720
Heed my advice.

620
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,039
To take on an old fox like Huo Jian,

621
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:45,079
not only do you need
a carefully laid-out plan,

622
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,640
but you need plenty of patience as well.

623
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:49,359
All right.

624
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:50,559
I'll do as you say.

625
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,640
Can I ask you a question?

626
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,239
Is your left leg really injured?

627
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,440
Do you really want to know?

628
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:13,559
I want

629
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:14,760
to know more about you.

630
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,199
How did that happen?

631
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:47,119
You know I love outdoor sports.

632
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,880
Sometimes, the tiniest accident

633
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:53,280
can lead to unfortunate consequences.

634
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:55,880
Does it still hurt?

635
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:01,280
If I were still
at the foot of the mountain,

636
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:03,039
I'm confident I could climb

637
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,440
to the top once again

638
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:06,320
and

639
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:09,119
meet

640
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:10,800
the girl that thought of me
as a wild boar.

641
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,840
I'm happy.

642
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,159
You've always been you.

643
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,719
Can you teach me rock climbing?

644
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,840
Of course.

645
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,159
But the more pressing matter
right now is...

646
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:39,039
Be careful you don't catch a cold.

647
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,719
Why don't I do it myself?

648
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,159
Be good.

649
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:54,320
Just sit still.

650
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:04,280
What are you doing?

651
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:06,000
The great Mr. Li

652
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:07,480
is actually drying my hair for me.

653
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,119
Of course, I have to take a photo

654
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:10,480
to commemorate such a glorious occasion.

655
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:11,119
Come on.

656
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:24,199
Oh, right.

657
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,079
I need to talk to you about something.

658
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,800
I almost called you Mr. Li
in front of Yi Fei today

659
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,840
and almost let it slip.

660
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,800
As your girlfriend in name,

661
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,039
what should I call you?

662
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:37,719
Anything.

663
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,800
That won't do.

664
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,639
Ze Liang.

665
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,679
That's too plain.

666
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:47,119
Everyone calls you that.

667
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:48,280
Liang?

668
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:51,639
That sounds Hong Kongese or Taiwanese.

669
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:54,719
Liang Liang?

670
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:56,079
No.

671
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:57,800
Liang Liang?

672
00:36:58,599 --> 00:36:59,320
No.

673
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:01,920
The meaning isn't good.

674
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,239
Xiao Liang?

675
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:04,880
Xiao Liang.

676
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,320
What about Xiao Liang?

677
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:09,199
That's enough.

678
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,679
You don't think it's good either, right?

679
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,199
Isn't there anything
that sounds a little more intimate?

680
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:28,840
In that case, you can call me Yan.

681
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,280
Yan?

682
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,199
Is that your nickname?

683
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:41,639
Yes.

684
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,159
Only the ones closest to me know

685
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:45,400
that nickname.

686
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,480

That's a nice name.

689
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,239

Huo Jian gave it to me.

00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,960
That old fox, Huo Jian.

697

I'll go and see who it is.

731
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,480
Mr. Li.

It's Ying Song.

I have to talk to him for a bit.

735

How did it go?

736
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,480
I've sent him away

00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,159
according to the path you designated.

738

739
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,440
I looked up that "Spider".

740
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:41,440
His name is Liu Ah Wei.

741
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:42,719
After he disappeared two years ago,

742
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,079
he never took another job.

743
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:45,280
He's from Yunnan.

744
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:46,559
However, two years ago,

745
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:48,199
he moved away from his old residence

746
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,480
with his wife and children.

747
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:50,960
No one knows where he is right now.

748
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:53,360
Huo Jian has been looking for this guy.

749
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,719
That means there must be something wrong
with him.

750
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,559
Keep searching.

751
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,599
As long as
we can get information on him,

752
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,000
spare no expense.

753
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,000
Understood.

754
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,639
Huo Jian's men

755
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:04,840
stood guard at the bar all day today.

756
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:05,840
I'm not sure

757
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,960
if they noticed Lin Tai or not.

758
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:09,760
That doesn't matter anymore.

759
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:11,199
He and I...

760
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:13,199
There are some things

761
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,360
both of us know well enough already.

762
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,079
Then what should we do next?

763
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:19,239
For all these years,

764
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,039
Huo Jian has been using Yunfeng Hotel

765
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,239
to earn profits for himself secretly

766
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,239
and using that money

767
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,039
to buy up loose shares from the market.

768
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,079
He has made his ambition clear.

769
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:32,239
As for us,

770
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,199
we've pretty much figured out

771
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,039
all the methods

772
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:36,079
he has been using to make money.

773
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,480
Are we going to begin our counterattack?

774
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:53,119
