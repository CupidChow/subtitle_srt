2
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:25,000
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,550
♫  Still haunts me now and then in quiet nights  ♫

4
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:41,330
♫  And turn to face all the long lost times  ♫

5
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,370
♫  Brace the pain  ♫

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:51,210
♫  Let memories wake up from oceans deep  ♫

7
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,350
♫  No place to hide  ♫

8
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,450
♫  No way to run  ♫

9
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,820
♫  New dawn counts down  ♫

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,030
♫  I fight  ♫

11
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,010
♫  I cry  ♫

12
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,800
♫  I give up  ♫

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:15,710
♫  Memories forgotten, forsaken surround  ♫

14
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:24,030
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

15
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:32,470
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

16
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:40,950
♫  Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

17
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:49,720
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

18
00:01:49,720 --> 00:02:00,150

19
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,200

20
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,400
Thank you, Sir. Bye-bye.

21
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,600
Little girl, watch your step.

22
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,700
Thank you, Sir.

23
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:20,779
Sir, get me a bottle of water.

24
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,440
Here you go.

25
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,640
Sir, have you seen these two friends of mine before?

26
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,360
No.

27
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,120
Well, there's a person called Liu A’Wei.

28
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,960
Do you know where he lives?

29
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,160
I don't.

30
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,600
Thank you. No worries.

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,080
Let's split up and search.

32
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,520
Tell me if you find anything.

33
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,120
Yes, Chairman Huo.

34
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:13,219
Xieyi.

35
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,699
Are you tired?

36
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,800
I'm not.

37
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,019
To be honest with you, I haven't felt this relaxed for a while.

38
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:36,520
Yes.

39
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,120
This place is completely different from Shanghai.

40
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,879
Wish I could stay here for a few more days.

41
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,000
Sure. Let's stay here for a few more days then.

42
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,219
I can do it myself.

43
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:56,799
Let me do it.

44
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,879
It broke two years ago.

45
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:37,679
It's a prosthetic limb.

46
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,819
It's done.

47
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,879
Xiaoxiao, come and have a seat.

48
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:49,379
Come here.

49
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,659
Sit here.

50
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:03,519
Xiaoxiao, I'm sure you have many questions for me.

51
00:05:03,527 --> 00:05:07,959
Brother Li, how did you manage to do that?

52
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,079
If it weren't for that moment just now,

53
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,421
I would never know that your leg was...

54
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:18,439
Xiaoxiao, do you know that I love rock climbing the most?

55
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:20,239
In the past,

56
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:23,760
I used to go rock climbing in mountains.

57
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,019
And I got to know Xieyi because of rock climbing as well.

58
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:35,800
That's why rock climbing is inseparable from my life.

59
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,800
Two years ago, I broke my leg.

60
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,779
At that moment,

61
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:47,420
I thought I could never stand up again.

62
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,139
 Sorry, we have no choice but to amputate his leg.

63
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,200
 Doctor, aren't there any other solutions to this?

64
00:05:56,299 --> 00:05:58,759
 His leg was deeply penetrated by a rusty pipe.

65
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,160
 And it was immersed in the rain for a long time.

66
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,500
 His wound has contracted clostridial myonecrosis due to C. Difficile infection.

67
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,740
 Once this virus enters the body, after a few hours,

68
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,100
 it will start attacking the neuromuscular junction.

69
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:17,400
 If we don't take any measures, the patient will face respiratory paralysis which may lead to his death.

70
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,800
 Back then, I was in deep grief.

71
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,600
 I was very negative as well.

72
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,560
 My friends and family were very cautious about it.

73
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,900
 They even hid away my rock climbing equipment.

74
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,339
 They were afraid that I might be upset if I saw them.

75
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:36,100
 One morning, I went to the balcony without telling anyone.

76
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,660
 That was my first time seeing the sunrise after my leg was broken.

77
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:46,660
 It felt... mystical and magical.

78
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:51,860
I remembered that I once made a promise to a person

79
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,499
that I would watch the sunrise together with her.

80
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,319
If I continue to be negative about it,

81
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:02,910
I was afraid that I might not have the chance to see her again.

82
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,499
But aren't you afraid of other people's opinions?

83
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:13,639
Their opinions don't matter.

84
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,399
The most important thing here

85
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:19,359
is the opinion of the person I love.

86
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,839
As long as she treats me like a normal person,

87
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:24,199
I will be a normal person.

88
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,959
I'm so envious of you two.

89
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,319
If only my mother could be like Sister Xieyi.

90
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:47,899
Xiaoxiao, your mother didn't do anything wrong.

91
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:49,999
You're her only child.

92
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,079
Of course, she would be worried about you and wanted to protect you.

93
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,800
But Xiaoxiao, your mother will grow old one day.

94
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,839
She won't be able to protect you again by then.

95
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:06,859
That's why. No matter, whether you're doing it for your mother or for yourself,

96
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:12,600
you need to learn how to be strong and learn how to accept yourself, understood?

97
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:15,600
What should I do then?

98
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,240
You love singing, right?

99
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,299
You should do just that.

100
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,759
That's right.

101
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,779
At night, when the stars are out, you can sing over here.

102
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:30,600
I believe that your father will surely hear you from above.

103
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,600
I'm afraid that I might mess it up.

104
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,039
Don't worry.

105
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,739
Look.

106
00:08:36,739 --> 00:08:39,360
Even I can do rock climbing again.

107
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,800
Of course, you won't mess it up.

108
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:45,339
Xieyi, am I right?

109
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:47,020
That's right.

110
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:50,559
If so, you guys need to accompany me.

111
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,080
Of course.

112
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,279
We will accompany you.

113
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:08,420
This Shi Chuchu promised to visit me today.

114
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,400
Why isn't she here yet?

115
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:13,820
She's not professional at all.

116
00:09:16,414 --> 00:09:18,359
It's just role-playing, right?

117
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:21,500
Just play your role! But she quit without telling me.

118
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:26,039
Quit what?

119
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,519
Nothing.

120
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,200
Just now, Brother Ji called me.

121
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,039
He insisted on making some cold dishes for me.

122
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:39,460
I told him not to do so. I told him that.

123
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,900
Since when did you become so courteous?

124
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,039
Now, I'm a patient.

125
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:48,672
If Brother Ji brings me the cold dishes that he had made,

126
00:09:48,673 --> 00:09:51,840
won't it arouse suspicion easily?

127
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,918
You're pretty meticulous?

128
00:09:53,918 --> 00:09:57,300
And you. Now, my role is to play as a patient.

129
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,440
Your role is to play as my family member.

130
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,519
Next time, if you visit me empty-handed again,

131
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,360
Huo Jian will surely be suspicious of us.

132
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,299
When he's suspicious of us, he'll expose us.

133
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:12,159
Once he has exposed us, what should we do if he ruins A'Liang's plan?

134
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:16,020
Can you bear that risk?

135
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,780
Fine, I got it.

136
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,620
Good.

137
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,120
Oh right, you were late today.

138
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,400
You should be punctual tomorrow.

139
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,804
Last time, when I was poisoned,

140
00:10:32,804 --> 00:10:35,960
the soup you made for me was pretty good.

141
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,759
You should make the same soup for me tomorrow.

142
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:39,619
Don't push your luck!

143
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,159
My face is so itchy because of the bandage.

144
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,879
It's too itchy. It doesn't help no matter how I scratch it.

145
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,320
Fine.

146
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,300
I'll make some soup for you tomorrow.

147
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,140
Speaking of grapes,

148
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,199
I do feel like eating some.

149
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,539
No one said grapes just now.

150
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:05,439
You said it just now.

151
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:10,420
Chuchu, you may not know, but it's so itchy.

152
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,320
It doesn't help no matter how I scratch it.

153
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,200
Fine. I'll peel some grapes for you.

154
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,399
Xiaoxiao! Xiaoxiao!

155
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,659
Listen to me. There were plenty of people today.

156
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:10,320
Our business was pretty good. That's why I came back late.

157
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,740
Let's grab a bite.

158
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:29,620
 Mom, you've worked hard at the market.

159
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,639
 I've heated the dishes for you.

160
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:33,279
 You can have them yourself.

161
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,080
 Tonight, I decide

162
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,240
 to head to the riverside that Dad used to bring me to

163
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,419
 and sing for him.

164
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:41,580
 When you guys named me,

165
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:44,679
 I'm sure you wanted me to be happy, right?

166
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:47,159
 That's why today,

167
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:49,899
 I wish to do something that will truly make me happy.

168
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:52,360
 Mom, I hope you won't be angry at me.

169
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,260
Xiaoxiao, take this.

170
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,538
Uncle Cao, didn't you use this microphone to promote and sell your honey?

171
00:13:10,538 --> 00:13:11,580
That's right.

172
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,399
We borrowed the microphone Uncle Cao had used to promote and sell his honey.

173
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,960
What do you think? The equipment is pretty good, right?

174
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,519
I'm not lending it to you. I'm renting it to you.

175
00:13:18,527 --> 00:13:21,398
It costs 50 yuan for an hour.

176
00:13:21,398 --> 00:13:25,359
Xiaoxiao, I believe that you can do a good job.

177
00:13:25,359 --> 00:13:29,278
I promise. As long as you do a good job, I'll waive the rental fee for you.

178
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:33,081
And I will give the microphone to you for free.

179
00:13:33,081 --> 00:13:35,240
Xiaoxiao, you can do it.

♪  As I push open the window of night  ♪

181
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,458
Xiaoxiao, I believe

182
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:52,839
that your mother didn't hate your singing.

183
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:58,100
She's just afraid that you might be influenced by other people's opinions.

184
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,300
But if singing itself can make you very happy,

185
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:07,140
I believe your mother will surely support you.

186
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:10,519
That's why, don't treat this as a burden.

187
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:11,799
Just give it your all.

188
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,719
You can sing if you feel like it.

189
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,739
That's right. Look.

190
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:19,440
The stars are shining tonight.

191
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,739
I believe your father will surely hear your voice.

192
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,700
Look at how forgetful I am.

193
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,480
I have some backing tracks here.

194
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,499
I'll play the backing tracks for you.

195
00:14:31,499 --> 00:14:34,799

00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:17,159
Xiaoxiao, you were great!

227
00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:18,960
Good job!

228
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,279
- What's wrong, Xiaoxiao? 
 - Xiaoxiao?

229
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,979
It's my mother.

230
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,280
It's fine.

231
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,519
Auntie, sorry about that.

232
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:38,820
Don't blame Xiaoxiao for this.

233
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,440
We were the ones who brought her here.

234
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,800
Thank you. I'd like to thank you both.

235
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,839
Xiaoxiao, your singing was beautiful.

236
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,819
My Xiaoxiao is the best.

237
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,820
Mom!

238
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:06,480
Sorry. I shouldn't have stopped you from singing.

239
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,720
In the future, you can sing whenever you like.

240
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,720
Thank you, Mom.

241
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:22,119
Xiaoxiao, go over there and play with Uncle Cao for a while.

242
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:25,540
I need to have a word with them.

243
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,880
Chairman Huo, I saw Li Zeliang.

244
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,540
He's very close to a pair of mother and daughter.

245
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,240
 Mother and daughter?

246
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,419
 They might be related to Liu A’Wei.

247
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,519
 Follow them.

248
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:51,919
Yes, Sir.

249
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:03,000
Mr. Li, Miss Su, you see...

250
00:19:03,939 --> 00:19:06,759
Auntie, don't get us wrong.

251
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:08,359
We didn't mean anything else.

252
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:10,939
We just like Xiaoxiao.

253
00:19:10,939 --> 00:19:12,400
Don't misunderstand me.

254
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,880
I was trying to say that I was especially anxious

255
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,919
when Xiaoxiao lost her hearing.

256
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:23,559
I was truly worried about how she'd cope with life when I'm gone.

257
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:28,540
But until today, I realized that maybe I was wrong from the start.

258
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,240
Xiaoxiao can live like an ordinary person.

259
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,839
Look. She did a great job at singing.

260
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,279
Mr. Li, thank you.

261
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,719
Thank you for everything that you did for Xiaoxiao.

262
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:43,140
Thank you.

263
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,640
Please get up.

264
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,119
Actually, we were wrong as well.

265
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:58,080
We brought Xiaoxiao here without your permission.

266
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,779
We would like to apologize for that.

267
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:02,179
Please don't say that.

268
00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:04,980
Actually, I should be the one to apologize.

269
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,699
Actually, before A'Wei left, he left something for me.

270
00:20:08,699 --> 00:20:10,440
He told me to keep it safe.

271
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,119
He said I might need to use it in the future.

272
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:15,359
But I didn't tell you both about it.

273
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:18,900
W-What did he leave for you?

274
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,400
It's a USB drive.

275
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,920
He didn't want me to check it.

276
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,640
And I know nothing about computers.

277
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,019
That's why I don't know what's inside.

278
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:29,960
If you both are looking for this, I can pass it to you.

279
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:32,919
That's great.

280
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:34,920
So where is the USB drive?

281
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,799
I need to return home and find it.

282
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,559
How about this? You guys can drop by tomorrow morning.

283
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,179
I'll pass it on to you both by then.

284
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:42,840
Okay, thank you.

285
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,039
Thank you.

286
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:46,480
I'll return with Xiaoxiao first.

287
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,980
Okay.

288
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:57,419
Do you think that's a piece of evidence?

289
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,500
Xieyi, looks like

290
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,539
the heavens are helping us.

291
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:06,880
But we still have to wait until tomorrow.

292
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,640
Tonight will be a long night.

293
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,899
Xiaoxiao, are you cold?

294
00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:23,200
I'm sure you haven't eaten yet, right?

295
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,460
I'll make you some spicy soup later.

296
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,760
A'Yan, when you were helping Xiaoxiao out,

297
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,780
did you expect to get anything in return?

298
00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:53,739
Actually, at first, I did approach her

299
00:21:54,619 --> 00:21:58,219
just so we could get our hands on the things we wanted.

300
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,239
But after that,

301
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,559
when I had truly understood her,

302
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:06,979
I also truly hoped that she could be happy.

303
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,820
Me too.

304
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:13,480
I guess being good does have its perks.

305
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,580
What was on your mind when you were listening to the song?

306
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,340
I was reminded of my father.

307
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:30,040
I was reminded of the times when he took care of me.

308
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:35,419
It's a pity that I can't keep the promise I've made to him.

309
00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:38,219
So when I listened to Xiaoxiao's singing,

310
00:22:38,219 --> 00:22:41,580
I was touched and felt regretful at the same time.

311
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,760
You're right.

312
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,577
Just like what we'd said to Xiaoxiao,

313
00:22:51,577 --> 00:22:53,620
your father is in heaven.

314
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:57,359
I'm sure he wishes for us to lead a happy life.

315
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:01,919
I believe that he'll surely bless us from above

316
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,100
and help us acquire the evidence.

317
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,359
What about you? What was on your mind then?

318
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:18,820
I was thinking about what happened two years ago.

319
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,799
It was under the same night sky.

320
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:25,939
A girl and I were sitting on a mountain top.

321
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,860
We were listening to some music.

322
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,720
A girl?

323
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,739
Which girl do you mean?

324
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,319
It's been too long since then.

325
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:39,119
I can't remember clearly.

326
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:42,339
I think her name was Xiao Yi.

327
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:44,240
Or, was it Xiao Huang?

328
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,519
Xiao Bai?

329
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:47,980
Xiao Chen?

330
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,400
Be honest with me.

331
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,200
Have you flirted with any other girls before you encountered me?

332
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,660
No.

333
00:23:55,459 --> 00:23:57,159
Really?

334
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:59,839
Really.

335
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:03,659
I only did one thing during the first half of my life.

336
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:05,820
That is to wait for your appearance.

337
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,779
You're such a glib talker. I don't believe you.

338
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:15,080
♫  Because you're my angel  ♫

339
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,200
♫  Baby, I love you  ♫

340
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,840
♫  I feel you, I need you  ♫

341
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,519
♫  I want to be happy because of you  ♫

342
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:28,156
You should believe that I won't deceive you.

343
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:34,280
♫  I want you to have the entire starry sky  ♫

344
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,360
♫  Baby, I love you  ♫

345
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,100
♫  I feel you, I need you  ♫

346
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:44,120
♫  I want to be happy because of you  ♫

347
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,960
♫  I secretly blindfolded you  ♫

348
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,020
♫  I'll tell you where I am  ♫

349
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:53,700
♫  It's just you and I, forever  ♫

350
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,680
 Rent a power bank for me! I forgot to bring my charging cable!

351
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,159
Okay.

352
00:25:39,259 --> 00:25:41,300
Is this the hotel you've booked for me?

353
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,859
That's right.

354
00:25:42,859 --> 00:25:45,019
There's not even a single person at the reception desk.

355
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,660
I'll call them immediately.

356
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,380
Anyone there?

357
00:25:50,499 --> 00:25:52,560
- Anyone there? 
 - Come back!

358
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,839
Why are you shouting in the middle of the night?

359
00:25:57,839 --> 00:25:59,439
Let me ask you.

360
00:25:59,439 --> 00:26:01,880
Are you sure you found Liu A’Wei's house?

361
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,500
Yes, Sir. I've inquired about them in the vicinity.

362
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,259
That girl is Liu A’Wei's daughter.

363
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:10,660
And I heard that Liu A’Wei had passed away.

364
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,900
He passed away?

365
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,400
That's right.

366
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,039
That's good news for me.

367
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:20,879
Chairman Huo, who exactly is this Liu A’Wei?

368
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:23,419
That's not something you should ask.

369
00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:25,680
Are you heading to their house right now?

370
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,459
Only the mother and the daughter are in the house.

371
00:26:27,459 --> 00:26:29,860
You want me to find them in the middle of the night?

372
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,079
Are you out of your mind?

373
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:32,540
Understood.

374
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:35,200
So... So do you want to change to another hotel?

375
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,800
Of course.

376
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:44,079
You've been away for quite some time.

377
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:47,599
Did some ladies try to flirt with you since you are good-looking?

378
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:49,499
I saw Huo Jian.

379
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,200
Why is he here?

380
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,759
I don't know.

381
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:56,035
Will Xiaoxiao and her mother be in danger then?

382
00:26:56,035 --> 00:26:57,799
He was looking for accommodation.

383
00:26:57,799 --> 00:26:59,319
That means he has just arrived here.

384
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:01,559
At least, he won't do anything tonight.

385
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,839
Let's head to Xiaoxiao's house early in the morning tomorrow.

386
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,439
All right.

387
00:27:10,459 --> 00:27:11,859
Speak.

388
00:27:11,859 --> 00:27:14,219
Speak what?

389
00:27:14,219 --> 00:27:16,200
Brother Ji had told me everything.

390
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,960
Huo Jian knew this was an act long ago.

391
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,060
Why did you lie to me and tell me to continue the act with you?

392
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,460
I...

393
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,420
Right. Why was I still acting?

394
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,299
Let's go. Send me back to the bar.

395
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:29,720
Stop pretending.

396
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,000
Answer my question.

397
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,900
Okay.

398
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:36,699
I'm afraid you can't take it if I tell you the truth.

399
00:27:36,699 --> 00:27:38,960
- Come here. 
 - What?

400
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,159
Come here and look into my eyes.

401
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:50,359
Closer.

402
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,979
Closer.

403
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,919
In psychology,

404
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:11,280
when a person looks at someone special to them with excitement,

405
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,520
their pupils will dilate by 45%.

406
00:28:15,139 --> 00:28:20,840
So did you detect any changes in my eyes?

407
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,040
You mean like this?

408
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,000
That's not it!

409
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,900
Delete it immediately! Give it to me!

410
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,540
Stop pretending!

411
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,400
Chuchu, I'm not pretending this time.

412
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,100
Look.

413
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,200
That night, Huo Jian came to find Zeliang.

414
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,719
He even discovered the secret chamber.

415
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,699
I sprained my ankle because I tried to stop Huo Jian.

416
00:28:42,699 --> 00:28:47,260
Listen, this time, I was really injured for helping A'Liang.

417
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,060
By the way, Chuchu, Huo Jian has gone to Yun'an as well.

418
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:59,280
No wonder I didn't see him for the past few days.

419
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,319
Do you think he will try to hurt Zeliang again?

420
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:05,599
Don't worry, Brother Ji is over there as well.

421
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:07,919
I don't think something bad will happen.

422
00:29:11,639 --> 00:29:15,439
 Coming! Coming!

423
00:29:18,139 --> 00:29:19,620
You are here. Please come in.

424
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,607
Let's go inside.

425
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:39,480
You guys haven't had breakfast yet, right?

426
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,359
The spicy soup I had made is still hot.

427
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:44,079
Thank you.

428
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:47,960
Just now, your uncle praised me after he tried it.

429
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:57,099
Have a seat.

430
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,720
By the way, where's Xiaoxiao?

431
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,699
She's playing outside together with your uncle.

432
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,780
Sister Xieyi?

433
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:13,060
Xiaoxiao, where did you go just now?

434
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,760
I went to the backyard.

435
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,280
Zeliang,

436
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,000
so you were discharged from the hospital? Why didn't you notify me about it?

437
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,839
I was worried about you, you know?

438
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:25,559
Look at how courteous your uncle is.

439
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:28,000
Look. He bought plenty of stuff for me.

440
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,400
It's nothing.

441
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,299
Zeliang's friends are my friends as well.

442
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:33,920
Oh yes, you all have it while it's hot.

443
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,819
I'll take something for you guys.

444
00:30:35,819 --> 00:30:37,759
Mr. Huo, have a seat as well. Don't just stand there.

445
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:39,259
Okay.

446
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,820
Xiaoxiao, I have something to tell you.

447
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:57,719
Go now.

448
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,360
What were you whispering about?

449
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,020
You should share it with us.

450
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,900
Let us join in on the fun.

451
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:08,480
So there was Little Red Riding Hood, and she fell sick.

452
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,260
Her grandmother went to visit her.

453
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:15,079
In the end, her wig was removed.

454
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:17,259
Actually, it was a wolf.

455
00:31:17,259 --> 00:31:19,500
It wanted to eat Little Red Riding Hood,

456
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,820
and take her house for itself.

457
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:26,960
By the way, A'Yan, you still don't know the ending yet, right?

458
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,040
In the end,

459
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,440
that wolf was captured by their righteous neighbors.

460
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,920
And they sent it to prison.

461
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:37,459
The wolf had to spend its entire life in prison.

462
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,039
That's just a story.

463
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:46,459
But when it comes to reality, the ending is often the opposite.

464
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,720
Xiaoxiao, why are you still here. Hurry and head to school.

465
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,419
What's the matter, Xiaoxiao?

466
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:10,539
Sister Xieyi told me not to take this out first.

467
00:32:10,539 --> 00:32:11,459
But why?

468
00:32:11,459 --> 00:32:13,700
Sister Xieyi told me to do so.

469
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,800
We should follow her instruction.

470
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:22,240
Xiaoxiao, I know that this was left by your father.

471
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,100
But since I've promised to give it to them, I have to keep my promise.

472
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,019
You should head to school.

473
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,200
Zeliang, the spicy soup Xiaoxiao's mother had made was delicious indeed.

474
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,159
I had a few bowls of it just now.

475
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:41,319
You guys should eat up.

476
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:42,799
How did you know I was here?

477
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,219
Didn't I tell you already?

478
00:32:44,219 --> 00:32:45,559
I was worried about you.

479
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:48,139
Not only do I know your location,

480
00:32:48,139 --> 00:32:50,480
but I also know what you plan to do.

481
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:58,271
So you followed me all the way here because you felt guilty?

482
00:32:58,271 --> 00:33:02,359
So that means you were the one who did it.

483
00:33:05,899 --> 00:33:08,200
How many times have I told you?

484
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,359
You need to provide evidence when you speak.

485
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:12,399
When you put it like this,

486
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,900
I feel heartbroken.

487
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,860
You should burn more joss paper for him.

488
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:25,560
See if he'll tell you about it.

489
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,820
Sir, I found the thing you guys were looking for.

490
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:33,480
- Wait! 
 - Stop!

491
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,121
Xieyi. Don't chase after him.

492
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,100
He can't run away.

493
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,600
Have a seat.

494
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,559
This... What's going on?

495
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:51,259
Sister Xia, my uncle was right.

496
00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:54,959
The spicy soup you made is delicious indeed.

497
00:33:54,959 --> 00:33:57,219
Please get my uncle another bowl.

498
00:33:57,219 --> 00:33:58,819
Sure.

499
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,079
Chaihuo, where are you going?

500
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,480
 Hello, Yingsong?

501
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,299
 Mr. Li? What's the matter?

502
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,860
 I saw Huo Jian just now.

503
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,460
 What?

504
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,599
 Are you saying that Huo Jian has gone to Yun'an as well?

505
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:17,519
 That's right.

506
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:19,400
 How would he know about your location?

507
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,320
 Don't tell me he has planted other spies beside you?

508
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,280
 I'm not sure.

509
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,960
 Yingsong, tomorrow is a crucial day.

510
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,219
 I want you to do something for me.

511
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,180

512
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,719
That fellow has burned the USB drive.

513
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,624
 The evidence is gone.

514
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:42,459
Zeliang, seems like you've lost again.

515
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,800
Huo Jian, you've committed so many despicable deeds.

516
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,400
Don't think that you can escape from this.

517
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,099
If I were you, I would've turned myself in.

518
00:35:51,099 --> 00:35:53,699
Maybe, they would show me some leniency.

519
00:35:53,699 --> 00:35:56,059
Miss Su, you're so good at cracking jokes.

520
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:59,159
In reality, I make the call.

521
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:03,459
Uncle, our current society is ruled by law.

522
00:36:03,459 --> 00:36:07,220
Once you've committed a crime, the law will punish you eventually.

523
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:11,379
The story between us isn't over yet.

524
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,680
Fine.

525
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,180
Let's just wait and see.

526
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,899
This place is pretty fun.

527
00:36:20,899 --> 00:36:22,559
You don't visit here often.

528
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:23,919
Enjoy yourselves.

529
00:36:23,919 --> 00:36:25,819
I'll excuse myself.

530
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:27,946
By the way, Zeliang,

531
00:36:27,946 --> 00:36:31,119
after you've returned to Ocean Hotel, you should play badminton with me again.

532
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,421
Let's see if you can defend against my serve this time.

533
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,379
Mr. Li, Lawyer Xie got injured trying to save Xiaoxiao.

534
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,440
Now, both Liu A’Wei and the evidence are gone.

535
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,019
You can rest at ease now.

536
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,299
You should have seen Li Zeliang's face today.

537
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,220
He wanted to take me down, but he couldn't do anything.

538
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,359
It was so interesting.

539
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:23,780
It's because he was no match for you in the first place.

540
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:27,139
How is it? Does it feel good?

541
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,000
I was planning to make myself feel better.

542
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:39,780
Now that all of your obstacles are gone,

543
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,759
you can marry me now, right?

544
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:48,619
Do you know why Li Zeliang ended up like this?

545
00:37:48,619 --> 00:37:51,500
It's because of Su Xieyi.

546
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,219
Once a person has a weakness that other people can use against them,

547
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:57,519
the person will cease to be invulnerable.

548
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:00,050
Isn't our current state pretty good as well?

549
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,119
You promised me this when you told me to abort my child last time.

550
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,379
Last time, you said it wasn't time yet.

551
00:38:07,379 --> 00:38:09,260
What about now?

552
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,280
Haven't I provided you with enough?

553
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,239
Why are you so greedy?

554
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:19,579
I'm greedy?

555
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,599
I've been with you for so many years.

556
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:25,160
I've done so much for you.

557
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,600
You should understand that a title is the only thing I want.

558
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,380
Be a good girl.

559
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:33,800
Since I've made you a promise, I will keep my promise.

560
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,300
Wait for a little longer, okay?

561
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:42,939
Stop deceiving me.

562
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,780
Why would I deceive you?

563
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,440
Now, I cannot truly rest at ease yet.

564
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,960
If that day does come,

565
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,839
I will surely marry you.

566
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:01,340
This is my last time trusting you.

567
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:04,399
Why would this be your last time trusting me?

568
00:39:05,459 --> 00:39:08,299
Our relationship hasn't even started yet.

569
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,279
Mr. Li, Miss Su, I really didn't know

570
00:39:28,279 --> 00:39:31,939
that your uncle was hostile towards you.

571
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:34,159
It's fine.

572
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:36,099
Sorry for the trouble.

573
00:39:36,099 --> 00:39:37,639
It's all my fault.

574
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:40,800
If I had listened to Xiaoxiao and didn't bring it out,

575
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,979
this wouldn't have happened.

576
00:39:42,979 --> 00:39:46,000
Sister Xia, you don't need to blame yourself.

577
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,200
I knew you did it out of good intentions.

578
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:54,499
How's Lawyer Xie?

579
00:39:54,499 --> 00:39:55,760
He sprained his elbow.

580
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,600
He has applied medicine to it. He's fine now.

581
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:03,519
Mr. Xie wouldn't have gotten hurt if he didn't try to protect Xiaoxiao.

582
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:05,800
I need to make some soup for him.

583
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,819
Have a seat.

584
00:40:06,819 --> 00:40:08,219
Let me help you out.

585
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:09,519
Thank you.

586
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:11,019
Go now.

587
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,419
Did you tell Lawyer Xie that you were coming?

588
00:40:24,419 --> 00:40:26,000
No, I didn't.

589
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,159
Why is he here then?

590
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,280
Maybe, it's because of Miss Su.

591
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,360
It's not her.

592
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,830
I've already asked her.

593
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:38,590

594
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:57,839
Please come in.

595
00:41:01,419 --> 00:41:04,320
Brother Minghao, are you okay?

596
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,820
I'm fine.

597
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:08,559
Sister Xia made this soup, especially for you.

598
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:10,159
You should drink it while it's hot.

599
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:11,759
Thanks.

600
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:18,680
Sorry. I didn't manage to get it back.

601
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,299
Brother Minghao, you don't need to blame yourself.

602
00:41:21,299 --> 00:41:24,059
At least, you saved Xiaoxiao.

603
00:41:24,059 --> 00:41:25,900
Luckily, your injury wasn't serious.

604
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,679
If not, I wouldn't be able to face my sister.

605
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,539
Have you found any other clues?

606
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:36,580
Sister Xia had searched the entire house.

607
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:40,300
But the USB drive was the only thing Liu A’Wei had left behind.

608
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:55,820
Xieyi, I wish to speak with Lawyer Xie in private.

609
00:41:57,279 --> 00:41:58,300
Okay.
