1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,970

2
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:25,100
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

3
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:33,550
♫  Still haunts me now and then in quiet nights  ♫

4
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:41,330
♫  And turn to face all the long lost times  ♫

5
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,370
♫  Brace the pain  ♫

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:51,210
♫  Let memories wake up from oceans deep  ♫

7
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,350
♫  No place to hide  ♫

8
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,450
♫  No way to run  ♫

9
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,820
♫  New dawn counts down  ♫

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,930
♫  I fight  ♫

11
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,010
♫  I cry  ♫

12
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,600
♫  I give up  ♫

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:14,710
♫  Memories forgotten, forsaken surround  ♫

14
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:24,230
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

15
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:32,570
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

16
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:40,950
♫  Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

17
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:49,320
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

18
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:57,650

19
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,950

20
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,199
Have you ever confessed your feelings?

21
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:08,000
A love confession?

22
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,140
Never mind. Forget I asked.

23
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,039
Do you not trust me in this matter, Mr. Li?

24
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,280
How many relationships have you had?

25
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,480
There you have it.

26
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,319
I'm going to the toilet.

27
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,819
Okay.

28
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:38,280
That was quick.

29
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,280
It's me.

30
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,840
Chauffeur Ji.

31
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,700
You can call me Yingsong.

32
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,080
Chauffeur Yingsong.

33
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,000
Have you ever been in a relationship?

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,080
Of course. I...

35
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,379
I've been in one, two, three...

36
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,600
Why should I tell you how many relationships I've had?

37
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,800
What kind of love confession do you prefer?

38
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,919
Love confession?

39
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:07,739
You've dated before, so you must have received love confessions.

40
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:10,059
What kind do you like?

41
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:12,539
Why are you suddenly asking me this?

42
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:15,580
If you want to know, you should think hard about it on your own.

43
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,319
You shouldn't be so direct.

44
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,779
I couldn't figure it out. That's why I'm asking you directly.

45
00:03:19,779 --> 00:03:22,719
I don't have the time. I need to know the answer immediately.

46
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,220
You have no time? But I do.

47
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,360
There's no rush for such matters.

48
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,380
The two parties need time to get to know each other.

49
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:34,680
From meeting to understanding, to falling in love.

50
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,379
The confession comes after all that.

51
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:38,860
It sounds complicated.

52
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,094
- How old are you? 
 -  I'm 28.

53
00:03:41,094 --> 00:03:42,400
How much do you make a month?

54
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,900
¥6,000.

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,319
That's less than me.

56
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,400
But Mr. Li gives us a handsome year-end bonus.

57
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,400
At least ¥10,000.

58
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,239
That makes it more than mine.

59
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,740
Why are you asking that?

60
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,560
I want to know how to confess.

61
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,740
Why are you in such a rush?

62
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,779
All right. We can skip the meeting, getting to know each other, falling in love,

63
00:04:02,779 --> 00:04:04,827
and head straight to the eighth episode.

64
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,121
The eighth episode? What eighth episode?

65
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:10,400
Haven't you watched a drama series before? Idol dramas always follow a typical plot.

66
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,657
When you reach episode eight, the characters usually appear in standard fashion

67
00:04:13,658 --> 00:04:15,080
with typical dialogues.

68
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,139
You just have to follow it.

69
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:19,260
I got it.

70
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,439
Got what?

71
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:23,039
The eighth episode. Thanks a lot.

72
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:24,519
I've paid your bill.

73
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:26,019
Goodbye.

74
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,680
Wasn't that Chauffeur Ji?

75
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,060
Why did he pay for us?

76
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,960
Not Chauffeur Ji.

77
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,519
He's Yingsong.

78
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:43,900
So you and Chauffeur Yingsong are...

79
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,680
I think I'm getting a love confession.

80
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,020
 Lin Xingran.

81
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,420
 You are the person I like the most.

82
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,759
 Yeah, sure. I'm the person you like the most.

83
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,920
 Look at you.

84
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,120
 You got yourself drunk because you drank on my behalf.

85
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,199
 Don't worry. We cleared out the bar today.

86
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,100
 It's reserved only for your big event.

87
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:41,859
The music? Smooth jazz.

88
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,759
I'm singing.

89
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,499
It has been 752 days

90
00:05:46,499 --> 00:05:51,940
since the day I met Xieyi beneath that tree.

91
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:02,040
Is it not grand enough?

92
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,600
You really are nervous.

93
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,079
As if you're about to get married.

94
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,639
For sure.

95
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,600
When Xieyi remembers this love confession,

96
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,319
I want her to feel utter happiness.

97
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,600
Listen.

98
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,480
Girls care more about the effort when it comes to this.

99
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,680
As long as you put effort into it, she will definitely be touched.

100
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,140
You didn't tell her, did you?

101
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,319
Of course not.

102
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,299
If I had told her, then where's the surprise?

103
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,199
I told her we were meeting with a client.

104
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,639
This is the key.

105
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,780
You didn't tell Director Li, right?

106
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,480
No, I didn't.

107
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,759
Wait. Didn't you come to feed Chestnut?

108
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,900
Why can't I tell him about it?

109
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,560
Besides that, I'm planning to tidy up the place for him.

110
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,040
I see.

111
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:03,199
Are you sure Director Li won't be coming home today?

112
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,279
Don't worry. He has a full day today.

113
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,200
That's good.

114
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,879
As for my absence from the office, don't tell him either.

115
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,900
I will get back before the end of the day.

116
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,140
Sure thing.

117
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,540
Thanks.

118
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:47,739
Finally done. Chestnut.

119
00:07:47,739 --> 00:07:51,120
You are pretty much our matchmaker, aren't you?

120
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,760
You can eat lots today. Consider it a bribe to keep quiet.

121
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,300

122
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,240
Hello, A'Yan.

123
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,319
 Xieyi, are you in the office?

124
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,059
Yes, I am.

125
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:14,439
 Okay. I'll go pick you up for dinner.

126
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:16,339
 See you in half an hour.

127
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,739
Half an hour? This is bad.

128
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,460
Remember. When I smash the glass,

129
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,939
the music, lights, and balloons will all come on.

130
00:09:07,939 --> 00:09:11,340
Then, you'll appear and say your line.

131
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,559
Perfect.

132
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:14,320
Yes, it's perfect.

133
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,059
But this is a love confession.

134
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:18,559
Why smash the glass? This isn't some assassination.

135
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,959
The signal has to be clear.

136
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,279
Got it.

137
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:23,979
 Rock!

138
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,879
Lovely.

139
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,660
Hou Xiaodong. You're standing.

140
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,800
Chuchu. I am practicing.

141
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,560
Don't come near.

142
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,480
There's just one more step.

143
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,440
I just have to take one more step.

144
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,200
The last step.

145
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,499
What are you doing?

146
00:10:11,499 --> 00:10:14,340
Come here. Sit down.

147
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,979
Be careful.

148
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,220
My leg... It's still not working.

149
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,480
You can't rush it.

150
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,420
You'll be able to walk when you are fully recovered.

151
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,999
It's my bad.

152
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:32,100
I shouldn't push myself so hard.

153
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,579
But this darn leg. Why won't it work?

154
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:35,979
Okay, okay.

155
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,100
Don't give up.

156
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,099
You'll get through this.

157
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,559
I've made you bone soup.

158
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,600
You should drink more.

159
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:01,979
Anyway, why is the bar decorated in this manner?

160
00:11:01,979 --> 00:11:03,820
Are you having a themed party?

161
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,200
 Oh, no. A'Liang is about to be here.

162
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,420
 It's going to be a battlefield.

163
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,299
About that... I can explain.

164
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:14,320
I'll tell you another day.

165
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:19,039
Aren't we going for dinner?

166
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:21,020
Why did we come to Oscar's?

167
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,639
Let's go in.

168
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:25,120
There's a surprise.

169
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,120
Let's go somewhere else.

170
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,020
Where are you going?

171
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,940
You haven't drunk the soup.

172
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,360
I'm sure you're busy.

173
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,460
I can drink it on my own.

174
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:39,099
Watch out!

175
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:31,559
Congrats on the love confession!

176
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,059
A great success!

177
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:59,279
This is the surprise you meant?

178
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,820
Thanks.

179
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,200
Thanks.

180
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,479
So you were being mysterious

181
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,879
because you wanted me to witness Oscar's love confession?

182
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,540
I didn't expect it to be like that.

183
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,600
When did Oscar start having a crush on Director Shi?

184
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,600
Did you already know?

185
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,060
I only just found out.

186
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,859
That Oscar. He seemed like a flippant guy.

187
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:39,779
I didn't expect him to have this side to him.

188
00:13:40,979 --> 00:13:46,540
Xieyi, what did you think of the confession venue?

189
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,120
It's not bad. But it was a little old-fashioned.

190
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,920
Okay. Guess it wasn't a pity then.

191
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,100
What do you mean?

192
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,700
It's nothing.

193
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,519
Let's order. Pick anything you like.

194
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,280
Waitress.

195
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,080
Hello.

196
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,600
We'd like to order.

197
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,100
What would you like, Miss?

198
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,519
I'd like to start with a salad.

199
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,019
Sure.

200
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,940

201
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,840
Hello?

202
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,599
 Hello, Mr. Li. Check your WeChat.

203
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,420

204
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,440
I'd also like the burger.

205
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,840
Thanks.

206
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,620
Chuchu, I can explain all of this.

207
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:47,059
Explain what?

208
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:54,120
Explain about your leg or this flashy set?

209
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,800
Both.

210
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,960
You don't have to say anything.

211
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,059
Right now,

212
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,119
I'm not ready to step into a new relationship.

213
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,600
Did you think I didn't know just because you didn't say anything?

214
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,120
Your leg had healed, but you pretended to be lame.

215
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,260
It couldn't have been because you wanted free soup.

216
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,740
The last time when you wanted me to look into your eyes,

217
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,039
I already felt it.

218
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,659
But we have always been friends.

219
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:47,100
- You suddenly act like this— 
 - What are you thinking?

220
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,060
Did you think I was confessing my feelings to you?

221
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,180
Don't be silly.

222
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,459
This is the set I prepared for A'Liang to confess to Xieyi.

223
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:57,280
This is how it ended up.

224
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,800
So I ruined Zeliang's love confession?

225
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:33,759
Chuchu!

226
00:16:43,739 --> 00:16:45,139
Here you go.

227
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:56,420
I haven't finished the one I have. Why did you order another drink?

228
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,519
Their cappuccino is really good.

229
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:01,719
Why don't you try it?

230
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,953
 After she drinks the cappuccino, there will be foam left on her lips.

231
00:17:08,953 --> 00:17:11,960
 At this moment, kiss her before she can react.

232
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,740
 Clean off the foam on her lips.

233
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,640
 Then confess your feelings to her affectionately.

234
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,899
That's odd.

235
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:21,219
Why is the foam so thick?

236
00:17:40,939 --> 00:17:42,439
What is it?

237
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,060
Is this embarrassing for you?

238
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:48,960
No. If that's what you prefer.

239
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:05,079
What is it?

240
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:06,719
Nothing.

241
00:18:10,739 --> 00:18:12,139
 Gift her a wallet.

242
00:18:12,139 --> 00:18:13,799
 It means you're giving her power over your money.

243
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,880
 You'll take care of all her expenditures.

244
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,859
 Nothing is more pragmatic than that.

245
00:18:18,859 --> 00:18:21,359
My dear. This is the card for my salary account,

246
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:23,840
my identification card, and my bankbook.

247
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,180
From now on, be it my money or me, they're all yours to keep.

248
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:32,839
What are you doing? This is only our first meeting.

249
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:36,400
Miss, where are you going?

250
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,839
What era are we living in?

251
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:41,259
He used such an outdated way.

252
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:43,799
Nowadays, payment is made by swiping cards.

253
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:46,459
Who brings a wallet out with them?

254
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,380
At most, we bring a card holder.

255
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:51,499
Where are you going?

256
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,820
I'm going to check the view.

257
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,560
Xieyi, go ask them about our order.

258
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,659
What other options are there?

259
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,680
Buy her a nice ice cream.

260
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,900
When she asks you if you'd like to try it,

261
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,480
you then kiss her.

262
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,039
Buy everything she likes.

263
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,939
Let me see.

264
00:19:20,939 --> 00:19:22,160
Xieyi.

265
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,920
- So many tips and tricks. 
 - Give it back.

266
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,730
Actually, you had wanted to confess to me

267
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,280
when you brought me to the bar, didn't you?

268
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,920
You knew?

269
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,540
The number at the bar.

270
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,119
I saw it.

271
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:45,179
752.

272
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:51,279
Today happens to be the 752nd day since we met on the hill.

273
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:53,100
I'm sorry, Xieyi.

274
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,200
I didn't manage to give you a proper love confession.

275
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,380
You're not angry, are you?

276
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,980
I'm not.

277
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:05,119
Because you've already confessed to me long ago.

278
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,259
When Lin Tai knocked me unconscious, you carried me to the hospital.

279
00:20:14,459 --> 00:20:16,200
 When I was a quivering wreck,

280
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,179
 you carried me at the beef noodle shop.

281
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:23,659
 When you let me call you A'Yan

282
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:25,719
 while you dried my hair at home.

283
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:26,979
 When you said

284
00:20:26,979 --> 00:20:31,079
that is a name reserved for only the closest person.

285
00:20:32,219 --> 00:20:34,740
When you cleared away the broken glass with your hands

286
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,979
 and pulled me up with all your might from the poisonous basement.

287
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:53,020
A'Yan. You've given me so many confessions.

288
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,172
Every one of them was more sincere than any of these.

289
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,278
I never thought there would be another person

290
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:05,740
aside from my father and family

291
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,599
that could love me this much.

292
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,540
So, I'll be the one

293
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,839
to confess my love to you.

294
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:22,320
A'Yan. If you're willing,

295
00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:25,660
may I be your girlfriend?

296
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,419
I'd use the rest of my life to protect you.

297
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,020
I do.

298
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:43,940
♫  You are my everything, my everything  ♫

299
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,700
♫  How I want to tell you  ♫

300
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:53,600
♫  I want to be your moon  ♫

301
00:21:53,600 --> 00:22:05,300
♫  Be mine, my love  ♫

302
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,820

303
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,200
Hello?

304
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,820
 Where are you?

305
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,960
What is it?

306
00:22:33,579 --> 00:22:35,820
 You left your soup container here.

307
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,820
 I'll return it to you.

308
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,860
It's okay. I am occupied right now.

309
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,240
Occupied?

310
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,019
You mean drinking by your lonesome self here?

311
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,820
How did you know I was here?

312
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,919
I, Oscar, am well-connected.

313
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:58,240
I'm all-powerful.

314
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,060
Wanting to find you is no more than a cakewalk.

315
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,119
Look at yourself.

316
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:11,200
Drinking alone like this isn't going to solve anything.

317
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,200
I'm fine.

318
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,680
I just wanted to vent a little.

319
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,080
I'm going home after I finish.

320
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,440
Don't worry about me. You can go.

321
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,380
This beer is awful.

322
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,960
See? I finished the beer.

323
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,400
Venting like this won't make you feel better.

324
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,380
Come on. I'll take you to a place.

325
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,340
Come with me.

326
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,659
This is the place you want to bring me to?

327
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:52,259
That's right.

328
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,460
Let's go.

329
00:23:55,419 --> 00:23:57,219
Let's go.

330
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,360
- Chuchu. 
 - Jerk!

331
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,759
Just let out all the frustrations you've been feeling!

332
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:08,039
Let everything out!

333
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:12,340
Screw him for being dumb.

334
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,759
A'Yan is blind!

335
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,119
Throw at it hard, Chuchu!

336
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,200
What exam?

337
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,039
Don't want to work. Don't want to be busy!

338
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,939
Smash it!

339
00:24:19,939 --> 00:24:24,040
♫  Who isn't new at defense?  ♫

340
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,620
♫  Yet we still betray ourselves  ♫

341
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:32,360
Have some milk tea. Drink something sweet.

342
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:37,240
This way, your brain will release dopamine that makes you feel happy.

343
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:43,640
The thing is, humans should never let themselves be stripped of happiness.

344
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:51,419
You know what?

345
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:54,260
The place where you found me just now

346
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:58,839
was where I went after my confession to Li Zeliang was rejected.

347
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:05,639
Chuchu. In this world, the most unfair thing is love.

348
00:25:05,639 --> 00:25:07,839
Because whether it is studies or work,

349
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,957
as long as you put in the effort, you will get the result in the end.

350
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,315
But that doesn't apply to love.

351
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,878
So long as one side is not interested, you won't get the result.

352
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:25,519
However, as long as you've done your best, it will always be a good memory.

353
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:28,140
So, don't be too sad about it.

354
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,840
Okay?

355
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,319
Who is sad?

356
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,466
I was trying to say,

357
00:25:36,466 --> 00:25:41,060
this place is a much better place to vent than that place.

358
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:45,259
I don't feel as bad as the last time.

359
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,700
Thank you.

360
00:25:49,699 --> 00:25:51,219
Don't mention it.

361
00:25:51,219 --> 00:25:52,800
We're friends, right?

362
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,420
It's only right to be there for each other.

363
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,555
But, if you really want to thank me,

364
00:26:00,555 --> 00:26:04,140
a music producer is coming to watch me perform next week.

365
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,759
I'm missing a drummer.

366
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:08,520
Can you help me out? What do you say?

367
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,240
Okay.

368
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,159
It's a deal then.

369
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,780
Where are you going?

370
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:20,860
I want to ask the boss if they offer annual membership.

371
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,599
As expected, it's hard for people to ignore trends.

372
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:30,819
Going to sign up for membership?

373
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:36,539
Wait a minute.

374
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:40,639
Did I unleash her preference for violence?

375
00:26:41,507 --> 00:26:42,910
Chuchu.

376
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:46,380

377
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,019
Chestnut. I've been tidying the whole day.

378
00:27:02,019 --> 00:27:03,899
It's finally your turn.

379
00:27:03,899 --> 00:27:07,160
Let me help you clean up your little house.

380
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,820
Have some water, Lady Boss.

381
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,200
Thank you, Boss.

382
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,480
Let me do it.

383
00:27:24,459 --> 00:27:25,959
Are you tired?

384
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,060
A little bit.

385
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:31,799
You've worked hard.

386
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:40,599
A'Yan. I used to imagine what perfect love is.

387
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:43,319
I finally have the answer now.

388
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,659
It is now.

389
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:49,000
This present moment.

390
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:59,419
When we first met Chestnut, it was still so small.

391
00:27:59,419 --> 00:28:01,740
It has grown up healthy and big.

392
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,720
You must have put in a lot of effort.

393
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,380
In the beginning, it was pretty tough.

394
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,980
But it was Chestnut

395
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,219
that accompanied me through the toughest times.

396
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:17,899
You know what? Hedgehogs don't bite.

397
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,659
Their only way to protect themselves

398
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:23,138
is the spines all over their body.

399
00:28:23,138 --> 00:28:25,520
But if it likes you,

400
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,539
even the spines become surprisingly soft.

401
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,280
Just like...

402
00:28:37,219 --> 00:28:39,199
Just like when I met you.

403
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:49,160
You seemed to have improved your talking skills.

404
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,160
Such a sweet talker.

405
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,440
I think Chestnut just made a sound.

406
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,959
Chestnut. Chestnut?

407
00:29:00,959 --> 00:29:02,240
What is it, Chestnut?

408
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,919
Are you jealous of us?

409
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:07,411
According to the life cycle of hedgehogs,

410
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:11,460
Chestnut is a 30 plus old guy who is still single.

411
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,680
I'll find you a girlfriend soon. How about that?

412
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,553
Look how happy it is.

413
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,480
By the way.

414
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,699
Chestnut's food has run out.

415
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,840
There's more there.

416
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:39,000
You're going to have a girlfriend. You must be delighted.

417
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,240
A'Yan. This is a nice box.

418
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,979
What's inside?

419
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,960
Open it and see.

420
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,839
You like carving?

421
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:09,900
When I was young, I was very naughty.

422
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,860
I could never sit still in class.

423
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,859
I had no patience.

424
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:18,279
In order to teach me to be more patient,

425
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:20,599
my father taught me seal carving.

426
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,858
Later on, whenever I am free,

427
00:30:24,858 --> 00:30:26,719
I would carve some things.

428
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,640
To calm my mind.

429
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,979
Until my dad passed away.

430
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Since he died,

431
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:41,259
I have never picked up these tools again.

432
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:53,640
Why don't you teach me? I'd like to learn.

433
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:57,739
This isn't anything fun.

434
00:30:57,739 --> 00:31:01,359
You might cut yourself playing with knives.

435
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,799
Then make one for me.

436
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,580
What should I carve?

437
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:12,339
Carve both our names together.

438
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:14,565
Call it

439
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,279
Liang Yan Xieyi.

440
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:23,640
Liang Yan Xieyi?

441
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,379
It means both Zeliang and Yan belong to Su Xieyi.

442
00:31:27,379 --> 00:31:31,640
Then I'm going to use the seal on all the places we've been to.

443
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,419
Here. Here.

444
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:36,100
Here... And here.

445
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,900
And here.

446
00:31:43,459 --> 00:31:45,640
What are you doing?

447
00:31:46,419 --> 00:31:50,644
Since you're the lady boss, you should do what a lady boss does.

448
00:31:50,644 --> 00:31:52,880
What's that?

449
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,540
Stamp the seal.

450
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:02,780
♫  Sailing on the sea of life  ♫

451
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:09,700
♫  All alone lost on the tide  ♫

452
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:15,940
♫  Waves of silver glitters blind my eyes  ♫

453
00:32:21,879 --> 00:32:27,380
Congratulations. For the restructuring of the Board of Directors, everyone voted for you.

454
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:30,839
Even the few Huo Jian supporters backed down.

455
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:35,179
I will soon have to call you Chairman Li.

456
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:39,060
I don't normally drink in the office.

457
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:43,247
What about a little gesture?

458
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:50,279
The fact that they voted for me to head the Board of Directors

459
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:52,480
is a form of encouragement for me.

460
00:32:52,939 --> 00:32:54,940
Ocean Hotel is a big family.

461
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,774
To ensure smooth progress,

462
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:59,300
we cannot forsake the unity and trust between members.

463
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,208
In addition,

464
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,799
starting from today, I will not ask about the past.

465
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,480
I will only look towards the future.

466
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,419
Those who remain at the hotel are all part of the family.

467
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:11,358
Listen to yourself.

468
00:33:11,358 --> 00:33:13,279
It's only you and me here.

469
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,079
Did you have to proclaim our motto?

470
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:21,740
Honestly speaking, I really want to thank you.

471
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:25,200
After all that has happened, you never stopped believing in me.

472
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,380
You've always stood by me.

473
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,580
You're really giving a speech now, aren't you?

474
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:32,299
Listen carefully. I didn't do it for you.

475
00:33:32,299 --> 00:33:34,580
I did it for Ocean.

476
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:37,919
Now you're proclaiming the motto.

477
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:42,459
It's because you influenced me.

478
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:49,520
Zeliang. Everyone recognizes your capabilities.

479
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,554
So be it the past or the future,

480
00:33:52,555 --> 00:33:56,420
my dad and I will always support you unconditionally.

481
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,000
Thank you.

482
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:09,819
By the way. Huo Jian's office has been cleared.

483
00:34:09,819 --> 00:34:11,959
You can move in any time.

484
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,340
I'm happy with this space.

485
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,560
I don't plan to move yet.

486
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,659
All right then.

487
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:23,760
As long as Chairman Li is happy.

488
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,319
Okay.

489
00:34:25,319 --> 00:34:27,139
Huo Jian left behind a huge mess.

490
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:28,519
I need to get busy.

491
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:30,980
Okay. I better get going too.

492
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:38,030
Xieyi, this is for Director Li.

493
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:40,019
Make sure he signs it.

494
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,659
 I need your help urgently.

495
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:04,280
What's the urgent matter?

496
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,480
I'm picking out a present for Xiaoxiao.

497
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,500
I need you to give me some ideas.

498
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:10,740
I've already picked one.

499
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,259
Stand up.

500
00:35:12,259 --> 00:35:13,859
Let me sit.

501
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:16,800
Can't you be more gentle?

502
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,400
No.

503
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:24,639
This one.

504
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:26,700
A microphone?

505
00:35:27,399 --> 00:35:28,479
How smart you are.

506
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,880
Of course.

507
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,239
This is perfect for Xiaoxiao.

508
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:34,300
Which one should we pick?

509
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,260
This one.

510
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,740
This is expensive. It has to be good.

511
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,900
A higher price doesn't mean it's good.

512
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,979
What about this one?

513
00:35:42,979 --> 00:35:44,360
It's on sale.

514
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,820
The color doesn't look nice.

515
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:49,099
Young girls like pink. You know nothing.

516
00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:50,819
We will buy this and this then.

517
00:35:50,819 --> 00:35:52,619
That's wasting money.

518
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:53,619
Not at all.

519
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:55,719
We'll buy two and keep one for you.

520
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:58,259
You are a great singer.

521
00:35:58,259 --> 00:36:01,599
♪ As sweet as honey ♪

522
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,159
Stop singing. 
 ♪ Your smile is sweet like honey ♪

523
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:05,779
Stop singing.

524
00:36:05,779 --> 00:36:09,760
♪ Just like flowers blooming in the spring breeze ♪

525
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,718
If you don't stop, I will...

526
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:14,339
Director Li, this is the document you asked for.

527
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:23,199
Do you still want it?

528
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,159
I can come back later.

529
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:47,139
I've added it to the cart. You can buy it.

530
00:36:50,019 --> 00:36:51,719
I'm going to buy both then.

531
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:53,590
 As you please.

532
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,280
 I'm so hungry.

533
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,840
Come and sit. Check out the scrumptious breakfast I made.

534
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,418
You made so much.

535
00:37:11,418 --> 00:37:13,039
Try it.

536
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:15,920
This is your favorite waffle.

537
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,300
How is it?

538
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,820
What's wrong?

539
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:24,479
I think my wisdom tooth is inflamed again.

540
00:37:24,479 --> 00:37:28,939
Xieyi, you can't ignore the constant inflammation.

541
00:37:28,939 --> 00:37:30,780
You should get it extracted.

542
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,519
It's fine. I just need to take some medication.

543
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:38,100
Oh, right. I haven't finished the medicine Brother Minghao gave me.

544
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,580
It's here.

545
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,480
You know? This medicine is amazing.

546
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,380
Right after I take it, the pain goes away.

547
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,440
But you're not treating the root of the problem.

548
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,900
Still, it's better than a tooth extraction.

549
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:57,480
I heard that wisdom tooth extraction is a minor surgery.

550
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,199
They use a clamp to break and pull the teeth.

551
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:01,880
Just thinking about it is scary.

552
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,880
I'd rather take medicine.

553
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,599
It's not as scary as you think.

554
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:08,639
They give you an anesthetic before the extraction.

555
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:11,680
With the anesthetic, you'll hardly feel anything.

556
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:13,500
I'd still rather not.

557
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,300
How about this?

558
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,440
Today is the weekend.

559
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,440
I'll take you to Movie World.

560
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,500
There is a pink-colored bus. It's lovely.

561
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,239
Maybe you'll forget about the pain when you're busy having fun.

562
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:28,819
Divert your attention. You won't feel the pain.

563
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,880
I can't.

564
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,199
Brother Ji told me you have to check up on your leg today.

565
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:35,380
I need to supervise you.

566
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,340
Hurry up and eat.

567
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,320
Is your tooth okay?

568
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,760
Can you chew on it?

569
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,000
I can use the other side.

570
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:55,359
Miss, when will my teeth be better?

571
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,039
You still have two wisdom teeth. You'll feel better after you remove them.

572
00:38:58,039 --> 00:38:59,599
I have to remove two more?

573
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,499
This is too painful.

574
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:06,499
Xieyi. Why not we take a number at the dentistry too?

575
00:39:06,499 --> 00:39:08,219
No need.

576
00:39:08,219 --> 00:39:11,019
We should hurry up. Dr. Wu is waiting.

577
00:39:11,019 --> 00:39:13,180
Let's go.

578
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,340

579
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,140
Dr. Wu.

580
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:20,179
You're here.

581
00:39:20,179 --> 00:39:22,139
Come and sit.

582
00:39:22,139 --> 00:39:24,000
I was about to call you to remind you.

583
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,660
I didn't expect you'd be on time this time around.

584
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,559
Who is this?

585
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:30,719
Hello, Dr. Wu.

586
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:31,960
I'm Su Xieyi.

587
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,760
We spoke before on the phone.

588
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,239
- I see. Take a seat. 
 - Sit.

589
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:38,519
I remember now. We've met.

590
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:42,079
That time, Zeliang asked me to put on a show with him,

591
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,960
pretending his leg was hurt.

592
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,159
You barged into the room then, almost in tears.

593
00:39:49,779 --> 00:39:52,800
I wonder why he's so punctual today.

594
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,199
Is it because you urged him to come?

595
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,980
Zeliang. Who would have expected a stubborn person like you

596
00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:04,839
would be so obedient to your wife?

597
00:40:06,019 --> 00:40:07,679
Stop it, Dr. Wu.

598
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:10,159
Stop teasing me.

599
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,400
I've already submitted the request.

600
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,560
Let's go and take an x-ray.

601
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,579
I'll get you a wheelchair.

602
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:19,179
It's okay.

603
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:22,280
I don't need a wheelchair.

604
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,600
I can walk there.

605
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,400
Xieyi, wait for me here.

606
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,000
- I'm going. 
 - Okay.

607
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,700
Wait for me.

608
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:44,020
Dr. Wu.

609
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:47,519
About A'Yan's leg, I have a few questions to ask you.

610
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:48,400
I'm listening.

611
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,519
It's been over two years since the amputation.

612
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:53,880
But A’Yan's leg still hurts very often.

613
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,037
Why is that?
