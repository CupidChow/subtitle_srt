2
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:25,000
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,410
♫  Still haunts me now and then in quiet nights  ♫

4
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:41,330
♫  And turn to face all the long lost times  ♫

5
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,370
♫  Brace the pain  ♫

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:51,210
♫  Let memories wake up from oceans deep  ♫

7
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,250
♫  No place to hide  ♫

8
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,350
♫  No way to run  ♫

9
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,820
♫  New dawn counts down  ♫

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,930
♫  I fight  ♫

11
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,010
♫  I cry  ♫

12
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,700
♫  I give up  ♫

13
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:15,610
♫  Memories forgotten, forsaken surround  ♫

14
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:23,930
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

15
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:32,270
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

16
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:40,950
♫  Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

17
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:49,650
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

18
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:59,920

19
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,719

20
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,960
You even sent Yi Fei to find that Spider?

21
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,380
It must have something to do with Mr. Li Senior's death, right?

22
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:24,259
Of course, if you can make good on your promise,

23
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:30,099
I will keep my mouth shut and continue to work for you, Chairman Huo.

24
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,400
Now that I've thought about it,

25
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,620
I think you make a lot of sense.

26
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,280
Cooperation will benefit both of us.

27
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,999
I will handle the compensation. It will be in your account tomorrow.

28
00:02:48,999 --> 00:02:51,199
Chairman Huo.

29
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,369
Just now, I shouldn't have spoken to you in that manner. I was just...

30
00:02:54,369 --> 00:02:56,479
We've been friends for so many years.

31
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,586
Of course, I know you.

32
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:02,879
Later, I'll have Secretary Yi put a few boxes of fine wine in the trunk of your car.

33
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,719
Go back now.

34
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,100
- No, Chairman Huo... 
 - You deserve it.

35
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,600
Go on.

36
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,000
Thank you.

37
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,487

38
00:03:36,487 --> 00:03:39,030
 As the new Chairman of Ocean Hotel,

39
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,690
 I will lead Ocean Hotel to glory once again.

40
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:45,260
 As the new Chairman of Ocean Hotel,

41
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:49,080
 I will lead Ocean Hotel to glory once again.

42
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:52,350
 As the new Chairman of Ocean Hotel,

43
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,090
 I will lead Ocean Hotel to glory once again.

44
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:20,580
 If you don't want your secret to be exposed, then do as I say.

45
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,939
Now that you've found out about the last thing you should know,

46
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,920
you can't stay alive any longer.

47
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,800
 She even wanted to call the police.

48
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,139
 I told you. This was your last chance.

49
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:52,519
 What a pity. You messed it up.

50
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,559
 Look. Even the heavens think that you are a fool.

51
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:22,179
 You don't deserve a single penny.

52
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,499
That's enough.

53
00:05:43,499 --> 00:05:45,599
If you drink any more, I'll have to take you back.

54
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,240
You might even throw up in my car.

55
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,680
Who asked you to take me back?

56
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,739
- I'll get you a glass of milk tea. 
 - No need!

57
00:05:52,739 --> 00:05:55,900
Do you think I'm still a baby that suckles milk like you?

58
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,520
Never mind then.

59
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,360
When I saw you playing drums earlier, I knew there was something troubling you.

60
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,360
A'Liang did go a bit far this time.

61
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,720
He didn't even tell us about such a big thing.

62
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,360
But what's worse is that he actually announced it at your family's party.

63
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,240
There must be something wrong with his brain.

64
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,199
That said, there must be a reason why A'Liang didn't tell us.

65
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:22,919
Think about it. We grew up together.

66
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:25,430
When has he ever managed to hide something from us?

67
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:31,160
Maybe he never even wanted to get along with that Su Xieyi.

68
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,719
Today, he introduced her to us.

69
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:35,820
Tomorrow, they might have already broken up. Why bother?

70
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,759
What's your score for her last time?

71
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:41,820
What score?

72
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,859
What's the score?

73
00:06:43,859 --> 00:06:46,039
90.

74
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,100
What about me?

75
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,780
100.

76
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,680
Don't lie. Be serious.

77
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,860
90.

78
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,720
Pretending to be impartial here, aren't you?

79
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,959
Miss Shi, you are incredibly hard to console.

80
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,519
Hou Xiaodong! Do I need you to console me?

81
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:07,600
This is silly. This is dumb!

82
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:10,460
Wait! I'll take you back.

83
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:14,779
 At 4 PM today, the traffic police department received a report

84
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:17,299
 that a wrecked vehicle was recovered from the river.

85
00:07:17,299 --> 00:07:20,079
 According to the preliminary judgment of the investigation, the cause of the accident

86
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:22,299
 is believed to be drunk driving...

87
00:07:22,299 --> 00:07:24,820
It was raining quite heavily a few days ago.

88
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,779
The water level of the river is much higher than it was years ago.

89
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:32,880
 We would like to remind all drivers to avoid drunk driving and drowsy driving.

90
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,140
 In addition, police were unable to locate the driver at the scene.

91
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:40,299
 Based on the car's license plate,

92
00:07:40,299 --> 00:07:42,940
 police have contacted the driver and asked him to help with the investigation

93
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,000
 to find out the cause of the accident.

94
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,900
Someone saved him.

95
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:53,439
 We also hope that viewers who know the owner of the car

96
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,719
 can contact the police to provide information.

97
00:07:56,719 --> 00:08:00,300
A'Liang. Ever since that Su Xieyi appeared,

98
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,140
you've been getting more and more mysterious.

99
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,140
Be honest with me.

100
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:08,479
Do you sincerely like her,

101
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,080
or are you just trying to pass the time?

102
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,600
If I wanted to pass the time, I could just play games.

103
00:08:21,739 --> 00:08:23,680
Mr. Li, he is awake.

104
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,680
Let's go.

105
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,800
Director Li.

106
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,679
You sure got lucky today.

107
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:47,351
If A'Liang hadn't asked Ji Yingsong to follow you,

108
00:08:47,352 --> 00:08:49,919
you would be at the bridge to the other world by now.

109
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,219
Director Li. You saved me?

110
00:08:53,219 --> 00:08:56,539
Who else could it be? Huo Jian?

111
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:58,239
You attacked Xieyi.

112
00:08:58,239 --> 00:09:02,320
I had Ji Yingsong follow you to capture you.

113
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,840
That's my fault.

114
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,519
Before this, Huo Jian wanted me to investigate Miss Su.

115
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:12,580
However, she found out. I had no choice but to...

116
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,799
- This... 
 - I know.

117
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:22,120
You were only working for Huo Jian because of your father.

118
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,039
I put some money on this card.

119
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:26,980
It's enough to cover the rest of your father's medical expenses.

120
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,759
I'm sorry, Director Li. I was wrong.

121
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:39,840
Thank you. Thank you.

122
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,300
Thank you.

123
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:49,480
You should know that I didn't just save you out of kindness.

124
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,280
I need you to repay the favor.

125
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,659
You've been working for Huo Jian for all these years. You've done many of his dirty deeds for him.

126
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:59,060
I'm sure you must know some of his unspeakable secrets.

127
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,940
I want to know the real reason.

128
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,999
 You even sent Yi Fei to find that Spider?

129
00:10:09,999 --> 00:10:13,379
 It must have something to do with Mr. Li Senior's death, right?

130
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,440
Could it be that I got it right?

131
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,740
What did you say?

132
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:25,320
I overheard it as well.

133
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,080
He sent Yi Fei to find someone known as the "Spider."

134
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,440
"Spider"?

135
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,999
This "Spider" guy is the one who cleaned the windows for the hospital Mr. Li Senior was in.

136
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:36,159
It was very strange indeed.

137
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,120
I only made it up in the heat of the moment too.

138
00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:41,159
Right.

139
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:43,399
It must be because of that.

140
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:47,359
However, it seems he disappeared two years ago.

141
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,379
The "Spiders" hang outside the wall.

142
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:52,999
They are not within the surveillance zone.

143
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:58,440
A'Liang. You've been investigating the people who appeared inside, but you found nothing.

144
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:04,759
Could it be that it was someone outside who discovered something about Huo Jian?

145
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,120
Now it makes sense.

146
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,819
A'Liang, we have hope now.

147
00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:15,259
I'll go and search for clues about the Spider right now.

148
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:18,679
You and Yingsong take him away from here right now.

149
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,679
This place isn't safe.

150
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,960
Remember to leave from the back door.

151
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,860
All right.

152
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,660
 According to the preliminary judgment of the investigation, the cause of the accident is believed to be drunk

153
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:33,120
 or drowsy driving by the driver and the slippery roads

154
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,879
 caused by recent rainfall and other weather-related causes.

155
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:39,840
 We would like to remind all drivers to obey the traffic rules

156
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,819
 and to avoid drunk driving and drowsy driving.

157
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:45,639
 In addition, police were unable to locate the driver at the scene.

158
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,639
 Based on the car's license plate,

159
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:50,279
 police have contacted the driver and asked him to help with the investigation

160
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:53,000
 to find out the cause of the accident.

161
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,480
You don't like to go to the company.

162
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,360
It turns out you prefer to hang around here, huh?

163
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,039
It's more fun to drink here.

164
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:20,259
You have a girlfriend now.

165
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:25,039
You should spend more time with her.

166
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,480
Why are you here, Uncle?

167
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,979
This belongs to Miss Su, right?

168
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:37,439
Yi Fei found it.

169
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:52,720
Back then, I wouldn't dare to say I didn't like such alcohol

170
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,880
for fear that others would say I had no taste or class.

171
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,720
Now that I'm old, I've decided to stop pretending.

172
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,279
If I don't like it, I don't.

173
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:06,071
After all, no matter how well I pretend, I will be found out sooner or later,

174
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:08,480
isn't that right?

175
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,720
You're right, Uncle.

176
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:14,639
Don't worry.

177
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,400
She is perfectly safe right now.

178
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:26,879
It's inevitable that people would sometimes misplace things.

179
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:29,720
I lost something yesterday too.

180
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,299
Have you seen it?

181
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:19,899
Miss Yi?

182
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:23,240
You're awake, Miss Su. How do you feel?

183
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,040
Secretary Yi, what is this place?

184
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,919
Why am I here?

185
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:32,139
This is our group's clubhouse.

186
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:34,960
Director Li was worried that the hospital would be too crowded and disturb your rest,

187
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,910
so he had me bring you here.

188
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,480
You mean, Director Li...

189
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,759
Zeliang told you to bring me here?

190
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:44,340
Of course.

191
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,820
Then where is he?

192
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,779
Director Li is in a meeting right now.

193
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:50,579
You must be hungry.

194
00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:54,459
Try our clubhouse's soup.

195
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:56,939
It's delicious.

196
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,280
Thank you for your concern.

197
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,960
Oh, right. Have you seen my bracelet?

198
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,220
The one I always wear on my left wrist.

199
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,279
Your bracelet?

200
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:30,220
No, I haven't.

201
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:34,100
Then what about my phone?

202
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,919
I want to give Zeliang a call.

203
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:38,159
He should know where my bracelet is.

204
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:41,020
I haven't seen your phone either.

205
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,939
Then what about yours? Can I borrow it?

206
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:47,140
Miss Su, I've told you Director Li is in a meeting right now.

207
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,380
He doesn't have time to answer your call.

208
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:54,040
The most important thing you should do right now is rest and take care of your body.

209
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,580
You're right.

210
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,120
Sister Fei, when will Zeliang finish meeting?

211
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,159
I miss him.

212
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,179
I don't know. Wait for the notification.

213
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,259
Sorry. I just recovered.

214
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:28,360
My hands are still weak.

215
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,820
Can I take a shower?

216
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,279
Where is the darn lock?

217
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,080
Is something the matter?

218
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,307
This... This door...

219
00:16:54,307 --> 00:16:55,919
This door has no lock.

220
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,819
If you need anything, tell me. I'll be right outside the door.

221
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,499
Hurry up and shower.

222
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,080
It's my first time here.

223
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,459
Aren't you going to give me a tour?

224
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:56,692
You have quite a lot of private rooms here.

225
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:09,619
Who is it? Are you asking for trouble?

226
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,680
Uncle Hou?

227
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,339
Uncle Huo, w-why are you here?

228
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,919
My girlfriend.

229
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,880
You have a girlfriend now?

230
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,739
Well, introduce her to me.

231
00:18:29,739 --> 00:18:34,680
Uncle Huo, I don't think the circumstances are appropriate.

232
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:37,160
Nothing of the sort.

233
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,519
We'll have to meet someday either way.

234
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:42,079
Besides, I am your elder as well.

235
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,679
Uncle, how about this?

236
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,279
I'll introduce you guys another day.

237
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:52,279
Girls are shy. She doesn't have makeup on either.

238
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:56,799
Next time, I'll bring her to visit you personally.

239
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,799
Is that all right, honey?

240
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,980
Be good now.

241
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,799
Feisty, isn't she?

242
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:06,920
Look. She's embarrassed.

243
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,680
All right.

244
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,580
Another day then.

245
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,880
Why is she taking so long in the shower?

246
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,720
Miss Su.

247
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:04,559
Miss Su?

248
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:26,400
She mustn't have gone far.

249
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,200
What exactly did you lose, Uncle?

250
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,479
Why don't I help you look for it?

251
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:46,480
Think.

252
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,680
You should know what it is.

253
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:54,199
Certain items have grave consequences if you lose them.

254
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:57,400
Just like Miss Su's bracelet.

255
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,940
It's important to her, but if someone else picked it up,

256
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,920
they might not appreciate it.

257
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,240
Hello?

258
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,688
 Hello? Li Zeliang I was locked up by Yi Fei.

259
00:21:21,699 --> 00:21:24,900
 I finally managed to escape. Hurry up and come and pick me up.

260
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,900
Stay where you are. I'll head over right now.

261
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:37,190
Uncle, I don't know where the thing you want is,

262
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,820
but I've found what I've been looking for.

263
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,119
I won't keep you company any longer. Put it on my tab.

264
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:44,779
I'll be leaving now.

265
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,280
Tell me your location.

266
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,900
Hello?

267
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,820
 I apologize, Chairman Huo.

268
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,879
 She slipped out. We're looking for her right now.

269
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,280
Thank you.

270
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:17,580
Owner, do you serve noodles here?

271
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,599
Do you have money?

272
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:43,519
I'm here.

273
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,780
Wait.

274
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,440
Help me pay for my noodles first.

275
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,620
Keep the change.

276
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,260
Their noodles are good. Do you want a bowl of noodles too?

277
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,940
I'm fine.

278
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,840
Thanks.

279
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:31,319
What exactly happened?

280
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:34,079
When I woke up, I found myself in a huge villa.

281
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,939
My phone and my bracelet were missing.

282
00:23:36,939 --> 00:23:41,699
Yi Fei said you took me there and told her to take care of me.

283
00:23:41,699 --> 00:23:45,200
But she wouldn't let me contact you, and she followed me everywhere.

284
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,279
She even stood guard outside while I showered.

285
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,999
Fortunately, I was smart.

286
00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:51,300
I noticed something was off right away.

287
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,359
That was practically a house arrest.

288
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:54,799
Something must be up.

289
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,780
So I tricked them and got out.

290
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,699
You didn't send me there, did you?

291
00:24:06,699 --> 00:24:07,939
No.

292
00:24:07,939 --> 00:24:11,459
Why did Yi Fei lie to me?

293
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:14,480
Could it be Huo Jian that's behind this?

294
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,840
Finish your noodles first. It won't taste good once it gets lumpy.

295
00:24:38,219 --> 00:24:39,919
Sorry.

296
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:43,599
Xieyi.

297
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:49,059
I said I would protect you,

298
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,979
but I failed to.

299
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,359
I'm sorry.

300
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,040
I'm fine. I'm all right.

301
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,079
I'm just a little hungry.

302
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,639
Eat slowly.

303
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:29,100
I'm done. Let's go.

304
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,879
I left in a hurry earlier. I lost one of my slippers.

305
00:25:39,879 --> 00:25:42,940
But that's all right. I can still walk. Let's go.

306
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:47,321
♫  You are my everything, my everything  ♫

307
00:25:47,321 --> 00:25:50,000
- Wait. 
 - What is it?

308
00:25:50,772 --> 00:25:52,719
46.9.

309
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,730
My weight.

310
00:25:55,730 --> 00:26:00,510
♫  I want to be your moon  ♫

311
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:04,420
♫  Always shining through  ♫

312
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,060
♫  Guiding you through every maze  ♫

313
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:10,059
It's more than that. You had a bowl of noodles.

314
00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:13,300
♫  You are my star  ♫

315
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:21,270
♫  Always orbiting around you  ♫

316
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:26,120
♫  I want to be your moon  ♫

317
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:37,920
♫  Be mine, my love  ♫

318
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,880
I'm sorry. I messed up.

319
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,759
That's not important anymore.

320
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:18,400
Did you find out where Lin Tai is?

321
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,400
I didn't see him at the entrance of the bar,

322
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,900
but I checked the surveillance cameras nearby.

323
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:28,737
This is surveillance footage from a cafe behind the bar.

324
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,960
This was when I went to the bar.

325
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,799
But I haven't managed to find out where Ji Yingsong took Lin Tai.

326
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,100
They are deliberately hiding.

327
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,839
You won't be able to find them.

328
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,279
But this isn't entirely a bad thing.

329
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:47,319
On the contrary, it revealed my nephew's true colors.

330
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:53,021
He... Could it be that he has found the Spider?

331
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,799
That shouldn't be the case.

332
00:27:57,799 --> 00:27:59,839
We've been looking for him for two years, and we haven't even managed to find him.

333
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,299
Even if he is searching for the Spider, he won't find him that easily.

334
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:06,100
Continue to keep an eye on the people around him.

335
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,719
If you find out that they are searching for the Spider,

336
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:10,559
alert me immediately.

337
00:28:22,259 --> 00:28:24,439
I made you some ginger tea.

338
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:26,659
Drink it and warm yourself up.

339
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:28,680
Thank you.

340
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,380
You're welcome.

341
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,900
Be careful. It's hot.

342
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,420
- It's very spicy. 
 - The spiciness drives away the cold.

343
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,860
Use this. Your place isn't safe anymore.

344
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,139
You should stay in a hotel for now.

345
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:01,260
You bought me a new phone and paid for me to stay at a hotel.

346
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,880
Is this what they call a blessing in disguise?

347
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,699
There are no grudges between Yi Fei and me.

348
00:29:11,699 --> 00:29:13,920
Why did she do this to me?

349
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,759
She must have been acting under Huo Jian's orders.

350
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:19,279
But why does Huo Jian want to imprison me?

351
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,540
Could it be that he wants to use me to threaten you?

352
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,300
Or...

353
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,419
Could it be that he is involved with my family's matter as well?

354
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:30,060
And he is warning me?

355
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:35,320
Look. Chen Hengsheng may have been the one to have signed the contract for Zhiwei,

356
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:39,840
but Huo Jian ould still get Chen Hengsheng to sell the fakes.

357
00:29:39,841 --> 00:29:43,169
It would make sense that he could order him to ruin Zhiwei too.

358
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,039
Why aren't you saying anything?

359
00:29:47,699 --> 00:29:49,820
Did I get it right?

360
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:57,580
You got it right. It was Huo Jian.

361
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,340
Then why didn't you tell me this sooner?

362
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,680
Is it fun watching me chase after Chen Hengsheng?

363
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,939
You don't know Huo Jian.

364
00:30:03,939 --> 00:30:08,739
He is ruthless and merciless to anyone who gets in his way.

365
00:30:08,739 --> 00:30:10,419
He is a terrifying man.

366
00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:11,880
But I'm not scared of him.

367
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,580
I'm scared.

368
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:17,980
Don't worry. I won't drag you down.

369
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,759
I'm not afraid of being dragged down.

370
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:22,160
I'm afraid he would hurt you.

371
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,300
I'm worried that you would act impulsively,

372
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,960
given your reckless personality.

373
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,960
If that happens, not only would we not be able to get anything on him,

374
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,989
but we would also alert him instead.

375
00:30:31,989 --> 00:30:33,960
Then why are you telling me this now?

376
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,620
I'm telling you this because I want you to stay alert and be more cautious,

377
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,318
not because I want you to go after him.

378
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:42,000
I don't think he knows about your relationship with Zhiwei right now.

379
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,680
He only wants to use you to get to me.

380
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,300
So you should still be safe right now.

381
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:51,700
As long as you don't do anything rash, he won't actually hurt you.

382
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,359
So you want me just to stay put and do nothing?

383
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:56,580
I can't do that.

384
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,480
I will help you.

385
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,640
Huo Jian is your uncle and the Chairman of Ocean Group.

386
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,119
Why should I believe that you would help me?

387
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:10,799
My father founded Ocean Group with his blood and tears.

388
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,939
Huo Jian wants to acquire Ocean Group all for himself.

389
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:16,400
He is currently using Yuanfeng to make money and buy up Ocean Hotel's shares.

390
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,700
That is why I want to help you.

391
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,541
 So Huo Jian laid his hands on Ocean Hotel as well.

392
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,640
But given your current position at Ocean Hotel,

393
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,720
it's hard enough for you to protect yourself.

394
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,040
How are you going to take on Huo Jian?

395
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,520
I'll take you to a place. Come with me.

396
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,400
This is...

397
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,720
Welcome to my secret world.

398
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:52,010

399
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,910

400
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,039
What do you think?

401
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,419
This is incredible.

402
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,580
Apart from Ji Yingsong, you're the first person to have entered here.

403
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,700
You practiced rock climbing here?

404
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:24,519
That means everything you did back at the hotel was just for show.

405
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,059
I pretended to be incapable to let Huo Jian's guard down.

406
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,859
I know all of the tricks up his sleeves now.

407
00:33:32,859 --> 00:33:38,500
However, this is still not the right time to confront him.

408
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,400
Xieyi, heed my advice.

409
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,459
To take on an old fox like Huo Jian,

410
00:33:43,459 --> 00:33:45,960
not only do you need a carefully laid-out plan,

411
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,940
but you need plenty of patience as well.

412
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,799
All right. I'll do as you say.

413
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,640
Can I ask you a question?

414
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,339
Is your left leg really injured?

415
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:12,939
Do you really want to know?

416
00:34:12,939 --> 00:34:15,760
I want to know more about you.

417
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,199
How did that happen?

418
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:47,719
You know I love outdoor sports.

419
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:54,280
Sometimes, the tiniest accident can lead to unfortunate consequences.

420
00:34:54,939 --> 00:34:56,939
Does it still hurt?

421
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:01,659
If I were still at the foot of the mountain,

422
00:35:01,659 --> 00:35:05,540
I'm confident I could climb to the top once again

423
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:11,519
and meet the girl that thought of me as a wild boar.

424
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,880
I'm happy.

425
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,959
You've always been you.

426
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,620
Can you teach me rock climbing?

427
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Of course.

428
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:38,019
But the more pressing matter right now is...

429
00:35:38,019 --> 00:35:40,079
Be careful you don't catch a cold.

430
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,340
Why don't I do it myself?

431
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,559
Be good.

432
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:54,559
Just sit still.

433
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:04,679
What are you doing?

434
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:08,060
The great Director Li is actually drying my hair for me.

435
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:10,679
Of course, I have to take a photo to commemorate such a glorious occasion.

436
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,280
Come on.

437
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:24,840
Oh, right.

438
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,400
I need to talk to you about something.

439
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,040
I almost called you Mr. Li in front of Yi Fei today and almost let it slip.

440
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,800
As your girlfriend in name,

441
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,039
what should I call you?

442
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:38,420
Anything.

443
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,800
That won't do.

444
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,660
Zeliang?

445
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,039
That's too plain.

446
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:47,699
Everyone calls you that.

447
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:49,499
A'Liang?

448
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:52,639
That sounds Hong Kongese or Taiwanese.

449
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:55,639
Liang Liang?

450
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:56,699
No.

451
00:36:56,699 --> 00:36:58,599
Liang Liang?

452
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:00,599
No.

453
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:02,420
The meaning isn't good.

454
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,599
Xiao Liang? Xiao Liang.

455
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,560
What about Xiao Liang?

456
00:37:08,779 --> 00:37:10,279
That's enough.

457
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,719
You don't think it's good either, right?

458
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,920
Isn't there anything that sounds a little more intimate?

459
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:30,040
In that case, you can call me A'Yan.

460
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,080
A'Yan?

461
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,299
Is that your nickname?

462
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:46,160
Yes. Only the ones closest to me know that nickname.

463
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,980
A'Yan?

464
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:52,919
A'Yan.

465
00:37:52,919 --> 00:37:56,220
That's a nice name. I like it a lot.

466
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,900
I'll call you A'Yan from now on.

467
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:04,770
♫  Sailing on the sea of life  ♫

468
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:11,559
♫  All alone lost on the tide  ♫

469
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:13,860
Isn't this my bracelet?

470
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,299
Why do you have it with you?

471
00:38:15,299 --> 00:38:17,399
Huo Jian gave it to me.

472
00:38:17,399 --> 00:38:19,960
That old fox, Huo Jian.

473
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,920
He must have had Yi Fei take it away from me when I was asleep.

474
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,559
♫  Another night has come  ♫

475
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:28,200
Give it to me.

476
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,720
I'll help you put it on.

477
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,280
Does this bracelet mean a lot to you?

478
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,320
My father left this for me.

479
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,840
It was a gift for my 18th birthday.

480
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:51,170
♫  I close my eyes and look  ♫

481
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:54,260
♫  To where you are  ♫

482
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,830
♫  You are my guiding star  ♫

483
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:02,630
♫  You are the compass in my heart  ♫

484
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:06,360
♫  Rain or shine, you never falter  ♫

485
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:12,100
A'Yan, both of us don't have parents anymore.

486
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,620
Let's take care of each other from now on, all right?

487
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:20,159
♫  Life is a journey  ♫

488
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:21,079
All right.

489
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:26,440
♫  Taking me back to where you are  ♫

490
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:40,550
♫  Take my boat and point it east  ♫

491
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,490
Don't take pictures at a time like this.

492
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:54,910
♫  When the storm comes hailing down my face  ♫

493
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:58,530
♫  I close my eyes and look  ♫

494
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,100
♫  To where you are  ♫

495
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,200
- Who is it? 
 - Who is it?

496
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:09,840
I'll go and see who it is.

497
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,700
Mr. Li.

498
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:23,359
Xieyi, it's Yingsong.

499
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,400
I have to talk to him for a bit.

500
00:40:33,608 --> 00:40:37,459
- How did it go? 
 - I've sent him away according to the path you designated.

501
00:40:37,459 --> 00:40:38,920
He is safe.

502
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,639
I looked up that "Spider."

503
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:41,839
His name is Liu A'Wei.

504
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,339
After he disappeared two years ago, he never took another job.

505
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:45,619
He's from Yunnan.

506
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:49,700
However, two years ago, he moved away from his old residence with his wife and children.

507
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,639
No one knows where he is right now.

508
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:53,880
Huo Jian has been looking for this guy.

509
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,800
That means there must be something wrong with him.

510
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,460
Keep searching. As long as we can get information on him, spare no expense.

511
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,580
Understood.

512
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:05,139
Huo Jian's men stood guard at the bar all day today.

513
00:41:05,139 --> 00:41:08,559
I'm not sure if they noticed Lin Tai or not.

514
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:10,219
That doesn't matter anymore.

515
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:15,760
He and I... There are some things both of us know well enough already.

516
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,279
Then what should we do next?

517
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:22,180
For all these years, Huo Jian has been using Yunfeng Hotel

518
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:25,600
to earn profits for himself secretly and using that money

519
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,519
to buy up loose shares from the market.

520
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,979
He has made his ambition clear.

521
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:36,879
As for us, we've pretty much figured out all the methods he has been using to make money.

522
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,680
Are we going to begin our counterattack?

523
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:55,440
Although it is a bit sooner than I expected.

524
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:02,530
♫  I need you, I love you  ♫

525
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:06,180
♫  I'll brave the waves for you  ♫

526
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:09,810
♫  You don't have to be brave all the time  ♫

527
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:16,080
♫  Please believe that I am by your side  ♫

528
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:21,690
♫  Ever and after  ♫

529
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:33,030

530
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:41,460
♫  Halfway through the journey on the train,  ♫

531
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:45,280
♫  a new passenger takes a seat  ♫

532
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,610
♫  The bells on the platform are ringing  ♫

533
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:51,980
♫  I wave my hands to see the passengers off  ♫

534
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:55,810
♫  With a one-way ticket stub in your hand  ♫

535
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:59,430
 you've embarked on a journey to happiness  ♫

536
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:02,930
♫  I didn't save your contact information  ♫

537
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:06,390
♫  But in my heart, I secretly ask  ♫

538
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:08,140
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

539
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,820
♫  How's it going with him?  ♫

540
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:13,530
♫  I bet his temper is better than mine  ♫

541
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:17,510
♫  He's better at guessing your complicated thoughts  ♫

542
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:21,510
♫  Does he hold you when you're sad?  ♫

543
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:23,390
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

544
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:25,320
♫  Everything must be going well  ♫

545
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:29,050
♫  Do you want to hear what I haven't said?  ♫

546
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:36,440
♫  Do lyrics of love songs stir up your emotions and recall all of our memories?  ♫

547
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:41,510
♫  It doesn't seem to be difficult  ♫

548
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,010
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

549
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:10,850
♫  How's it going with him?  ♫

550
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:14,460
♫  You and fate have not given me an answer  ♫

551
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:18,670
♫  The price of growing up is like a pile of bargaining chip  ♫

552
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:22,530
♫  The wager is who can let go first  ♫

553
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:24,380
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

554
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:26,360
♫  Everything must be going well  ♫

555
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:30,410
♫  Life is not as complicated as I thought  ♫

556
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:34,880
♫  Silence is the best that I can do  ♫

557
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,720
♫  Whatever pain and suffering may come,  ♫

558
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,960
♫  I'm not afraid at all  ♫

559
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:51,180
