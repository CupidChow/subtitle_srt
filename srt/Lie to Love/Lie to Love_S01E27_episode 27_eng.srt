00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:25,100
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

3
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:33,550
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

4
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:41,530
♫  And turn to face all the long lost times  ♫

5
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,270
♫  Brace the pain  ♫

6
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:51,210
♫  Let memories wake up from oceans deep  ♫

7
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,250
♫  No place to hide  ♫

8
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,450
♫  No way to run  ♫

9
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,820
♫  New dawn counts down  ♫

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,030
♫  I fight  ♫

11
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,110
♫  I cry  ♫

00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,700
♫  I give up  ♫

♫  Memories forgotten, forsaken surround  ♫

14
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:24,130
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

15
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:33,070
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

16
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:40,850
♫  Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

17
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:49,720
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

18
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:57,950

19
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,950

20
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:46,919
Why did you turn on only this light?

21
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,019
You didn't even get changed. Such a bad girl.

22
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,900
Eat something.

23
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:07,180
I made you your favorite mung bean cake.

24
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,760
Here.

25
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,339
I said eat up.

26
00:03:17,339 --> 00:03:20,359
I made it for you. It's very fresh.

27
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:22,400
Xie Minghao!

28
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:26,979
Why don't you just kill me? I won't tell you anything!

29
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:40,600
If you won't listen to me,

30
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,560
I'll make Xieyi come here and keep you company.

31
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:58,359
Very well. Enjoy.

32
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:00,479
Remember to get changed.

33
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,860
Boss! This is bad! Warehouse No. 6 is on fire!

34
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,340
- What's going on? 
 - I have no idea!

35
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,680
Everyone is busy putting out the fire!

36
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,879
- Come on! Let's take a look! 
 - Come on!

37
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,100
Director Shi, you're finally here. Something happened at Lantian Bay.

38
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,240
When was this?

39
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,279
Just now, the construction site called and said the fire is under control.

40
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:48,038
Fortunately, no one was hurt.

41
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,279
Does Chairman Li know?

42
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,739
Chairman Li and Xieyi have gone there.

43
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,470

44
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,020

45
00:05:02,739 --> 00:05:07,339
Lawyer Xie! Something happened at the Lantian Bay construction site.

46
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:10,000
Here, Director Shi. Have a seat.

47
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,660
Here.

48
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:25,339
I didn't expect things to turn out this way.

49
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:28,079
The initial plan was for you to expose this batch of insulation materials

50
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,560
during the on-site inspection by shareholders at the end of the month.

51
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,020
Now that things have turned out this way, I have no idea what to do as well.

52
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,420
The fire on the construction site isn't just Ocean's internal issue.

53
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,079
This will directly put Ocean in the firing line.

54
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,679
That's right.

55
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,579
Director Shi. Have you thought about this?

56
00:05:55,579 --> 00:05:58,100
This might be God's will.

57
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,379
Think about it. It was Xieyi who bough that batch of materials.

58
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,120
Now that there's a fire,

59
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,680
God is helping you to win Li Zeliang's heart back.

60
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,439
Chairman Li has been blinded by his emotions.

61
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,460
You're the only one who can show him the truth.

62
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,539
Now that this has happened, why don't we bring the plan forward?

63
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,559
All right.

64
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,480
Let's proceed as we discussed then.

65
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:34,460
Next, they'll get to that batch of insulation materials.

66
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,260
Use this opportunity to point out Su Xieyi's mistakes.

67
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,879
Let Chairman Li see the truth.

68
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:43,460
As to how to deal with this PR crisis,

69
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,830
I believe you can handle it.

70
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,439
Why would this happen?

71
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:13,040
Did you find out the cause of the fire?

72
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,759
Based on our preliminary assessment, the overloaded ventilator

73
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,399
caused the circuit to catch fire

74
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:19,399
and ignite the insulation material in the warehouse.

75
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:21,118
The ventilator?

76
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,580
Did you not know the output of the ventilator and the correct usage of it?

77
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,979
We use this kind of ventilator at all our warehouse construction sites.

78
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:30,439
It's procured through proper channels.

79
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,760
By right, there shouldn't be a problem.

80
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,639
Even if it was overloaded,

81
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:35,560
only the circuit would catch fire.

82
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,280
It wouldn't burn all the insulation materials in the warehouse.

83
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,740
That said, there is a problem with this batch of insulation materials.

84
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,020
That's most likely the case.

85
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,899
Do a thorough investigation.

86
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:01,099
Before I return to the company, I want to see the detailed investigation report.

87
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:02,759
Yes.

88
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,199
Cease all operations for today.

89
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,439
Keep a lid on this.

90
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:07,339
Okay.

91
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:08,880
Let's go.

92
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:26,110

93
00:08:44,939 --> 00:08:47,519
 Sorry, I have rhinitis.

94
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,380
The results of the investigation are out?

95
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,320
After the fire broke out, the police went to the scene to conduct an investigation and collect evidence.

96
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,599
This is the investigation report.

97
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,240

98
00:09:17,499 --> 00:09:18,679
May I take a look?

99
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:21,060
We'll get to the bottoms of things.

100
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,000
Xieyi. You can go first.

101
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,059
She's the person involved.

102
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:28,520
She has the right to know the truth.

103
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,300

104
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,079
Miss Su. Did you take a good look?

105
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:51,300
It's clearly written on the report

106
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,084
that this batch of insulation materials

107
00:09:53,085 --> 00:09:56,399
did not comply with the company's Class A standards.

108
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,960
All the materials in the warehouse are of Class B extruded board.

109
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,320
But the strange thing

110
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,000
is that it was stated as Class A in the contract that you brought back.

111
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,720
On the day the materials arrived,

112
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,579
you personally inspected and accepted them.

113
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,080
I did check that batch of materials.

114
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,140
The label clearly stated Class A.

115
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,380
I wanted to believe you.

116
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,800
So after I got the report, I contacted the manufacturer.

117
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,120
They said the supplier asked them to do this.

118
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,140
You were the one who found this supplier.

119
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:31,279
Director Shi, are you suspecting me?

120
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,259
It's hard for me not to think that.

121
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:35,500
But why would I do that?

122
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:40,359
That's because you're Shen Zhihong's daughter, the owner of Zhiwei Corporation.

123
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:43,720
You suspected that Zhiwei's bankruptcy had something to do with Ocean.

124
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,501
That is why you approached Zeliang,

125
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:49,759
got into Ocean just to wait for the right time to take Ocean down.

126
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:55,320
Right after Ocean made a promise to ensure the quality of the Lantian Bay project, this happened!

127
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,639
Su Xieyi. That's so cruel of you.

128
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:59,639
I did no such thing.

129
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,519
Xieyi.

130
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,739
All I want to know now

131
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,280
is, how did you come across this supplier?

132
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,440
Brother Minghao introduced him to me.

133
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,459
Xie Minghao?

134
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,800
I get it now.

135
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,560
Xieyi. You may step outside now.

136
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:49,100
We can't delay this any further.

137
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,679
The media wants an answer.

138
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,720
I have the press conference scheduled for tomorrow.

139
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,980
Announce the outcome of the investigation right there and then.

140
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,580
I got it.

141
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,500
Look what happened now.

142
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,580
Are you still trying to protect her?

143
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,939
Director Shi. Don't worry.

144
00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:11,220
I'll make sure it's impartially handled.

145
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,000
But think about it.

146
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,100
If we link these two incidents together,

147
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,060
it doesn't seem very much like an accident.

148
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:22,519
I suspect that someone's using Su Xieyi

149
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:25,040
to take down Ocean.

150
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,559
Okay.

151
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:30,279
Let's hope you can find out the truth as soon as possible.

152
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:32,060
I will.

153
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:51,440
You know what? It turns out that Su Xieyi is the daughter of the owner of Zhiwei.

154
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,999
How did you know?

155
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:55,200
Just now, I wanted to pass Director Shi a document.

156
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,639
When I got to the door, I heard the news.

157
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:59,679
It gave me a shock that I dared not enter.

158
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:02,539
The great revenge by the daughter who went bankrupt.

159
00:13:02,539 --> 00:13:05,079
This is a big deal.

160
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:08,660
It's a shame. Chairman Li treats her so well.

161
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,320
She turns out to be so vicious.

162
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:16,720
Are you girls so free that you have time to talk behind people's back

163
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,739
during working hours?

164
00:13:18,739 --> 00:13:21,200
Mingyue, you have to be careful.

165
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,699
You're so tight with Su Xieyi.

166
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:25,959
Beware. She might make use of you.

167
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,699
You girls often enjoyed the coffee that Xieyi bought you.

168
00:13:30,699 --> 00:13:32,839
How could you say such a thing?

169
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,819
Mingyue, they don't mean that.

170
00:13:35,819 --> 00:13:38,299
This series of events do raise eyebrows.

171
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:40,299
Raise eyebrows?

172
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:44,100
Look. Whatever you say,

173
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,119
I believe that Xieyi isn't that kind of person.

174
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:49,800
But you can't tell a book by its cover.

175
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,179
There's no telling if she was behind this fire.

176
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,879
Don't make unfounded accusations.

177
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,840
But Zhiwei does have a beef with Ocean.

178
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,440
Besides, Xie...

179
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,820
Hi, Chairman Li.

180
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,039
We haven't even gotten to the bottom of things.

181
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:18,199
I've said this before. No gossiping in the office.

182
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:22,339
If I hear anyone talking about this behind my back again,

183
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:25,220
I'll have to get her to leave Ocean.

184
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:40,579
Are you not suspicious of me?

185
00:14:48,699 --> 00:14:50,780
I've always believed in you.

186
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:56,640
But… I'll use my own way to get to the bottom of things.

187
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,100
Thank you.

188
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:12,799
Xieyi. That day, I was being mean.

189
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,273
I solemnly apologize to you about Xieqing.

190
00:15:18,273 --> 00:15:22,980
Xieyi. You can punish me however you want.

191
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,440
But don't ignore me.

192
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,620
At crucial times like this,

193
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,259
the more we should communicate with one another.

194
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,040
I'll always be waiting for you.

195
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:40,359
When I find out the truth, I'll come back.

196
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,939
The truth about everything.

197
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,858

198
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,970
 [Ocean Group's stock price has continued to fall.

199
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:13,000
- Brother Minghao. 
 - What brings you here?

200
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,600
There is a problem with that batch of insulation materials.

201
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,400
Let's talk inside.

202
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,399
Mr. Li, I've investigated the matter.

203
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:28,622
No one on the construction site uses this medicine.

204
00:16:28,622 --> 00:16:32,279
That said, someone else entered the factory.

205
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,180
I've checked the security footage.

206
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,679
Many people went in and out of the place. All were in uniform.

207
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:38,939
We couldn't get a clear picture of the faces.

208
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:42,899
There are so many warehouses in the factory.

209
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:44,639
Almost all are equipped with ventilators.

210
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,420
But why is it so coincidentally

211
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,419
that the warehouse where the insulation materials were got on fire?

212
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:51,579
Isn't that too much of a coincidence?

213
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:54,580
I, too, suspect that someone deliberately set it on fire.

214
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,000
After the incident,

215
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,919
this account by the name He Jianghua immediately released a video of the fire scene.

216
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:04,599
The fire was extinguished in less than an hour after it started.

217
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:06,359
Lantian Bay is in the suburbs.

218
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,740
Why is it so coincidental?

219
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,939
Didn't this little brat say that he went on a trip?

220
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:13,359
Why would he be back so soon?

221
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:17,199
He seems to be involved in both incidents.

222
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,760
This He Jianghua is very important.

223
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:23,240
He often makes unannounced visits everywhere.

224
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,760
It's not difficult for him to sneak into the factory and set a fire.

225
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,103
Just now, Ms. Su did tell me that He Jianghua is using the same rhinitis inhalation.

226
00:17:33,103 --> 00:17:35,139
Why don't I ask him to come over?

227
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:36,979
We have no proof right now.

228
00:17:36,979 --> 00:17:39,059
We can't go toe-to-toe with him.

229
00:17:39,979 --> 00:17:42,680
Will he answer if you call him?

230
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,480
He might not answer my call.

231
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,540
But that doesn't mean he won't answer other people's calls.

232
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:53,980
Those in the media industry like him are only after scoops.

233
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,599
He's obsessed with exposing Ocean, isn't he?

234
00:17:58,419 --> 00:18:00,399
We can take advantage of that.

235
00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:01,940
Understood.

236
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,700
 Hua

237
00:18:13,979 --> 00:18:16,219
Hi, Mr. He.

238
00:18:16,219 --> 00:18:17,960
Who's this?

239
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,699
I'm a fan of yours.

240
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:22,000
I've been following your account for a long time.

241
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,079
These days, there aren't many conscientious people

242
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:27,720
with a great sense of responsibility like you in the media industry.

243
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,638
I have great admiration for you.

244
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,019
 Not at all.

245
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:34,079
But this is my number at work.

246
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,100
If there's nothing else, that's enough talk.

247
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,659
Wait, don't.

248
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,680
Why would I call you for nothing, right?

249
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,140
Well...

250
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:47,085
I am the foreman at the Lantian Bay construction site.

251
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:50,739
I feel so pumped after seeing your report.

252
00:18:50,739 --> 00:18:55,399
I happen to have some inside information about Lantian Bay.

253
00:18:55,399 --> 00:18:58,640
I hope you can help to give us a voice.

254
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:04,194
Do you know if they have some other frauds?

255
00:19:04,194 --> 00:19:06,519
It's not convenient to talk over the phone.

256
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:07,939
We should set up a meeting place,

257
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:11,780
and I'll bring you the evidence and information and show them to you.

258
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,000
Okay. I'll find a place and send you the location.

259
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,040
Okay. I'll wait to hear from you.

260
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:24,419
He agreed to meet up.

261
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:28,000
Mr. Li, the press conference is scheduled for tomorrow.

262
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,799
If we can prove that He Jianghua is the arsonist,

263
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,480
catching him will give us a chance to make a comeback.

264
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,760
I won't miss this opportunity.

265
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,680
Why would it turn out this way?

266
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,720
That supplier has a good track record.

267
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,440
But I couldn't reach him now.

268
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,020
His phone has been turned off, and even his office is closed.

269
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,219
Can you find him?

270
00:19:56,219 --> 00:19:58,839
All right. I'll help to ask around.

271
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:00,200
I'm counting on you.

272
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,060
I still have work to do. I'll get going now.

273
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,860
Leaving so soon?

274
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:17,780
Brother Minghao. Have you been bringing lunch to the office lately?

275
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,519
That's right.

276
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,160
I feel worn out these days.

277
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,145
I didn't want to order in. I just wanted to prepare the food myself.

278
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,200
Take care of yourself.

279
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,420
This is my sister's favorite.

280
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,960
That's right.

281
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,799
I don't know what else I can do.

282
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:35,340
Whenever I think of her, I'll have some of her favorite foods.

283
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,140
It can help to ease the pain of missing her.

284
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,980
I know it's hard to let go.

285
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,100
But still, we have to look forward.

286
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,980
Thank you.

287
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:50,799
Well, I'll get going then.

288
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,959
Let me know if you hear anything.

289
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:55,439
I'll walk you out.

290
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,759
Just get back to your work.

291
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,259
- Be safe. 
 - Okay.

292
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:13,639
Hello? What's wrong?

293
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:38,900
Hi, Mr. He. I'm here.

294
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,480
Which private room are you in?

295
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,079
 I'm in Songhe Hall.

296
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:44,019
 Come alone.

297
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:46,159
Okay.

298
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:50,119
Mr. Li, he's in Songhe Hall.

299
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,889
He specifically emphasized that I should go alone.

300
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,720
Wait here for me. I'll meet him.

301
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,780
I'll call you if there's anything.

302
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,080
Chairman Li. You don't seem so surprised to see me.

303
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,719
Likewise. You aren't surprised to see me.

304
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,900
So my speculation was right.

305
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,139
Tell me about it.

306
00:22:45,139 --> 00:22:48,019
Lantian Bay project has a delicate nature.

307
00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:52,259
I even gave my word that there would be no fraud.

308
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:56,658
So if anything goes wrong with Lantian Bay project at this very moment,

309
00:22:56,658 --> 00:22:59,960
it will surely hit Ocean hard and fast.

310
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,960
It was you who introduced Xieyi to that supplier.

311
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,359
You took advantage of the trust that Xieyi had in you.

312
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:10,480
Also, you were too eager to set things in motion and set up a trap for her.

313
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:16,940
So you must have instructed the supplier to secretly swap that batch of materials.

314
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:19,659
Then?

315
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:23,678
Based on the two discoveries made by He Jianghua,

316
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,200
he seemed to have known the exact time

317
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,119
and be the first to expose the news.

318
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:34,519
It was so coincidental as though he was the one who set the fire.

319
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:36,819
If I'm right,

320
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:39,979
you're the one behind all this.

321
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:46,099
Chairman Li is indeed very smart.

322
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:48,680
You're so quick to admit it.

323
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,519
That's right. It was my doing.

324
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:51,640
Very well.

325
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,999
I'll invite the media and hold a press conference.

326
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:57,060
Make sure you'll be there when it happens.

327
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:00,679
You're the key witness for me to set the record straight.

328
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:03,420
Don't worry, Chairman Li. I'll surely be there.

329
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:08,799
But before that, I have a little something that might pique your interest.

330
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:20,540
 I did check that batch of materials. The label clearly stated Class A.

331
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,680
 I wanted to believe you.

332
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,019
 So after I got the report, I contacted the manufacturer.

333
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:29,480
 They said the supplier asked them to do this.

334
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,920
 Please verify the details.

335
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,240
 If there's no issue we can proceed to sign the contract.

336
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,079
 There's no need to go through it.

337
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:39,200
 The contract was prepared by Lawyer Xie.

338
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,519
 I trust him.

339
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:44,380
 Besides, I've gone through the electronic version over a dozen times.

340
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:47,839
 Let's just sign and stamp it.

341
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,700
 Miss Su. Did you meet He Jianghua in the restaurant the other day?

342
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,939
 I did.

343
00:24:57,939 --> 00:25:01,000
 But I thought he was just an ordinary customer.

344
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,700
 Miss Su.

345
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,279
 Mr. He.

346
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,060
 What a coincidence. Did you come to buy books too?

347
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,200
 That's right. I travel a lot.

348
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,640
 So I came to take a look around at the bookstore near the hotel

349
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,960
 and picked two books.

350
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,199
 This is all directed at me.

351
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:20,380
 It's like someone's pulling the strings.

352
00:25:23,699 --> 00:25:25,540
 Class B insulation boards

353
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:29,359
 can also be used as insulation for building exterior walls.

354
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:32,720
 As to why the Class A insulation board was not used

355
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,499
 in accordance with Ocean's previous standards, it's all entirely my decision.

356
00:25:37,499 --> 00:25:40,600
 It has nothing to do with Ms. Su Xieyi.

357
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,820
Li Zeliang, stand right there!

358
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:55,299
Are you out of your mind? Have you considered the consequences?

359
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,039
What do you think I should do?

360
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:06,319
Push all the blame on Su Xieyi?

361
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:11,940
Then, push her out and let her come under fire in order to protect Ocean's reputation?

362
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,280
But this is clearly her fault.

363
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,799
It's the material she bought that caused the fire.

364
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:20,519
You did this for this woman who's up to no good. Is it worth it?

365
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:23,100
I'm the chairman of Ocean

366
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,580
and also the largest shareholder.

367
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,179
I'll be responsible for the decision I make.

368
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:29,359
Li Zeliang, let me remind you.

369
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:31,519
You might be the chairman.

370
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:34,459
But Ocean doesn't belong to you alone.

371
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:36,599
I'm well aware of that.

372
00:26:38,939 --> 00:26:42,060
You're a lost cause!

373
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,640
You'll regret your decision.

374
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:02,240
Why did you do that?

375
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:08,059
I told you I would clear your name.

376
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,960
You're not clearing my name.

377
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,980
You're apologizing lightly will only make things harder for yourself.

378
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,619
The die is cast.

379
00:27:17,619 --> 00:27:20,201
There's no need to look into it any further.

380
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,039
What have you gone through to reclaim Ocean?

381
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,840
Have you forgotten all that?

382
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,780
What you said today before the media will cause Ocean's stock price to plummet.

383
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:35,119
That's the business that your father had spent his lifetime building.

384
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:36,599
Su Xieyi.

385
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:41,599
You're in no position to teach me what to say or do.

386
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:46,319
I have the right to decide on how Ocean will deal with the problem.

387
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:50,180
Think about it.

388
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,680
There must be a reason behind all this.

389
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,960
You said it yourself.

390
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,619
What we need now is to communicate and solve the problem together.

391
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,820
I've given you the chance to do that.

392
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,019
But the ship has sailed.

393
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,020

394
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:45,800
 Chairman Li, don't worry. I'll surely be there.

395
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:50,340
 But before that, I have a little something that might pique your interest.

396
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,400
 It's all recorded in the statement.

397
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,040
 The supplier privately sent a sum of money to Xieyi.

398
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,259
 Three million in total.

399
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,539
 Lawyer Xie, you sure are a professional.

400
00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:16,939
 What a flawless frame job you have here.

401
00:29:16,939 --> 00:29:20,400
 But what can this statement prove?

402
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,839
 Xieyi signed the contract with the supplier.

403
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:24,720
 The company has a backup copy.

404
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,659
 It's written clearly on it.

405
00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:29,819
 I, too, have a copy of the contract that you talked about.

406
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,400

407
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,370

408
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,260
 Xie Minghao. You forged the contract.

409
00:30:02,939 --> 00:30:06,859
 Don't you recognize Xieyi's handwriting? But it's nothing difficult.

410
00:30:06,859 --> 00:30:10,940
 If necessary, I can ask an authoritative organization to analyze it.

411
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:14,000
 That supplier is my friend.

412
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,279
 He told me that it was Xieyi who instructed them to sign this dual contract,

413
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:20,160
 and she also specifically ordered

414
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,096
 for the B3 extruded board to be packed into a Class A material package.

415
00:30:24,096 --> 00:30:27,497
 She asked for a colossal amount of money. Three million.

416
00:30:27,497 --> 00:30:30,359
 If necessary, I can arrange for you to meet with the supplier.

417
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:34,300
 Of course. They'll tell you the same narrative.

418
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,079
 You've bought that supplier, right?

419
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:42,140
 It's their words against her. I won't take their words for it.

420
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,960
 I knew you would think this way.

421
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,580
 So I prepared a small surprise for you.

422
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:55,020
 Miss Su. I like this about you. You dive just right in.

423
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:59,570
 How about this? I can give you 10 percent of the rebate.

424
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:01,919
 Make it 20 percent.

425
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,640
 Miss Su. You asked us to use B3 materials to replace those of Class A

426
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,599
 and we could make some money from it.

427
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:11,839
 But the profit margin isn't as much as you think.

428
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:15,339
 Besides, do you have any idea how much 10 percent is?

429
00:31:15,339 --> 00:31:17,480
 It's about three million.

430
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,555
 After all, we're just trying to make a living.

431
00:31:20,555 --> 00:31:22,839
 All right. I'll text you now.

432
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,419
 I've received your bank account number.

433
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:25,438
 After the deal goes through,

434
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,139
 I'll transfer the fee for the rebate to the bank account number that you provided.

435
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:31,399
 Please accept this little gift.

436
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:34,159
 Don't mention it. It's nice working with you.

437
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,960
 Oh, right.

438
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,900
 Let me briefly explain it to you.

439
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:43,860
 Three million meets corresponding standards of extremely large monetary amount.

440
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,119
 Based on the amount of remittance from the supplier to Xieyi,

441
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:50,020
 the sentence should be at least ten years or even life imprisonment.

442
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:55,580
 Now, I have the evidence, witness, and Xieyi's motive for revenge.

443
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,619
 Xie Minghao.

444
00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:03,760
 I never thought you would even do something like this to Xieyi.

445
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,739
 You don't want her to suffer?

446
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,119
 The choice is yours.

447
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:11,079
 You can either protect Xieyi and take the blame.

448
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:13,640
 That will cost Ocean its reputation and lead to bankruptcy.

449
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,940
 You know better.

450
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:18,440
 Or you can rat Xieyi out, and I'll hand over the evidence.

451
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:23,000
 In that case, I'm afraid you can only visit her in jail.

452
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,519
 The tug between power and love.

453
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,780
 This has always been an eternal dilemma.

454
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,114
 I'm really curious

455
00:32:32,114 --> 00:32:34,640
 as to how you will choose.

456
00:33:04,979 --> 00:33:08,158
Since you've called and asked me here,

457
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,638
you can just cut to the chase.

458
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:16,519
You must have heard what A'Yan said at the press conference today.

459
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:19,079
I was just beside him. I heard him.

460
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:22,359
Well, do you know the reason he said that?

461
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:24,678
Miss Su, you're a smart person.

462
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:29,300
It shouldn't be hard to figure out that Mr. Li said that to protect you, right?

463
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,900
I know that.

464
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,960
But based on my understanding of him,

465
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,120
he isn't the kind to make a trade-off and take the blame without careful consideration.

466
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,839
It does strike me as a little odd.

467
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:42,718
After the fire accident at Lantian Bay, Mr. Li was investigating the incident

468
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,160
and he even arranged a meeting with He Jianghua.

469
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,619
Did he meet He Jianghua then?

470
00:33:47,619 --> 00:33:49,400
No.

471
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,499
But he met someone else.

472
00:33:51,499 --> 00:33:52,440
Who?

473
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,363
Xie Minghao.

474
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,730
Brother Minghao?

475
00:33:58,339 --> 00:34:00,739
Did they meet by chance?

476
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:02,459
No.

477
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:06,000
Mr. Li went into the private room that He Jianghua booked.

478
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,499
Then, both of them walked out together.

479
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:12,920
He arranged a meeting with He Jianghua.

480
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,139
Why would Brother Minghao be in there?

481
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:18,760
From what I see, it's all very clear now.

482
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,079
He Jianghua and Xie Minghao are in it together.

483
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:24,220
Actually, Mr. Li has long suspected him.

484
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:28,678
But I could tell that he found it hard to talk to you about certain things.

485
00:34:28,678 --> 00:34:31,060
Miss Su, think about it calmly.

486
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,079
Who introduced the supplier to you?

487
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:37,778
If you didn't commit fraud on the purchase of this batch of materials, who could it be?

488
00:34:37,778 --> 00:34:39,039
Think deeper.

489
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:42,639
Mr. Li speculated that the fire at the warehouse was man-made

490
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,680
and he suspected it was He Jianghua's doing, so he asked him to meet up.

491
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,639
But the one who showed up was Xie Minghao.

492
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:51,060
First, it's He Jianghua and Xie Minghao. Then, the supplier and Xie Minghao.

493
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,579
Don't you find it suspicious?

494
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:59,760
Well, what did he say after he met Brother Minghao?

495
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,979
I did ask him when I sent him back.

496
00:35:01,979 --> 00:35:03,679
But he didn't say anything.

497
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:07,199
But I could tell he wasn't in good shape.

498
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:09,281
Initially, Mr. Li was going to announce

499
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:12,180
the investigation results to the police and the media

500
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,960
and suspected the possibility of arson.

501
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,740
But right before the reporters, he totally changed his stance.

502
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,480
I think

503
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,079
this has something to do with his private conversation with Xie Minghao.

504
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,580
Brother Ji, thank you for telling me all this.

505
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:31,840
The opinions expressed are solely my own.

506
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,159
I don't mean anything else.

507
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:36,163
Also, Mr. Li doesn't know that you asked to see me.

508
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,040
Sister.

509
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:52,780
If you were still alive,

510
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:58,638
I bet you wouldn't believe that these things are related to Brother Minghao.

511
00:35:58,638 --> 00:36:00,079
Right?

512
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,660
Perhaps, I shouldn't have come back.

513
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,860
That way, A'Yan wouldn't have gotten into all these troubles.

514
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,260
And you would still be fine.

515
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:21,439
So many things have happened.

516
00:36:22,979 --> 00:36:25,419
Tell me. What should I do?

517
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:57,920
 To my beloved sister, Xieyi.

518
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,980
 If you're reading this,

519
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,880
 it means I have lost yet another bet.

520
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,680
 All my life, I've had so many regrets.

521
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:13,177
 But my biggest regret is not able to find true love.

522
00:37:13,177 --> 00:37:15,278
 Xie Minghao doesn't love me.

523
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,640
 He was just pretending to love me.

524
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,219
 He only treats me as a tool for seeking revenge against Zhiwei.

525
00:37:22,219 --> 00:37:26,977
 Actually, the one he likes all along is you.

526
00:37:26,977 --> 00:37:30,000
 In order to get you, he would do whatever it takes.

527
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,197
 He would go on a revenge spree on anyone who stopped him from loving you.

528
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:37,440
 If you receive this doll from Xie Minghao,

529
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,660
 please stay away from him because he must have

530
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:44,259
 started to hatch a sinister plot against you.

531
00:37:44,259 --> 00:37:49,639
 Also, please protect your loved ones and those who love you.

532
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:53,760
 Xieyi. Weak as I am,

533
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,360
 I have to confess my crime to you.

534
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,758
 I've made a huge mistake.

535
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,400
 I'm responsible for Zhiwei's bankruptcy.

536
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,420
 So I'll pay the price for my mistake.

537
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,799
 I don't expect your forgiveness.

538
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:16,440
 I just hope you can live happily forever.

539
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,739
 If there is an afterlife,

540
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,759
 I hope we can become real sisters.

541
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,300
Drink some water.

542
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:08,919
Very good.

543
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,520
As long as you behave, I promise I'll still be nice to you like I did.

544
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:18,482
Leave the container here after you're done. I'll collect it tomorrow.

545
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,160
How's Xieyi?

546
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:31,099
Like I said, if you do as I say, she'll be fine.

547
00:39:31,099 --> 00:39:33,052
I want to see her.

548
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,500
Can I?

549
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:37,439
Sure.

550
00:39:39,729 --> 00:39:41,363
When?

551
00:39:41,363 --> 00:39:43,099
Tomorrow, perhaps.

552
00:39:43,099 --> 00:39:44,918
Or maybe next year.

553
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,113
After I take care of everything, I'll let you two meet up.

554
00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:53,580
You look good in this outfit.
