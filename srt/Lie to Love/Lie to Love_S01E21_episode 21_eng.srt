♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:40,950

17
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:49,720
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

18
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:59,920

19
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,050

20
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,180
Dr. Wu. About A'Yan's leg,

21
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,280
- I have some questions. 
 - I'm listening.

22
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,280
It's been over two years since the amputation.

23
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,540
But A’Yan's leg still hurts very often.

24
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,660
Why is that?

25
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,539
There are two reasons why Mr. Li often experiences pain.

26
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:25,980
One of them is known as the phantom limb.

27
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,900
It's a form of pain caused by psychological conditions.

28
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,860
Even with modern medicine, it's still hard to cure it.

29
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,819
The other one is caused by swelling.

30
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:35,719
Swelling?

31
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:39,460
After the amputation, the limb will undergo rapid atrophy.

32
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,260
After the rapid decline of muscle function,

33
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,779
blood circulation will be affected, so is the flow of lymph.

34
00:02:45,779 --> 00:02:46,900
Let me put it this way.

35
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,099
The lower half of the body must support the weight of the body.

36
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:53,219
At the same time, the weight is also exerted on the prosthetic limb.

37
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:56,300
It's harder for blood to flow back into his heart.

38
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,019
These two are the main causes of the swelling.

39
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:02,741
The pain is very agonizing.

40
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:05,300
If it gets worse...

41
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,900
What if it gets worse? He can't use the prosthetic limb?

42
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,120
If it gets worse, the only solution is to amputate further up the leg.

43
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,740
He will undergo another amputation.

44
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,199
What can we do to prevent that?

45
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:18,700
Reduce the use of the prosthetic limb. Try using a wheelchair instead.

46
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,460
Reduce the abrasion and pressure between the amputated part and prosthetic limb.

47
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,779
Mr. Li is very strong-willed.

48
00:03:24,779 --> 00:03:26,740
He dislikes the use of a wheelchair.

49
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:31,319
I tried to persuade him but to no avail.

50
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,500

51
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,419
What's wrong, Xieyi?

52
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:47,760
You've been putting on a long face ever since you came out.

53
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,199
Did Dr. Wu say anything worrying?

54
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,520
It's nothing.

55
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,700
He told me you need to let your leg rest for better recovery.

56
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,520
Last night you checked every inch of my body.

57
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,040
You should know very well how my leg is doing.

58
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,580
A’Yan! Take it seriously. Enough with the jokes.

59
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,719
Joke?

60
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,900
Which jokes?

61
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,360
All of them.

62
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,160
The phone is ringing.

63
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:23,400
Hello, Yingsong.

64
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,140
 Mr. Li, I have some progress to report regarding the investigation.

65
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,920
Sure. I'm on my way.

66
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,460
What is it?

67
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,079
It's nothing.

68
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,959
You want me to take it seriously.

69
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,459
So, you're driving.

70
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:42,619
That's more like it.

71
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,620

72
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,680
I contacted Liu A'Wei's co-worker.

73
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,460
- I got a very important lead from the man. 
 - What is it?

74
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,079
While Liu A'Wei was working at the place,

75
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,519
he once asked for free legal aid for his daughter.

76
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:05,539
The lawyer in charge was Xie Minghao.

77
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:09,879
Xie Minghao?

78
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,379
Xie Minghao...

79
00:05:18,299 --> 00:05:22,100
He showed up at the hospital two years ago.

80
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,299
And this time, he showed up in Yun'an.

81
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:28,400
And he was even in contact with Liu A'Wei.

82
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,659
It was already very suspicious that he showed up in Yun'an.

83
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:35,079
But based on Huo Jian's words,

84
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,140
he opposed Zhiwei because of K of Spades.

85
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,439
But why would he take orders from him?

86
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:43,999
This question has left me baffled.

87
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,319
What if...

88
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:51,419
If K of Spades has the video filmed by Liu A'Wei...

89
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,720
Then everything will make sense.

90
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,299
But this is just our speculation.

91
00:05:56,299 --> 00:05:59,419
Not to mention Shen Zhihong was Xie Minghao's benefactor

92
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:01,160
and he is Xieqing's father.

93
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,700
Why would he do such a thing?

94
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,519
Shen Xieqing was Zhiwei's director of finance.

95
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,600
And Xie Minghao was Shen Xieqing's finance

96
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,480
and also Zhiwei's corporate lawyer.

97
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,999
Yingsong.

98
00:06:15,999 --> 00:06:18,399
Dig out all the files about Zhiwei from two years ago.

99
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,279
Check every file one more time.

100
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,240
See if there is any new lead.

101
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,439
Yes.

102
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:25,619
I need to talk to him.

103
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,460

104
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,279
Director Li, to what do I owe the honor of having you here?

105
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:45,839
I have some of Huo Jian's corporate contracts for you to verify.

106
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,380
I could have gotten them myself.

107
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,720
You shouldn't trouble yourself with this.

108
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,020
Xieyi was worried you haven't fully recovered.

109
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,940
She asked me to take some burden off your shoulders.

110
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,520
I was passing by. So I dropped by for you.

111
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,739
I appreciate it.

112
00:07:02,739 --> 00:07:06,140
But Huo Jian left a mess of an account for us.

113
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,140
As a lawyer, I should see to it.

114
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,179
Thank you, Lawyer Xie.

115
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:15,720
By the way, when I came up upstairs I notice your firm also provide

116
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,160
free legal aid for charity.

117
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:23,179
You have quite a sense of justice.

118
00:07:23,179 --> 00:07:25,479
I simply help however I can.

119
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,720
I was told Liu A'Wei also got legal aid for Xiaoxiao.

120
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,979
Did Li Xia tell you that? Or did Xiaoxiao tell you?

121
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,679
Lawyer Xie, do you know Liu A'Wei?

122
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:50,659
It's been too long, I don't remember all the details.

123
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:54,979
But after you left that day, I saw Liu A'Wei's photo at Li Xia's house.

124
00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:58,979
I must say, he did look quite familiar.

125
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,399
What is it?

126
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:05,260
Does Xiaoxiao need legal aid to defend her civil right?

127
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,119
Let me know. I can help.

128
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,559
It's nothing.

129
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,659
All right, thank you for the tea.

130
00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:18,219
I have an appointment with my client. I should get going.

131
00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:19,919
Wait, Director Li.

132
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,120
Could you pass this medicine to Xieyi?

133
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,320
She must be running low on it.

134
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:36,060
She's been taking this medicine. It works wonders.

135
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,119
It does.

136
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:44,820
However, it only subdues the pain temporarily.

137
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,659
Unless we find a cure, Xieyi will be dependent on medicine.

138
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:51,065
If she takes the medicine for every toothache,

139
00:08:51,065 --> 00:08:55,200
Xieyi will forget that what she really needs isn't a painkiller.

140
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,240
She should remove her aching wisdom tooth.

141
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,540
Perhaps you don't know her the way I do.

142
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,559
She is terrified of dental extraction.

143
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,290
Is that so?

144
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,939
I should really have a word with her regarding the matter.

145
00:09:13,939 --> 00:09:17,490
As for the medicine, you can keep it for now.

146
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,659
I must go now.

147
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:44,059
 Li Zeliang, you started this war.

148
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:48,370

149
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:00,559
Xieyi.

150
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:04,059
Does your tooth still hurt?

151
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:07,440
No. I took the medicine.

152
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,179
You need to ease up on the antibiotic.

153
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:14,040
It's bad for your health.

154
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,060
Trust me. You should get your wisdom tooth removed.

155
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,440
But I'm really scared.

156
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,503
Unless you tackle the root cause,

157
00:10:23,503 --> 00:10:27,059
the problem will never stop bothering you.

158
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,900
It's not hurting anymore.

159
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,280
Let's see how it goes next time.

160
00:10:40,419 --> 00:10:42,279
What is this chair doing here?

161
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,440
I can move it out for you.

162
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,240
You can fall if you bump into it.

163
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,520
I put it there on purpose.

164
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,679
I can't put on the prosthetic when I take a shower.

165
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:54,039
I can use the chair as support.

166
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:08,560
- Director Shi. 
 - Lawyer Xie.

167
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,299
I'm sorry you have to come all the way here at night.

168
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:14,040
I always see to the job you give me.

169
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,779
These are the contracts that involved collection issues.

170
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:23,699
I need your legal department to sort them out.

171
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:25,699
Sure.

172
00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:28,040
You could come have waited until tomorrow.

173
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,240
I need to spend some time with Xieqing tomorrow.

174
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,919
She loves drawing, so I'm taking her out to sketch some scenery.

175
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:36,240
Your fiancée is very fortunate to have met you.

176
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,240
Director Li is also very fortunate to have a confidant

177
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,939
such as yourself.

178
00:11:42,939 --> 00:11:44,839
What?

179
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:47,239
Director Shi. Stop lying to yourself.

180
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:52,180
You work overtime until late at night because you are using the job to ease your pain.

181
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,899
Lawyer Xie, your job is to finish the tasks I give you.

182
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:00,740
My personal life is none of your concern.

183
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,480
Director Shi. We've known each other for a long time.

184
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,519
I've always admired your resilience.

185
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,780
If you gave up now,

186
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,719
that wouldn't be the Director Shi I know.

187
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:18,040
If there is nothing else to discuss, leave.

188
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,440
Your greatest qualities are your charisma and capability at work.

189
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,019
Huo Jian just got arrested. Ocean Hotel suffered a huge blow.

190
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:30,039
Director Li must deliver a great result to prove his worth and Ocean Hotel.

191
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:34,000
If you choose to help him in his cause and deliver a great result,

192
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,320
he will see your worth and charisma in the process.

193
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:52,019
Honestly, every man would want to have a capable wife.

194
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:05,539
Huo Jian's arrest was very satisfying, but it left a great impact on Ocean Hotel.

195
00:13:05,539 --> 00:13:10,020
We should plan for Ocean Hotel's future by looking at the bigger picture.

196
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,100
Ocean Hotel has two options.

197
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,000
One, new hotels in foreign countries.

198
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,479
Two, local projects.

199
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:25,179
Impressive, ace corporate lawyer.

200
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,419
You know more than you need to.

201
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,559
I was in charge of the partnership contracts.

202
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:37,100
If I didn't know the field, I'd be neglecting my occupation.

203
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:41,380
So what are your thoughts on the matter?

204
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,639
New hotels in foreign countries can be a promising plan.

205
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,559
It can display Ocean Hotel's ambition for the international market.

206
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:52,319
But for it to work, you must see to it personally, Director Shi.

207
00:13:52,319 --> 00:13:57,479
You might even need to live abroad, away from friends and families.

208
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,519
What about the other plan?

209
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,459
As for the local projects, we can focus on the Lantian Bay Resort.

210
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:07,879
It's in a strategic location and yields promising profits.

211
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:11,480
Not to mention Ocean Hotel only need a resort to build a complete domain.

212
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,159
That project is only a matter of time.

213
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:17,259
The one downside is the high cost.

214
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:21,199
But I believe with Hengye Bank and Ocean Hotel's connection,

215
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,459
funding shouldn't be a problem.

216
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,000
You have a very keen insight, Lawyer Xie.

217
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,200
It's just my personal take.

218
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,899
Don't take my word for it.

219
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:34,279
It's getting late. I must leave now.

220
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:36,260
Don't stay up too late.

221
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,059
Lantian Bay...

222
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,799
You are sweating.

223
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:57,499
It's all right. My leg is hurting again.

224
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,220
I'll call Dr. Wu right away.

225
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,919
Never mind.

226
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:07,640
It's late. Dr. Wu must have gotten off work.

227
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,900
The pain will subside.

228
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,619
Go back to sleep.

229
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,760
Does it still hurt?

230
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,119
Much better now.

231
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,960
♫  Time tries to wash away my feelings for you  ♫

232
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,060
Why is it hurting all of a sudden?

233
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,000
♫  But I know how you mean the world to me  ♫

234
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,740
It happens on rainy days.

235
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,120
Dr. Wu explained the causes to me.

236
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,879
Your leg is hurting partly because of the prosthetic you're using.

237
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:59,720
♫  Till you came around  ♫

238
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,039
♫  And now I can't live without your light  ♫

239
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:06,001
Did he tell you to talk me into using the wheelchair?

240
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:11,960
He also told me you dislike using the wheelchair.

241
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:16,119
I haven't thought of a way to convince you.

242
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,890
Don't worry about me.

243
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,520
I'll be fine.

244
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,319
Don't worry.

245
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:32,802
A'Yan. If I agree to have my tooth removed,

246
00:16:32,802 --> 00:16:36,679
could you promise me you'll try using the wheelchair?

247
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,720
♫  To fly up to the sky  ♫

248
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,920
I thought it terrified you.

249
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,699
But you are right.

250
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:47,879
Taking medicine won't cure my toothache.

251
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:52,000
Not using the wheelchair won't stop your leg from hurting.

252
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:58,760
I know. You hate the feeling of sitting in a wheelchair.

253
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,440
You want everyone to see you as a normal person.

254
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,480
But as your loved one,

255
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,859
all I care about is for you to be healthy.

256
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,999
I know you hate using a wheelchair in public.

257
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:18,441
But we can use it at home. Okay?

258
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,160
♫  And me a thousand joys  ♫

259
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,819
A'Yan.

260
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,959
For our future,

261
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,060
you must stay well and healthy.

262
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,039
Okay?

263
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,581
Yes. I promise.

264
00:17:39,581 --> 00:17:43,721
Make an appointment for me. I'll get the tooth removed.

265
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,560
Okay.

266
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,320
♫  To fly up to the sky  ♫

267
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,080
♫  Even if I'll melt away  ♫

268
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,230
♫  To give you love  ♫

269
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,659
Well?

270
00:18:01,659 --> 00:18:04,179
 I made a dentist appointment for Miss Su.

271
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:06,019
 It's this afternoon.

272
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,699
Okay, you did well.

273
00:18:14,639 --> 00:18:16,019
What is it, Director Shi?

274
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:19,099
You walk with great passion, do you come with good news?

275
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:23,839
Have you considered the resort project of Lantian Bay?

276
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,580
Why are you bringing this up now?

277
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,859
Lantian Bay has always been the most prized project of Ocean Hotel Corporation.

278
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,759
Huo Jian had set the project in motion.

279
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:37,060
But since he's been arrested, all the business partners withdrew from the project.

280
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,390
That left us in a tough spot.

281
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,359
But the project itself has promising commercial value.

282
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:50,499
We are in dire need of a great project to regain the people's trust in Ocean Hotel.

283
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,759
If we can turn it into a success, we can make a comeback

284
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,580
and prove your worth in the market.

285
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:01,379
I suggest we pool our resources into this project

286
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,960
no matter what the challenges are.

287
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:07,140
What is it?

288
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,319
Great minds think alike.

289
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:12,930

290
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:20,420
This is the development proposal Huo Jian left behind before his arrest.

291
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,279
I've been going through it.

292
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:25,219
However, this project will cost us a great fortune.

293
00:19:25,219 --> 00:19:27,179
- I think... 
 - Don't you worry, Zeliang.

294
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:30,299
People will be drawn to a promising project.

295
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:35,640
As for the funding, Hengye Bank will give you their full support.

296
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:43,850
- Xieyi. 
 - Brother Minghao, you needed to see me?

297
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,839
I came to deliver some contracts.

298
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:48,840
I thought I could treat you to a coffee. I hope it's all right.

299
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,380
It's still within my right.

300
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,799
Director Li came to me yesterday.

301
00:19:53,899 --> 00:19:57,060
He said you've asked him to ease up on my workload. Thank you.

302
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,000
Thank you.

303
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,920
You got hurt because of us.

304
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,819
A'Yan cares about you a lot.

305
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,680
Care to elaborate?

306
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,319
He acknowledges your capability at work.

307
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:12,319
He even asked about your childhood.

308
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:14,940
He promised to get along with you.

309
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,520
What else did he say?

310
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,939
Nothing.

311
00:20:17,939 --> 00:20:20,760
He asked about your relationship with my father.

312
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,880
We'll be family soon.

313
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,255
It's only right to know each other better.

314
00:20:25,255 --> 00:20:27,659
He really does care about you.

315
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:30,259
How did you answer?

316
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:32,960
You took better care of my father than I did.

317
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,060
What more could I ask of you?

318
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:39,419
I owed a lot to Uncle Shen. I was returning the kindness.

319
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:41,799
By the way, I ordered a steak.

320
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:42,939
Let's have lunch together.

321
00:20:42,939 --> 00:20:45,640
There is something I must see to. I can't stay too long.

322
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,100
It's all right. How is your toothache?

323
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,020
I came here to pass you the medicine.

324
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,200
You must have finished the last box.

325
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,379
Thank you, Brother Minghao.

326
00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:03,399
But soon enough, I won't need the medicine anymore.

327
00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:05,079
What do you mean?

328
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:08,259
I promised A'Yan to have the tooth removed.

329
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:11,150
Are you going to the dentist later?

330
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,659
A'Yan is right. Taking medicine won't cure the pain.

331
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:17,780
I should have removed the wisdom tooth long ago.

332
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,640
Brother Minghao. Thank you for the medicine.

333
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,599
You won't have to get it for me anymore.

334
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,880
You have my support for having the courage to remove it.

335
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,920
By the way, you can't have solid food for a few days.

336
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,477
How about this? Let me look after you.

337
00:21:36,477 --> 00:21:38,340
It's fine. I have A'Yan around.

338
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,839
He can take care of me.

339
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:41,539
I doubt that.

340
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:44,000
I used to take care of you when we were in Germany.

341
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,279
I can do a better job than him.

342
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:52,380
Actually, I've moved into A'Yan's place.

343
00:22:01,659 --> 00:22:03,959
When was that?

344
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:05,879
Why didn't you tell me?

345
00:22:06,699 --> 00:22:10,960
A'Yan and I think we've wasted too much time while we were apart.

346
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,080
We cherish each other.

347
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,659
Now that Huo Jian has been arrested,

348
00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:21,019
I just want to spend my life with the person I love.

349
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,630
What about me?

350
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,420
All this time I've never left your side.

351
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:33,081
You promised to come back after the investigation is over.

352
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,100
Are you going to leave me forever over him?

353
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,480
I've waited for you for so long.

354
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,380
Do I mean nothing to you?

355
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:52,499
What are you talking about? I don't get it.

356
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,160
I should get going.

357
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,800
Xieyi. Don't get it wrong.

358
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,999
I meant our bond as a family.

359
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:08,859
Brother Minghao. My sister needs you.

360
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:10,720
Spend more time with her.

361
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,900
Xieyi.

362
00:24:11,939 --> 00:24:13,539
Xieyi!

363
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:19,559
What's on your mind?

364
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:22,799
You look upset the whole way.

365
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,140
It's nothing.

366
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:29,240
Maybe the thought of tooth extraction got me nervous.

367
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,119
Don't worry. I got you the best dentist.

368
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:35,060
It won't hurt at all.

369
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,780
Let's go.

370
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,800

371
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:45,759
It's on the left side of the upper jaw.

372
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:48,379
Stay still. We'll give you the anesthetic.

373
00:24:48,379 --> 00:24:51,719
Don't be afraid. I'm right here all the time.

374
00:24:51,719 --> 00:24:55,599
Excuse me, that is my seat.

375
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,159
Sorry.

376
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,680
I'll stand right here.

377
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,539
Sorry. This is my position. Excuse me.

378
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,180
Sorry.

379
00:25:15,219 --> 00:25:19,559
Sorry. We need you to leave, so we can carry out our work.

380
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,720
Sorry. I'll wait outside.

381
00:25:29,859 --> 00:25:33,240
Sir, please close the door. Thanks.

382
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:42,259
I'll wait outside.

383
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,000
Relax. Ready. Open your mouth.

384
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:59,839
 I look silly. I can't let people see me like this.

385
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,539
 Where is he? He promised to wait outside.

386
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:18,780
 Did I scare him off?

387
00:26:29,979 --> 00:26:31,799
Where are you?

388
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:35,580
 Xieyi, come outside. I'm waiting.

389
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:07,890
♫  When dark clouds cover the starry sky in the dark  ♫

390
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:13,910
♫  When the glimmer lights up my eyes when I am lost  ♫

391
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:18,219
♫  The tears and wounds hidden behind your smile  ♫

392
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:21,619
Stop standing there. Let's go home.

393
00:27:21,619 --> 00:27:28,350
♫  Leave it to me, and you should be happier  ♫

394
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:35,380
♫  If tearing it apart makes me worthy of the praises  ♫

395
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:40,720
♫  Piece together your dreams with broken collections  ♫

396
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,219
This isn't fair.

397
00:27:42,219 --> 00:27:44,379
Why do I look silly after getting rid of the tooth?

398
00:27:44,379 --> 00:27:46,720
But you still look cool with the wheelchair.

399
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,459
That means you have good taste.

400
00:27:50,459 --> 00:27:52,740
This isn't fair!

401
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,700
Don't you dare!

402
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,261
No!

403
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,519
What was that for?

404
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:08,270
♫  You don't have to be brave all the time. Please believe  ♫

405
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,830
♫  I am by your side  ♫

406
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:14,220
♫  To embrace the fragility right in front of your eyes  ♫

407
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:19,310
♫  And hug you at the moment you feel like crying  ♫

408
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:25,970
♫  Ever and after  ♫

409
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,400
What's on your mind?

410
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:32,299
Nothing.

411
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,699
I realized I've been too busy.

412
00:28:37,659 --> 00:28:39,920
I overlooked so many things.

413
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,180
This isn't the first time I've come here.

414
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,580
But for the first time,

415
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,040
I find the scenery remarkable.

416
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,440
It's the mood.

417
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,639
You're in a good mood today.

418
00:28:52,639 --> 00:28:54,200
Indeed.

419
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,259
It's been so long since I've felt this calm.

420
00:28:58,039 --> 00:28:59,780
The sunshine is pleasant.

421
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,480
The air is fresh.

422
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,040
The scenery is beautiful.

423
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,200
I even have my loved one right here for me.

424
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:11,619
I can almost imagine our life together after retirement.

425
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:13,820
That made me happy.

426
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,259
It's too early to think about retirement life.

427
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:18,459
Get over it.

428
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:24,099
What? Don't you want to grow old together with me?

429
00:29:24,099 --> 00:29:26,680
That depends on your attitude.

430
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,900
By the way, I almost forgot.

431
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,000
My father used to tell me that removed teeth

432
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,960
should be tossed into the river, so I can make a wish.

433
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,540
When I was little...

434
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,800
What's wrong?

435
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,560
Which tooth did you remove?

436
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,039
An upper-jaw tooth.

437
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,220
Upper-jaw teeth go into the river, the lower-jaw teeth go to the roof.

438
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,580
I got it right.

439
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,380
That's right.

440
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,240
But the tooth you removed was a wisdom tooth.

441
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,100
What's wrong with it?

442
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,000
You didn't let me finish.

443
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,520
I said, when I was little my father told me

444
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,279
people tossed away their teeth to make wishes.

445
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:13,480
However, that's for...

446
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:18,640
For the teeth to grow back again.

447
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,039
I got careless.

448
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:29,660
Whatever. As long as my wish comes true, I don't mind going through the trouble again.

449
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:36,219
Don't worry.

450
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,079
I was just kidding.

451
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:39,779
I inquired the doctor.

452
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:44,560
Under normal circumstances, a wisdom tooth doesn't grow back.

453
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,760
That's good to know.

454
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,019
But what wish did you make?

455
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:54,139
Why would you go through the pain again just to realize the wish?

456
00:30:54,139 --> 00:30:56,000
I can't tell you just yet.

457
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,419
I'll tell you after I get well.

458
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,880
Very well.

459
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,980
But I think I can almost guess what it is.

460
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,480
Don't get too confident.

461
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:14,419
If I didn't have the confidence to guess, how could I be our boyfriend?

462
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,240
 What happened?

463
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:37,860
 When did you start having feelings for Xieyi?

464
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:42,719
 Uncle Shen, Xieyi is like a sister to me.

465
00:32:42,719 --> 00:32:43,799
 You scoundrel!

466
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:48,219
 If I didn't see it myself, who knows what could have happened?

467
00:32:48,219 --> 00:32:49,940
 Sorry.

468
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:53,480
 I've fallen in love with her long ago.

469
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,020
 Now that she's returned from Germany,

470
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,200
 - I'm glad— 
 - Silence!

471
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,519
 You can't have such perverted thoughts about your sister!  
 (Note: They are not blood brothers)

472
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,039
 Xieyi is still young.

473
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,000
 I don't want you to affect her study.

474
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,720
 I will never allow it!

475
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,920
 Why not?

476
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,079
 Am I not good enough for her?

477
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,459
 You've always known it.

478
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:15,359
 Xieqing likes you.

479
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:19,940
 I don't want you to affect the relationships of my daughters!

480
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:24,180
 Over the years, Xieqing stood by you and supported you.

481
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,839
 Do not let her down!

482
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,960
 Is this a gift for Xieyi?

483
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,760
 I warn you,

484
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:39,720
 as long as I live and breathe,

485
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,039
 it will never happen!

486
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,819
 I know what you mean, Uncle Shen.

487
00:33:56,819 --> 00:34:00,119
 Xieqing is the right partner for me.

488
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:01,819
 Don't worry.

489
00:34:01,819 --> 00:34:04,000
 I will take good care of her.

490
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,440
 I can let it slide this time.

491
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,920
 Tomorrow I am sending Xieyi back to her school in Germany.

492
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,360
 You must never contact her again!

493
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:32,759
 Xiey, I will make sure you stay by my side.

494
00:35:32,759 --> 00:35:36,060
 No one can stop me from getting what I want.

495
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:51,079
 Chairman Huo. You intoxicated me and changed the sum of the liquidated damage compensation.

496
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,960
 You're clearly scamming me.

497
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,000
 It's all written on the contract.

498
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,039
 How is it scamming?

499
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:03,919
 Besides, as long as your supply comes in time,

500
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,519
 the liquidated damage won't be an issue.

501
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:13,199
 But... I can't come up with the supply in time.

502
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:15,679
 That's why I've come to you for help.

503
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,259
 How is it possible?

504
00:36:19,259 --> 00:36:22,639
 Zhiwei is a massive firm.

505
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:26,419
 I can't get the supply within the time frame.

506
00:36:26,419 --> 00:36:29,360
 Chairman Huo, we've been partners for years.

507
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,320
 Could you give me a few more weeks?

508
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,919
 I assure you, I'll figure out a way.

509
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:38,500
 I beg of you.

510
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,500
 Chairman Huo.

511
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:46,719
 I beg of you!

512
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,880
 I beg of you!

513
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,159
 I beg of you!

514
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:06,279
 I want the liquidated damage to be paid in full sum.

515
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,040
 Uncle Shen!

516
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:16,019
Xieyi, I won't give up on you.

517
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:30,499

518
00:38:30,499 --> 00:38:33,360
We've upgraded the booking system.

519
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:37,339
We are making sure no one can resell their reservations.

520
00:38:37,339 --> 00:38:39,780
On the other hand, not just Yunfeng Hotel,

521
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:43,940
all the hotels under Ocean Hotel Corporation have undergone a thorough internal investigation.

522
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:46,180
The result is very apparent.

523
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,679
Great work.

524
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:51,360
But we cannot dwell on our past success.

525
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,139
After the scandal with Huo Jian,

526
00:38:54,139 --> 00:38:57,599
the market has lost its faith in Ocean Hotel.

527
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:04,339
For the time being, we need a project that will pique the market's interest.

528
00:39:04,339 --> 00:39:09,980
Next, I plan to focus our effort on the Lantian Bay Resort.

529
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:14,599
But this project is massive.

530
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:20,319
If we push it now, we have to mortgage all the assets Ocean Hotel has.

531
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,480
High investment brings high returns.

532
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,719
I also think Lantian Bay resort

533
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:31,159
will become a necessary step for the company to make a comeback.

534
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:35,440
I've read the development proposal written by Huo Jian.

535
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:40,920
In regard to the project cost, many corners were cut.

536
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,719
Most importantly, he even planned to save the cost of digging underground water

537
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:47,660
by using artificial hot water as hot springs.

538
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:51,459
He only wanted to fill his own pocket and disregard the company's reputation.

539
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:54,400
Listen up.

540
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,119
We need to make a profit when we run a business.

541
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,960
But we must never cut corners and lie to the consumers.

542
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:04,999
Otherwise, we'll end up just like Huo Jian.

543
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:12,639
I'll redo the development proposal.

544
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:14,899
We'll discuss it further when it's done.

545
00:40:14,899 --> 00:40:16,660
Dismissed.

546
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:28,399
Zeliang. What will you do with Huo Jian's proposal?

547
00:40:28,399 --> 00:40:30,299
I'll keep it for now.

548
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,539
It's worth keeping for reference.

549
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:40,699
As you mentioned, the proposal involves cutting a lot of corners to reduce the project cost.

550
00:40:40,699 --> 00:40:44,659
Make sure you keep it well.

551
00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:49,280
If it got leaked and raised questions, we'd be in trouble.

552
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:52,519
Don't worry about it.

553
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:54,239
I'll keep it inside my home.

554
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:58,299
As soon as I come up with a new proposal, I'll dispose of it immediately.

555
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:03,119
- Lawyer Xie. 
 - Director Shi.

556
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,159
Sorry for the long wait.

557
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:06,519
It's all right.

558
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:10,280
I've settled all the contracts that involved legal disputes.

559
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,100
I brought them here for you.

560
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,059
That was fast.

561
00:41:13,059 --> 00:41:16,159
I always finish your order as fast as I can.

562
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,440
An ace lawyer indeed.

563
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,380
You are very efficient.

564
00:41:24,998 --> 00:41:26,339
- What's wrong? 
 - It's nothing.

565
00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:32,020
I think you've become the vying person you were before.

566
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,539
Did you heed my advice?

567
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,380
Speaking of that, I should thank you for the pointer.

568
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:44,199
I suggest Chairman Li focus our efforts on the Lantian Bay Resort.

569
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:47,499
As it turned out, he had the same idea.

570
00:41:47,499 --> 00:41:49,760
We've just decided in the meeting.

571
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,939
I might be even busier than ever.

572
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,920
Since you're already here, stay for a while.

573
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,320
You helped me a great deal.

574
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,299
Let me treat you to lunch.

575
00:41:59,299 --> 00:42:00,400
Sorry, Director Shi.

576
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,359
I must visit Xieqing at the hospital.

577
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:06,000
Xieyi just extracted her wisdom tooth. So she won't make it.

578
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,670
I must keep Xieqing company.

579
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:11,979
Why would Su Xieyi visit Xieqing?

580
00:42:11,979 --> 00:42:14,780
What's their relationship?

581
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,740
I don't think it's a secret anymore.

582
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,820
Xieqing is Xieyi's older sister.

583
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:23,379
Actually, Xieyi is Uncle Shen's biological daughter.

584
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:26,139
What?

585
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,750
♫  I need you, I love you  ♫

586

♫  I'll brave the waves for you  ♫

587
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:40,250
♫  You don't have to be brave all the time  ♫
