The result from your
Housekeeping Department

26
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,760
is worse than lackluster.

27
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,590
How am I supposed to explain this
to the shareholders?

28

I've been

But you have learned nothing

What's wrong with you people?

Now, you're

40
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,960
telling me there's someone in my room?

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,710
It was outrageous!

42
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,760
I was sleeping inside my room

43
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,880
when someone came knocking on the door.

44
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,510
I opened up

45
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,840

Stay away from alcohol and games.

63
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,400
Now, you can't even catch

I'm fine.

Uncle.

71
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,630
Since you're in the mood
for a game today,

72
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,030
I can't let myself be the downer.

73

Uncle, don't worry. I'll be fine.

Mr. Lin,

77
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,480
how did it go?

78
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,510
Come to my office.

79
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,000
I've told you

80
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,440
we are in peak season.

81
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,360
I told you to reserve

82
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,400
all the rooms.

83
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,440
Why did you allow online booking?

84
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,320
But...

85
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:47,840
I was worried

86
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,880
if the rooms of an entire floor

87
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,880
weren't available to be booked online,

88
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,710
it'd be too suspicious.

89
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,550
What are you worried about?

90
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,360
I'm in charge of this matter.

91
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,480
Do you know how much money

92
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,400
a room can make during

93
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,480
the entire peak season?

94
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,030
Yes.

95
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,670
So, what should we do next?

96
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,800
I don't have too big of an issue.

97
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,070
But the customer who booked a room

98
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,760
from our website didn't get his room,

99
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,440
so he's very upset right now.

100
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,550
I'll apologize to the customer later.

101
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,360
I'll be more careful next time.

102
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,320
I was told Li

103
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,550
would be back soon.

104
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,110
You need to be more careful.

105
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,400
I will.

106
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,510
Mr. Li,

107
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,840
let's call it a day.

Ze Liang.

109
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,030
You might think my way is too stern,

110
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,960
but it wasn't easy for your father

111
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:45,920
to build this company.

112
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,710
It took him over 20 years to nurture

113
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,710
Ocean Hotel from a no-name company

114
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,320
to the giant firm it is today.

115
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,550
So remember,

116
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,480
Ocean Hotel belongs to the Li family,

117
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,630
not the Huo family.

118
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,000
I am merely

119
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,480
a steward taking care of it.

120
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,000
This responsibility

121
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,960
will eventually become yours to bear.

122
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,800
You're right, Uncle.

123
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,520
Mr. Huo,

124
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,270
we need your signature
for this document.

125
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,800
Clean up the mess.

126
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,310
Come with me to the headquarters.

127
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:37,880
Okay.

128
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,640
Return to your work

129
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,760
and delete

130
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,600
all the contact records

131
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,470
and documents.

132
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,310
Yes.

133
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,030
Go on.

134
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,880
Are you looking for someone?

135
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,070
Hello, I'm here for the interview,

136
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,350
but I can't seem to find my way there.

137
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,230
Is this the place?

138

(Su Xie Yi)

139
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,640
Follow this path and turn left
at the pantry.

140
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:56,640
Then, go to the second floor.

141
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,270
Thanks.

142

(Ocean Hotel Corporation)

143
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,230
May I take a seat here?

144
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,190
Welcome, Mr. Huo.

00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,150
Mr. Huo.

146

You're finally back.

147
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,520
Mr. Lin,

148
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,070
Li Ze Liang

149
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,000
has returned to our company.

150
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,310
Mr. Huo,

151
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,800
I assure you

152
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,310
I will keep an eye

153
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,430
on that boy.

154
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,520
You'll

155
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,960
get all the updates firsthand.

156
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,880
From what I heard,

157
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,760
the booking system of our hotel has run

158
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,640
into some issues.

159
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,070
Are you aware of the matter?

160
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,840
I'm resolving it as we speak.

161
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,230
Why do you look so nervous?

162
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,520
Just make sure you carry out

163
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,720
my orders.

164
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,720
As for the booking system,

165
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,960
take your time with it.

166
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,520
I understand.

167
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,390
Go on.

168
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:06,640
Yes.

169
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,840
Why do you choose to bring

170
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,800
that kid from the Li family back now?

171
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,760
A worthless prince is still
a prince nonetheless.

172
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,150
Many of the shareholders

173
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,520
are elders of the Li family.

174
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,640
As soon as they learned

175
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,110
Li Ze Liang's condition had improved,

176
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,000
they've been asking

177
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,560
for him to come back to work.

178
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,600
I was told they planned

179
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,600
to leave Yunfeng in his care.

180
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:49,760
Mr. Li.

181
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,110
This is the Housekeeping Department's

182
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,680
sales report for the past six months.

183
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,310
You have just returned to work,

184
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,640
so it's better to have a grasp
of the company.

185
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,150
Leave it on the desk.

186
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,230
I'll read it later.

187
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,430
I was told the Housekeeping Department

188
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,430
had received many complaints.

189
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,070
What is going on?

190
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,720
It's said that the booking system

191
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,600
ran into some problems.

192
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,920
But it could also be some errors
from the Housekeeping Department.

193
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,310
It could also be

194
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,150
some errors from
the Networking Department.

195
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,150
Is that so?

196
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,960
Are the problems resolved?

197
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,720
We've reported it

198
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,070
to Mr. Huo.

199
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,800
If there's nothing,
I should get back to my work.

200
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,070
(Sales Report of
the Housekeeping Department)

201
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,640
Yunfeng Hotel was built

202
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,150
on the foundation of Zhiwei Building

203
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,470
and expanded upon it.

204
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,110
Li Ze Liang has been in charge

205
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,110
of the Zhiwei Building project.

206
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,560
It's normal if people

207
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,920
view it that way.

208
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,760
If you didn't make him hand over

209
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,560
the project years ago,

210
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,600
Yunfeng Hotel wouldn't even exist.

211
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,310
I've told you time and time again.

212
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,800
Do not bring up the past.

213
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,840
I'm doing this

214
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,720
because I have my reasons.

215
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,800
I brought Li Ze Liang back

216
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,920
and assign him a position in the company

217
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,920
because I want those elders

218
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,230
to shut up.

219
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,880
Furthermore,

220
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,560
putting him where I can see him

221
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,350
makes our work a lot easier.

222
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,000
You're right.

Your new prescription is ready.

I can go get it anytime.

240
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,560
He advised you to have

241

one or two massages every week.

242

Yes.

What do you mean?

336

Do you like camping?

338

Have you watched a sunrise
from the mountaintop?

339
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,270
Watching a sunrise is too childish.

340
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,680
It's not my cup of tea.

341
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:12,270
It's more practical
to just sleep soundly in bed.

342
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,880
Camping is out of the question.

343

Is this

345
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,000
how you pick up girls?

346
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,430
You can at least be more creative.

347
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,350
Take off your clothes.

348
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,070
I need to borrow it.

349
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:48,960
Thanks.

350
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,600
(Methylcobalamin tablets)

351
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:29,880
Are you

352
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,030
going to watch me get changed?

353
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,560
Sorry.

354
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,310
I'll pay for your shirt.

355
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,270
It's 85, 62, and 86.

356
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,390
What is that?

357
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:00,960
It's my measurements.

358
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,520
Aren't you buying me a new shirt?

359
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,640
Well...

360
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,840
I saw a bottle of pills

361
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,680
inside the car.

362
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,920
Are you not feeling well?

363
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:15,600
Yes.

364
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,150
I have dissociative amnesia.

365
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,190
I ran into some bad situations
a few years ago.

366
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:20,800
I'm still recovering.

367
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,760
How are you doing?

368
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,000
There are many things

369
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,150
I can't remember.

370
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,230
But after giving it some thought,

371
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,230
I forgot a lot of unpleasant memories

372
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,110
as well.

373
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,640
That makes me feel much better.

374
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:49,920
Here.

375
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,880
I doubt they are coming back.

376
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,350
What? Feeling attached to this place?

377
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,760
Seeing you're a handsome one,

378
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,310
I could give you

379
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,600
a free ride home.

380
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:15,960
Never mind.

381
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,720
This is my business card.

382
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,070
Thank you for helping out just now.

383
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:25,870
(Li Ze Liang)

384
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,030
Ocean Hotel?

385
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,150
What's wrong?

386
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,680
I majored in hotel management.

387
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,150
Ocean Hotel is the first choice

388
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,350
of my job hunting.

389
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,110
It's the Number One.

390
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,640
Consider this

391
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,110
an IOU you gave me.

392
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:42,720
Wait.

393
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,800
May I know your name?

394
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,390
Su Xie Yi.

395
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,820
(Wild Hog)

396
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,800
Let go!

397
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,190
Don't let go!

398
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:26,880
Hang on tight.

399
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,600
Don't be afraid.

400
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:30,920
I'll pull you up.

401
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,190
Hang in there.

402
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,110
One,

403
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,600
two,

404
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,520
three.

405
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,150
Hurry up!

406
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:54,650
(Rock climbing peak)

407
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,680
Can you read this?

408
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,880
It says "Rock climbing peak."

409
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,960
This is the famous rock-climbing spot

410
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,110
for the enthusiasts.

411
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,110
Were you

412
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,110
out of your mind?

413
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,600
Why did you poke around with the stick?

414
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,430
Who would poke a man

415
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,640
off the cliff with a stick?

416
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,350
Speaking of yourself.

417
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,800
Look over here.

418
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,190
What does it say?

419
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:13,800
(Beware of wild hogs)

420
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,520
"Beware of wild hogs."

421
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,430
Is there some kind of fetish among

422
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,600
the rock-climbing enthusiasts?

423
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,000
Do you

424
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,350
love a spot where wild hogs are around?

425
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,520
You mistook me for a wild hog?

426
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,800
What's wrong?

427
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,600
It's nothing.

428
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,110
I get a toothache when I get mad.

429
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,150
I have some painkillers.

430
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:39,960
You can have some.

431
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,350
Never mind.

432
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,270
It'll get better in a while.

433
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,230
Are you sure?

434
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,600
Well...

435
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,190
Although it was your fault

436
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,390
for almost dragging me down

437
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,110
from the cliff,

438
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,230
I poked you with the stick.

439
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:59,640
So, we are even now.

440
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,470
We should steer clear of each other
from now on.

441
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,230
Steering clear of each other?

442
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,030
What's wrong?

443
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,800
There is something

444
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,430
under the blanket.

445
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,270
Stay still.

446
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,430
Be careful.

447
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,880
It could be a rat.

448
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,600
It's not a rat.

449
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,190
It's a small hedgehog.

450
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,000
See?

451
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,030
Isn't it cute?

452
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,520
A hedgehog!

453
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,000
It's so adorable!

454
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,270
Don't touch it!

455
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:56,960
Does it hurt?

456
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,230
I'm all right.

457
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,920
Put a band-aid on it.

458
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,350
Disinfect it.

459
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:03,720
Come on.

460
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,150
It's done.

461
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:22,640
Thanks.

462
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,470
Don't mention it.

463
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,070
Little hedgehog,

464
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,310
you're so cute.

465
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,030
You look like a spiky little ball.

466
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,110
Why are you here

467
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:36,840
all by yourself?

468
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,230
Why are you here camping by yourself?

469
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,150
I just came back to China,

470
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,110
so I don't have many friends.

471
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,600
Are you cold?

472
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,640
The night can be freezing up here.

473
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:49,760
Maybe you could

474
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,520
stay with me.

475
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,880
Maybe I could keep your company.

476
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,150
Don't get me wrong.

477
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,520
You just mentioned

478
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,030
there were a lot of wild hogs,

479
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,150
dingos,

480
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,110
and even snakes in the area.

481
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,600
Of course,

482
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,230
I hope we're safe here.

483
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,310
It's up to you.

484
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,640
See you.

485
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,430
Do you know how to shoot a star trail?

486
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,560
Certainly.

487
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,760
Allow me to introduce myself.

488
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,150
I'm Li Ze Liang.

489
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,190
What about you?

490
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,310
You can call me Yi.

491
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,390
Su Xie Yi...

492
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,000
Yi...

493
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,190
Hello?

494
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:14,960
Hello?

495
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,150
Madam?

496
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,070
Where are you?

497
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,070
Are you coming back or not?

498
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,000
Don't worry,

499
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:21,600
I'll wire you the payment.

500

(Ocean Hotel)

503
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,960
Hello? Mr. Gong?

504
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:54,110
Hello? Your father is in trouble!

505
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,600
I didn't catch that.

506
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,760
Your father is in trouble!

507
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,150
Where is he now?

508
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,760
At Huo Jian's place!

509
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,840
(The patient has been diagnosed
with dissociative amnesia.)

510
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,600
(She will selectively)

511
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,310
(forget certain parts of her life.)

512
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,760
During her rehab,

513
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,230
the family must pay close attention

514
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,390
to her mental health.

515
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,430
(Li Ze Liang.)

516
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,230
(Which one)

517
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,600
(is the real you?)

518
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,340
(Li Ze Liang.)

519
