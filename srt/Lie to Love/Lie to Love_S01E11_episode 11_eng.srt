♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

3
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:33,510
♫  Still haunts me now and then in quiet nights  ♫

♫  And turn to face all the long lost times  ♫

20
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:19,019
As they say, fate brings two people together.

21
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:23,720
Miss A'Chu. Today, we're seated here in the same car.

22
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,339
That shows that we were brought together by fate.

23
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,519
Brother Ji, isn't this a private car booked specially for me?

24
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,499
Why is he here?

25
00:02:33,499 --> 00:02:34,659
I'm sorry, Director Shi.

26
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:38,879
We booked a private car for Mr. Oscar a well. But he requested this.

27
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,840
Why waste the money?

28
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,919
I'm saving money for your company.

29
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:45,260
Money isn't a problem for us.

30
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,178
You're right.

31
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,359
Brother Ji, why is your boss so stingy?

32
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:55,560
He owns a big company, but sent such a small car to pick Director Shi up.

33
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,860
There's no place for my Simba.

34
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,240
Actually, you can just put Simba in the trunk.

35
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,840
No way.

36
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,260
It has claustrophobia.

37
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:14,180
Chu Chu, do you feel carsick?

38
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,599
Why aren't you talking?

39
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:19,479
I have some really good medications for motion sickness with me.

40
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,520
Would you like to try it?

41
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,460
I won't feel carsick if you sit in the front.

42
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,800
I can't do that.

43
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,339
I'll get dizzy if I sit in the front.

44
00:03:28,339 --> 00:03:30,020
Look.

45
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:34,319
Do all bosses like to sit in the back?

46
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,759
Are all rock and roll singers this chatty?

47
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:39,300
No. Not me.

48
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,520
Are you sure you're all right?

49
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,639
Did anyone upset you?

50
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,860
I'm here for work, not for vacation.

51
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,660
You know what? I'm here for work too.

52
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,979
I'm the guest performer.

53
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:10,979
You? Are you kidding me?

54
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:13,139
What about me?

55
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:14,460
Look, Director Shi.

56
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,700
Does your company not perform a background check on your clients?

57
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,040
Don't you know that the Romans love rock music?

58
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,959
I can sing and play any songs that they like.

59
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:32,439
Be it rock, lyrical, jazz, or blues, I know it all.

60
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,899
I'm like a walking jukebox.

61
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,559
Chuchu, what kind of music do you like to listen to?

62
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,160
Crosstalk?

63
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,299
Hou Xiaodong!

64
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:50,420
Keep talking nonsense, and I'll kick you out of the car now.

65
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,300
Director Ji, please drive faster. Thank you.

Thank you for your hard work.

89
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,319
Director Li has been singing your praises.

90
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,640
Well, if Director Li has any compliments, he can say it right to my face.

I'm done singing. Is there no applause for me?

Let's take a break.

93
00:06:14,619 --> 00:06:16,099
My dear fan.

94
00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:19,519
If I guess it correctly, you must be Miss Su Xieyi, right?

95
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:25,279
If I guess it correctly, you're Oscar, the talented rock singer, right?

96
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,739
You have good taste.

97
00:06:26,739 --> 00:06:31,219
So I'm going to dedicate the next song to my only fan here,

98
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:32,920
Miss Su Xieyi.

99
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,900
Although the song is a little cheesy, your boyfriend is a big fan of it.

100
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:42,320
- Knock it off. 
 - When did you start listening to cheesy songs?

101
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,860
Chuchu. I bet you don't know.

102
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,140
His Muse, the Goddess, dedicated this song to him.

103
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,800
Back then, he even listened to hard rock songs with us.

104
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,279
But he had a sudden change in personality,

105
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,720
and started playing this song every day that I even know how to play it.

106
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,419
Muse, the Goddess?

107
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:00,519
Who's that?

108
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,940
He stayed tight-lipped.

109
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,079
For a very long time, I tried to worm it out of him, but I got nothing.

110
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:07,199
Miss Su. Don't take it to heart.

111
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,800
I promise A'Liang has only one ex, and it was Platonic.

112
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,820
Why would I?

113
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,639
Everyone has an ex.

These three are medications for toothache. Which would you like?

I'll take all three. Please wrap them up for me.

Why are you here?

153
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,179
For the official reason, as a partner of Ocean, I've been formally invited.

154
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:46,220
So there's a personal reason?

155
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,780
I'm worried about you coming here alone to investigate Chen Hengsheng.

Having a toothache again?

157
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:02,739
This is German medicine. It's not available in the country.

158
00:11:02,739 --> 00:11:05,634
I asked someone to bring it from Germany.

159
00:11:05,634 --> 00:11:08,759
- Well, thank you. 
 - Don't just talk. Here.

160
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:11,239
Take it now.

161
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,559
How are you lately?

162
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:20,600
Don't worry. There has been some progress.

163
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,200
What progress?

164
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,179
Why are the hotel staff so rude?

165
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,420
I'm already out of inspiration and they keep knocking on my door.

166
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:52,599
It's you, indeed.

167
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,960
Why are you playing the guitar during the day?

168
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,459
It'll affect others at work. Don't you know that?

169
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,799
Your hotel has such poor soundproofing?

170
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,679
I should write a complaint letter.

171
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,200
You were playing it on the balcony!

172
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:05,240
I get it now.

173
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,900
My beautiful piano music piece attracted you here.

174
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,600
Are you out of your mind? I'm warning you. Stop playing it.

175
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,279
Li Zeliang once said that fate may have been destined,

176
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,659
but I can measure it.

177
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,039
What are you talking about?

178
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,750
I have an app here.

179
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,579
Just insert yours and Li Zeliang's birthdates and zodiac signs,

180
00:13:30,579 --> 00:13:35,040
I'll be able to get your fate index right away.

181
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,081
It's a hoax. I don't believe in such a thing.

182
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:40,619
So high!

183
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,200
Let me take a screenshot.

184
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,580
That's so high.

185
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,399
So, so high.

186
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,099
Show me.

187
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,539
I can't give it to you for free.

188
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,399
Tell me. How are you going to bribe me?

189
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,059
Give me your phone.

190
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:07,539
What do I get?

191
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:10,760
Or I'll take a screenshot at once and post it on Moments.

192
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,799
I hate it the most when people threaten me.

193
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,780
- Give it to me! 
 - I'm not afraid of you!

194
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,600
- I won't give it to you. Not giving it to you. 
 - Give it to me!

195
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,939
- Come and get me. Come and get me. 
 - Give me the phone!

196
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:17,720
I'm not. Come on.

197
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,033
- Come on. 
 - Give it to me!

198
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:20,279
- Give me the phone! 
 - Can you get it?

199
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,600
- Give it to me!
- Can you reach it?

200
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,000
- Can you reach it? 
 - Give it to me.

201
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:39,920
It's fine. Liang's room is right below mine.

202
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,539
I'll retrieve it once he comes back.

203
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:44,339
You're going now.

204
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:48,339
Sir, here's your steak. Enjoy.

205
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:50,360
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

206
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,619
So Li Zeliang gave me his word that if I helped him with this auction,

207
00:14:59,619 --> 00:15:03,039
he would give me the evidence of Chen Hengsheng's wrongdoing.

208
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:07,022
As long as we can get Chen Hesheng, there's no need to worry about finding dirt on Huo Jian.

209
00:15:07,022 --> 00:15:09,900
- Li Zeliang promised to help you? 
 - That's right.

210
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,400
And you believe him?

211
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,540
I believe him.

212
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,759
Eat up, or the food will turn cold.

213
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,259
Okay.

214
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,099
Lawyer Xie, why didn't you tell me that you were coming?

215
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,759
Why are you here?

216
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:36,280
What's the matter? Am I interrupting?

217
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,360
No.

218
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,399
Director Li, what would you like to have?

219
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:41,119
Excuse me.

220
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,539
Lawyer Xie, what are you having?

221
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:46,279
Well, Xieyi ordered this specially for me.

222
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,379
It's right up my alley.

223
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,659
Director Li, what would you like to order?

224
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:52,359
It's fine.

225
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:55,979
I'll share with Xieyi.

226
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:17,599
Xieyi, how many times have I told you not to take cold drinks if you have a toothache?

227
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,399
What if it hurts even more?

228
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:21,539
Don't take cold drinks anymore.

229
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,919
Well, Lawyer Xie, did you come to Yunfeng for business or pleasure?

230
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:36,040
I'm representing Hengye Bank to handle any legal affairs related to the auction,

231
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,779
and become a courier guy for Xieyi.

232
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,680
What's that?

233
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,000
This is a special medicine for toothache.

234
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,879
I used to take it when I was in Germany.

235
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,619
Brother Minghao asked a friend to bring it back from abroad.

236
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,000
- What's that? 
 - Nothing.

237
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,039
Helping a friend to deliver it.

238
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:06,760
Xieyi, go back to your room first.

239
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,179
I have something to discuss in private with Lawyer Xie.

240
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,719
All right.

241
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,400
Brother Minghao, I'll get going then.

242
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,400
Rest well.

243
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,900
Xieyi.

244
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,220
Three times a day. Don't forget.

245
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,800
Okay.

246
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,199
Xieyi.

247
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,119
Wait for me in your room.

248
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:38,040
I'll be back soon.

249
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,359
Go on.

250
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,839
Director Li, feel free to ask me anything.

251
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:57,319
Don't stand on ceremony. No consulting charges.

252
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:02,340
Lawyer Xie, your concerns for Xieyi seem a little out of line.

253
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,039
Xieyi and I are families.

254
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:07,540
Xieyi was previously attacked, and the perpetrator is still at large.

255
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:12,340
So It sets my mind at rest to be close to Xieyi.

256
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,100
I've also said it before.

257
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,480
The person you should be concerned about is Xieqing.

258
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,919
As for Xieyi, I'll take care of her.

259
00:18:20,739 --> 00:18:24,640
This is Xieyi's first time going on a long business trip, and it's a tough job.

260
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,920
Indeed, she needs someone to look after her.

261
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:32,020
But you might not be the person who knows her best.

262
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:37,480
After all, I've kept her company in the last two years.

263
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,480
I know all about her preferences.

264
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,960
Like, the kind of medicine that works best when she has a toothache.

265
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,660
Besides, do you really believe that you're capable of taking better care of her than me?

266
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,819
I'm warning you.

267
00:18:55,819 --> 00:18:58,039
Don't affect her at work.

268
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:02,760
Otherwise, I'll have to evict you.

269
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,560
I will.

270
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,800
You forgot something.

271
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,260
Wait, Director Shi. Are we going to enter A'Liang's room just like that?

272
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,780
I don't think it's a good idea.

273
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:31,920
Cut the crap. It's all because you dropped your phone on his balcony.

274
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,219
What do we do if he's back now?

275
00:19:33,219 --> 00:19:35,299
What are the odds of that?

276
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,000
Su Xieyi.

277
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,640
Why are you back this late?

278
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,580
Didn't I tell you to get back to your room early?

279
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,239
I went to the kiosk downstairs and bought a bottle of water.

280
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:52,080
Didn't I tell you not to take cold drinks? What? No more toothache?

281
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,100
I just took my medicine.

282
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,819
Brother Minghao gave it to me. Have you forgotten?

283
00:19:57,259 --> 00:19:59,279
Su Xieyi.

284
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:01,880
Do you know what's your status now?

285
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,699
How can you casually go out and have a meal with another man? Is that appropriate?

286
00:20:05,699 --> 00:20:08,160
First, I did it openly.

287
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,520
Second, since Brother Minghao is here, what's wrong if I eat with him?

288
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,259
It's perfectly fine.

289
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:16,100
Besides, what's my status?

290
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,799
Excuse me.

291
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,139
We're only partners.

292
00:20:20,139 --> 00:20:24,219
 Do you expect me to stick with you, all the time and have no personal space?

293
00:20:24,219 --> 00:20:25,859
 Su Xieyi.

294
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,160
Are you feeling abused?

295
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,240
What's the matter?

296
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,000
Do you want the whole world to know that we're only putting up a show?

297
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,420
I'm talking to you. What are you looking at?

298
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,060
A'Liang, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do this.

299
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,940
I came to retrieve my phone.

300
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:07,370
I don't want a fourth person to know about this.

301
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:13,440
Excuse me.

302
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,200
I came with him to retrieve his phone.

303
00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:26,210
I promise, there wont be a fifth person who knows about this.

304
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,700
Miss Su, are you happy now?

305
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,940
Now that Oscar knows, the whole world will know.

306
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,700

307
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,890
 What's that? Nothing.

308
00:22:05,899 --> 00:22:07,770
 Helping a friend to deliver it.

309
00:22:19,979 --> 00:22:22,340
So it's all just a pretense?

310
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,699
A'Yan, you're awake. I ordered breakfast, come and have some.

311
00:22:42,699 --> 00:22:45,239
Miss Su, if no one's here,

312
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:48,179
Just call me Mr. Li.

313
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:50,060
Sure, Mr. Li.

314
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,640
Today is a sunny day, I hope you'll be in a good mood.

315
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,259
Please enjoy your breakfast.

316
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,580
I'm not eating. You enjoy it. I'm going to get changed.

317
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,310
Let's eat together!

318
00:23:03,459 --> 00:23:05,300
Miss Su, there's no need to take such, drastic action.

319
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,799
Listen up, you were right. We don't need for to stick together.

320
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:12,879
Since we're busy, it's more efficient to work separately.

321
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:18,480
He sure is green with envy.

322
00:23:36,859 --> 00:23:38,919
It's been a while, Mr. Roman.

323
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:41,710
That's right. I've been looking forward to this.

324
00:23:42,639 --> 00:23:45,319
Miss Su, the last few days must have been hard for you.

325
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:49,740
Not at all. It's my honor to take part in such a high-profile auction.

326
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:54,119
Miss Su, my wife has been thinking about the cocktails that you made.

327
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:58,759
I saw you promise to make her some nice cocktails.

328
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:01,899
No problem. If you feel like drinking, feel free to come to me.

329
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:03,260
Sure.

330
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,880
Mr. Roman, Director Shi is preparing for the dinner tonight.

331
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,480
Well, good wine is a must.

332
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,900
I promise that you and your wife will have a good time.

333
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:16,639
Allow me to introduce Mr. Chen Hengsheng, the general manager of Yunfeng Hotel.

334
00:24:16,639 --> 00:24:18,850
- Nice to meet you. 
 - Welcome.

335
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,000
General Manager Chen.

336
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,720
Mr. and Mrs. Roman are tired after their long trip.

337
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,119
Take them to rest.

338
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:26,080
See you at dinner.

339
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,079
Sounds good, see you then.

340
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:30,919
Their room is ready. This way, please.

341
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:32,239
Here.

342
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,780
I've been hearing good news the past few days.

343
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:46,540
Well done.

344
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,179
Thank you for your compliment, Uncle.

345
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:52,979
However, don't expect me to ever let my guard down.

346
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,210
See you tonight.

347
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,839
Stop looking already.

348
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:10,200
You... Get the guest registration counter set up.

349
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,499
It's done.

350
00:25:11,499 --> 00:25:13,160
Set up the welcome area then.

351
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,739
It's done.

352
00:25:14,739 --> 00:25:17,400
Then go and find something else to do.

353
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,540
Like?

354
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,160
Figure it out yourself.

355
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,772
What about you?

356
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:25,410
I'll attend to some other matters.

357
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,680
This way, please, Chairman Huo.

358
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:48,540
Chairman Huo, you're finally here.

359
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:52,440
The auction is about to begin. What's the next step?

360
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,440
What, afraid you might lose your position?

361
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,519
I'm worried about you.

362
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:01,860
No matter what, Li Zeliang is still Mr. Li Senior's son.

363
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,340
He keeps such a high profile.

364
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:06,520
What if he manages to pull this off? That will—

365
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,620
That will pose a threat to my position.

366
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,920
Of course.

367
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,860
They elect the chairman's position every three years.

368
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,640
The re-election is drawing near.

369
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,279
It's obvious that he's going to make an appearance.

370
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,440
Are you afraid  no one will to protect you, once I'm removed from the position?

371
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,019
Well, you're my boss.

372
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,200
This kid is really something.

373
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,640
I didn't expect him to be able to get this auction event.

374
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,359
Since he wants to fire the first shot, let it blow up in his face.

375
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:39,440
That's what I thought as well.

376
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,879
The problem is if we want to mess up Li Zeliang's auction...

377
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,719
and not to draw suspicion to ourselves... that's going to be really tricky.

378
00:26:48,719 --> 00:26:50,459
Indeed.

379
00:26:50,459 --> 00:26:55,639
But right now, I have an extra pawn.

380
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:58,359
Su Xieyi.

381
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:01,139
Do you know who her father is?

382
00:27:01,139 --> 00:27:03,239
No.

383
00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:05,540
Shen Zhihong.

384
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,860
Su Xieyi is Shen Zhihong's daughter?

385
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,100
That doesn't make sense.

386
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,160
Why would she be with Li Zeliang then?

387
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,000
These two incidents, the bankruptcy of Zhiwei Corporation,

388
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,200
and Shen Zhihong's suicide, are connected to Ocean.

389
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,400
In other words, Ocean is her enemy.

390
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,960
That's right,

391
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,950
and now, she's the girlfriend of her enemy.

392
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,880
Interesting, isn't it?

393
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,319
So she gets close to Li Zeliang

394
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,680
for revenge.

395
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,070
It doesn't matter what she thinks.

396
00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:00,079
What matters is what came to your mind when you learned of her real identity.

397
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:02,060
Yi Fei would think the same.

398
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:07,340
So would everyone else when they came to learn of her real identity.

399
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:15,480
So you're saying that we have to expose Su Xieyi's identity?

400
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,240
But we need an opportunity to pull that off.

401
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,079
Mrs. Roman is a big fan of the cocktails that Su Xieyi makes.

402
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:25,359
What's going to happen if she gets poisoned

403
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:29,100
after drinking the cocktail that Su Xieyi makes?

404
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,119
That goes without saying. It'll be a big scandal.

405
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:35,228
Also, not only will it ruin Li Zeliang's auction,

406
00:28:35,229 --> 00:28:38,359
the suspicion will fall upon Su Xieyi.

407
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:42,559
Mrs. Roman loves to drink the Mojito and Gin and Tonic that Su Xieyi makes.

408
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,720
Whatever method of preparation,

409
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,280
these two cocktails will be garnished with a slice of green lime.

410
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:50,979
You know what to do, right?

411
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,159
I don't want anyone to know about this.

412
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:03,359
See to it yourself.

413
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,320
Okay.

414
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:20,200
So? How are you enjoying your time here?

415
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:24,910
All thanks to you for looking out for me.

416
00:29:26,699 --> 00:29:29,070
After you get things done,

417
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:34,319
this position will forever be yours.

418
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:39,359
Your son's career will be smooth sailing as well.

419
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:45,359
I understand.

420
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,799
- Take care. 
 - Okay.

421
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:51,640
Okay.

422
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,939
- Director Li, you're here. 
 - Mr. He.

423
00:29:52,939 --> 00:29:55,980
- It's been a while. Welcome to the auction reception. 
 - Sure.

424
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,960
- Mr. Thomson. 
 - Hi, Mr. Li.

425
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,379
Hi, it's been a while.

426
00:29:59,379 --> 00:30:01,000
- Hi. 
 - Hi.

427
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,720
This is my wife, Demi.

428
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,000
This is my girlfriend, Miss Su Xieyi.

429
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,279
Hi.

430
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:10,559
Mr. Miller.

431
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,240
It's been a while.

432
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,440
Long time no see you.

433
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,379
Welcome to the auction reception.

434
00:30:16,379 --> 00:30:20,799
- This is? 
 - This is my girlfriend, Miss Su Xieyi.

435
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,680
Hi.

436
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,319
All right, Mr. Li. That should be enough.

437
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:27,879
Didn't you say it would be more efficient to work separately?

438
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:31,820
What? No more toothache?

439
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,120
The special medicine sure works wonders.

440
00:30:35,499 --> 00:30:37,359
That's right. I woke up this morning,

441
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:39,179
and saw a few boxes of medications in the living room.

442
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:41,359
So I gave it a try.

443
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:45,499
It actually worked. I wonder who bought them.

444
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,140
Hi, Mr. Miller.

445
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,380
We just passed by him.

446
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,699
Hi, Mr. Thomson.

447
00:30:52,699 --> 00:30:55,340
We passed by him a while ago.

448
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:59,019
Hi, Sir.

449
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,000
- This way, please. 
 - Mr. Roman.

450
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,759
Director Li.

451
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:35,180
- Good evening. 
 - Good evening.

452
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,659
What a lively evening.

453
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:40,400
It looks like this auction will surely be a success.

454
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,300
All thanks to you for your great support.

455
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,359
Thank you. Keep it up.

456
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:48,699
Mr. Roman. Let's have a drink to celebrate it.

457
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:50,220
Sure.

458
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,000
I'm sorry. Mrs. Roman, I've forgotten.

459
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
- What's wrong? 
 - How can you drink such wine?

460
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,330
If my memory serves me right,

461
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:05,410
someone still owes Mrs. Roman a glass of cocktail. Right?

462
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:09,159
That's right. Mrs. Roman, I'll prepare it for you in a short while.

463
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:11,680
No rush.

464
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:13,919
Mr. Roman.

465
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,279
On behalf of Yunfeng Hotel, a subsidiary of Ocean Group,

466
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:21,119
here are my best wishes in advance that the auction will be a great success.

467
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:22,540
Great.

468
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,040
May the auction be a great success.

469
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:33,899
Get moving.

470
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:36,356
Hurry up. There's no more food out there.

471
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,970
 Serve the dish.

472
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,400
Why haven't you sent the green limes over?

473
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:52,201
I'm on it now.

474
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,400
Hold on.

475
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,440
Later, remember to tell the bartender

476
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,200
that there is a problem with the taste of this batch of green limes.

477
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,319
So it can only be used for garnishing,

478
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:12,720
not for guests so as not to affect our reputation.

479
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,840
- All right. 
 - Get to it now.

480
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,699
Director Shi.

481
00:33:23,699 --> 00:33:25,199
Hi.

482
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,720
I've been observing them all day.

483
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:41,839
Do you notice that Liang does give Miss Su special treatment?

484
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:45,039
Didn't you hear them yesterday?

485
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,100
They were saying the opposite.

486
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,119
Look at them walking arm in arm.

487
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:51,540
Something is going on.

488
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,240
What do you know?

489
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:55,419
I do.

490
00:33:55,419 --> 00:33:57,759
Of course, I know. I'm a man.

491
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:00,440
A man will surely understand another man.

492
00:34:00,448 --> 00:34:03,827
What kind of man drinks milk every day?

493
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:08,941
Let me reiterate it again.

494
00:34:08,941 --> 00:34:11,401
This is milk tea.

495
00:34:11,401 --> 00:34:13,800
Zeliang, I'll leave you be.

496
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,719
I'll prepare the cocktail for Mrs. Roman.

497
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,960
Okay. Go on.

498
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,700
Thank you.

499
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,099
Do girls like to drink such beautiful wine?

500
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:11,340
We love to drink good wine.

501
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,820
I'll give it a try then.

502
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,959
- Don't... 
 - Hey, pretty.

503
00:35:13,959 --> 00:35:15,759
Hi, Handsome.

504
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,199
It's so awful.

505
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:22,659
I think you shouldn't force it.

506
00:35:22,659 --> 00:35:25,340
This cocktail I just made is slightly stronger.

507
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,299
This will be of some use to me.

508
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:28,400
What is it used for?

509
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,280
I bet you don't know.

510
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,760
Look.

511
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,320
Everyone in the trade knows that it can be used to wipe the bracelet.

512
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,660
As for me, I'll use it to clean my guitar pick since I'm using it later.

513
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,170
- Guitar pick? 
 - That's right.

514
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:46,660
Miss Su, is my cocktail ready?

515
00:35:47,299 --> 00:35:50,980
Mrs. Roman, I'm sorry.

516
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,639
This is made for you?

517
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:56,760
I'm so sorry. It's not Miss Su's fault.

518
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,760
I couldn't help myself.

519
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,400
It's okay.

520
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,800
I'll make you another glass.

521
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,260
Sure.

522
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,639
Well, I'll get going then.

523
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:08,119
I'm going to perform in a bit.

524
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:09,400
Thanks for the lime.

525
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,100
Off you go.

526
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,139
Oh, right, Miss Su.

527
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:17,159
I've been going around in the last two days.

528
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:19,259
Could you make me something light?

529
00:36:19,259 --> 00:36:20,239
Sure.

530
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:22,460
I'll reduce the amount of alcohol.

531
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:24,660
This is quite an art.

532
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:28,360
If it's something stronger, pair it with green limes.

533
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,020
But if it's something lighter,

534
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,039
pair it with yellow limes.

535
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,119
I believe in your taste.

536
00:36:44,499 --> 00:36:46,260
It's done. Give it a try.

537
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,619
Sure.

538
00:36:56,659 --> 00:36:58,560
It looks like the show is about to begin.

539
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,100
 Ladies and gentlemen.

540
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,460
 Let me invite tonight's guest performer to come on stage,

541
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,519

 Put your hands up!

563
00:38:43,339 --> 00:38:47,100
- What's wrong? 
 - Why is he on the floor?

564
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,320
Oscar.

565
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,020
Oscar. Oscar.

566
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:56,120
Oscar, what's wrong?

567
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,960
Call an ambulance.

568
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,059
Take him to the backstage. I'll take care of here.

569
00:39:06,059 --> 00:39:07,659
Get up.

570
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,439
 Sorry, ladies and gentlemen.

571
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:16,900
 As our live singer is feeling under the weather,

572
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,639
 the show will end up.

573
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:21,939
 Please don't panic.

574
00:39:21,939 --> 00:39:26,299
 Right now, please follow our staff to enjoy your meals.

575
00:39:29,799 --> 00:39:31,800
I'm sorry. There was a slight hiccup.

576
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,939
It's being taken care of now.

577
00:39:32,939 --> 00:39:35,480
Sorry for ruining the fun.

578
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,619
- See you. 
 - Okay.

579
00:39:36,619 --> 00:39:37,900
- See you. 
 - See you.

580
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,980
- See you. 
 - Bye.

581
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,760
I saw that singer drinking before he went on stage.

582
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,920
I think a lady gave him the drink.

583
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,660
Could something be wrong with the drink?

584
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:50,320
Could it be the bartender's doing?

585
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:53,519
If so, this drink...

586
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,380
Don't be afraid.

587
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,280
I'm here.

588
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,559
There are rumors that the alcohol that Oscar took may have been poisoned.

589
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:04,360
But I was the one who made the drink.

590
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,120
I have no idea why it would turn out this way.

591
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,259
We have called the police. They'll be here soon.

592
00:40:10,259 --> 00:40:12,840
Don't worry. They'll get to the bottom of things.

593
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,039
This happened in critical moments as such.

594
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:16,820
It's definitely no accident.

595
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:19,659
Someone must be behind this.

596
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:24,700
Someone wanted to use this poisoning incident to take you and me down.

597
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:28,573
I was just wondering if that was their intention,

598
00:40:28,574 --> 00:40:31,639
Oscar wouldn't be the perfect target.

599
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:35,960
The cocktail that I made was meant for Mrs. Roman.

600
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,960
That makes sense now.

601
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,343
If it was Mrs. Roman who got poisoned,

602
00:40:40,344 --> 00:40:43,360
the auction would turn into a big scandal.

603
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,719
How hateful.

604
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:49,970

605
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,880
Mr. Roman got hot under the collar now.

606
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,780
I have to appease him.

607
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:01,839
Xieyi, think carefully.

608
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:06,919
See if there was any part that we would easily overlook or screw up.

609
00:41:10,106 --> 00:41:13,860
Don't worry. No matter what happens, I'm here for you.

00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:03,430
♫   Whatever pain and suffering may come,   ♫

644
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:06,210
♫  I'm not afraid at all  ♫

645
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:16,830
