2
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:24,900
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

3
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:32,850
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

4
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:41,330
♫  And turn to face all the long lost times  ♫

5
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,370
♫  Brace the pain  ♫

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:51,210
♫  Let memories wake up from oceans deep  ♫

7
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,150
♫  No place to hide  ♫

8
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,350
♫  No way to run  ♫

9
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,720
♫  New dawn counts down  ♫

10
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,930
♫  I fight  ♫

11
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,110
♫  I cry  ♫

12
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,500
♫  I give up  ♫

13
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:14,910
♫  Memories forgotten, forsaken surround  ♫

14
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:23,930
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

15
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:32,370
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

16
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:40,850
♫  Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

17
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:49,620
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

18
00:01:49,620 --> 00:02:00,050

19
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,950

20
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,479
Xieyi? What brings you here?

21
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,919
Why didn't you give me a call?

22
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,919
I thought you'd be at home.

23
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:21,859
Where have you been?

24
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:24,779
To discard the trash.

25
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,039
What is it? Did something happen?

26
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:30,299
Let's talk inside.

27
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,839
I'll pour you some water.

28
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:46,920
Did you meet Li Zeliang yesterday?

29
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,580
Did he tell you that?

30
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:55,240
Did they also tell you that I was the one who introduced the supplier?

31
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,759
And that I'm related to the guy they suspected, He Jianghua?

32
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,419
That I'm the mastermind?

33
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:03,257
Are you trying to say that you didn't do any of these?

34
00:03:03,257 --> 00:03:05,479
Indeed, I went to see Li Zeliang yesterday.

35
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:08,840
But I just wanted to ask him what really went down,

36
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,440
and if there was anything I could do to help.

37
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,820
I don't know what's Li Zeliang's motive for telling you this.

38
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,060
Here. Sit down and talk.

39
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,039
You're lying.

40
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,539
You've been lying to me all along.

41
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:27,159
Why would I lie to you?

42
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:29,580
All these years, how have I treated you and Xieqing?

43
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,159
You should know better, right?

44
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:33,099
Drop the act already.

45
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:37,800
All these years, you've been playing a perfect and affectionate fiancé.

46
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,160
It's so foolish of me

47
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,019
to be deceived by this facade that you put on.

48
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:46,259
My sister had been with you for so long.

49
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,199
But she didn't sense the slightest bit of love.

50
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,620
Instead, she was controlled by a dangerous lunatic!

51
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:04,320
Well, do you know why I did all this?

52
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,539
That's because Xieqing is the bond that ties us together.

53
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:12,980
Once I leave her, you'll drift further away from me.

54
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,079
I'm doing all this for you.

55
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,380
Tell me.

56
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,779
The things that happened to my sister. Was it your doing?

57
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:27,639
The things that happened to Zhiwei two years ago. Was it you too?

58
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,199
Okay.

59
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,539
You can tell that to the police.

60
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:38,280
Su Xieyi.

61
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,300
Do you still want to see your sister?

62
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,490
What do you mean?

63
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,460
As I said, she's the bond that ties us together.

64
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,560
How could I bear to let her die?

65
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,475
You can go to the police. But I promise you.

66
00:04:54,475 --> 00:04:56,600
You're not going to see your sister ever again.

67
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,879
She'll starve to death.

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,399
Where is she?

69
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:03,599
What did you do to her?

70
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,319
You really do love your sister dearly.

71
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:13,060
Promise me one thing, and you'll get to see her.

72
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,720
Break up with Li Zeliang.

73
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,859
Promise me you'll never see him again, and you'll stay by my side forever.

74
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,640
You wish!

75
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,079
Fine.

76
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:25,840
If so, you're going to lose your sister for real.

77
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,100
Why should I believe you?

78
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,877
How do I know if you're not lying to me again?

79
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:45,480
It's been so long, and they didn't recover her body. Do you think that's normal?

80
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,420
Also, the mung bean cakes you saw last time, I prepared them for Shen Xieqing.

81
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,920
Well, you can choose not to believe me.

82
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,920
But before the two of you break up, I'll let your sister starve.

83
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,100
Let's see if you'll take your chances.

84
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,839
Before I see any proof that my sister is still alive,

85
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,779
I won't agree to anything.

86
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,760
Okay.

87
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,219
I'll show you proof.

88
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,199
But that depends on how you behave.

89
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,659
I'll give you time to think about it.

90
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:34,128
I've waited for you for this long anyway. I can wait a little longer.

91
00:06:55,977 --> 00:06:57,358
Mr. Li.

92
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,940
Before this, He Jianghua, and Xie Minghao didn't cross paths.

93
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,380
Besides, He Jianghua is a well-known Weibo verified account user.

94
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,380
Why would he help Xie Minghao to set the fire?

95
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,979
This is what puzzles me.

96
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:13,879
All the clues point to He Jianghua.

97
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:16,959
For us to turn the tables around, he'll be the key.

98
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,559
Understood.

99
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,160
Mr. Li.

100
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,877
There's something that I have to let you know.

101
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:35,757
I took the liberty to tell Miss Su about your encounter with Xie Minghao

102
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,839
when investigating He Jianghua.

103
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,620
Ji Yingsong.

104
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,199
Who told you to do that?

105
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,080
Mr. Li, I don't know what Xie Minghao told you.

106
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,039
But I do know that you made a public apology because of Miss Su.

107
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,059
Even if I didn't tell her,

108
00:07:58,059 --> 00:08:00,580
Miss Su would have sensed that herself.

109
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,240
I made a public apology because Xie Minghao has the recording and dual contract

110
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,879
that can prove Xieyi accepted bribes.

111
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,920
Once these pieces of evidence are made public,

112
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,160
Xieyi will inevitably become a lightning conductor for criticism.

113
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,240
I have to protect her. Do you get it?

114
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,295
But given Xieyi's character,

115
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:18,120
once she found out that I was threatened by Xie Minghao,

116
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,120
she wouldn't just let things slide.

117
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,659
If so, everything I did would have been in vain, wouldn't it?

118
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:25,579
Mr. Li. I'm sorry.

119
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
I didn't think of that.

120
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,580
I just didn't want Miss Su to misunderstand you.

121
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,519
Forget it.

122
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,519
You did it for my sake.

123
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,299
How did Xieyi react to that?

124
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:43,360
Miss Su didn't say it, but I could tell that she was very touched

125
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,320
and that she believes in you.

126
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,060
 You can go to the police. But I promise you.

127
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,140
 You're not going to see your sister ever again.

128
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,420
 She'll starve to death.

129
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,340
 Break up with Li Zeliang.

130
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,100
 Promise me you'll never see him again, and you'll stay by my side forever.

131
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,300
 Hedgehogs will not bite.

132
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:55,420
 Its only defense is the thorns all over its body.

133
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,797
 But if it likes you,

134
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,940
 even its spines

135
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:02,960
will become very soft.

136
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:05,039
 A'Yan.

137
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:09,259
 Soon, I'll be covered with soft spines just like Chestnut.

138
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:11,479
 Will you understand?

139
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,879
Thank you for the other day.

140
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:22,639
My sister has a mental disorder.

141
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:24,779
Thank you for the notice.

142
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:28,120
This is a gift from my client. I bet it'll come in useful for you.

143
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,280
Take it as a token of appreciation from me.

144
00:10:30,819 --> 00:10:33,660
Lawyer Xie. You're being so courteous.

145
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,240
We'll surely bear in mind the things that you've told us to do.

146
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,599
Besides, it's our responsibility to protect the safety of the residents.

147
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:44,960
Next time, if anything comes up, feel free to come to me.

148
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,479
There is something that I might need your help with.

149
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:50,079
Ask away.

150
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,959
These two.

151
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,320
My sister owed them a sum of money.

152
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,919
I'm trying to raise funds, but they don't believe me.

153
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,899
They've been looking for my sister.

154
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:03,960
I'm afraid that my sister will suffer an emotional shock if she runs into them.

155
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:08,459
If they come here, please inform me at once.

156
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,039
Sure, Lawyer Xie. Don't worry.

157
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,799
I'll remember their faces.

158
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:15,720
If they come, I'll surely notify you.

159
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,259
- Thank you. 
 - No worries.

160
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,860
- Thank you for the trouble. 
 - Take care.

161
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:32,559
Yes, Dr. Wu.

162
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,900
You're right.

163
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,500
We'll come over at once.

164
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,740
Okay.

165
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,340
Thank you.

166
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,979
Mr. Li?

167
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,640
Mr. Li?

168
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,420
Did you call me?

169
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,440
I just made an appointment with Dr. Wu.

170
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,240
He's very concerned about your leg.

171
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,519
He suggested that we go over now for a checkup.

172
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,320
Wait. Why did you act on your own again?

173
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,240
Your health is the top priority.

174
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,840
I noticed you often have leg pain.

175
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,159
It can't be delayed any longer.

176
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:23,879
Besides, Miss Su reminded me to keep a lookout for you.

177
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:26,699
I'm fine.

178
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:29,279
This can wait until I'm done with Xieyi's matters.

179
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:38,600
Su Xieyi. Congrats!

180
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,420
You've got what you wished for.

181
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,459
Director Shi. What do you mean?

182
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,600
Zeliang made a public apology for you because of the fire at Lantian Bay.

183
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,917
Look what has happened to Ocean.

184
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:52,139
Isn't that what you'd wished for?

185
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:55,399
If it's my fault, I won't shirk responsibility.

186
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:59,479
But it wasn't my fault. So I won't take the blame.

187
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:02,080
So you're saying that I've wrongly accused you?

188
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,540
Did you really think the fire at Lantian Bay was an accident?

189
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,270
Of all the warehouses, why did the one where the external wall insulation materials were stored caught fire?

190
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,390
There are so many ventilators.

191
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,039
The fire was extinguished almost immediately.

192
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,080
Why would the news of the fire break so promptly?

193
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,799
And the person who covered the news is He Jianghua.

194
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,899
Have you given all this careful thought?

195
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,519
According to what you said, if someone deliberately set the fire,

196
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:33,880
why didn't Zeliang continue the investigation and chose to conclude it so quickly?

197
00:13:33,882 --> 00:13:36,243
He did it to protect you.

198
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,718
At this point, I hope you'll leave Ocean.

199
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,590
Otherwise, Zeliang might not pursue the matter of the insulation boards,

200
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,790
but not me.

201
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:48,480
Don't worry.

202
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,080
I came to tender my resignation.

203
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,919
Director Shi.

204
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:00,320
I know you have always had a strong prejudice and misunderstanding against me.

205
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,277
But I get it.

206
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:07,779
After all, you want what's best for Ocean and A'Yan.

207
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:10,380
I hope that after I leave,

208
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,100
you'll continue to protect A'Yan.

209
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,080
If you still remember the good thing he has done for you,

210
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,919
I hope you won't live with hatred anymore.

211
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:24,440
Live a good life after you leave Ocean.

212
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,461
Don't bother him again.

213
00:14:26,461 --> 00:14:28,039
What did you say?

214
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:29,939
Revenge?

215
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,720
That's right.

216
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,179
The fire in Lantian Bay was just an accident.

217
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:38,600
Lawyer Xie did all this to stop you from taking revenge.

218
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,039
He didn't want to see you keep walking down the wrong path.

219
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:43,039
Xie Minghao?

220
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,320
How could you believe what he said?

221
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:49,640
There's something I have to tell you.

222
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,920
The supplier of the external wall insulation materials

223
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,687
that I purchased from was introduced by him.

224
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,940
And Xie Minghao happens to know He Jianghua, the guy who covered the news.

225
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,599
I bet it's not difficult for you to connect the dots, right?

226
00:15:03,599 --> 00:15:07,439
All I can say is that I was wrong about him.

227
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,099
Here's a piece of advice.

228
00:15:09,099 --> 00:15:11,240
For Ocean's future plan in this business world,

229
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,720
it's best you steer clear of this person.

230
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,180
Dr. Wu.

231
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,720
I've exhausted all options to persuade him.

232
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,220
But he wouldn't go to the hospital for treatment,

233
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,939
and he wouldn't let me tell Miss Su about it.

234
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:43,520
 We detected osteomyelitis, and this is a serious condition.

235
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,397
 Delays in treatment might lead to cancer.

236
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,999
I know.

237
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,320

238
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,860
 You said it yourself.

239
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:16,719
 What we need now is to communicate and solve the problem together.

240
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:19,499
 Let me briefly explain it to you.

241
00:16:19,499 --> 00:16:23,600
 Three million meets corresponding standards of extremely large monetary amount.

242
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,879
 Based on the amount of remittance from the supplier to Xieyi,

243
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:29,859
 the sentence should be at least ten years or even life imprisonment.

244
00:16:29,859 --> 00:16:35,219
 Now, I have the evidence, witness, and Xieyi's motive for revenge.

245
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,200
 Xie Minghao.

246
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,340
 I never thought you would even do something like this to Xieyi.

247
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,300
 You don't want her to suffer?

248
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,659
 The choice is yours.

249
00:16:46,659 --> 00:16:49,679
 You can either protect Xieyi and take the blame.

250
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,220
 That will cost Ocean its reputation and lead to bankruptcy. You know better.

251
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,039
 Or you can rat Xieyi out, and I'll hand over the evidence.

252
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:01,599
 In that case, I'm afraid you can only visit her in jail.

253
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,160
 Come and find me when you want to tell me the truth.

254
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,419
 Please don't tell anything about this to Xieyi.

255
00:17:10,419 --> 00:17:15,399
 I know I have no right to ask this of you, but I don't want to see her hurt and upset over what happened in the past ever again.

256
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,060
 Xieyi.

257
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,200
 About He Jianghua working with Xie Minghao to stitch you up,

258
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,459
 the police have stepped in.

259
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,960
 I believe it won't be long now.

260
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,140
Hi, Lawyer Xie. President Dai is waiting for you inside.

261
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,198
- Lawyer Xie. 
 - President Dai.

262
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,700
Come over.

263
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,499
Lawyer Xie.

264
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,040
Take a look.

265
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,117
As per your request, I've registered a new company

266
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:04,340
and gave you 10 percent of shares in this company.

267
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,459
President Dai, you sure are a man of your word.

268
00:18:10,459 --> 00:18:13,140
Well, you're very honest yourself.

269
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,160
Indeed, your fee is a lot higher than those ordinary lawyers.

270
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,319
I've secretly bought some Ocean shares through Diying and Zhengde.

271
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:23,119
This sum of money can last you a lifetime.

272
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,919
Thank you, President Dai.

273
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:29,019
By the time we hold more than five percent of Ocean shares, we can then show ourselves.

274
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:33,140
Then, we'll take him by surprise.

275
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,720
Isn't it exciting?

276
00:18:36,259 --> 00:18:39,159
I have thought about it. I want to be the largest shareholder.

277
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,799
I have always hated the name "Ocean".

278
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:44,400
After the acquisition, I'm going to change the name.

279
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,440
What should I name it?

280
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,000
Zhengcai?

281
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,240
Zhengde?

282
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,100
Zhengcai?

283
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,375
The combination of virtue and talent.

284
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:57,780
Becoming Ocean's largest shareholder requires a huge sum of money.

285
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,000
Have you prepared the money?

286
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,740
I like to play big.

287
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,876
I have contacted Aihong Fund

288
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:07,100
and pledged all of Zhengde shares to raise funds.

289
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,100
Prepare enough ammunition for war.

290
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:17,379
We have only one goal, which is to take down Li Zeliang.

291
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,879
A'Yan.

292
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,299
Xieyi.

293
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:52,780
You look nice today.

294
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,460
Thank you.

295
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,359
I have heard about your resignation from Ocean.

296
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:02,100
- I... 
 - A'Yan.

297
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,079
We're out to have fun. Let's not talk about this.

298
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,470
Come on. There'll be a huge crowd if we're late for certain activities.

299
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,330
Let's get inside first.

300
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,339
Okay.

301
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,499
What's the matter? Does your leg hurt?

302
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,260
I'm fine. Look.

303
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,660
It's all good.

304
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,600
Oh, right, Xieyi. Wait for me.

305
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,790
I'll buy you a bottle of water.

306
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,260
I'll go. It's not convenient for you.

307
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,300
Just sit tight.

308
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,619
Look.

309
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,110
I have this mini bike.

310
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,839
Wait for me.

311
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,060
Off we go!

312
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:04,070

313
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,980
You have such a good figure.

314
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,418
What do you think? Can I become a spokesperson for pin art sculpture now?

315
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:29,019
Xieyi. I feel so happy today.

316
00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:33,200
If you like it here, we can come here more often.

317
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,640
There's a cinema over there.

318
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,780
I think the two of us haven't gone to the movies together.

319
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,220
How about this?

320
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:47,159
Next time, we can go together.

321
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,160
We did.

322
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:00,360
Are you talking about Yunfeng Hotel? "Roman Holiday"?

323
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,279
I remember you watched it at least five times that day.

324
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:07,500
I bet you can recite all the lines in it.

325
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,359
That's right.

326
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:18,779
Do you remember their lines in the car?

327
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,960
"I have to leave you...

328
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,620
now.

329
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:41,959
I'm going to that corner there and turn.

330
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:46,039
You must stay in the car.

331
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,919
Promise me

332
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:57,360
not to watch me go beyond the corner.

333
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,319
Just drive away.

334
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,480
Don't mind me.

335
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:15,380
Just leave me as I leave you."

336
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,280
These were the lines

337
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:39,599
that Ann said to Joe before returning to the palace.

338
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:46,860
But I prefer the lines that she said toward the end.

339
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,439
She said,

340
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,319
"My favorite city is Rome.

341
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,980
By all means, Rome.

342
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:09,759
Because this place

343
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,179
holds the most special memories for me."

344
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:35,979
 I take your resignation from Ocean as a gesture of goodwill.

345
00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:37,700
 What about my sister?

346
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:45,120
 Your sister is holding today's morning paper.

347
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,830
 It's enough to prove that she's still alive.

348
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:52,860
 I told you. What I want is for you to break up with Li Zeliang.

349
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:56,019
 Before that happens, I've decided to let her starve.

350
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,019
 If you love your sister, just do as I say.

351
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:09,160
 Okay. I'll break up with Li Zeliang.

352
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,919
 Very well.

353
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,019
Let's break up.

354
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,679
Xieyi.

355
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:42,679
Are you doing this because of Xieqing?

356
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:45,820
If it's because of Xieqing, I can explain.

357
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:50,039
When I met Xieqing the other day, she did tell me something.

358
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:55,117
Back then, Zhiwei went bankrupt because of her.

359
00:26:55,117 --> 00:26:59,620
But at that time, something happened to Xieqing.

360
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,450
I was afraid that it would crush you.

361
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,520
That's why I didn't tell you.

362
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,960
That was so long ago.

363
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,479
What's the point of bringing it up now?

364
00:27:09,479 --> 00:27:12,319
So are you going to break up with me over this?

365
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:18,899
Xieyi. If you have any difficulties, you can just tell me.

366
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,639
Li Zeliang.

367
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:27,540
Don't you get it?

368
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:32,540
The sight of you reminds me of how my dad and sister left me.

369
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,750
Let's not see each other again.

370
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,780
Don't contact me anymore.

371
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,420
From now on, we have nothing to do with each other.

372
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,100
Where are you going?

373
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,039
Are you going to see Xie Minghao?

374
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:57,580
He's not a good person! Believe me, Xieyi.

375
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,440
Do you remember the K of Spades that Huo Jian told you about?

376
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,150
Xie Minghao is K of Spades.

377
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:05,410
It was Xie Minghao who instructed your sister to bankrupt Zhiwei,

378
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:08,619
and got Huo Jian to drive Zhiwei to a corner.

379
00:28:08,619 --> 00:28:10,720
It was him, Xie Minghao!

380
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:15,720
I'm well aware of the kind of person he is.

381
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:20,600
I hope you can get things straight.

382
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,300
There's no more future for us.

383
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,480
Please let go.

384
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:00,100
♫  Rain falling down from the sky  ♫

385
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:05,350

00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:14,000
♫  In your circle of love  ♫

411
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,600
I just don't understand.

412
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,500
Why would Miss Su suddenly want to break up with you?

413
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:09,800
She said the sight of me

414
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:16,600
reminds her of Xieqing and Uncle Shen.

415
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,600
That's why...

416
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,400
she couldn't face me.

417
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:29,930
Mr. Li. Do you actually believe that?

418
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,600
I do have the inescapable responsibility

419
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,800
for the death of Uncle Shen and Xieqing.

420
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:59,000
Had I stopped it sooner,

421
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,600
such tragedy wouldn't have happened.

422
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,400
They had a death wish.

423
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,500
You might be able to save them once.

424
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,100
But there's no telling you can save them the second time.

425
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:21,500
I think Miss Su knows this better than I do.

426
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,100
I think there must be some other reasons

427
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,600
Miss Su insisted on breaking up.

428
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,200
 I'm well aware of the kind of person he is.

429
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,600
 I hope you can get things straight.

430
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,000
Is it because of Xie Minghao?

431
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,200
He used the recording and contract to threaten Xieyi

432
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,100
after threatening me.

433
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,400
If that's really the case,

434
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,600
Miss Su will be in great danger.

435
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,400
I'll get to the bottom of things.

436
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,500
I've broken up with Li Zeliang.

437
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,200
It's time to make good on your promise.

438
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,500
It's not the time yet.

439
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,700
Xie Minghao. You have to keep your word.

440
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:47,000
I promised I would let you see Xieqing, but I didn't say when.

441
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,200
You...

442
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,400
You must be hungry.

443
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,100
Drink up.

444
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,400
Are you mad?

445
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,300
Why are you mad?

446
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,400
Look, I even prepared a little surprise for you.

447
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,400
These dolls are prepared specially for you.

448
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,200
From now on, this will be your room.

449
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,700
Do you like it?

450
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,000
I won't stay here.

451
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,400
You can choose to decline if you don't want to see Xieqing.

452
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,600
Why are you doing this?

453
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,300
I'll never love you.

454
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,600
I don't care what you do.

455
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:15,500
As long as you're with me, you have to love me.

456
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,400
See these dolls?

457
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,500
From now on, you'll stay by my side just like them.

458
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,400
Put on a show if you have to.

459
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,300
Look, I kept Xieqing in the dark for so many years. But she was happy, wasn't she?

460
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:33,500
So just act as if you love me when you're with me, and that will do.

461
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,900
Otherwise, you know what I would do to Xieqing and Li Zeliang, right?

462
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,000
I can play along with you and put on a show.

463
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,600
- But on one condition. 
 - What is it?

464
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:52,000
I want to see a new picture of my sister every day.

465
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,100
I want to make sure that she's still alive and that she's doing well.

466
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,300
It's a deal.

467
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,800
I have a condition too.

468
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,400
You can't see or contact Li Zeliang anymore.

469
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,500
Believe me when I say I have my own way. If you contact him, I'm going to find out.

470
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,800
There'll be dire consequences then.

471
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,900
Don't worry.

472
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,000
Very well.

473
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,700
Rest earlier.

474
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,900
I'll help you fetch your luggage.

475
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,500
Xieyi.

476
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,960
Where are you going?

477
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,700
I was planning to send food to your sister.

478
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,000
But you foiled my plan.

479
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
She'll starve for another day because of you.

480
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,600
How could you do this to her?

481
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,800
I've told you. No rush.

482
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,200
I'll let you see her when it's time.

483
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,300
If you push it, your sister will have to suffer.

484
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,200
I was wrong.

485
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,700
I promise I won't follow you anymore.

486
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,400
Go and meet my sister.

487
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,200
Bring her some food.

488
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,400
Do you think I'll still believe you?

489
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,600
What are you trying to do?

490
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,000
Want to make it up to me?

491
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,400
There are a lot of things that I want to do with you.

492
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,000
Let's start with dating.

493
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,600
Rest earlier.

494
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,000
 From the looks of it, I'll have to play along with him for now.

495
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,700
 When opportunity knocks, I'll find out where my sister is.

496
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:40,200
♫  I need you, I love you  ♫

497
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:44,000
♫  I'll brave the waves for you  ♫

498
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,400
♫  You don't have to be brave all the time  ♫

499
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:52,800
♫  Please believe that I am by your side  ♫

500
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,700
♫  Ever and after  ♫

501

 ''How Have You Been Lately?'' - Silence Wang

503
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:19,200
♫   Halfway through the journey on the train,   ♫

504
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,000
♫   a new passenger takes a seat   ♫

505
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,200
♫   The bells on the platform are ringing   ♫

506
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,780
♫   I wave my hands to see the passengers off   ♫

507
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,600
♫   With a one-way ticket stub in your hand   ♫

508
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,200
♫   you've embarked on a journey to happiness   ♫

509
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,600
♫   I didn't save your contact information   ♫

510
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,800
♫   But in my heart, I secretly ask   ♫

511
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,800
♫   How have you been lately?   ♫

512
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,600
♫   How's it going with him?   ♫

513
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,300
♫   I bet his temper is better than mine   ♫

514
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:55,200
♫   He's better at guessing your complicated thoughts   ♫

515
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:59,100
♫   Does he hold you when you're sad?   ♫

516
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,000
♫   How have you been lately?   ♫

517
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,800
♫   Everything must be going well   ♫

518
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,800
♫   Do you want to hear what I haven't said?   ♫

519
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:14,400
♫   Do lyrics of love songs stir up your emotions and recall all of our memories?   ♫

520
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,000
♫   It doesn't seem to be difficult   ♫

521
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,700
♫   How have you been lately?   ♫

522
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,500
♫   How's it going with him?   ♫

523
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,300
♫   You and fate have not given me an answer   ♫

524
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:56,300
♫   The price of growing up is like a pile of bargaining chip   ♫

525
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:00,000
♫   The wager is who can let go first   ♫

526
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,800
♫   How have you been lately?   ♫

♫   Everything must be going well   ♫

528
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,100
♫   Life is not as complicated as I thought   ♫

529
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:12,400
♫   Silence is the best that I can do   ♫

530
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,400
♫   Whatever pain and suffering may come,   ♫

531
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,300
♫   I'm not afraid at all   ♫

532
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:28,880
