00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:15,610

2
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:25,100
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

3
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:33,550
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

4
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:41,430
♫  And turn to face all the long lost times  ♫

5
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,370
♫  Brace the pain  ♫

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:51,210
♫  Let memories wake up from oceans deep  ♫

7
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,350
♫  No place to hide  ♫

8
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,450
♫  No way to run  ♫

9
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,820
♫  New dawn counts down  ♫

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,030
♫  I fight  ♫

11
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,110
♫  I cry  ♫

12
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,700
♫  I give up  ♫

13
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:14,710
♫  Memories forgotten, forsaken surround  ♫

14
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:24,230
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

15
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:32,470
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

16
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:40,950
♫  Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

17
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:49,620
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

18
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:59,950

19
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,419

20
00:02:03,419 --> 00:02:07,679
I found something on the construction site in Lantian Bay.

21
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:10,759
Mr. He. Take a look.

22
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,520
Are you trying to imply that this inhaler is mine?

23
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,600
You know the reason that I'm here.

24
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,719
We both know what this is about.

25
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,619
Let's have a chat.

26
00:02:26,619 --> 00:02:28,399
What do you want?

27
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:31,759
I'll hand it over to the police.

28
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,840
I don't need to remind you whose fingerprints are on it, right?

29
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,920
Don't keep going down the wrong path.

30
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,219
Miss Su. You dance so gracefully.

31
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:44,659
Be honest with me. Have you been learning how to dance since you were a kid?

32
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:47,360
Oh, right, President Dai.

33
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,140
I saw He Jianghua walking out here with an odd look on his face.

34
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,899
Him? He's just a lackey.

35
00:02:53,899 --> 00:02:57,080
He refuses to do as told. Thus, the odd look.

36
00:02:57,699 --> 00:03:00,400
Mr. Lawyer, help President Dai out and advise him

37
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,400
on how to deal with people like him.

38
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,359
It's okay.

39
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:09,020
People like He Jianghua would set Ocean on fire simply by egging him on.

40
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,820
How smart can he be?

41
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,719
He thought we would help him.

42
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,239
Right now, I have something on him.

43
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,280
If I tell him to do something, he has to do it.

44
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,899
When he's of no value, I'll set him up and send him to prison

45
00:03:25,899 --> 00:03:28,639
and let him rot in there.

46
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,740
He'll pose a threat to us if we keep him around.

47
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,619
President Dai is a man of his word.

48
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,019
You're not being yourself today.

49
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:43,259
Why are you talking so much to him?

50
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:46,639
Are you trying to help Li Zeliang fish for information?

51
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:48,439
You're thinking too much.

52
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:52,260
Even if I am, I won't have a chance to tell him.

53
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,399
Good that you know.

54
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:00,140
Nice!

55
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,999
Come on. Hurry. Drink up.

56
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,320
Let's drink our fill. Come on, Lawyer Xie.

57
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,000
No, President Dai. I have a call to make.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,719
- Look at you. 
 - I'll be right back.

59
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,120
President Dai, a toast to you.

60
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,120
Sure. Here.

61
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:16,779
- I'm sorry. 
 - It's okay.

62
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:18,979
- I'll do it. 
 - How nice of you.

63
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:24,379
Xieyi.

64
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,080
Let me do it.

65
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,531
- Wait. She... 
 - I'm sorry.

66
00:04:31,531 --> 00:04:33,600
- Let's see. Where did it spill on? 
 - Wait.

67
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
It's fine. Really.

68
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,319
Why are you being a stranger?

69
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,639
It's okay now. This thing doesn't worth a thing.

70
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,460
All right then. Tell me. What should I do?

71
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:48,280
Reveal the truth including the evil deeds of Xie Minghao and Dai.

72
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,020
If you turn yourself in, you'll get a lighter sentence.

73
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,520
Chairman Li.

74
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,339
If you think that I get scared easily, then, you're wrong.

75
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,940
Many people use such an inhaler.

76
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,719
You can deal with it however you want.

77
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,339
I won't see you out.

78
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,520
Look, Lawyer Xie.

79
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,400
Don't say I didn't remind you.

80
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,279
Things are different now that you have a girlfriend.

81
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:35,900
Be sure to thoroughly remove

82
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,900
the pictures of the girls, and delete all the chat records with them.

83
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,550
If she finds out,

84
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,910
you'll have no end of trouble.

85
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,779
Xieyi, what are you doing?

86
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,779
I'm taking a selfie.

87
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:56,779
Why don't the three of us take a photo together?

88
00:05:56,779 --> 00:05:58,579
Give me the phone.

89
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,000
What do you think? Do I look nice?

90
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:23,179
It'll be perfect if I'm in it.

91
00:06:23,179 --> 00:06:25,739
Oh, come on. Showing affection in front of me.

92
00:06:25,739 --> 00:06:27,840
All right. Cut the crap. Come on. Drink up.

93
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,400
- I'll fill it up for you. 
 - Here, Mr. Dai.

94
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,059
Come on. Let's drink.

95
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,700

96
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,140
 He would set Ocean on fire simply by egging him on.

97
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,959
 How smart can he be?

98
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,732
 He thought we would help him.

99
00:06:56,732 --> 00:07:00,399
 Right now, I have something on him.

100
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,331
 If I tell him to do something, he has to do it.

101
00:07:04,331 --> 00:07:07,000
 When he's of no value,

102
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,299
 I'll set him up and send him to prison and let him rot in there.

103
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,060
 Zhiwei's bankruptcy had nothing to do with A'Liang.

104
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,380
 It was all Shen Xieqing and Xie Minghao's doing.

105
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,879
 What do you think I should do?

106
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:48,120
 Push all the blame on Su Xieyi?

107
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,995
 Then, push her out and let her come under fire

108
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,319
 in order to protect Ocean's reputation?

109
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:56,062
 You did this for this woman who's up to no good. Is it worth it?

110
00:07:56,062 --> 00:07:57,762
 Director Shi.

111
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,779
 Don't you think this whole thing has many doubtful points?

112
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:04,280
 If you don't want me to say it, I won't.

113
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,920
 But I hope you can wake up.

114
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,800
 This isn't the time to let emotions cloud your judgment!

115
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,119
 I'm thinking perfectly straight.

116
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,779
 Zeliang. I'm sorry.

117
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,380
 All this while, I'm the one who let emotions cloud my judgment.

118
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,659
 This mistake that I made serves as a wake-up call to me.

119
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,661
 You two are the ones who know each other best.

120
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,719
 It's time I let go.

121
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,500

122
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Zeliang. It was President Dai who requested the stockholders' meeting.

123
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,360
He's coming for you.

124
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:07,999
I know.

125
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,600
There's a total of nine votes from the board of directors.

126
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,659
As far as I know, he has four votes in hand.

127
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:15,699
I'm the only one who can help you now.

128
00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:19,019
You know that. Just say the word, and I won't say no.

129
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:22,340
Director Shi. This is my own problem.

130
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,420
I don't want to get you dragged into it.

131
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,780
I'm sorry.

132
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,020
I went out to sea last night to fish.

133
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,800
So I got up late. Good morning, everyone.

134
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,420
President Dai, you're here. Here. Take a seat.

135
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,539
Old Zhang, how is it? Did you receive the softshell turtle?

136
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:37,579
Is it good?

137
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:39,939
I caught it myself.

138
00:09:39,939 --> 00:09:41,969
It's very nutritious.

139
00:09:41,969 --> 00:09:43,308
Go on.

140
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,760
This conference room is a little shabby.

141
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,900
The devil's in the detail.

142
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,100
Like these broken chairs,

143
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,400
the table, and the people.

144
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,999
They should be weeded out.

145
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:06,679
You're here, Chairman Li. Sorry, I didn't notice.

146
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:13,020
Now that everyone is here,

147
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,840
let's get onto the agenda.

148
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,440
Hold on.

149
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:21,299
Allow me to do some introdcution. This is Miss Su Xieyi.

150
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:22,939
I'm sure everyone knows her.

151
00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:25,720
She's President Dai's temporary special assistant.

152
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,080
Let's have her set out. Zhengde's plans to everyone.

153
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,700
Hold on.

154
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,440
Xieyi. Here. Come here.

155
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,680
Hurry. Come over.

156
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:43,719
To make an announcement, you should do it at the right place.

157
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:45,139
Please.

158
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:56,459
Zhengde and Diying have no objection to the stockholders meeting process received in the morning.

159
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,270
But before moving on to discuss

160
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:02,590
how to deal with Ocean's situation,

161
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,200
Diying proposes

162
00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:10,379
to first deal with the accident that took place in Lantian Bay.

163
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,815
Well, what do Zhengde and Diying propose that we should do to deal with the matter

164
00:11:20,815 --> 00:11:23,580
before moving on with the procedures?

165
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:46,513
"In view of the wrong decision made by Mr. Li Zeliang in the Lantian Bay project,

166
00:11:46,513 --> 00:11:49,500
it led Ocean stock to take a hit.

167
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,300
We suggest

168
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:58,819
that Mr. Li Zeliang must be removed from the post of chairman.

169
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:07,079
That's because a tainted chairman with bad leadership

170
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:10,340
will do no good to the company whatsoever."

171
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,639
Come on. Let's vote.

172
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,219
I second that.

173
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,860
Director Shi, please take a stand.

174
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,360
It's more than half of the votes.

175
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,930
Chairman Li, I'm so sorry.

176
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:51,559
You may change seats. I'll pick for you.

177
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:53,259
The seat over there looks good.

178
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:56,019
Please.

179
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,960
All right. We can now officially get onto the agenda.

180
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,139
Director Shi, please preside over the meeting.

181
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,620
- Sister Mingyue. 
 - Sister Mingyue.

182
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:49,350
Lawyer Xie is now Zhengde's business lawyer,

183
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:54,790
and Su Xieyi is now President Dai's temporary special assistant.

184
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,500
What nonsense is this?

185
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,739
It's true. We heard it when we went to deliver the tea.

186
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,480
Sister Mingyue. Didn't you say that you believed her?

187
00:14:07,845 --> 00:14:11,798
If there's nothing else, we'll end the meeting here.

188
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,060
Mr. Li.

189
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:20,159
Are you in a hurry to go home? What will you do at home?

190
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,459
Go home to keep your girlfriend company?

191
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:27,679
Isn't your girlfriend over there?

192
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,939
I got it messed up.

193
00:14:30,939 --> 00:14:33,840
She's your ex-girlfriend now.

194
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,599
Lawyer Xie, if you ask me, you're indeed a man of charm.

195
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:41,000
Both sisters vied with each other and fell for you at the same time.

196
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,679
Miss Su, especially.

197
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:46,819
She gave up her position as the wife of Ocean's chairman and fell in love with you.

198
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:49,300
You have to cherish her.

199
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,318
Dai Ziang.

200
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,579
I'm warning you not to discuss other people's private matters in public.

201
00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:58,100
Private matters? Is it?

202
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,200
In that case, why not make it public then?

203
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:04,659
Miss Su.

204
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:08,719
Have you broken up with Mr. Li Zeliang?

205
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:10,399
Tell them.

206
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:26,359
That's right.

207
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:29,259
I broke up with Mr. Li a long time ago.

208
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:31,835
We have nothing to do with each other now.

209
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,100
Mr. Li, how miserable.

210
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,439
You lost your chairman post and got dumped by your girlfriend.

211
00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:51,559
What's the saying? Suffering a double loss.

212
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:53,900
A real pity. Meeting's over. How pitiful!

213
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,862
What a real pity!

214
00:16:28,258 --> 00:16:30,720
Su Xieyi, don't you think you've gone too far?

215
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,500
When others spoke ill of you, I foolishly stood up for you.

216
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,980
From the looks of it, you had me fooled, hadn't you?

217
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,920
Look what you've done to Chairman Li and Ocean.

218
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,380
You're such a cold-blooded and ruthless woman.

219
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,420
Was it all just a show?

220
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:49,460
I'm sorry.

221
00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:04,580
I've checked and verified it through the fund company.

222
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,119
You were right.

223
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:09,620
In order to take over Ocean, Dai

224
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:13,000
has gambled away his whole fortune

225
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,459
to fight this battle with you.

226
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:16,739
How much did he pledge?

227
00:17:16,739 --> 00:17:21,520
All twenty percent of Zhengde stocks that he owns was pledged to Aihong Fund.

228
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,207
According to the performance guarantee ratio,

229
00:17:23,207 --> 00:17:26,900
Zhengde's stock price cannot fall below 30 percent.

230
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,680
Otherwise, it is likely to be forced to liquidate.

231
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,019
He sure is aggressive.

232
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:33,659
That's right.

233
00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:36,760
At that time, Zhengde's stock price will plummet.

234
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,840
That Dai dude will be forced to liquidate.

235
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,680
Do you think he will jump into the sea?

236
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,399
Hou Xiaodong.

237
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:49,140
Not only can you sing rock songs, but you're also even an expert in finance.

238
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,293
Of course.

239
00:17:50,293 --> 00:17:53,920
Thanks to the influence from a young age. I picked it up along the way.

240
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,020
I just didn't want to inherit my dad's business.

241
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:02,100
Director Shi, you put on quite a good show today.

242
00:18:02,739 --> 00:18:05,280
Likewise, Chairman Li.

243
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:15,700
A'Liang, this was the first time I begged my dad for something.

244
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,359
It was all for you.

245
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:19,919
So? So rock, isn't it?

246
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,900
So today's drinks are on you.

247
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:27,339
No problem.

248
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,830
Oh, right.

249
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,000
How are you coping with today's incident?

250
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:45,280
Although you guys told me to believe in Su Xieyi,

251
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,280
I couldn't wrap my head around her deeds and words today.

252
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,990
That makes me believe her even more.

253
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,200
Besides, Xieyi is secretly helping me.

254
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,559
I received a text message from Xie Minghao.

255
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,960
It was a recording.

256
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,416
 Many people use such an inhaler.

257
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,716
 You can deal with it however you want.

258
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:16,399
 I won't see you out.

259
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:26,250

260
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:33,860
If He Jianghua hears this recording, he'll go berserk.

261
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,200
But why would it be sent over by Xie Minghao?

262
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,220
Xie Minghao would never expose himself.

263
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,599
The only explanation is that someone else used his phone.

264
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:46,200
It could only be Xieyi.

265
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,700
Xie Minghao took Xieyi to meet Di Ziang yesterday.

266
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,800
It's possible that her phone was taken.

267
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,619
He Jianghua is the deciding factor.

268
00:19:56,619 --> 00:20:00,000
If we can convince him, there's hope to turn things around.

269
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,900

270
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:10,059
Mr. He.

271
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,240
Why are you here again?

272
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,220
I've said everything that needs to be said.

273
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,600
Please leave.

274
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,059
Listen to this.

275
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:25,000
After that, you might get a good picture of things.

276
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,240
 He's just a lackey.

277
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,000
 He refuses to do as told. Thus, the odd look.

278
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,700
 People like He Jianghua would set Ocean on fire simply by egging him on.

279
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,600
 How smart can he be?

280
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,000
 Right now, I have something on him.

281
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 If I tell him to do something, he has to do it.

282
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,659
 When he's of no value,

283
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:52,260
 I'll set him up and send him to prison and let him rot in there.

284
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,879
 He'll pose a threat to us if we keep him around.

285
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,820
 President Dai is a man of his word.

286
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:04,660
Dai Ziang made you commit arson

287
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:08,000
because he wants to have something on you.

288
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,039
That way, you would have to play along with them.

289
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,219
I've handed the rhinitis spray to the police. Do the right thing now.

290
00:21:14,219 --> 00:21:15,840
Chairman Li.

291
00:21:16,979 --> 00:21:19,119
I get what you're saying.

292
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,910
But I can't afford to mess with these people.

293
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,440
Do you think you can hide from them?

294
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,600
Will the police let you get away?

295
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,540
Will Dai Ziang let things slide?

296
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,860
He won't.

297
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:35,499
He'll only get worse and make you their accomplice.

298
00:21:35,499 --> 00:21:39,060
At that time, your sin will keep running deeper.

299
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,340
He could make you commit arson now.

300
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:45,279
In the future, he can force you to kill.

301
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:53,000
Right now, you have only two options.

302
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,400
It's either you stay right down the path you're on, or

303
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,520
you step back from the brink.

304
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,660
Of course.

305
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,200
I can help you.

306
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,290
Just come forward and testify against them,

307
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,510
then Ocean will call off the damage claim,

308
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:25,280
and get you the best lawyer.

309
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,530
Cooperate with the police investigation,

310
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,540
and you can obtain leniency.

311
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:40,579
Mr. He. I believe

312
00:22:40,579 --> 00:22:43,459
your original intention when you got into the media industry

313
00:22:43,459 --> 00:22:46,179
was to become a fighter of justice.

314
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:49,419
You had a momentary lapse in judgment and were taken advantage of.

315
00:22:49,419 --> 00:22:52,659
You don't wish to keep going down the wrong path either.

316
00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:54,140
Right?

317
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:06,300
So as to which path to take,

318
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,880
I believe you already have the answer in your heart.

319
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,900
Chairman Li. What should I do?

320
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:21,380
Do what you do best and use it to uncover the truth.

321
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,280
Okay.

322
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:32,000
This is great, Zeliang.

323
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,800
He Jianghua has the video recorded and is willing to step forward and testify against them.

324
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,920
When will you be making the announcement?

325
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,818
Now isn't the time yet.

326
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,459
We have to find Xieqing first.

327
00:23:41,459 --> 00:23:44,680
I suspect that Xie Minghao hid her somewhere.

328
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,700
But I've followed Lawyer Xie for a few days now.

329
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,760
Besides his residence and law firm, he hasn't been to any other places.

330
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,990
If Xieqing is alive...

331
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,490
at least she has to eat.

332
00:24:00,699 --> 00:24:03,519
Is it possible that Xie Minghao has her tucked away in his own apartment?

333
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:06,079
Mr. Li, I'll investigate it right away.

334
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,939
Coincidentally, Dai Ziang and Xie Minghao asked me out for dinner tonight.

335
00:24:12,939 --> 00:24:14,799
Since they want to rope me in,

336
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,499
I'll see if I can worm anything out of them and meet up with Xieyi while I'm at it.

337
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,579
Be careful.

338
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,579
 It's more than half of the votes.

339
00:24:48,579 --> 00:24:50,200
 Chairman Li, I'm so sorry.

340
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,400
 You may change seats. I'll pick for you.

341
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,620
 Director Shi was acting out of the ordinary.

342
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,140
 She couldn't possibly betray A'Yan.

343
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,280
 Why would it be like this?

344
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,380
Xieyi.

345
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,200
Xieyi. Get ready to go out.

346
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,459
President Dai arranged a celebration dinner.

347
00:25:12,459 --> 00:25:13,859
Okay.

348
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:19,019
What's the matter?

349
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:25,039
I'm sorry.

350
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:29,400
I wanted to take a bath. But I got distracted.

351
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,300
 Open up! The water's leaking!

352
00:25:36,939 --> 00:25:38,259
It's you.

353
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:42,739
You're really something. You own two units? And even two wives.

354
00:25:42,739 --> 00:25:44,860
Sorry, let's talk outside.

355
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,019
What's wrong with you?

356
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:51,259
Two days ago, I just complimented you for being a good husband.

357
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:53,480
 Look at the water leakage.

358
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,639
 Our ceiling and wallpaper are all wet. How are you going to deal with this?

359
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:57,927
I'm so sorry.

360
00:25:57,927 --> 00:26:00,500
The floor drain is clogged. We didn't know what had happened.

361
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,700
How about this? I'll compensate you for your loss.

362
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,939
 On top of that, I'll pay for the emotional distress caused.

363
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:06,480
 You're a pleasant man to deal with.

364
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,079
 But you have to keep your word.

365
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:09,975
Sorry for the trouble.

366
00:26:09,975 --> 00:26:12,560
I'll get going then. Don't you forget.

367
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,099
I'm sorry.

368
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,420
Xieyi.

369
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,520
Xieyi.

370
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,400
How did it go?

371
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,219
It's taken care of.

372
00:26:37,219 --> 00:26:38,840
That's great then.

373
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:45,319
What's wrong?

374
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:46,800
Nothing.

375
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,800
Leave it. Clean yourself up. We're leaving in a bit.

376
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,460
Okay.

377
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,879
 Two units? Two wives?

378
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:05,160
 Is my sister in the unit below us?

379
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,480
So the neighbor downstairs isn't mad anymore?

380
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,139
Why don't I buy something for her tomorrow as a token of apology?

381
00:27:22,139 --> 00:27:23,680
We're neighbors after all.

382
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,340
It's better to get along with each other.

383
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,300
It's okay. It's no issue.

384
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,940
That neighbor is a nice person.

385
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,799
Sorry.

386
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,200
I'm late.

387
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,199
My VIPs are here.

388
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:37,400
Sorry to keep you waiting.

389
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,600
Director Shi?

390
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,119
Are you surprised?

391
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,619
Indeed, there were some misunderstandings between us.

392
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:45,000
But it's all in the past now.

393
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,799
Let bygones be bygones.

394
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,760
That's right. We'll all be friends now.

395
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,340
Come on. Take a seat.

396
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,200
Here.

397
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,119
Firstly, I want to express my deepest gratitude to Director Shi.

398
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:03,480
After all, your vote is crucial to me.

399
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,639
Also, I have one other thing to ask you, Director Shi.

400
00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:12,179
Are you really planning to sell your stocks in Ocean?

401
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:13,580
Of course.

402
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:17,490
There's nothing else left for me in Ocean.

403
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:19,160
After the transfer of the stocks,

404
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,300
I'll stop engaging in wishful thinking about him.

405
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,400
This is great. How about this?

406
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,659
You can transfer all your Ocean's stocks to me.

407
00:28:25,659 --> 00:28:27,900
Don't worry. I'll make sure you're well paid for it.

408
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,500
Tomorrow, I'll get Lawyer Xie to draw up a contract, and we can sign it as soon as possible.

409
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:34,160
- Nice doing business with you. 
 - Nice doing business with you. Here.

410
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,060
Come on. Let's drink this together.

411
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,800
- Here. 
 - Bottoms up!

412
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,100
Come on. Let's dig in.

413
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,660
You all must be starving. Come on. Dig in. Let's not wait.

414
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,580
Excuse me. I'm going to the washroom.

415
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,160
Sure. Help yourself.

416
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,200
Perfect. I'm going to.

417
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,899
Let's go together, Director Shi.

418
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:53,000
- Sure. 
 - Okay.

419
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,459
Be my guest.

420
00:28:55,459 --> 00:28:57,739
Lawyer Xie, let's eat.

421
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:07,100
Can we trust Shi Chuchu?

422
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,319
That depends on if she dares to sell her stocks.

423
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:12,580
Just test her out, and we'll know.

424
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:23,359
Director Shi, don't be fooled by them.

425
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:26,580
A'Yan needs you now more than ever.

426
00:29:33,259 --> 00:29:35,219
I didn't betray Zeliang.

427
00:29:35,219 --> 00:29:38,899
Actually, we've been putting on a show.

428
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:43,820
Zeliang wants me to tell you not to worry about Ocean.

429
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:47,480
He's received the recording you sent. This evidence is crucial.

430
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,720
But right now, there's something more important that I have to verify with you.

431
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,399
Is your sister still alive?

432
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,040
Is Xie Minghao using her to threaten you?

433
00:29:57,419 --> 00:29:58,440
That's right.

434
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,939
Indeed, she's still alive.

435
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:04,739
So Zeliang is right.

436
00:30:04,739 --> 00:30:09,220
He said that your sister is likely to be locked up in the apartment building where Xie Minghao lives.

437
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,559
Do you know the exact location?

438
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,219
Zeliang wants to rescue her.

439
00:30:13,219 --> 00:30:16,240
In the last few days, I've been observing Xie Minghao.

440
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,132
Combining with what you just said,

441
00:30:18,132 --> 00:30:23,360
I can basically tell that my sister is held in the apartment below Xie Minghao's unit.

442
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,360
The neighbor from the unit below said that Xie Minghao owns two units in the building,

443
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,300
and suspects that he has two wives.

444
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,980
That proves that she has met him downstairs before.

445
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,019
I don't know which unit it is.

446
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:38,839
But I guess it's not too far from 1503.

447
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:43,260
This is great. This can help us narrow it down.

448
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:46,940
Xie Minghao has been meaning to take me out for a Western dinner.

449
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,959
How about this?

450
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:50,720
Tomorrow, I'll ask him out at 7:00 in the evening.

451
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,699
Help me inform A'Yan and tell him to get my sister out of there.

452
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,480
Don't worry.

453
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,380
But if we get Xieqing out, what about you?

454
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,220
Just give me a call and let me know.

455
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,440
There are more solutions than there are problems.

456
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,359
Be careful.

457
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,240
Mr. Li.

458
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:21,580
I've checked. 1603 is the only unit in the building that's registered under Xie Minghao's name.

459
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,900
I'm not surprised.

460
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,240
Xie Minghao is always very cautious.

461
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,780
Even if he has rented another unit, he'll not use his own name.

462
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,739
Should I get people to check from house to house?

463
00:31:31,739 --> 00:31:34,240
No. This will surely alert Xie Minghao.

464
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,219
Before you can find her, he might already have her transferred elsewhere.

465
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:50,160
 Xieyi. Chuchu has spoken to me.

466
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,879
I understand whatever you're doing. But I want to tell you this.

467
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:56,039
My greatest regret in life

468
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:00,020
 is failing to save Uncle Shen on that rainy night.

469
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:05,360
So, tomorrow,

470
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,680
I'm going to get your sister out of there.

471
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,179
I won't make you sad anymore.

472
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:14,819
 I don't want you to cry, and I won't make you cry again.

473
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:16,519
Xieyi.

474
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:21,117
To the world, you may be one person.

475
00:32:21,117 --> 00:32:24,860
But to me, you mean the world.

476
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,679
 Xieyi. Come back.

477
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,900
A'Yan.

478
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,879
Wait for my return.

479
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,380
This way, please.

480
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,599
Sir, I'll ask the kitchen to get the food ready.

481
00:32:57,599 --> 00:32:59,519
- Go on. 
 - Okay.

482
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,980
Do you still remember this song?

483
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:25,910
This is a famous tango. "Por una Cabeza."

484
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:28,600
That's right. "Por una Cabeza."

485
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,219
It's like the distance between us.

486
00:33:30,219 --> 00:33:34,200
So near, yet so far like we're separated by a galaxy.

487
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,319
Do you remember the first time we met?

488
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:56,019
Of course.

489
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:58,900
It was snowing that day.

490
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,019
You were bullied by people by the side of the road.

491
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:04,399
Not only were you skinny, but you were also thinly dressed too.

492
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,740
If I say I was frozen before I met you,

493
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,660
well, I melted the moment I met you.

494
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:15,560
At that time, the video store behind me was playing this song.

495
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,780
I will never forget that moment in my life.

496
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:31,779
How great would it be if we could go back in time?

497
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:33,700
If we could go back in time,

498
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:37,450
if I could give you that doll back then,

499
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:40,539
would I be the one you love?

500
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,659
Brother Minghao. There are no ifs in life.

501
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,541
This way, please.

502
00:35:01,541 --> 00:35:03,515

503
00:35:03,515 --> 00:35:06,260
I left something in the car. You guys can go ahead.

504
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,760
I'll go and get it.

505
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,239
All right. We'll wait for you on the third floor then.

506
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:12,000
- All right. 
 - Okay.

507
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,779
Sir, let me introduce this listing. It's really hard to come by.

508
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:42,181
Thank you so much for spending such a romantic night with me.

509
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,059
Here's a little surprise for you.

510
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:47,559
Your favorite dessert in Germany.

511
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:48,679
Thank you.

512
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,179
You're welcome.

513
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:55,920
Hi, who's this?

514
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,780
 Hi, is this Lawyer Xie?

515
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,180
Yes. What is it?

516
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,780
 Are you at home?

517
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,780
I'm not. Why?

518
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,359
Two people came to view the units here.

519
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:07,999
They look like the creditors in the photo you showed me.

520
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,180
Are you sure?

521
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,479
It might be a mistake if it was only one person.

522
00:36:15,479 --> 00:36:18,299
But if both guys resemble the creditors, it won't be wrong.

523
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,360
Okay. I got it. Thank you.

524
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:33,160
Xieyi. It's time to leave.

525
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,360
What's the matter?

526
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,439
Someone broke into the house. I need to go and take a look.

527
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:42,820
Since someone gave you a call earlier, it means they'd take care of it.

528
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:46,500
At least, let me finish the dessert first.

529
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,579
I said, let's go home.

530
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,860
Is anyone in there?

531
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:02,619
Is anyone in there?

532
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,419
Is anyone in there?

533
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,855
- What's the matter? 
 - Hi.

534
00:37:26,855 --> 00:37:28,239
Have you seen this guy?

535
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:29,739
I don't know him!

536
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,899
Xieqing!

537
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:43,639
Xieqing!

538
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:45,760
It's me.

539
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,199
Xieqing!

540
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:48,899
 I'm here!

541
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,019
Xieqing! Xieqing!

542
00:37:53,019 --> 00:37:55,199
I'm here!

543
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,839
Wait here for me. I'll be right back.

544
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,559
Xieqing? Xieqing?

545
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:36,240
How are you?

546
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:44,159
You're having a fever. Let's go.

547
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:45,659
Come on.

548
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,380
Xieqing?

549
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,719
Xieqing?

550
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,239
Xieyi.

551
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,939
Su Xieyi?

552
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,519
Xieyi?

553
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:14,039
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

554
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:15,480
 I don't want you to cry,

555
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,360
 and I won't make you cry again.

556
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,398
 Xieyi.

557
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,600
 To the world, you may be one person.

558
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:27,240
 But to me, you mean the world.

559
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,400
 Xieyi. Come back.

560
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:34,149
♫  Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

561
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:41,740
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

562
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,920
♫  And turn to face all the long lost times  ♫

00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,420
A'Yan, I'm back.

♫  You don't have to be brave all the time  ♫

♫  a new passenger takes a seat   ♫

♫  But in my heart, I secretly ask  ♫

580
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,890
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

581

♫  How's it going with him?  ♫

582
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:14,380
♫  I bet his temper  ♫

♫  is better than mine  ♫

584

♫  your complicated thoughts  ♫

586
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:24,160
♫  Does he hold you when you're sad?  ♫

587

♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

♫  Do you want to hear what I haven't said?  ♫

590

♫  and recall all of our memories?  ♫
