00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:25,100
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

3
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:33,210
♫  Still haunts me now and then in quiet nights  ♫

4
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:41,230
♫  And turn to face all the long lost times  ♫

5
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,370
♫  Brace the pain  ♫

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:51,210
♫  Let memories wake up from oceans deep  ♫

7
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,150
♫  No place to hide  ♫

8
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,350
♫  No way to run  ♫

♫  New dawn counts down  ♫

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,030
♫  I fight  ♫

11
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,010
♫  I cry  ♫

12
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,600
♫  I give up  ♫

♫  Memories forgotten, forsaken surround  ♫

14
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:23,930
♫  Memory of us in the last life  ♫

15
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:32,370
♫  Still haunts now and then in quiet nights  ♫

16
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:40,750
♫  Shivering, waiting for the light  ♫

17
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:49,550
♫  When morning comes from the other side  ♫

18
00:01:49,550 --> 00:02:00,150

19
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,950

20
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,640
My dad died

21
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:12,660
because he'd seen through your true colors.

22
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,180
Zeliang!

23
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,420
You need evidence.

24
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,680
You can't make a baseless accusation.

25
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,000
Your father must have taught you this.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,460
Evidence?

27
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,539
You were the one who bought these artworks.

28
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:31,419
Those who came today were all experts.

29
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,839
They could tell in a glance if these are worth the money.

30
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,120
All these years,

31
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,599
you have worked so hard

32
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:47,440
to gain the trust of all those in Ocean Group, especially those shareholders.

33
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,170
Well done.

34
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,180
But if I were

35
00:02:53,019 --> 00:03:00,540
to open this door now and reveal these so-called artworks,

36
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,201
what do you think the consequences will be?

37
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,960
The image that you've tried so hard to build

38
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,820
all these years would be destroyed.

39
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,580
What are you trying to do?

40
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:49,960
Little by little, I'll get back what's rightfully mine.

41
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,219
Fine.

42
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,700
What do you want?

43
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,600
This is a declaration.

44
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:23,799
Uncle. Please have a look.

45
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,581

46
00:04:31,581 --> 00:04:33,080

47
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,080

48
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:43,199
As compared to the tricks you pulled back then to steal my father's shares,

49
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,780
what I did today is nothing.

50
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:57,239
Whether to open the door or

51
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,299
to sign the paper.

52
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,200
Uncle. It's up to you.

53
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,878
On behalf of Ocean Group,

54
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:38,800
I would like to thank you all once again for your support.

55
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,399
 At the same time, I would like to thank Mr. Roman again.

56
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,940
 Thank you for your trust in our work.

57
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,559
I'm glad we didn't let you down.

58
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:23,470
♫  When dark clouds over the starry sky in the dark  ♫

59
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:29,270
♫  When the glimmer lights up my eyes when I am lost  ♫

60
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:36,950
♫  The tears and wounds hidden behind your smile  ♫

61
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:43,340
♫  Leave it to me, and you should be happier  ♫

62
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:49,260
 A'Yan. I really wish we could go back in time to the day we met.

63
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,439
 I thought that would be the beginning of my happiness.

64
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:55,460
 But I never thought things would change.

65
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:03,310
 At least, there's one thing that hasn't changed.

66
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:09,200
♫  There's no need to be afraid of darkness anymore  ♫

67
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,979
 I've never forgotten about you.

68
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:17,620
♫  I'll brave the waves for you  ♫

69
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:23,730
♫  You don't have to be brave all the time  ♫

70
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,200
♫  Please believe that I am by your side  ♫

71
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,620
♫  To embrace the fragility right in front of your eyes  ♫

72
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,519
♫  And hug you at the moment you feel like crying  ♫

73
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:36,640
Xieyi. Why did you come back?

74
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,400
Was it raining heavily that day?

75
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,999
Which day?

76
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,620
The day you saved my dad.

77
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,600
 Uncle Shen!

78
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,540
 Uncle Shen, what are you doing?

79
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,859
 Li Zeliang.

80
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:14,979
 Uncle Shen. Don't do anything rash.

81
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:19,040
 I just found out that they went over my head and signed a contract with you.

82
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,479
 What... What's going on? You can just tell me.

83
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:25,099
 It's too late.

84
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,219
 It's all too late.

85
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:30,020
 I've pleaded with Chairman Huo.

86
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,259
 There's no way I could provide the goods in time.

87
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:36,040
 But he refused to accept any less of the penalty.

88
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,840
 He wants to force Zhiwei into a corner.

89
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,680
 It's not like that, Uncle Shen.

90
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,519
 We have to believe in the law.

91
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:46,879
 No matter what happens, we can solve it by legal means.

92
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,940
 We'll look into it if there's a problem.

93
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,240
 - Stop looking into it! 
 - All right!

94
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,220
 I won't. Don't move!

95
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,719
 No investigation.

96
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:57,520
 But think about it.

97
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,219
 Y-You still have your family. Right?

98
00:09:02,219 --> 00:09:03,620
 You still have your family.

99
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,559
 They need you.

100
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,459
 No matter what the problem is, we can solve it together.

101
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:12,259
 That's right.

102
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,140
 For my family's sake.

103
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,620
 Uncle Shen!

104
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:34,379
 Uncle Shen! Hold on tight!

105
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:36,040
 Don't let go!

106
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,740
 I'll hold on to you!

107
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,220
 Don't let go!

108
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,120
 Promise me.

109
00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:49,960
 It all ends here.

110
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:28,540
Dr. Wu said you injured your leg trying to save someone.

111
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:33,039
Rain and rust caused your wounds to become infected.

112
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:37,720
The day you got injured was the same day my dad jumped off the building.

113
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:43,739
If Dr. Wu hadn't called,

114
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,180
were you planning to keep it a secret forever?

115
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,720
Sorry, Xieyi.

116
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,139
I've tried my best.

117
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,200
Sorry, A'Yan.

118
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,740
I'm sorry.

119
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:23,659
I was wrong about you.

120
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,340
I'm sorry.

121
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,600
I'm sorry.

122
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,199
I'm so sorry.

123
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,159
All right, silly girl.

124
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,500
Stop crying.

125
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,719
I'm fine, aren't I?

126
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,240
Have a seat.

127
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,380
Sit.

128
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:18,160
Xieyi. You should leave tomorrow.

129
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:22,979
Why? Because of Huo Jian?

130
00:12:22,979 --> 00:12:27,699
My relationship with Huo Jian isn't as simple as you thought.

131
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:32,424
Besides wanting to take control of Ocean,

132
00:12:32,424 --> 00:12:37,099
he might have something to do with my dad's death.

133
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,294
What do you mean?

134
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:51,019
My dad called me the day before he died.

135
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:55,879
He said Huo Jian is not as simple as he seems.

136
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:58,819
He also said he would relieve Huo Jian of some of his duties,

137
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,400
after he was discharged from the hospital.

138
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,820
So by the time you rushed back,

139
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:08,720
your dad had already passed away.

140
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,240
I went to the hospital to investigate the cause of death.

141
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,760
According to the report from the hospital, my dad's condition deteriorated, and he died of natural causes.

142
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,240
But the last person my dad met before he died was Huo Jian.

143
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,740
Also,

144
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:31,320
he even signed an equity grant agreement and awarded Huo Jian 10 percent of the shares.

145
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,220
That's very unusual.

146
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:40,379
Later on, I've been secretly conducting my own investigation.

147
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:45,020
I've investigated all the people who might have been in contact with my dad before his passing.

148
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,400
I've heard from Brother Minghao too.

149
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,900
That's right.

150
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,519
I've looked into almost everyone.

151
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:54,780
But there was no evidence.

152
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:01,039
But there's only one person who hasn't been found.

153
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,999
Who is it?

154
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,859
Spider, a man by the name Liu A'Wei.

155
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,160
According to the scheduling report, on the day my dad died,

156
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,220
he happened to be cleaning the glass outside the building.

157
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,200
But after that day,

158
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:22,779
he resigned and disappeared.

159
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:28,099
So... I suspect that he must have seen something he wasn't meant to see,

160
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:32,750
or he got his hands on some secrets. That's why he went missing.

161
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,240
Huo Jian has been looking for this person as well.

162
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,479
This all the more proves his guilty conscience and fear.

163
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:44,340
Well, have you found him?

164
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,260
Yingsong has been looking for him.

165
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,179
But so far, there's nothing definite yet.

166
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,660
A'Yan. I'll look for him with you, all right?

167
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,600
Only by finding him can we convict Huo Jian.

168
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:15,359
Xieyi. The kind of things Huo Jian would do

169
00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:17,260
is beyond anything you could imagine.

170
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,730
Once he finds out that I'm looking for Spider,

171
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,930
it might drive him into a corner, and he'll resort to any means.

172
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:29,520
So this is what worries you and that's why you want me to leave?

173
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:45,279
They've all been telling me that if we stay together, we'll become each other's weak spot.

174
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,280
But right now, there's no more secret between us.

175
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,779
We have a common enemy, Huo Jian.

176
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:54,719
We, too, can be each other's armor.

177
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:09,240
A’Yan, I don't want to hide behind you.

178
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,039
No matter what happens in the future,

179
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:14,660
I'll face it with you.

180
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,410
♫  I'm sorry I wasn't there for you  ♫

181
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:22,230
♫  Listen to my heart  ♫

182
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,021
Xieyi.

183
00:16:27,021 --> 00:16:30,820
♫  Then I'd have such wings  ♫

184
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,050
♫  To fly up to the sky  ♫

185
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:37,940
♫  Even if I'll melt away  ♫

186
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:42,590
♫  To give you love  ♫

187
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,907

188
00:16:56,907 --> 00:16:58,679
There's a fridge over here.

189
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:00,760
Sure, Sir. I'm on it.

190
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,000
Come on. Let's get out.

191
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,500
Hurry.

192
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,120
We're almost done. Turn off the lights.

193
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,700
You should at least leave one on for me.

194
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,280
Can't sleep?

195
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,320
What a beautiful stage.

196
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,260
I was this close. Just this close

197
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:08,540
in completing the most perfect performance of my own life.

198
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,359
What matters is you're fine now.

199
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:13,260
Well, you can have any stages you want.

200
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:17,000
What's the matter? Why are you being so gentle today?

201
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,759
Well, you're our invited guest.

202
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:22,720
I'm just trying to play nice.

203
00:18:23,739 --> 00:18:27,619
Is it because Xieyi is back? That's why you can't sleep too?

204
00:18:27,619 --> 00:18:30,119
Why are you so annoying?

205
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:34,459
I can't even have a proper conversation with you.

206
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,079
I remember the last time we went on such a big stage

207
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:51,119
was when our music club had a graduation performance.

208
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:53,939
Back then, you were still a drummer.

209
00:18:56,459 --> 00:18:59,400
Actually, you played the drums well.

210
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,399
If you hadn't quit the music club, it probably would still exist.

211
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,659
I don't like playing drums.

212
00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:08,039
I know.

213
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:11,660
You joined the music club because A'Liang was there.

214
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:22,400
Do you really hate playing drums that much?

215
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,380
Whenever I saw you playing the drums, you did quite an awesome job.

216
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,759
Maybe it's because I don't like music.

217
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:32,459
Right.

218
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:35,599
It's very difficult for people to find something that they love to do.

219
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:39,100
But I think you should give yourself more chances to try things out.

220
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,699
You're right.

221
00:19:45,699 --> 00:19:48,179
I should give myself a chance.

222
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:50,679
That's right. It's fine if you don't like rock and roll.

223
00:19:50,699 --> 00:19:53,240
But you have to like the spirit of rock and roll.

224
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,200
Be brave to explore things, especially when making journeys into the unknown.

225
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,079
Or...

226
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,920
Or you can try exploring what's around you.

227
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,659
Thank you for the encouragement.

228
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:21,359
I get it now.

229
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,920
Well, it's getting late. Rest earlier.

230
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,739
Encouragement?

231
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,780
That's right.

232
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,480
Didn't you tell me to be braver?

233
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,499
I admit. I was too afraid of failure.

234
00:20:35,499 --> 00:20:39,680
That's why I kept putting myself in a safe spot.

235
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,780
But today, when the moment Su Xieyi pushed the door and walked in,

236
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,599
it suddenly hit me.

237
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:49,879
I'm lacking that tiny bit of bravery as compared to her.

238
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,740
Thank you.

239
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:00,340
Go back and rest earlier.

240
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,520
Braveness?

241
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,620
I clearly emphasized exploring.

242
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,220
Exploring the people around you.

243
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,920

244
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,220

245
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:16,900
Hello?

246
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,700
Brother Minghao.

247
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:25,339
Brother Minghao. I'm sorry.

248
00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:27,599
 I'm back in Yunfeng.

249
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:29,599
Is that so?

250
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,619
A'Yan injured his leg trying to save my dad.

251
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:38,480
When I first learned the news, my mind went completely blank.

252
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,200
I couldn't control myself.

253
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:46,019
So... I'm sorry.

254
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,380
I feel relieved now after hearing your voice.

255
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,979
You left all of a sudden.

256
00:22:52,979 --> 00:22:54,419
I've been worried about you.

257
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:58,839
It felt like I'd just snapped back to reality.

258
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:00,319
Don't worry.

259
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:02,240
I'm safe now.

260
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,440
I won't go over there then.

261
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,740
See you in Shanghai.

262
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,199
Okay.

263
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:03,579
Sister! I grabbed this doll myself.

264
00:24:03,579 --> 00:24:05,880
- Could you give it back to me? 
 - So what if you grabbed it?

265
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,680
- I want to play with it! 
 - Give it back to me!

266
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,359
- I will not! 
 - Give it back to me!

267
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:11,019
- No! 
 - Give it back to me!

268
00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:12,799
I won't!

269
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,259
I'll tell Mom about it!

270
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:16,999
There's no point! I want to play with it!

271
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:19,540
Dad! Sister took my doll!

272
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:23,519
That doll is mine! She's the one who tried to take it!

273
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,119
 Ming Hao.

274
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:30,199
 Uncle Shen. Xieqing.

275
00:24:30,199 --> 00:24:32,640
 We're just having a meal. Why did you bring all these?

276
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,119
 Just a little something from me.

277
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:36,219
 Dad. Minghao makes a lot of money now.

278
00:24:36,219 --> 00:24:38,739
 He just won the Lawyer Rising Star Award.

279
00:24:38,739 --> 00:24:41,480
 Really? I've always thought highly of you.

280
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,799
 Uncle Shen. Without your support and encouragement over the years,

281
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,499
 I wouldn't be where I am today.

282
00:24:46,499 --> 00:24:48,780
 Please do accept this gift from me.

283
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,140
 No more next time, all right?

284
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,300
 - Have a seat. 
 - Dad.

285
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,900
 Sister.

286
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,540
 I'm back.

287
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,860
 Where have you been? We're waiting for you.

288
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,799
 I went to buy crab noodles.

289
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,839
 Look who's here.

290
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:04,619
 This is...

291
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:06,599
 That's Brother Minghao.

292
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:08,320
 Hi, Brother Minghao.

293
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:15,219
 Hi.

294
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:17,519
 Let's eat.

295
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:20,040
 - Okay. 
 - Take a seat over here.

296
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,119
 You have been abroad all these years.

297
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:29,279
 I didn't get to really take care of you.

298
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,019
 Your mom is gone now.

299
00:25:32,019 --> 00:25:33,839
 Move back in, all right?

300
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:36,200
 That's right, Xieyi. Dad misses you a lot.

301
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,380
 Dad. I just enrolled at the University of Hannover.

302
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,480
 After I graduated, I'll come home, and keep you company every day.

303
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,839
 And sister too.

304
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:46,939
 That's great.

305
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,256
 Why didn't you discuss it with me before you applied for the hotel management course?

306
00:25:51,256 --> 00:25:53,519
 Hotel management is a kind of management too.

307
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:57,319
 Besides, sister is helping you to manage the business now.

308
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:01,079
 Sweet talker. Eat up. Hurry.

309
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:02,200
 Eat up.

310
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,700
 Minghao.

311
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,660
 Eat up.

312
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,840
 Thank you.

313
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,400
 Here.

314
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,380
 - Eat more. 
 - Thank you, Dad.

315
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,600
 Here's the claw.

316
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,359
 Okay, that's enough.

317
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:22,640
 Here. Eat more.

318
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,200
 Dad, you too.

319
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,119
 It's beautiful.

320
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,960
 It's for me, right?

321
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,580
 Do you like dolls?

322
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,000
 I love them.

323
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,860
 I've been trying to grab one, but I couldn't get any.

324
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:30,100
 Grab more for me next time.

325
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,859
 Sure.

326
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:38,440
 Xieyi just returned from abroad. What does she like to eat?

327
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,200
 My treat tonight.

328
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,440
 Well, let's go to my favorite restaurant.

329
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,840
 All right.

330
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:37,820
- How did it go? 
 - Mr. Li, the special fund for the hearing impaired in cooperation with the hospital has been formally established.

331
00:28:38,939 --> 00:28:40,539
Thank you.

332
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:44,420
Let's hope it can help more families in need.

333
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:48,519
Oh, right. Any leads on Liu A'Wei?

334
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:52,340
The hospital provided us with a list of patients who had

335
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,119
undergone surgery in their hospital in the past two years.

336
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:55,499
There's a total of 63 patients.

337
00:28:55,499 --> 00:28:59,719
One of them is Liu Xiaxiao with Liu A'Wei's name under the family signature column.

338
00:28:59,719 --> 00:29:01,640
- Really? 
 - That's right.

339
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:06,100
Also, the surgery date is exactly one month after Liu A'Wei disappeared.

340
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,799
That should be it.

341
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:09,419
Did you find out where they are?

342
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:12,218
One month ago, Liu Xiaoxiao once went back to the hospital.

343
00:29:12,218 --> 00:29:13,839
There are follow-up records.

344
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,739
The contact number given is out of service.

345
00:29:15,739 --> 00:29:19,580
There's only one known address, which is a small town called Yun'an,

346
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,839
with no house number.

347
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:23,559
Good job.

348
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:28,079
It looks like Liu A'Wei and his family have moved there.

349
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:29,119
All right.

350
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:31,440
I'll send people to Yun'an to investigate it.

351
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,280
It's not that big of a town. We should get something soon.

352
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,579
Be careful. Take caution.

353
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:40,759
Don't let Huo Jian find out.

354
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:43,440
I just forced him to sign the withdrawal agreement.

355
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,359
He must be holding a grudge.

356
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:48,279
I don't want to drive him into a corner just yet.

357
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:49,979
Understood.

358
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,420
You may go now.

359
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,000
The auction was a big success.

360
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,820
There is much news reporting on it not only locally,

361
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,559
but internationally as well.

362
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,659
That's right. This is by far the most successful

363
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:14,279
promotion of Ocean's corporate image in recent years.

364
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:17,639
Director Li sure lives up to expectations.

365
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:19,499
Don't say that.

366
00:30:19,499 --> 00:30:24,960
All thanks to your support that makes this auction a great success.

367
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,520
All right. Next, I have an important announcement to make.

368
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,939
I've decided to officially resign as the chairman effective today,

369
00:30:34,939 --> 00:30:37,640
and I will also withdraw myself

370
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,899
from the next chairman re-election meeting.

371
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:42,419
Chairman Huo. Why is that?

372
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:45,199
Old Li entrusted these burdens to me

373
00:30:45,199 --> 00:30:49,300
simply because Zeliang was still young back then.

374
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,540
But as you can see,

375
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:54,920
be it in terms of physical health or abilities,

376
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,479
Zeliang is capable to shoulder these burdens now.

377
00:30:58,479 --> 00:31:02,040
The student has outdone the teacher.

378
00:31:02,699 --> 00:31:05,900
My only interests are keeping fish and doing sports.

379
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,459
I can finally take a break now.

380
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,739
Right?

381
00:31:17,379 --> 00:31:19,599
- For you. 
 - Thank you.

382
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:21,479
Here. This is for you.

383
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:22,640
Thank you.

384
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,859
For you, Mingyue.

385
00:31:24,859 --> 00:31:27,519
Nice one, girl. What a huge box.

386
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,620
I brought these local products all the way from Jiangcheng.

387
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:34,220
Have your fill. Given your appetite, I'm sure you can finish it.

388
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:37,419
Congratulations! The auction was a big success.

389
00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:39,960
Director Li has finally made a name for himself.

390
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,219
You sure are very well-informed.

391
00:31:42,219 --> 00:31:43,480
Of course.

392
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,880
We didn't know Director Li so well back then.

393
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:49,680
I'll make it clear.

394
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,520
I have no intention to curry favor with you.

395
00:31:54,019 --> 00:31:56,979
It takes time to get to know someone.

396
00:31:56,979 --> 00:31:58,508
Most importantly,

397
00:31:58,508 --> 00:32:02,420
knowing that he's a good person is all that matters.

398
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,799
Love really is the best skincare product.

399
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:12,640
You're glowing now whenever you talk about Director Li.

400
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,559
Am I?

401
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,640
Shocking news!

402
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,880
What is it?

403
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,259
Chairman Huo resigned ahead of schedule at the board meeting earlier.

404
00:32:24,139 --> 00:32:25,459
What?

405
00:32:25,459 --> 00:32:28,599
Xieyi, Director Shi wants you at her office.

406
00:32:31,419 --> 00:32:32,819
Come in.

407
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,939
Okay. Don't worry.

408
00:32:39,939 --> 00:32:42,919
I'll get this taken care of before noon.

409
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,180
Okay.

410
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,400
- Do you want something to drink? 
 - It's okay.

411
00:33:00,459 --> 00:33:03,640
Welcome back, Miss Su.

412
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,160
I know what you want to ask.

413
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,459
I know it's for my own good.

414
00:33:08,459 --> 00:33:11,080
But I think there are many things in this world

415
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,979
that are more important than one's personal safety.

416
00:33:13,979 --> 00:33:17,700
That's why I came back, and I'm not planning to leave.

417
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,279
That's up to you to decide. It's within your rights as well.

418
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,180
No explanation needed.

419
00:33:23,699 --> 00:33:26,019
What do you want to ask then?

420
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,730
Do you still remember what we talked about the other day?

421
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:35,359
You said that I like Zeliang.

422
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,860
You were right.

423
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:41,319
So I want to tell you that from this moment onward,

424
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:44,240
I'll officially be competing with you.

425
00:33:53,459 --> 00:33:56,500
Sorry, Director Shi. It slipped out of my hands.

426
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,000
I'm here to deliver the documents.

427
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,380
If there's nothing else, I'll get going then.

428
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,019
Hi, Director L-Li.

429
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:14,659
Have you seen Xieyi?

430
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:17,719
She... she's inside.

431
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,059
What are you two talking about?

432
00:34:37,459 --> 00:34:42,159
Nothing. Just having a casual chat with Xieyi.

433
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:55,339
All right.

434
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:00,999
It's lunchtime. Join us for lunch.

435
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:03,880
Go ahead. I have things to do.

436
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,160
All right. We'll get going then.

437
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:14,199
Bye, Director Shi.

438
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,220

439
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:32,699
Didn't I say I would treat you to a rice bowl?

440
00:35:32,699 --> 00:35:34,159
Why are you having noodles?

441
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:36,840
I heard that Huo Jian had resigned ahead of schedule.

442
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,419
Given his character, he wouldn't give up that easily.

443
00:35:40,419 --> 00:35:43,400
Of course. I found out that he made a quick buck

444
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,599
from the purchase of art in the company name, and used it against him.

445
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:50,219
So he had no choice but to sign the resignation and withdrawal agreement.

446
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:54,220
That way, he could at least step down with dignity.

447
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,979
He agreed just like that?

448
00:35:55,979 --> 00:35:57,239
I've said it before.

449
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:58,800
As long as he withdraws himself from the re-election,

450
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,979
I'll wipe the slate clean.

451
00:36:00,979 --> 00:36:04,979
Li Zeliang, have you forgotten what he has done to our families?

452
00:36:04,979 --> 00:36:07,959
The reason I came back is to deal with him.

453
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:11,480
For the sake of the position as a chairman, you're going to spare him just like?

454
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,700
I didn't say I was going to spare him.

455
00:36:15,939 --> 00:36:20,139
Xieyi. We can't rush things.

456
00:36:20,139 --> 00:36:22,400
Take it one step at a time.

457
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,128
Besides, Huo Jian's most heinous crime

458
00:36:25,128 --> 00:36:29,380
isn't the one that's financially related, but murder.

459
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:35,560
Are you saying that we should hit him where it hurts?

460
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,960
Yingsong will be able to find Spider's whereabouts soon.

461
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,939
This time, I'll show no mercy.

462
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,880
 I've made an appointment with my dad

463
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,719
 at eight o'clock tonight.

464
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:55,099
Okay. See you tonight.

465
00:36:57,737 --> 00:36:58,639
Who is it?

466
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:03,499
Chuchu. We received great support from Hengye Bank for the auction.

467
00:37:03,499 --> 00:37:07,659
Whatever it is, I should meet President Shi and thank him.

468
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:12,619
So I asked Chuchu to help me arrange an appointment with her dad.

469
00:37:12,619 --> 00:37:14,359
That's right.

470
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,800
Director Shi is quite a nice person.

471
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,199
That's right. I've known her for a long time.

472
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:23,199
She's always been very outstanding.

473
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:26,400
If this is in the novel,

474
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,559
you two will be the ideal and lovely couple

475
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:31,840
whose families are of equal rank.

476
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,339
That's right. Look.

477
00:37:46,339 --> 00:37:50,559
Chuchu and I grew up together.

478
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:53,499
Also, we'd always been classmates.

479
00:37:53,499 --> 00:37:55,460
During class, we would be comparing our grades.

480
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,700
After school, we would play together.

481
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,679
So the terms "lovely"

482
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:03,600
and "ideal couple" don't do us justice.

483
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,800
You have to add "childhood sweethearts" too.

484
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,860
How about adding "innocent playmates?"

485
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:12,079
Indeed.

486
00:38:13,939 --> 00:38:15,839
But...

487
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,199
Director Shi is so highly competent and she lacks femininity.

488
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:22,519
You probably don't know.

489
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:25,639
Since she was a kid, she was like a tomboy.

490
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:29,239
She had short hair and often followed me around.

491
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:33,180
I remember there was once a man who mistook her for a boy.

492
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,139
She totally went nuts.

493
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:42,160
Also, Director Shi is an average-looking girl.

494
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,660
Her eyes are too big.

495
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,840
Sometimes, the way she stares at me gives me the creeps.

496
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,858
Don't you think so?

497
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,800
Most importantly, she has a great temperament.

498
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,159
- I really can't— 
 - That's enough.

499
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:57,920
Director Shi isn't as bad as you said she is.

500
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,599
So many girls desire to be as outstanding as she is.

501
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:03,559
Besides, she probably has a long queue

502
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:05,599
of potential suitors and admirers.

503
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:09,519
No matter how outstanding she is, you're the only one I like.

504
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,800
Why did you say that all of a sudden?

505
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,320
I didn't ask who you like.

506
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:28,639
If you're worried, come with me to the dinner.

507
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:30,539
What do you think?

508
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:34,399
Forget it. I'll pass on the high-end dinner.

509
00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:37,200
I have a date tonight.

510
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,739
You do? With whom?

511
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:41,000
Chestnut.

512
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,160
I haven't played with it for some time.

513
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,420
All right then. Keep it company.

514
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,280
I'll be back soon.

515
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,679
Speaking of which, you added so much vinegar to the noodles.

516
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:03,119
Is it still edible?

517
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,720
Yes. And it's heavenly.

518
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,499
I should just eat mine.

519
00:40:24,099 --> 00:40:26,839
Are you really willing to just give up the position as chairman?

520
00:40:27,579 --> 00:40:29,820
I've said this before.

521
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,299
No matter how high the position is, it's just a position.

522
00:40:32,299 --> 00:40:36,300
What I want is to become Ocean's largest shareholder.

523
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,099
But I'm worried that once you make way,

524
00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:41,400
it will allow Li Zeliang to build momentum,

525
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,199
and it'll be hard to stop it later on.

526
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:46,280
Do you know what it means to make concessions to gain advantages?

527
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,239
This is what we have discovered.

528
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:52,619
Oscar has been helping Li Zeliang to find Spider.

529
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:55,819
What a good buddy.

530
00:40:55,819 --> 00:40:57,400
But worry not.

531
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,760
They are just looking for a needle in a haystack.

532
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,460
They won't find anything.

533
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,640
What if we let them find him?

534
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,719
Are you saying that we give him a fake news

535
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:11,080
to lure Li Zeliang out?

536
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,359
This nephew of mine was bedridden for over a year and a half because of his leg injury.

537
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,880
If anything happens to his leg again, he might have to stay in bed

538
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,159
for another one year and a half or even longer.

539
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:25,840
The chairman re-election is coming.

540
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,974
If he was crippled,

541
00:41:27,974 --> 00:41:33,099
you wouldn't be able to resign even if you wanted to.

542
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,000
Today is your birthday, right?

543
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:49,559
I promised to give you a surprise.

544
00:42:16,479 --> 00:42:18,759
About what we discussed earlier,

545
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,600
I'll leave it to you to get it done.

546
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,960
♫  I need you, I love you  ♫

547
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,510
♫  I'll brave the waves for you  ♫

548
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:37,440
♫  You don't have to be brave all the time  ♫

552
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,590
♫  Halfway through the journey on the train,  ♫

553
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:10,410
♫  a new passenger takes a seat  ♫

554
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:14,740
♫  The bells on the platform are ringing  ♫

00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:17,110
♫  I wave my hands to see the passengers off  ♫

♫  With a one-way ticket stub in your hand  ♫

♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

561

♫  How's it going with him?  ♫

562
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:38,860
♫  I bet his temper is better than mine  ♫

563
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:42,640
♫  He's better at guessing your complicated thoughts  ♫

564
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,640
♫  Does he hold you when you're sad?  ♫

565
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,520
♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

566
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,450
♫  Everything must be going well  ♫

567
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:54,180
♫  Do you want to hear what I haven't said?  ♫

568
00:43:54,180 --> 00:44:01,970
♫  Do lyrics of love songs stir up your emotions and recall all of our memories?  ♫

569
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:05,040
♫  It doesn't seem to be difficult  ♫

570

♫  How have you been lately?  ♫

♫  Everything must be going well  ♫

572

♫  You and fate have not given me an answer  ♫

573
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:43,710
♫  The price of growing up is like a pile of bargaining chip  ♫

574
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:47,660
♫  The wager is who can let go first  ♫

575

♫  Silence is the best that I can do  ♫

♫  Whatever pain and suffering may come,  ♫

580

♫  I'm not afraid at all  ♫

581
