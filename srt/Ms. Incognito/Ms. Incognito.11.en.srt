<i>I'll quit everything now.</i>

6
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:09,433
I'm sorry, Chairman.

7
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:58,800
You want to give up everything and die now?

8
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:10,833
Chairman.

9
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,767
Chairman, you were alive all along?

10
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:18,367
Chairman.

11
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:22,133
Why did you come out?

12
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:23,833
Attorney Lee.

13
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:26,367
Did you know about this too?

14
00:02:26,367 --> 00:02:28,033
Madam.

15
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:33,867
What have you two... What on earth did you do!

16
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:35,233
Explain yourselves.

17
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:36,867
Why don't you let go of me and talk?

18
00:02:36,867 --> 00:02:39,400
Yeong Ran, stop!

19
00:02:40,067 --> 00:02:41,533
Chairman.

20
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:44,300
Have you been toying with me all this time?

21
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,833
Must've been fun, huh?

22
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:49,500
Had fun watching me fight for my life?

23
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,800
It wasn't that fun.

24
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,533
So you knew everything?

25
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,133
Do you even know

26
00:02:57,133 --> 00:03:00,800
how many people got hurt because of you?

27
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,467
So what?

28
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,367
You're broke, but still righteous, huh?

29
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:12,300
Did you think changing your life was that easy?

30
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,667
You want to give up everything now?

31
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:19,200
What? Are you planning to die?

32
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,900
What's this?

[Suicide Note]

34
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,667
Did Ga Seon Yeong write this too?

35
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:31,000
Madam, were you really trying to die?

36
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,933
Chairman.

37
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:35,267
No, I'm fine.

38
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:39,600
When I pointed the gun at her head,
everything became clear.

39
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,500
Even if I die,

40
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,867
Ga Seon Yeong wouldn't release Jeon Dong Min.

41
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:47,467
She'd pin all her crimes on me.

42
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:50,167
And make Jeon Dong Min look like an accomplice.

43
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:51,933
Obviously.

44
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:54,367
Now you're thinking like Seon Yeong.

45
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,967
Chairman.

46
00:03:57,567 --> 00:04:01,333
Why didn't you tell me any of this?

47
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:04,700
I'm a businessman.

48
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,233
I always need multiple
contingency plans to survive.

49
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:10,567
You didn't even trust me?

50
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:14,667
I risked my life coming here

51
00:04:15,433 --> 00:04:18,567
for someone who doesn't trust me.

52
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:20,700
Yeong Ran.

53
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,567
Our relationship

54
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:26,500
is strictly contractual.

55
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,800
Attorney Lee.

56
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:35,200
Amend the will.

57

Chairman.

58
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,867
Not only leave my assets,

59
00:04:38,867 --> 00:04:44,400
but also pass the Gaseong Group
chairmanship to Kim Yeong Ran.

60
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,733
You're giving Madam
the Gaseong Group chair position too?

61
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:52,100
That's the only way to use Gaseong Group's power.

62
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:58,033
How long are you going to let
Seon Yeong control everything?

63
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:02,833
I'm sorry.

64
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,733
I need more time to consider.

65
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,900
Chairman, are you alright?

66
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,800
This won't do. Let me carry you.

67
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,967
Come on, let's go.

68
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,933
Chairman, hold on a little longer.

69
00:05:36,933 --> 00:05:38,600
We're almost there.

70
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,733

74
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,900
How is Chairman now?

75
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,500
As you can see, he doesn't have much time left.

76
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,167
The morphine is causing
occasional dementia symptoms.

77
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:14,767
Ga Seon Yeong already made her move.

78

79

What do we need to do to save Mr. Jeon Dong Min?

80
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:25,367
This is the will personally amended by Chairman.

81
00:07:25,367 --> 00:07:28,467
Let's make it public during Ga Seon Woo's funeral.

82
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:33,200
Before the shareholders' meeting?

83
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,567
By hiding in Muchang and killing the hitman,

84
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:39,233
you've blown our plan to reveal all of

85
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:41,700
Ga Seon Yeong's crimes, haven't you?

86
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,300
Will revealing this really give us any leverage?

87
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,967
At the very least, it'll help us clear

88
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:51,667
Dong Min's name right away.

89
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:56,500
But why on earth

90
00:07:57,467 --> 00:08:01,033
did Chairman deceive so many people?

91
00:08:05,167 --> 00:08:07,733

92
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:09,467

93

95
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,700
<i>The juicier the story,</i>

96
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,467
<i>the longer the press stays focused on our family.</i>

97
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:25,433
<i>That would be shocking, indeed.</i>

98
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:28,067
<i>I don't plan to die.</i>

99
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:29,067
<i>What?</i>

00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:30,800
<i>What do you mean by that?</i>

101

<i>This is the final gamble of my life.</i>

102
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,600

In Korea, there's nothing money can't buy.

106
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,267
Why are you even doing this, Attorney Lee?

107
00:08:56,267 --> 00:08:58,633
Is it just for the success fee?

108
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:00,767
Of course.

109
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:03,600
I'm being paid more than I could ever earn

110
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,533
as a lawyer in a lifetime.

111
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:07,433
Is that all there is to it?

112
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:13,700
Chairman Ga was the one who helped me
when I was a poor student,

113
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,567
he gave me scholarships.

114
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:18,967
I'm repaying that debt now.

115
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:22,167
Let me ask you instead.

116
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:25,267
Why did you choose to get involved in this,
Ms. Kim Yeong Ran?

117
00:09:25,267 --> 00:09:26,600
You could die,

118
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,400
or even end up killing someone else.

119
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,367
Was it really just about the money?

120
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,800
At first, it was all about money.
But now, it's my revenge too.

121
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,833
I won't let her get away with using money

122
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,667
and influence to frame innocent people.

123
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:49,133
I'll expose everything
Ga Seon Yeong did through Gil Ho Se

124
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:51,567
and make sure she pays for it.

125
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:55,100
It's been a while
since we've been on the same page.

126
00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:28,333

127
00:10:36,633 --> 00:10:39,667

128
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,233
Understood.

129
00:10:45,967 --> 00:10:48,733
What about these two?

130
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:51,633
The article should've been published this morning.

131
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:54,867
Prosecutor Kim, make sure the script fits.

132
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:57,767
Yes, don't worry.

133
00:10:57,767 --> 00:10:59,867
There shouldn't be any problems.

134
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:07,300

It's chaos, total chaos!

138
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:13,400
What is?

139
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,067
Did you see the article?

140
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:17,567

143
00:11:26,467 --> 00:11:28,500
- Is this real?
- Shh!

144

Ju Won, go inside first, okay?

146
00:11:34,467 --> 00:11:36,633
- Okay.
- That's right.

147
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:41,167
Hey.

148
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,600
I'll look into this quietly,
so keep your mouth shut.

149
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,900
Kang Seong Tae, if this gets out.
I'll know it came from you, got it?

150
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,967
If you understand, nod.

151
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:53,233
Go on, Ju Won needs to eat.

152
00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:54,867
Eat?

153
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:59,133
You!

154
00:11:59,133 --> 00:12:00,800
Keep your mouth shut!

Madam.

156
00:12:10,433 --> 00:12:13,133
You've been going to the study quite often lately.

157
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:16,933
Isn't Attorney Lee the only one in there?

158
00:12:16,933 --> 00:12:19,467
Why are you so curious about that?

159
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:23,100
You two are dismissed as of today.

160
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,733
What?

161
00:12:25,967 --> 00:12:27,633
Madam,

162

even if we're house staff,
firing us overnight like this

163
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:33,233
is wrongful termination.

164
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:35,367
You must not know this, but...

165
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:36,633
Butler Choi.

166
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:39,567
You've been overcharging

for groceries and supplies.

168

Okay, maybe her, but why me?

170

- No.
- That's...

174

Thank you for your service.

176

Madam, I'll delete all of it.

177
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,500
At least give us some time to pack before we go.

178
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,600
How despicable and petty. Really.

179
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,000
I quit. I'm done.

180
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,067
Are you really quitting?

181
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:14,067
Yeah.

to get a visitation.

to worry about other people?

holding a firearm, on suspicion of murder.

you're not the killer within 48 hours,

You chased Gil Ho Se
because of what happened in Muchang.

211

When Gil Ho Se tried to kill Ga Seon Woo
and commit suicide,

without thinking? Huh?

That's how it went down.

225
00:15:48,633 --> 00:15:52,600
But how did you track down Gil Ho Se anyway?

226
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,733
I investigated through Jeong Woo and found that

227
00:15:55,733 --> 00:15:59,167
Gil Ho Se had ties to Ga Seon Yeong going back to

228
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,067
when he was serving time at Cheongsan Prison.

229
00:16:01,067 --> 00:16:04,367
They also met at a small theater
on the day Ga Seon Woo died.

230
00:16:04,367 --> 00:16:07,900
That kind of alibi was probably
prepared in advance by Ga Seon Yeong.

- You lunatic.
- You only realize now?

but you're crazier than I thought, huh?

00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,767
When Ms. Bu Se Mi gave her final class
at the kindergarten,

542
00:39:36,767 --> 00:39:39,233
[Ms. Bu Se Mi, I miss you, from Ju Won]
the kids wrote these letters to her.

543
00:39:39,233 --> 00:39:41,300
Okay, got it.

544
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,967
By the way, where's the civil affairs office here?

545
00:39:44,967 --> 00:39:46,600
Why the civil affairs office all of a sudden?

546
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,633
I collected petitions from the villagers.

547
00:39:49,633 --> 00:39:52,800
We need to actively publicize Dong Min's
unfair situation and get him out quickly.

548
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,933
You don't have to go this far.

549
00:39:54,933 --> 00:39:55,933
Dong Min will be released soon.

550
00:39:55,933 --> 00:39:57,500
Just go back now.

551
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,500
No...

552
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,867
- Mi Seon.
- Yes.

553
00:39:59,867 --> 00:40:01,033
They said the civil affairs office is that way.

554
00:40:01,033 --> 00:40:04,233
Lee Don, we'll handle things here.
Don't worry too much.

555
00:40:04,233 --> 00:40:06,233
Don, focus on what you can do.

556
00:40:06,233 --> 00:40:08,233
I'll do what I can.

557
00:40:08,233 --> 00:40:09,267
Let's hurry.

558
00:40:09,267 --> 00:40:10,900
- Don, good luck.
- This way?

559
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,800
- Don, stay strong.
- That's not it.

560
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,200
- Mi Seon, it's here.
- Come quick.

561
00:40:17,933 --> 00:40:21,233
Yeah, that's my sister.

562
00:40:33,167 --> 00:40:35,867
Ms. Baek Hye Ji finished her testimony well.

563
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:41,267
Director Kim says she'll be better
after a few more days in the hospital.

564
00:40:41,267 --> 00:40:43,333
Madam, and this...

565
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:45,867
These are letters written
by the kindergarten children themselves.

566
00:40:45,867 --> 00:40:49,633
[Ms. Bu Se Mi, I miss you, from Ju Won]

567
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:58,200
I thought you'd want to know.
The autopsy results just came in.

568
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,533
The gunpowder residue and fingerprints

569
00:41:00,533 --> 00:41:02,467
all match Gil Ho Se.

570
00:41:02,467 --> 00:41:06,867
It's concluded as him killing Ga Seon Woo
before committing suicide.

571
00:41:06,867 --> 00:41:09,967
Dong Min will be released soon.

572
00:41:10,667 --> 00:41:12,600
That was remarkably fast.

573
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,267
Madam, I'm Lee Don.

574
00:41:18,233 --> 00:41:22,733
Now let's return the favor
to Ga Seon Yeong as she deserves.

575
00:41:22,733 --> 00:41:24,467
Let's do that.

576
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,267
- Don.
- Yeah.

577
00:41:39,267 --> 00:41:42,033
Ah, though you already know each other,
I'll introduce properly.

578
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:43,733
This is the heir of Gaseong Group,

579
00:41:43,733 --> 00:41:46,867
not a gold digger, but Madam Kim Yeong Ran.

580
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,933
Seung Hee, sit down.

581
00:41:50,933 --> 00:41:52,567
Okay.

582
00:41:55,267 --> 00:41:58,600
I asked to meet you because I had
something important to deliver.

583
00:42:00,833 --> 00:42:02,800
What's this?

584
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,500
Real name Gil Tae, alias Gil Ho Se.

585
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:09,200
Autopsies confirm Gil Ho Se
is Ga Seon Woo's murderer.

586
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,833
And there's testimony that

587
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:15,333
he tried to kill me in Muchang.

588
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:18,500
What exactly was the relationship
between Ga Seon Woo and Gil Ho Se?

589
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,933
Not Ga Seon Woo, but Ga Seon Yeong.

590
00:42:21,633 --> 00:42:24,900
They met through the Cheongsan Prison
rehabilitation program.

591
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:28,967
They developed a deep connection from then on.

592
00:42:28,967 --> 00:42:32,433
You're saying she killed her own brother?

593
00:42:32,433 --> 00:42:34,200
That's impossible.

594
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:38,500
Such impossible things
happen frequently around here.

595
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:43,433
Reporter Pyo, you should also get payback
from Ga Seon Yeong for what she did.

596
00:42:43,433 --> 00:42:46,900
But last time too,
all the articles got blocked from above.

597
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,300
That absolutely won't happen this time.

598
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,133
Don't worry.

599
00:42:53,633 --> 00:42:55,500
Wait a minute.

600
00:42:57,033 --> 00:43:00,100
It appears that Professor Ga Seon Yeong has been
meeting Gil Ho Se, whose real name is Gil Tae,

601
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:03,067
a prisoner she met
through the rehabilitation program

602
00:43:03,067 --> 00:43:05,967
at Cheongsan Prison, until recently.

603
00:43:05,967 --> 00:43:07,567
So what?

604
00:43:07,567 --> 00:43:10,667
Gil Ho Se was also at the dock
where Vice President Ga Seon Woo died,

605
00:43:10,667 --> 00:43:13,400
yet no news or records mention it.

606
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,267
Doesn't that seem suspicious?

607
00:43:15,267 --> 00:43:17,833
Ten days ago, he even attempted
to kill Kim Yeong Ran.

608
00:43:17,833 --> 00:43:21,533
We've secured all the witness
and victim testimonies from the scene.

609
00:43:21,533 --> 00:43:25,000
Senior, are you going to let this
exclusive story slip away?

610
00:43:26,367 --> 00:43:28,567
Let's do this.

611
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:29,600
Really?

612
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,900
Release it.

613
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,900
Reporting the truth is our mission, right?

614
00:43:37,233 --> 00:43:40,567
Senior! So should I really write the article?

615
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:47,333
Professor.

616
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,300
Professor Ga Seon Yeong.

617
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,633
What brings you here?

618
00:43:53,633 --> 00:43:55,000
You know Gil Ho Se, right?

619
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,733
On the day Mr. Ga Seon Woo died, the last person
he met was you, Ms. Ga Seon Yeong.

620
00:43:58,733 --> 00:44:01,333
We'll need your full cooperation
with the investigation.

621
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:03,433
Wait a moment.

622
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:07,633
That day, I was the one who met
Gil Ho Se, not Professor.

623
00:44:07,633 --> 00:44:09,233
What?

624
00:44:20,467 --> 00:44:23,300
<i>The subscriber you are calling
is not available. After the tone...</i>

625
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,467

evidence of his sister being the mastermind]

629
00:44:50,167 --> 00:44:52,500
Ye Rim.

630
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,400
The humiliation you suffered,

631
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,767
I'm repaying it in full.

632
00:45:45,767 --> 00:45:47,700
Madam.

633
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:50,600
Are you here?

634
00:45:52,233 --> 00:45:54,200
You're not, are you?

635
00:45:58,667 --> 00:46:01,700
It's dirty and despicable, really...

636
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:05,133
Still wet behind the ears, and you,

637
00:46:05,133 --> 00:46:08,533
rising in status through marriage, huh?

638
00:46:08,533 --> 00:46:09,833
'Get out right now?'

639
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:12,533
Fine, I'll leave immediately.

640
00:46:12,533 --> 00:46:16,800
But I'm taking my severance pay with me.

641
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:21,433
I worked my butt off in this house.

642
00:46:26,733 --> 00:46:28,900
But,

643
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:34,100
I was trying to set everything
back to where it belonged.

644
00:46:54,133 --> 00:46:58,800
I ordered Gil Ho Se to kill Kim Yeong Ran.

645
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,467
You know abetment of murder
is treated as murder itself, right?

646
00:47:01,467 --> 00:47:03,133
Mr. Ham Hyeon Woo.

647
00:47:03,133 --> 00:47:05,300
You've worked as Secretary
to Ms. Ga Seon Yeong for a long time, right?

648
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:09,100
Moreover, both Kim Yeong Ran and Baek Hye Ji
survived attempted murders.

649
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,367
One count of murder,

650
00:47:10,367 --> 00:47:13,433
and two counts of attempted murder.

651
00:47:13,433 --> 00:47:17,233
You'll likely face at least ten years in prison.

652
00:47:17,233 --> 00:47:19,533
How much is Ga Seon Yeong offering?

653
00:47:19,533 --> 00:47:23,067
I'll remain silent until my lawyer arrives.

654
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:53,700
It was definitely Chairman, right?

655
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,967
Chairman.

656
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,667
It's really you, right?

657
00:49:06,033 --> 00:49:07,667
Chairman.

658
00:49:12,933 --> 00:49:14,600
He's warm.

659
00:49:21,467 --> 00:49:25,367
Chairman, you're alive?

660
00:49:25,367 --> 00:49:27,900
Give me some water.

661
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:33,300
Yes, yes, Chairman.

662
00:49:34,167 --> 00:49:36,033
Chairman.

663
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:41,000
Here, drink some water.

664
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,367
Oh, my, oh, my.

Chairman.

669
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,933
Do you remember me?

670
00:50:06,933 --> 00:50:09,833
It's me, Butler Choi.

671
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,733
What on earth is going on?

672
00:50:21,967 --> 00:50:23,800
No.

673

Chairman.

674
00:50:27,067 --> 00:50:29,333
Look here.

675
00:50:29,333 --> 00:50:31,600
One, two.

676
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,533
Oh, splendid.

677
00:50:33,533 --> 00:50:36,567
Now, let's take one together too.

678
00:50:36,567 --> 00:50:39,267
One, two, three.

679
00:50:43,933 --> 00:50:46,033
Chairman.

680
00:50:46,033 --> 00:50:49,033
Do you remember Kim Yeong Ran?

681
00:50:49,033 --> 00:50:51,467
She was your security guard.

682
00:50:52,667 --> 00:50:53,967
Who?

683
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:58,067
Ah, the plain-looking one with the pitiful face.

684
00:50:58,067 --> 00:50:59,567
Yeah.

685
00:50:59,567 --> 00:51:01,333
Exactly.

686
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,367
A face that doesn't even stick in memory.

687
00:51:06,467 --> 00:51:10,900
Let me escort you to the bedroom, Chairman.

688
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,933
Here.

689
00:51:16,467 --> 00:51:19,400
Hold your cane.

690
00:51:21,167 --> 00:51:22,900
Good.

691

One, two.

697
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,800
Oh, well done.

699
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,933

700
00:52:04,933 --> 00:52:07,733

705
00:52:42,433 --> 00:52:46,300

with dementia is in the main house.</i>

Yes, so you want me to

turn off all the house CCTV

713

A surprise gift for you.

721
00:54:17,633 --> 00:54:19,767
Don't tell me it's Mr. Dong Min?

722
00:54:19,767 --> 00:54:21,267
He'll be out shortly.

723
00:54:21,267 --> 00:54:24,333

She's even more impatient than Chairman.

725
00:54:40,567 --> 00:54:43,200
I should have bought some tofu.

Prisoner 1227, Jeon Dong Min.

727
00:54:48,767 --> 00:54:50,233
Are these your belongings?

728
00:54:50,233 --> 00:54:51,300
Check them yourself.

00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:52,933
Yes.

[Mr. Dong Min, I'm sorry for leaving you alone.
I'll come get you soon.]

731
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,733
What's this?

732
00:55:39,733 --> 00:55:41,233
Power outage?

733
00:55:41,233 --> 00:55:43,233
Oh my goodness.

<i>Yeong Ran, someone came to the house.</i>

737
00:56:03,467 --> 00:56:05,633
Who?

738
00:56:05,633 --> 00:56:06,667
Is something wrong, Byeol Nae?

739
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:08,400
<i>Ga Seon Yeong is here.</i>

740
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,267

00:56:10,267 --> 00:56:12,533
Understood. I'll be right there, Byeol Nae.

742
00:56:13,533 --> 00:56:14,767
Attorney Lee, I need to borrow your car.

743
00:56:14,767 --> 00:56:15,767
Take care of Mr. Dong Min for me.

744
00:56:15,767 --> 00:56:16,933
What's happening, Madam?

745
00:56:16,933 --> 00:56:18,667
She said Ga Seon Yeong came.

746
00:56:18,667 --> 00:56:20,300
Wait.

747
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,300
Madam.

748
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,367
I'll leave as soon as Dong Min comes out.

749
00:56:27,367 --> 00:56:28,967
Yes.

750
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,533
Dong Min.

751
00:56:58,633 --> 00:57:00,233
Where's Yeong Ran?

752
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Well, that's...

753
00:57:54,833 --> 00:57:57,467
Ye Rim, you came?

754
00:58:01,533 --> 00:58:03,667
Why are you so late?

755
00:58:03,667 --> 00:58:07,200
I've been waiting for so long.

[20th Gaseong Group Shareholders' Meeting]
Director Ga has been elected as the 2nd CEO.

762
00:59:05,767 --> 00:59:08,300
Even the secret library CCTV wasn't working.

763
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:09,633
How do you feel right now?

764
00:59:09,633 --> 00:59:10,900
You stay in Muchang.

765
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:12,167
That's how you can help.

766
00:59:12,167 --> 00:59:14,467
Yeong Ran, contact me if you need anything.

767
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:15,500
Anytime.

768
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:18,233
You're the one who ordered the hit on
Ga Seon Woo and Kim Yeong Ran, right?

769
00:59:18,233 --> 00:59:21,167
I'll make it clear that you're nothing.

00:59:21,167 --> 00:59:23,300
You're finished now, Ga Seon Yeong.

771
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:25,767
Now you need to give that guy an answer too.

772
00:59:25,767 --> 00:59:27,733
I'm not a good person, Dong Min.

773
00:59:27,733 --> 00:59:31,133
But to me, you are
the best person of all, Yeong Ran.
