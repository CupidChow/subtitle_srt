Put your hands above your head.

592

The autopsy results show that the cause of death
was head trauma from a gunshot.

Who's the perpetrator?

594
00:56:17,733 --> 00:56:21,233
The suspect was caught at the scene
and is currently being transported to Seoul.

595

The USB was completely destroyed,

and Ho Se committed suicide there.

597

What about Ho Se's body?

598
00:56:36,433 --> 00:56:41,467
There was nothing to verify his identity,
so he was sent to a morgue for unclaimed bodies.

599
00:56:42,633 --> 00:56:44,600
He was quite useful though.
