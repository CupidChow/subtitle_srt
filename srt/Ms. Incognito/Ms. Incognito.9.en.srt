00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,667
Yeah, it's me.

539
00:43:53,667 --> 00:43:55,633
Are you with Kim Yeong Ran right now?

540
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,967
<i>Could you ask if she knows
someone named Kim Gyo Bong?</i>

541
00:43:59,767 --> 00:44:01,333
Why?

542
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:03,600
He just turned himself in

543
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,000
claiming he acted on Kim Yeong Ran's orders.

544
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,533
What?

545
00:44:07,533 --> 00:44:09,367
Got it, I'll check.

546
00:44:10,567 --> 00:44:12,100
Madam.

547
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,967
Do you know someone named Kim Gyo Bong?

548
00:44:21,767 --> 00:44:23,733
Your face says you do.

549
00:44:23,733 --> 00:44:25,533
Let's go home first.

550
00:44:25,533 --> 00:44:27,700
We need a strategy.

551
00:44:35,133 --> 00:44:38,467
The man submitted proof that
he received money from you.

552
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:42,567
Since he was your mother's man,
it's understandable that he's under suspicion.

553
00:44:42,567 --> 00:44:45,533
Evidence can be fabricated or exaggerated.

554
00:44:45,533 --> 00:44:47,433
But the public will blindly believe

555
00:44:47,433 --> 00:44:49,600
the fake, exaggerated proof.

556
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,633
You know Ga Seon Yeong did this.

557
00:44:51,633 --> 00:44:53,433
Who wouldn't know that?

558
00:44:53,433 --> 00:44:56,067
They've fabricated evidence against you, Madam!

559
00:44:56,067 --> 00:44:57,933
Prove it's fake.

560
00:44:57,933 --> 00:44:59,400
That's your job, Attorney Lee.

561
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,433
A lawyer isn't a miracle worker.

562
00:45:01,433 --> 00:45:06,200
How much longer do I have to clean up your messes?

563
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,267
You've got quite a list of issues
hanging off you, don't you?

564
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:14,467
Seems Chairman overestimated you,
Ms. Kim Yeong Ran.

565
00:45:15,267 --> 00:45:18,833
I told him to find someone
from a decent, clean background.

566
00:45:34,733 --> 00:45:37,967
<i>The wife of late Gaseong Group
Chairman Ga Sung Ho, Kim Yeong Ran,</i>

567
00:45:37,967 --> 00:45:40,433
<i>appeared at a public event for the first time.</i>

568
00:45:40,433 --> 00:45:42,867
That woman's really something.

569
00:45:42,867 --> 00:45:45,600
Marrying a man forty years older?

570
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,767
She's not ordinary.

571
00:45:46,767 --> 00:45:49,767
How dare she show her face so brazenly?

572
00:45:50,767 --> 00:45:53,633
Do you know her well?

573
00:45:53,633 --> 00:45:55,933
She's always on the news.

574
00:45:57,967 --> 00:46:01,667
They say she deliberately
went after an old, rich man.

575
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:09,633
Miss, do you always believe
others' words without context?

576
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:11,733
No,

577
00:46:11,733 --> 00:46:15,933
I'm just sharing what I heard.

578
00:46:18,267 --> 00:46:21,467
I'll take my leave now.

579
00:46:21,467 --> 00:46:23,200
Yes.

580
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,900
Don't do that.

581
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,167
What if she's actually a good person?

582
00:46:27,933 --> 00:46:30,300
Ju Won, eat up a lot, okay?

583
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:42,000
[Ms. Bu Se Mi]

584
00:47:01,867 --> 00:47:03,500
Tae Min.

585
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,267
I packed some side dishes.

586
00:47:22,267 --> 00:47:23,967
Thanks.

587
00:47:28,667 --> 00:47:30,667
Did you pack everything?

588
00:47:30,667 --> 00:47:32,700
Yeah, mostly.

589
00:47:33,867 --> 00:47:35,267
You should've called me.

590
00:47:35,267 --> 00:47:37,267
I would've brought them.

591
00:47:39,733 --> 00:47:42,100
How's Ms. Baek Hye Ji's condition?

592
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,333
If it's too hard, come back.

593
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:50,633
I just want to stay by Hye Ji's side.

594
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,433
It's my first time.

595
00:47:57,467 --> 00:48:00,333
When people say I'm possessed,

596
00:48:00,333 --> 00:48:04,700
they avoid or ignore me at first.

597
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:09,500
But Hye Ji was the first to look at me

598
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,533
without prejudice.

599
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:19,500
And there's no one else at Hye Ji's side.

600
00:48:20,467 --> 00:48:22,867
I've noticed since day one.

601
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:28,567
How lonely must she have been to come
all the way here looking for a friend?

602
00:48:32,733 --> 00:48:34,933
Dong Min.

603
00:48:34,933 --> 00:48:36,567
Yeah?

604
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:40,367
You miss Ms. Bu Se Mi, right?

605
00:48:41,567 --> 00:48:43,433
Is the general here?

606
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,467
Can't you tell?

607
00:48:46,467 --> 00:48:48,733
Didn't come today.

608
00:48:58,233 --> 00:49:00,467
I just wonder

609
00:49:00,467 --> 00:49:02,867
if I'm allowed to miss her.

610
00:49:02,867 --> 00:49:04,933
There's Ju Won too.

611
00:49:04,933 --> 00:49:08,033
If you overthink it, is that really love?

612
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,333
You said it yourself.

613
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:16,067
When Ju Won's mother left him

614
00:49:16,067 --> 00:49:20,433
for the man she liked, you said,

615
00:49:21,533 --> 00:49:23,967
'How could anyone

616
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:26,567
not follow where their heart goes?'

617
00:49:30,533 --> 00:49:32,400
Ms. Bu Se Mi

618
00:49:33,233 --> 00:49:35,000
is a strong person.

619
00:49:36,167 --> 00:49:38,500
She'll get through this on her own,

620
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,800
and me going would just burden her.

621
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,400
Who's ever strong from the start?

622
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,833
And that wouldn't be a burden.

623
00:49:50,833 --> 00:49:53,567
People are desperate to bring her down,

624
00:49:57,767 --> 00:50:00,333
but having someone by her side

625
00:50:01,067 --> 00:50:04,033
who believes in her, that's such a comfort.

626
00:50:14,967 --> 00:50:19,067
Just pretend to give in and go see her.

627
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:30,833
Yeong Ran!

628
00:50:48,133 --> 00:50:49,767
Hey, Tae Min.

629
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:53,033
I'll drive you to Seoul.

630
00:50:53,033 --> 00:50:54,733
Wait here.

Leaving?

635
00:51:54,567 --> 00:51:57,067
I should stop relying on you too.

636
00:51:57,067 --> 00:51:58,567
Hey, So Yeong.

637
00:51:58,567 --> 00:52:00,900
Stop hanging around Kim Gyo Bong.

638
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:03,400
He's a bloodsucker.

639
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,067
I'll handle it myself.

640
00:52:05,067 --> 00:52:06,267
Jeez.

641
00:52:06,267 --> 00:52:07,500
This is for lodging.

642
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:11,700
Why so much?

643
00:52:14,133 --> 00:52:17,133
I found a solid investor.

644
00:52:17,133 --> 00:52:20,133
Thanks for everything so far.

645
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:25,833
Yes, Attorney.

Where are you going?

668
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,167
There are too many reporters outside.

669
00:53:43,167 --> 00:53:44,567

- Yes, Madam.

You can go in now.

Ms. Baek Hye Ji, wake up.

687
00:55:27,167 --> 00:55:28,833
I'm sorry.

688
00:55:45,933 --> 00:55:48,800
You told me to come to Pyeongtan Chinatown.

Where is this? Huh?

690
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:54,833
Where's your boss?

Where's Ga Seon Woo?

00:56:20,567 --> 00:56:22,567
Lee Don, it's been a while.

694
00:56:24,433 --> 00:56:26,633
You had another money source.

695
00:56:29,033 --> 00:56:30,933
Let me make a proposal.

696
00:56:30,933 --> 00:56:33,500
A proposal?

697
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:37,967
Kim Yeong Ran will soon be arrested
as an accomplice to murder.

698
00:56:39,133 --> 00:56:44,133
I want to see Kim Yeong Ran fight
completely alone without help.

699
00:56:46,567 --> 00:56:51,167
This family is really unbearable.

The principal of Iseon Kindergarten Lee Mi Seon.

702
00:57:00,533 --> 00:57:03,533
She illegally hired Kim Yeong Ran,
a high school graduate who never even set foot

703
00:57:03,533 --> 00:57:07,333
near Iseon Women's University,
as a kindergarten teacher.

704
00:57:08,667 --> 00:57:10,933
Don't drag my family in.

705
00:57:13,067 --> 00:57:16,633
All the CCTV here was turned off,

706
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:18,656
and there are people who would do
anything for money.

707
00:57:18,656 --> 00:57:20,833
How about this?

708
00:57:38,033 --> 00:57:40,200
How much will you pay me

709
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:44,100
as the price for that proposal?

710
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:46,267
As much as you want.

711
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:10,733
Thank you for today.

712
00:58:10,733 --> 00:58:12,333
Please go back now.

713
00:58:20,633 --> 00:58:22,467
I have something to say.

714
00:58:30,433 --> 00:58:32,200
Actually, I...

715
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,800
Next time.

716
00:58:35,033 --> 00:58:37,000
We can talk later.

717
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,267
I missed you.

718
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I was very worried about you.

719
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:06,300
I'm not the Bu Se Mi that you know.

720
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:10,267
I'm Kim Yeong Ran, who married
a man 40 years older for money.

721
00:59:10,267 --> 00:59:12,600
The person I saw in Muchang

722
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:15,500
was Kim Yeong Ran.

723
00:59:16,533 --> 00:59:18,433
Someone who's been hurt a lot inside

724
00:59:18,433 --> 00:59:20,533
and is easily hurt.

725
00:59:20,533 --> 00:59:23,833
And the person standing before me now

726
00:59:24,767 --> 00:59:26,600
is that same person.

727
00:59:29,067 --> 00:59:30,900
Even if your words are cold,

728
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:34,933
I know you're warm-hearted inside.

729
00:59:39,967 --> 00:59:41,900
I like you very much.

730
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:03,800
Those feelings are
all misunderstandings and delusions.

731
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,800
And

732
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:10,433
I don't like you enough
to abandon my dreams, Mr. Jeon Dong Min.

733
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,833
Once this is all over, I'll leave.

734
01:00:17,267 --> 01:00:21,467
Kim Yeong Ran, the ex-convict wife of Chairman Ga,

735
01:00:21,467 --> 01:00:25,567
will start a new life where nobody knows her.

736
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,100
So don't interfere.

737
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:33,400
I have no intention of ever
returning to this wretched country.

738
01:00:34,467 --> 01:00:37,300
Thank you for everything.

739
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:19,376
<i>♫ Starting to be born again ♫</i>

740
01:02:32,192 --> 01:02:35,303
<i>♫ Now is the time ♫</i>

741
01:02:35,303 --> 01:02:42,296
<i>♫ Even hidden scars will shine ♫</i>

742
01:02:43,334 --> 01:02:46,080
<i>♫ I share the light ♫</i>

743
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:52,440
<i>♫ I'll brighten the days shrouded in darkness ♫</i>

744
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,900
Ms. Kim Yeong Ran, you're under
arrest on suspicion of conspiring

745
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:57,267
to commit murder against Ga Seon Yeong.

746
01:02:57,267 --> 01:02:58,433
Did you check what I asked you to?

747
01:02:58,433 --> 01:03:00,800
Don't tell me you're... Don't do anything stupid.

748
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:01,800
Hey, Kim Yeong Ran.

749
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,167
Come out to Pyeongtan Port dock.

750
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:06,900
The fact that you contacted us like this
means he's definitely cornered.

751
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,000
- Is she right?
- Yes, it is.

752
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,167
It's really her.

753
01:03:09,167 --> 01:03:11,133
Jeon Dong Min, are you at Pyeongtan Port?

754
01:03:11,133 --> 01:03:12,267
Just stay put.

755
01:03:12,267 --> 01:03:13,900
Yeong Ran.

756
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,667
Are you even human after all this?

757
01:03:17,667 --> 01:03:19,300
Ga Seon Yeong.
