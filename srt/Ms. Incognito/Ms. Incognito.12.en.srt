[Final Episode]

3
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,867
Ye Rim, you came?

4
00:01:20,867 --> 00:01:22,933
Why are you so late?

5
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:26,533
I've been waiting so long.

6
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:40,933
<i>Chairman is alive.</i>

7
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:43,500
<i>But he doesn't recognize me.</i>

8
00:01:52,967 --> 00:01:55,000
Were you waiting for me?

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,333
Of course.

10
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:02,033
It's my daughter after 20 years.
Of course, I'd wait.

11
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,333
Ye Rim.

12
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:12,500
You have no idea how lonely
I've been living in this house, huh?

13
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,700
From now on, I'll stay by your side, Dad.

14
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,900
Good. I appreciate that.

15
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,733
But if you're living here, beware of Seon Yeong.

16
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:28,700
Never go near her.

17
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,700
Make sure she doesn't notice you. Got it?

18
00:02:44,867 --> 00:02:47,000
Why Seon Yeong?

19
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,833
She's only after my fortune.

20
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:59,833
If she learns you're inheriting
everything from me,

21
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:03,367
she won't leave you alone.

22
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,033
Okay.

23
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:08,767
I'll follow your advice.

24
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:10,733
Good.

25
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:16,033
You truly are my only blood.

26
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,600
You're fundamentally different
from these money-hungry people.

27
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:29,700
Everyone in this house is a monster.

28
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:33,133
Monsters?

29
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,600
Seon Yeong is terrifying.

30
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,700
So scary.

31
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,733
But

32
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,500
that Seon Yeong,

33
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,233
she's a pitiful child.

34
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:59,867
Her father's death

35
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:06,267
was actually caused by her mother
for the inheritance.

36
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,600
On a rainy day,

37
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,733
she hired someone to kill him

38
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:16,300
at the fishing spot.

39
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:21,633
Ever since then,

40
00:04:22,633 --> 00:04:25,233
she grew up

41
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:30,467
without a single kind word

42
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:35,367
or warm look from her mother.

43
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:38,000
How pitiful.

44
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:41,200
Pitiful?

45
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,833
How dare you say 'pitiful'?

46
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:53,267
It was disgusting enough
that Lee Seon Yeong became Ga Seon Yeong.

47
00:04:53,267 --> 00:04:55,433
Say it again, huh?

48
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:57,867
Wait, Ye Rim. Why are you acting like this?

49
00:04:57,867 --> 00:05:00,867
Ye Rim, Ye Rim, Ye Rim!

50
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,267
Why keep calling a dead girl's name?

51
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:06,600
Who died? Ye Rim. Who's dead?

52
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:14,800
The Ga family members
should've been eliminated from the start.

53
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,633
You were just a factory manager.

54
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,133
How dare you pity anyone?

55
00:05:27,267 --> 00:05:28,867
Ga Sung Ho.

56
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:33,900
Know my biggest regret?

57
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:38,033
When you married Mom,

58
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:41,533
I should've killed you then.

59
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:46,033
None of this would've happened.

60
00:05:46,033 --> 00:05:47,600
Ye Rim.

61
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,300
I told you not to say that name!

62
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,800
You're already dead. Dying again won't matter.

63
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,967
Ye Rim.

64
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:01,000
What's wrong with you?

65
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,700
Why act like that wretched Seon Yeong?
Like that wretched woman.

66
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,433
Wretched woman?

67
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:15,167
I'll let you meet
the Ye Rim you're desperately seeking.

68
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,200
Shut your filthy mouth!

69
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:33,567
Ye Rim.

70
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:38,333
Ye Rim's gone. I killed her.

71
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:42,200
I personally choked your daughter to death.

72
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,067
Just like I'm killing you.

73
00:06:54,267 --> 00:06:56,267
Seon Yeong.

74
00:06:58,033 --> 00:07:00,300
Thank you.

75
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,433
'Thank you'?

76
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:07,500
You lunatic.

77
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,267
Die, you insufferable creature!

78
00:07:10,267 --> 00:07:11,967
Die!

79
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,467
Dad.

80
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:56,167
I need your fingerprint.

81
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,400
[Will]

82
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:20,867
Chairman.

83
00:09:20,867 --> 00:09:22,533
Oh, no.

84
00:09:24,267 --> 00:09:25,933
Chairman.

85
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:32,267
Chairman, wake up.

86
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:34,433
Chairman.

87
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:36,700
What do we do?

88
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,067
Darn it!

89
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:40,167
Ga Seon Yeong!

90
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:41,200
Chairman.

91
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,267
Ga Seon Yeong!

92
00:09:45,467 --> 00:09:49,233
Attorney Lee, call an ambulance.

93
00:09:50,267 --> 00:09:52,933
Can't do that.

94
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:55,833
What do you mean?

95
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,100
Chairman's already deceased.

96
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,433
What does that matter?

97
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:06,867
Forgive me, Madam.

98
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:08,000
Give me the phone.

99
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,633
Give me the phone!

100
00:10:09,633 --> 00:10:11,467
- Give me the phone!
- Madam.

101
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:14,000
Please, please.

102
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,533
What should I do?

103
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,200
Oh, what should I do?

104
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,433
Chairman.

105
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,933
Chairman, what should I do?

106
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,333
Chairman.

107
00:10:47,067 --> 00:10:51,867
Chairman, please open your eyes.

108
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:54,600
Chairman. Oh God, what should I do?

109
00:10:57,933 --> 00:11:00,333
Chairman.

110
00:11:46,267 --> 00:11:52,233
We've temporarily moved Chairman
to Gaseong Hospital's mortuary.

111
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,167
We failed to protect Chairman.

112
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,033
Madam.

113
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:14,467
It must be so hard for you,
but you need to pull yourself together.

114
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:17,467
We still have work to do.

115
00:12:17,467 --> 00:12:20,733
The shareholders' meeting is about to begin.

116
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:24,767
Understood.

117
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:34,333
Jeon Dong Min is waiting outside.
Would you like to see him?

118
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,367
Oh, Don.

119
00:12:57,367 --> 00:12:59,600
Is something wrong with Ms. Yeong Ran?

120
00:13:01,367 --> 00:13:03,833
You should go back to Muchang.

121
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,100
Don't ask anything for now.

122
00:13:06,733 --> 00:13:08,800
That's how you can help.

123
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,500
[Jeon Dong Min]

124
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:57,033
<i>Ms. Yeong Ran, contact me anytime
if you need anything.</i>

125
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,933
Dong Min!

126
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:19,067
Mi Seon!

127
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,200
You've been through a lot, huh? Good job.

128
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,467
Eat quickly.

129
00:14:22,467 --> 00:14:23,500
What is this?

130
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,400
Tofu. You've got to do what needs to be done.

131
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,967
Eat it all, and you'll never go
near the police station again, hurry.

132
00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:32,633
- All of this?
- It's not that much.

133
00:14:32,633 --> 00:14:33,800
But where's Ju Won?

134
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,333
Huh? Where'd he go?

135
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,200
He was here just a minute ago.

136
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,267
I'll go look for Ju Won.

137
00:14:39,267 --> 00:14:42,100
Wait, no. This...

138
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,733
Dong Min, eat the tofu before it gets cold.

139
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,033
Jeon Ju Won.

140
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:50,367
Jeon Ju Won!

141
00:15:04,933 --> 00:15:09,533
Dad's here, but Ju Won isn't,

142
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:12,233
so I guess I have to go back to Seoul.

143
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:13,700
No!

144
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,900
Dad!

145
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,033
Dad, where are you going again?

146
00:15:26,033 --> 00:15:27,533
I'm sorry.

147
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:29,433
Did you wait long for me?

148
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:30,867
A bit.

149
00:15:30,867 --> 00:15:34,000
You must've been busy too, Dad.

150
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Jeon Ju Won.

151
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,633
You've grown so much since I last saw you.

152
00:15:37,633 --> 00:15:39,500
Dad.

153
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,200
I look like an elementary school kid now, right?

154
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,667
Not like a kindergartener, right?

155
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,433
Well.

156
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,200
I'll ask Miss when she comes back.

157
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,400
Dad, when will Miss come back?

158
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,533
She has lots of things to finish.

159
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:10,167
She'll come back after finishing them.

160
00:16:10,933 --> 00:16:12,600
When?

161
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,567
She still needs some time.

162
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:22,433
But in my opinion,

163
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:24,667
she will definitely come back.

164
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,400
I don't believe you, Dad.

165
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,967
Just because you grew taller,
you don't believe your dad?

166
00:16:31,967 --> 00:16:34,567
I never believed you even before.

167
00:16:34,567 --> 00:16:36,600
Look at this kid.

168
00:16:43,533 --> 00:16:46,100
I'm sorry.

169
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,233
I'll try to be a better dad.

170
00:16:49,233 --> 00:16:50,600
Well,

171
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,167
then I'll try to be a better son too.

172
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:09,867
Madam, we have a problem.

173
00:17:09,867 --> 00:17:14,233
The secret study's CCTV wasn't recording either.

174
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,667
What do you mean?

175
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:18,067
There's absolutely no footage.

176
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,833
Professor, you look beautiful today.

177

[The 20th Gaseong Group Shareholders' Meeting]

178
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:10,133
We now begin the 20th
Gaseong Group Shareholders' Meeting.

179
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:14,967
We'll proceed with the vote for

00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,500
Executive Director.

183
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,867

[Will]

185
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:51,433
What's the meaning of this, Executive Director?

186
00:18:51,433 --> 00:18:56,033
So Kim Yeong Ran presented a fake will?

187

00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,067
Kim Yeong Ran.

361
00:32:32,067 --> 00:32:34,700
I won't let you get away with this.

362
00:32:36,567 --> 00:32:38,533
Let go! Hey!

363
00:32:38,533 --> 00:32:40,167
Let go of me!

364
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,433
- There she comes.
- She's coming.

365
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:51,300
Ms. Kim Yeong Ran, please give us an interview.

366
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,700
From Chairman Ga Sung Ho's case
to the Ga Seon Woo and Ga Ye Rim cases,

367
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:58,167
the prosecution sought
death penalty for Ga Seon Yeong.

368
00:32:58,167 --> 00:33:00,367
How do you feel about this?

369
00:33:03,433 --> 00:33:05,800
I'll keep it brief today

370
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,567
and provide details another time.

371
00:33:10,133 --> 00:33:11,733
Let's go.

372
00:33:12,512 --> 00:33:18,000
- Ms. Kim Yeong Ran, please give us a statement.
- Say a few more words.

373
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,133
[The late Ga Ye Rim, the late Ga Sung Ho]

374
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:26,433
[Red Ramyeon]

375
00:33:46,267 --> 00:33:47,967
Chairman.

376
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,500
Now rest peacefully with your daughter.

377
00:34:12,767 --> 00:34:14,333
Madam.

378
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:17,667
It's time you gave that guy an answer too.

379
00:34:17,667 --> 00:34:21,000
He worries about you more than anyone else.

380
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,333
Are you okay?

381
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,267
I'm trying to be.

382
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:40,500
I'm sorry, Dong Min.

383
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,433
Oh, there's nothing to apologize for.

384
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,800
For everything.

385
00:34:51,733 --> 00:34:56,400
I never once blamed you, Yeong Ran.

386
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,167
I'm not a good person, Dong Min.

387
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,267
Blinded by greed, I deceived the people of Muchang

388
00:35:09,267 --> 00:35:12,667
and even framed you.

389
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:15,467
- So...
- Yeong Ran.

390
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:20,067
Truly bad people don't say things like this.

391
00:35:20,067 --> 00:35:22,867
And why care what others say?

392
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:24,900
To me, Yeong Ran,

393
00:35:26,933 --> 00:35:29,200
you're better than anyone else.

394
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,600
Yeong Ran.

395
00:35:37,567 --> 00:35:40,300
After all this is over,

396
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,700
if you ever think of Muchang or me,

397
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:46,100
come back then.

398
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,000
I'll be waiting.

399
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,067
You don't have to wait for me.

400
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:54,467
I'm only human. I don't mean I'll wait forever.

401
00:35:56,633 --> 00:35:59,833
I'll wait exactly ten years.

402
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,600
But no complaining when you come back
and I've become an old man.

403
00:36:18,267 --> 00:36:22,367
These days there are too many caregivers
exploiting the elderly,

404
00:36:22,367 --> 00:36:25,367
so we're pretty strict about hiring.

405
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:28,800
I guess I have nothing to worry about.

406
00:36:32,033 --> 00:36:33,700
This is the room.

407
00:36:37,767 --> 00:36:39,533
Go ahead and step inside.

408
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:53,467
Oh, you don't know anything.

409
00:36:54,133 --> 00:36:57,600
Men prefer women like Yeong Ran

410
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:02,567
who act all pitiful and vulnerable.

411
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:09,767
And what makes me worse than Yeong Ran?

412
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:24,733
Sir?

413
00:37:24,733 --> 00:37:27,333
I'm Choi Mi Hyang.

414
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,467
Last time at Grandma's handmade knife-cut noodles.

415
00:37:34,467 --> 00:37:36,633
Oh, the one 'made by hand'?

416
00:37:36,633 --> 00:37:39,700
Literally by hand.

417
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,633
Who is it?

418
00:37:46,533 --> 00:37:47,867
Hye Ji.

419
00:37:47,867 --> 00:37:51,167
If I'd known you were here,
I would've come sooner.

420
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:53,833
Why didn't you contact me? Huh?

421
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:57,833
Excuse me, who are you?

422
00:37:59,933 --> 00:38:01,900
Did she hurt her head or something?

423
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,200
No.

424
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,900
Just joking.

425
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,133
Hye Ji, you scared me! Why are you teasing me?

426
00:38:10,133 --> 00:38:12,333
But, Mister, what brings you here?

427
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:14,233
Mister? Who?

428
00:38:16,467 --> 00:38:17,500
Me?

429
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,867
Are there other 'misters' besides you?

430
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:25,300
Hye Ji, stop joking around. What's wrong?

431
00:38:29,033 --> 00:38:31,033
- Tae Min.
- Yes.

432
00:38:33,967 --> 00:38:37,667
I want to rest.

433
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:40,067
Hye Ji hasn't fully recovered yet.

434
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:41,833
Visitations are currently prohibited.

435
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:44,200
Please leave now.

436
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,967
Hye Ji, let's talk, okay?

437
00:38:45,967 --> 00:38:47,333
- Hye Ji.
- Leave.

438
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:49,000
Get out. Now.

439
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,300
Let go, young man!

440
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,633
You only like Hye Ji because of
that 100 million won too, right?

441
00:38:52,633 --> 00:38:54,567
What are you talking about? Get out now.

442
00:38:54,567 --> 00:38:55,600
- What's wrong with you people?
- Out!

443
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,000
- You can't treat me like this.
- Out!

444
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Hye Ji, over here.

445
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,867
Get out!

446
00:38:59,867 --> 00:39:02,167
Let's be honest, you're not my oppa.

447
00:39:03,533 --> 00:39:05,167
Hye Ji.

448
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:12,767
If I don't say this now,
I might never get another chance.

449
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,700
- I...
- Stop!

450
00:39:17,267 --> 00:39:18,733
- Tae Min.
- Yes.

451
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:20,800
There's something I'm curious about.

452
00:39:23,533 --> 00:39:25,867
Why are you taking care of me?

453
00:39:27,633 --> 00:39:29,333
Well...

454
00:39:30,433 --> 00:39:35,333
Because I thought you'd be lonely

455
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,467
here at the hospital.

456
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:44,200
You always smile, Hye Ji,

457
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,100
but deep down,

458
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,833
you're someone who gets lonely easily.

459
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:57,700
So I wanted to stay by your side.

460
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,200
Tae Min.

461
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,833
Yes?

462
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,033
Wanna make

463
00:40:14,133 --> 00:40:16,033
today our day one?

464
00:40:17,967 --> 00:40:21,833
Today isn't day one, Hye Ji.

465
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:23,267
If you check the calendar...

466
00:40:23,267 --> 00:40:25,167
I'm asking you to be my boyfriend.

467
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:33,333
But can we handle a long-distance relationship?

468
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:36,100
I can. I'll come every single day.

469
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,000
It only takes 4 hours
from Muchang to here. Just 4 hours.

470
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,933
Tae Min, have you ever kissed someone?

471
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,200
Me neither.

472
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,400
I see.

473
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,567
Not even once.

474
00:40:51,233 --> 00:40:52,733
Same here.

475
00:40:52,733 --> 00:40:53,767
Me too.

476
00:40:53,767 --> 00:40:55,367
- Me too.
- Me too.

477
00:40:55,367 --> 00:40:56,500
Me too.

478
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:00,433
<i>♫ Even the warmth you lost ♫</i>

479
00:41:00,433 --> 00:41:05,267
<i>♫ I'll rekindle it all ♫</i>

480
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:11,833
<i>♫ Have you seen the star-filled night ♫</i>

481
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:14,767
Wait for me.

482
00:41:16,233 --> 00:41:22,667
<i>♫ I won't let go, I'll keep waiting ♫</i>

483
00:41:22,667 --> 00:41:25,600
<i>♫ Mirroring my form ♫</i>

484
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:31,167
<i>♫ I'll hurt as much as you do ♫</i>

485
00:41:31,167 --> 00:41:35,167
<i>♫ I'll be colored by your smiles ♫</i>

486
00:41:35,167 --> 00:41:36,800
Does it hurt?

487
00:41:38,433 --> 00:41:40,433
- Here?
- It's racing.

488
00:41:40,433 --> 00:41:41,767
Hearts naturally beat fast.

489
00:41:41,767 --> 00:41:43,833
My heart beats too fast.

490
00:41:44,833 --> 00:41:46,533
Should we see a doctor?

491
00:41:59,033 --> 00:42:00,667
Friend!

492
00:42:06,133 --> 00:42:07,967
Are you here to pick me up?

493
00:42:10,233 --> 00:42:12,367
Ms. Baek Hye Ji.

494
00:42:12,367 --> 00:42:13,867
What's wrong, friend?

495
00:42:13,867 --> 00:42:17,067
Ms. Baek Hye Ji, you and Tae Min
look good together.

496
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:19,667
And Muchang is a nice place, huh?

497
00:42:22,367 --> 00:42:23,800
What?

498
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,067
Are you telling me to go to Muchang?

499
00:42:27,133 --> 00:42:29,833
I was going to watch movies with friends,

500
00:42:29,833 --> 00:42:31,700
eat meals, drink coffee,

501
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,400
do all those normal things now.

502
00:42:43,633 --> 00:42:45,267
This is...

503
00:42:46,033 --> 00:42:48,900
You really learned ballet once, right?

504
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,000
I heard from Attorney Lee.

505
00:42:52,033 --> 00:42:53,933
Yeah.

506
00:42:53,933 --> 00:42:56,967
I persuaded the orphanage director,

507
00:42:56,967 --> 00:42:59,567
so I could only attend for one month.

508
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:04,800
But I didn't even have pointed shoes back then,
so I got bullied every day.

509
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,267
That won't happen anymore.

510
00:43:09,467 --> 00:43:11,867
You'll stay friends with me forever, right?

511
00:43:18,833 --> 00:43:20,433
Yeah.

512
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,700
Madam.

513
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,933
Congratulations on completing
the contract with the chairman.

514
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,167
Are you going somewhere?

515
00:43:54,167 --> 00:43:56,333
Now that my contract with the chairman is over,

516
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:59,567
so my stay here as a live-in lawyer is over.

517
00:43:59,567 --> 00:44:05,167
It wouldn't look good for me
to stay here alone with the heir.

518
00:44:05,167 --> 00:44:07,600
If unnecessary gossip spreads,

519
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,667
it could significantly
impact Gaseong Group's stock price.

520
00:44:09,667 --> 00:44:11,933
That's the kind of person you are now, Madam.

521
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,800
Do you have somewhere to go?

522
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,833
Well.

523
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:20,100
It's small compared to your wealth,

524
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:23,033
but I have a decent amount in my bank account.

525
00:44:23,667 --> 00:44:27,433
Maybe I'll go to a hotel for a staycation.

526
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:43,233
Thank you for your hard work until now.

527
00:44:43,233 --> 00:44:44,433
Oh, right.

528
00:44:44,433 --> 00:44:47,933
I've already sent all the gifts to Muchang.

529
00:44:51,267 --> 00:44:52,867
Alright.

530
00:44:55,467 --> 00:44:58,733
What's this? I wasn't expecting
any registered mail.

531
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:05,867
The land below has been purchased
by Gaseong Foundation.

532
00:45:05,867 --> 00:45:08,477
[Notice of purchase]
To be permanently used as a kindergarten

533
00:45:08,477 --> 00:45:11,100
for early childhood education in remote areas...

534
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,267
Lord!

535
00:45:17,267 --> 00:45:18,700
What? What happened?

536
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,600
What? Why?

537
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,267
Why? Why?

538
00:45:25,067 --> 00:45:27,667
This place was sold.

539
00:45:27,667 --> 00:45:29,667
Huh?

540
00:45:29,667 --> 00:45:31,033
Sold?

541
00:45:31,033 --> 00:45:33,267
The landowner is still alive.

542
00:45:33,267 --> 00:45:37,267
Ah, did he sell it off to another
nursing home operator again?

543
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:39,400
Ms. Bu Se Mi bought it!

544
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,800
She said it'll be used as a kindergarten forever!

545
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,700
Forever!

546
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,567

549
00:45:56,267 --> 00:45:58,633
I should've bought it.

Seong Tae.

551
00:45:59,667 --> 00:46:03,167
How grateful you should be for this, huh?

552
00:46:03,167 --> 00:46:06,133
Now even you can live as a good person!

00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:14,400
But isn't Ms. Bu Se Mi coming back?

556
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,700
The kids and Dong Min really want to see her.

557
00:46:20,467 --> 00:46:25,267
Are you doing well, Ms. Bu Se Mi?

558
00:47:02,967 --> 00:47:06,067

I finally understand

562
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:40,933
why you stayed here all this time.

563
00:47:45,067 --> 00:47:47,733
How lonely you must have been.

564
00:47:48,433 --> 00:47:50,067
Now,

00:47:51,367 --> 00:47:53,967

Yeah, I haven't seen her since morning.

But now that I'm nervous, I can't get it right.

650
00:55:23,967 --> 00:55:26,333
What's there to be nervous about

01:00:06,933 --> 01:00:08,567
Why?

724
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,533
Have you been well?

725
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:21,533
Yes.

726
01:00:26,467 --> 01:00:29,733
One, two, three.

727
01:00:32,967 --> 01:00:38,100
<i>♫ If you stay by my side ♫</i>

728
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:42,933
<i>♫ Everything will be okay ♫</i>

729
01:00:42,933 --> 01:00:48,667
<i>♫ Don't cry anymore, just smile ♫</i>

730
01:00:48,667 --> 01:00:49,967
Be careful.

731
01:00:49,967 --> 01:00:51,000
Okay.

732
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,100
<i>♫ I'll protect you by your side ♫</i>

733
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:56,767
<i>♫ I'll fill the empty sky with stars ♫</i>

734
01:00:56,767 --> 01:00:59,500
It feels so nice walking together like this.

735
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:10,767
I think I'm happiest when I'm here.

736
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:13,400
There's no place better than Moodeave.

737
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,100
And,

738
01:01:16,933 --> 01:01:19,900
there's no one better than you, Dong Min.

739
01:01:22,067 --> 01:01:25,600
You just realized that now?

740
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,100
Yeong Ran.

741
01:01:40,733 --> 01:01:43,367
Why don't we just keep living in Muchang?

742
01:01:47,133 --> 01:01:49,133
Let's live together.

743
01:01:51,667 --> 01:01:53,267
From now on,

744
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:56,800
I'll protect you for the rest of your life.

745
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,933
Didn't you say you'd wait ten years?

746
01:02:00,933 --> 01:02:03,933
Yeah, but now that I see you again,

747
01:02:03,933 --> 01:02:05,800
I can't possibly wait.

748
01:02:09,167 --> 01:02:10,967
I can't wait anymore.

749
01:02:10,967 --> 01:02:16,900
<i>♫ One day, I had a scary dream ♫</i>

750
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:20,767
<i>♫ Let's just think like that ♫</i>

751
01:02:20,767 --> 01:02:25,767
<i>♫ Rising again ♫</i>

752
01:02:45,867 --> 01:02:49,067
Ms. Jo Byeol Nae, what do you mean
your card was declined?

753
01:02:49,733 --> 01:02:51,700
We have a guest here.

754
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:53,233
Guest?

755
01:02:53,233 --> 01:02:55,733
That star, Shin Su Hyeon, Shin Su Hyeon!

756
01:02:55,733 --> 01:02:57,733
- Shin Su Hyeon?
- That scandal.

757
01:02:57,733 --> 01:02:59,600
- The chaebol scandal?
- Shh.

758
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:00,767
I'm such a big fan.

759
01:03:00,767 --> 01:03:03,000
Snap out of it.

760
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,233
Prepare some drinks.

761
01:03:04,233 --> 01:03:05,633
- What kind?
- Anything.

762
01:03:05,633 --> 01:03:07,867
Anything? Peppermint tea?

763
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,700
You're Attorney Lee Don, correct?

764
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,467
Yes, I'm your fan.

765
01:03:31,467 --> 01:03:34,533
No, I'm Lee Don.

766
01:03:34,533 --> 01:03:38,567
I heard you're good at hiding people.

767
01:03:38,567 --> 01:03:40,633
That's my specialty.

768
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:43,667
But there's one thing...

769
01:03:44,533 --> 01:03:49,200
I charge 50,000 won per minute.
Is that all right with you?

770
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,567
Money won't be an issue.

771
01:04:03,467 --> 01:04:08,100
[Thank you to everyone who loves Ms. Incognito]

772
