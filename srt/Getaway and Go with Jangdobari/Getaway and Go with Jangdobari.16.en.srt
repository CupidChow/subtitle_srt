1
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:05,839
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARIBARI

2
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,643
AFTER A NIGHT IN GANGNEUNG

3
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:15,582
A PEACEFUL MORNING WHERE
THE GENTLE WAVES WAKE THEM UP

4
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,752
Morning.

5
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:21,021
Hi.

6
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:23,023
It's day two.

7
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:24,591
Right.

8
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:25,959
She isn't here yet.

9
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:28,561
So instead,

10
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:31,031
here I am, waiting.

11
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:32,232
STIFF

12
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:34,200
Can't you be Umdobaribari for a moment?

13
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,037
How about Umtaeguriguri?

14
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:40,774
SHAKING THE CAMERA OUT OF EMBARRASSMENT

15
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,575
I think it's a bit awkward.

16
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,177
I'm…

17
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:46,846
I'm not the show host,

18
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,849
but someone who's here
at your beck and call.

19
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:51,985
I'm Umtaeguriguri.

20
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,688
Can you explain your outfit of the day?

21
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:58,858
My outfit?

22
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:03,196
IS THE ROOKIE SHOW HOST DOING WELL?

23
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:05,899
Is that her?

24
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:07,333
-Hey.
-Morning.

25
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:09,536
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

26
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:11,638
Oh, so quick. Putting me on duty.

27
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,808
Remember how we met briefly
in the elevator yesterday?

28
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:16,843
You know what happened yesterday?

29
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,380
Normally, after I'm done filming,
I get changed at lightning speed,

30
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:22,482
I remove my makeup

31
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,585
like some old men washing their faces.

32
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:28,288
Then, I put on a facial mask
with my hair up,

33
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:31,224
and left the hotel room
looking as if I were at home.

34
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,159
I didn't know I'd run into him again,

35
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,661
but when I did in the elevator,

36
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:36,429
it was so embarrassing.

37
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:38,731
But when Tae-goo saw me,

38
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,366
he asked who I was.

39
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,634
That's not it.

40
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:43,103
-That's not what I said.
-Then what?

41
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:44,337
I said, "Nice to meet you."

42
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:45,705
IT WAS HIS FIRST TIME SEEING HER BAREFACED

43
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,373
He didn't need to correct me there.

44
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,542
As I did my makeup today,

45
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,112
I found myself wondering
what the point of all this is.

46
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:54,614
Still, I dolled myself up,
thinking he should see me

47
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:55,782
looking decent.

48
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,217
I see.

49
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,218
You look great.

50
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,519
AVOIDING EYE CONTACT

51
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,921
I see your shoes match
the color of your T-shirt.

52
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:03,790
-It wasn't intentional.
-I see.

53
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,559
My shoes…
Well, they just happened to match.

54
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:10,530
Are you saying you look stylish
no matter what you throw on?

55
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:12,398
OF COURSE NOT

56
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,100
Where were you yesterday?

57
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,737
ROLE-PLAYING STARTS AGAIN

58
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,572
I think I'll be having nightmares
about this.

59
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,141
First of all,

60
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:23,910
-why don't we take a short walk?
-Sounds good.

61
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,445
-Would that be okay?
-Of course.

62
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:27,480
-Shall we?
-Sure.

63
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,082
THEN LET'S GO FOR A WALK

64
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,718
Did you sleep well?

65
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:32,952
-I did.
-Did you?

66
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:39,826
EPISODE 3
LET'S COME BACK TO GANGNEUNG SOMEDAY!

67
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:45,565
GYEONGPO LAKE, GANGNEUNG

68
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,838
EDGY HAND GESTURE

69
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:54,941
Don't they look the same?

70
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,377
HOW IS HE SO GOOD AT DID? HAHA

71
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,913
FREAKISHILY DETAILED HAND GESTURE

72
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,081
My fair lady!

73
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:04,384
I see you lowered your walls
a bit more overnight.

74
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:08,788
It's still early in the day,
and the sun isn't too strong.

75
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,890
I figured we could go for a walk.
Is that okay?

76
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:11,958
We have to make room

77
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,160
for more food anyway.

78
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,995
Keep showing us that chic side of you.

79
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,230
I'll provide opportunities.

80
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,167
Ok-sun, did you sleep well?

81
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,570
What did you just say?

82
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,505
Wait, am I Ok-sun?

83
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,507
THEY'RE STUCK IN THEI'M SOLO UNIVERSE

84
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:31,978
I see your sketches stretch out
over a long time.

85
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,548
The best part of I'm SOLO is when
the participants introduce themselves.

86
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:39,285
-Some of them even do a show-and-tell.
-That's right.

87
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:43,022
I'm sure some enjoy
introducing themselves that way,

88
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:48,461
but I like watching how keen
they are to show themselves in that time.

89
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:51,598
And seeing their hands shake as they sing…

90
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:54,100
Their courage amazes me,

91
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,002
but it also makes me question

92
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:57,737
whether I could do the same.

93
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:58,671
Why don't you…

94
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:00,640
What's with him?

95
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,811
STILL, OK-SUN HEADS TO HER STAGE

96
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,014
I'm Ok-sun of the 22nd class.

97
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,882
THE CAPTIVATING WOMAN
WHO SHOOK UP GANGNEUNG, OK-SUN

98
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,118
I'm a freelancer,

99
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,519
and my ideal man

100
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,389
is someone who looks after himself
and shows me…

101
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:17,991
Shows me…

102
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,593
Who shows me that he cares.

103
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,229
I couldn't be more nervous right now.

104
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,732
I'm not usually like this,

105
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,967
but I'm here because I want a boyfriend.

106
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,037
Let me sing a song.

107
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,573
MUTED FOR COPYRIGHT REASONS

108
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,309
JENNIE'S SONG AND DANCE MOVES
SHE LEARNED IN WANDO

109
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,945
SHE WAS ABLE TO CHARM EVERYONE
WITH HER DANCE

110
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,179
Thank you.

111
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:43,316
I bet I look possessed.

112
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:44,851
I didn't know you'd actually do it.
Sorry about that.

113
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,053
Yeong-su of the 22nd class.

114
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:50,623
You watched me just now.

115
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,628
Go for it!

116
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:59,065
THE INTROVERT ADDICTED
TO ROLE-PLAYING - YEONG-SU

117
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,601
I'm too shy to even be up here right now.

118
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,637
He'll speak on my behalf.

119
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,339
…WHAT?

120
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,141
Ok-sun!

121
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,116
I'm Yeong-su.

122
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,819
Let's get going.

123
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,055
Oh, no.

124
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,358
I hope this doesn't put a damper
on his acting career.

125
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:27,427
I'm kidding.

126
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,828
Thanks for plucking up the courage.

127
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,663
-I should be thanking you.
-No way.

128
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,468
I haven't done open comedy sketches
in a while, and I had been wanting to.

129
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:38,571
But now the craving is gone
after this trip with you.

130
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:44,277
An acrostic poem for Gangneung
was on the bus that drove past us.

131
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:45,912
I can't believe it.

132
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:46,813
What was it?

133
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,614
Gang. "Let's come back to Gangneung."

134
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:49,849
Neung. "Neung!"

135
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,919
-That's a good one.
-Tell me about it.

136
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,655
But all I could think of
was shingled hedgehog.

137
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:57,256
That's the best I could do.

138
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:02,061
Anyway, we're off
to have our morning coffee now.

139
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:04,230
I like the sound of that.

140
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,699
AFTER A SHORT WALK,
THEY GO FOR THEIR MORNING COFFEE

141
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,835
-Hello.
-Hello.

142
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,236
Look, it's a potato ongsimi bun.

143
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:11,804
Which of the two would you like?

144
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,272
1) POTATO ONGSIMI COFFEE
2) POTATO MELANGÉ COFFEE

145
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:14,107
The ongsimi coffee?

146
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,242
-Decaf, right?
-Yes.

147
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,144
Any desserts?

148
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,179
Why don't we have one each?

149
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:21,080
Sounds good.

150
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,349
Done.

151
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,283
Thank you.

152
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,352
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

153
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:32,525
What a view.

154
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,561
THE REFRESHING VIEW OF GANGMUN BEACH

155
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:37,096
STRETCHES OUT IN FRONT OF THE CAFE

156
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:41,501
IT MAKES YOU WANT TO DIVE RIGHT IN

157
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:43,536
Are you comfortable here?

158
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,304
Should we stay another day?

159
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:46,939
Would you like to stay another day?

160
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,174
Hatchet Shot!

161
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,512
I taught you something I shouldn't have,

162
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:53,780
and you keep doing it.

163
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,084
How about an acrostic poem for ongsimi?

164
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,919
Sure. Bring it on.

165
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:02,522
-Ong.
-Ong.

166
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,258
You must be here for ongsimi coffee.

167
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:08,227
-Sim.
-Suddenly, Shim Shin comes to mind.

168
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,130
I.

169
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,032
Oh, dear. But he isn't here.

170
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,802
That made sense.

171
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:16,803
Sorry about that.

172
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,704
-You're good at this.
-I'll stop.

173
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,440
-I'll put this to rest now.
-Sure thing.

174
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:23,443
You're done with your share
of acrostic poems today.

175
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:25,244
Still, that was good.

176
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,613
If only I hadn't seen that acrostic poem
on the bus today.

177
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,148
My pride wouldn't have been hurt.

178
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,150
Geez.

179
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:32,285
Gangneung.

180
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,520
Nothing starts with "neung."

181
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:36,289
I went through all letters.

182
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,691
Neungshim Shin Ramyun comes to mind.

183
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:42,161
AS EXPECTED OF THE ACROSTIC POEM GENIUS

184
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:45,031
Strike that. It wasn't funny.

185
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,065
Nonsense.

186
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,301
That's the kind of jokes I love.

187
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:51,871
Gang. How about some ramyeon in Gangneung?
What brand?

188
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:54,774
Neung. Neungshim Shin Ramyun

189
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,676
CHUCKLING

190
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,878
You're good.

191
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,413
You're talented.

192
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,815
-Your drinks are ready.
-Thank you.

193
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,317
No, I'll get them.

194
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,252
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

195
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,420
Thank you.

196
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,190
Even the glasses are pretty.

197
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:14,961
POTATO ONGSIMI COFFEE
POTATO MELANGÉ COFFEE

198
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,662
POTATO ONGSIMI COFFEE

199
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:17,730
POTATO ONGSIMI, MADE LIKE BOBA PEARLS,

200
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:18,798
ARE ADDED FOR A CHEWY TEXTURE

201
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,032
THAT GOES WELL WITH THE COFFEE'S SOFTNESS

202
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,667
POTATO MELANGÉ COFFEE

203
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,202
EINSPÄNNER TOPPED WITH CREAM
MADE FROM BLENDED POTATO

204
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,203
I'm excited to try it.

205
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,338
Go ahead.

206
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:27,006
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

207
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,508
POTATO ONGSIMI BUN:
STICKY RICE BUN - POWDERED GRAIN

208
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:29,475
I can't wait.

209
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,043
-Tell me about it.
-This is ongsimi coffee.

210
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,912
Drink up!

211
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,280
HOW DOES THE COFFEE TASTE
WITH POTATO ONGSIMI?

212
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,983
It's like I'm asking you to down
an alcoholic drink.

213
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,186
It's unique.

214
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:41,621
Is it good?

215
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:42,522
It's good.

216
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:43,890
BRIGHTENING UP

217
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:47,193
He flashed a very happy smile.

218
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,229
HE TRIES THE POTATO ONGSIMI

219
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,230
It's so novel.

220
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,232
Goodness.

221
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,469
DO-YEON TRIES THE POTATO MELANGÉ COFFEE

222
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,639
-It's really good.
-Really?

223
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,041
Right here. Try the cream.

224
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:02,942
The cream.

225
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,176
-This is also good.
-Is it?

226
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:07,079
THEY TRY EACH OTHER'S COFFEE

227
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,015
Isn't it good? I know.

228
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,784
I'll try an ongsimi.

229
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,953
It's fascinating.

230
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:17,256
YUMMY!

231
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,624
It's good.

232
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:20,693
This reminds me of that thing.

233
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,196
The ongsimi is chewier than boba pearls.

234
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:27,300
It tastes just like a good vanilla latte.

235
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:28,701
This one's crazy good.

236
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,336
THEN HOW'S THE CREAM
ON THE POTATO MELANGÉ COFFEE?

237
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,507
This one's also good.

238
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,809
-I can't be sure until I've tried it.
-Please go ahead.

239
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:37,710
Of course.

240
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:40,446
It's really good.

241
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,616
THE LATTE WHISPERER TAKES A CAREFUL SIP

242
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,121
My gosh.

243
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,358
That felt like a scene from a TV show.

244
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:54,060
Do you know what you were like?

245
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:55,861
AN EXTREMELY DRAMATIC REACTION

246
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,163
The owner gave us a thumbs-up.

247
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:58,230
I'm amazed.

248
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,232
You're pretty popular
among business owners

249
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,434
here in Gangneung.

250
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,703
First, the fish stew restaurant,
and now this cafe.

251
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,304
Maybe I should call you
the Gangneung Prince.

252
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,841
There's ongsimi inside that.

253
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,977
Is there ongsimi in this too?

254
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:13,779
HE TURNS HIS HEAD AND TAKES A SHY BITE

255
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:14,914
She's right.

256
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,650
A MOUTHFUL

257
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:21,821
It's so good.

258
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,824
The outer layer is nice and chewy as well.

259
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,994
On a scale of 1 to 100,
how close you've gotten now?

260
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:33,232
On a scale,
how would you rate our closeness?

261
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,500
From 1 to 100, where are we?

262
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:35,768
I'd rate you at 28.

263
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,169
28 OUT OF 100

264
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,338
We're at 37.

265
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,173
Really?

266
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:42,975
Hold on a second.

267
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,210
It went up by nine points.

268
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,979
There's a joy in gaining more points,

269
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:49,081
especially since you don't
hand them out easily.

270
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:52,985
Didn't he say a score above 40
counted as acquaintance?

271
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:56,989
A person I stay in touch with
and spend time with…

272
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,759
From 40 to 60.

273
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,160
Between that and 60?

274
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,928
An acquaintance? Hold on.

275
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,530
We've done four shows together,

276
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:05,931
and I'm still not an acquaintance?

277
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,167
Am I just a colleague, or simply someone
in the same line of work?

278
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,235
Then…

279
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:13,773
Maybe 37 is too high.

280
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:17,977
SHAKES HEAD

281
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:23,649
TUTS

282
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:24,617
You know what?

283
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,053
We'll split the bill.

284
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:29,555
Wire us half of it, okay?

285
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,224
Just kidding.

286
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,459
What's my score, then?

287
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,195
I really was joking.

288
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,731
You can't tell a lie.

289
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,033
You'd rather stay silent than tell a lie.

290
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,736
You're smiling awkwardly.

291
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:45,638
A score of 28

292
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:47,640
when we spent 12
and a half hours together?

293
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:49,608
It was only a joke.

294
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:51,677
Well, everyone laughed except me.

295
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,280
Check the episode when it airs.

296
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,982
-Anyway, this was so good.
-I know.

297
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,652
There's nothing like this in Seoul.

298
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,220
That's why I'm so disappointed.

299
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,157
I know a really good place, although
what they do is slightly different.

300
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,026
-In Seoul?
-I texted you about it.

301
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:09,628
He recommended five places in total.

302
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:10,730
Cheongpa Chaekgado.

303
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:13,232
Cheongpa-dong? I go there often.

304
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:14,467
That place…

305
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,702
-You said they have good croffles.
-It's run by my friend.

306
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:18,904
PROMOTING A FRIEND'S CAFE

307
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,172
A good friend of mine.

308
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,173
Is the coffee good?

309
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,144
-If so, that's okay.
-They do insanely good croffles.

310
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,545
It's near Seoul Station.

311
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,581
No way. It's close to where I live.

312
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:29,582
-Really?
-Yes.

313
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:31,350
I'll check it out sometime.

314
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,452
The croffle is really good.

315
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,421
What else other than croffle?

316
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,189
Well, coffee.

317
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,059
Their Americano is absolutely delicious.

318
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,429
I'd love for Cheongpa Chaekgado
to be introduced.

319
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,498
The place looks lovely.

320
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:46,932
I'll check it out.

321
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,567
-It's nice.
-Thanks for saying so.

322
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:49,568
The pleasure's mine.

323
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,071
SCRATCHING

324
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:53,372
What now?

325
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,307
You were up to something, weren't you?

326
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:56,776
No, not exactly.

327
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:57,676
Then what?

328
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,780
(HESITANT)

329
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:09,622
Have you heard of my movie,

330
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,224
Trivial Matters?

331
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,093
-Have you?
-No.

332
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,162
It's a short film.

333
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:18,497
This is embarrassing.

334
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,099
What about it? Why did you bring it up?

335
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:21,901
-What the hell?
-What is it?

336
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,169
I've watched this.

337
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:24,904
How did you come across it?

338
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,507
I used to be hooked on short films
a while back.

339
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:29,975
Exactly. I saw this on Watcha.

340
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,777
This is the one.
But why did you bring it up?

341
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:34,747
A good friend of mine…

342
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,951
I wanted to show him some support.

343
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:39,919
What is it?

344
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,755
I mentioned the cafe,
so now I'm mentioning a movie.

345
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:46,292
It's my way of supporting my friends.

346
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,561
So what about Trivial Matters?

347
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:51,163
-The director is a good friend of mine.
-The director?

348
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,299
Anyway, I thought…

349
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,336
talking about the movie
would be helpful for him.

350
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,237
Really?

351
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,072
I'm embarrassed to bring up
my own project, but…

352
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,074
How so? Don't be embarrassed.

353
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:03,542
This is great.

354
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,945
We're lucky to get to know
a talented director.

355
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:07,880
HAHAHA

356
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,482
Is there any other friend
you want to mention?

357
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:13,552
You must have a few more.

358
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:14,653
Well…

359
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,689
-It's all good now.
-Are you good?

360
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:18,958
He's hilarious.

361
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:20,893
HATCHET SHOT

362
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:23,395
Was that a Hatchet Shot?

363
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:24,797
Oh, dear.

364
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:26,832
That gave me the chills.

365
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:27,867
THE ANIME FAN LOVES IT, HE'S SOBBING

366
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,002
I'm feeling woozy.

367
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,371
FLAPPING

368
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:35,007
This is…

369
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,244
I only wanted to make it
less awkward. Sorry.

370
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,712
Feel free to do it anytime.

371
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,313
Things felt too awkward,

372
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,349
so before I knew it, I…

373
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:46,118
If that helps, then I'm all for it.

374
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:47,920
Keep throwing shots all you want.

375
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,355
By the way…

376
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:50,789
Sorry about that. I'll stop.

377
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:53,692
CLENCHES

378
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,261
You're clenching your fist.

379
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,999
It's your last meal in Gangneung.
Is there anything you'd like to have?

380
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,033
I…

381
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,335
I wouldn't mind sticking to coffee.

382
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,237
-Really?
-I'd love a different cup of coffee.

383
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,073
I don't often get the chance to do this.

384
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,508
We can go back to where we've been,

385
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,343
and I'd be glad

386
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,080
to have coffee with their dessert options.

387
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:15,981
Really?

388
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:20,319
But there's an amazing meal
waiting for you

389
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:23,289
that could even wipe out
your coffee craving.

390
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:24,690
And this place

391
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,660
is one of my stylist's favorites.

392
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:28,894
Is that so?

393
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,562
The braised jangchi is to die for.

394
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,831
Sure thing. I like the sound of that.

395
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,567
-Shall we?
-Sure.

396
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,569
13 MINUTES BY CAR TO KONGSAE JANGCHIJJIM

397
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,939
Recently, when Tae-goo was asked

398
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:44,109
how he gets closer to someone
he wants to be friends with,

399
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,912
-he said he just can't.
-That's right.

400
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,814
I saw that clip.

401
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:49,882
That's because

402
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:54,486
I rarely ever approach people first.

403
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,922
I tried that when I was younger,

404
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,991
but it only made things more awkward.

405
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:02,227
Even if it's someone
you just want to be friends with

406
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,762
-and not date?
-Both, actually.

407
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:06,098
I'm like that with people
I meet on set as well.

408
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,534
Still, I'm friends with a lot of people.

409
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,737
I'm only saying this

410
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,572
because most of my friends…

411
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,775
I'm close to people like Hie-won and Yul,

412
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:21,046
who invited me out for meals first.

413
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,482
But this is why I said
I spend most of my time alone.

414
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,584
When I talk to people on set,

415
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:30,756
I want to ask for their number
and get to know them better,

416
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,292
but I can't bring it up first.

417
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,461
That's the part I meant I'm poor at.

418
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,697
If I want to get close to someone

419
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,400
but they're shy like me,
then we can't get close.

420
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:45,571
I'd still make the effort
to reach out a few times.

421
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,773
But even if I manage
to start a conversation,

422
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,943
it doesn't last,
which makes things awkward.

423
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,980
Throughout my entire career,
there were only a handful of times

424
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,682
where I asked for other people's contact.

425
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,719
I worry it might make them uncomfortable.

426
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,355
That's why I never ask.

427
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:04,723
Have you wanted to ask

428
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,225
-for Do-yeon's number?
-Sorry?

429
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,227
CHUCKLING

430
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,462
I don't want to bother her.

431
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,131
He thinks that about everything.

432
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:14,400
He's bothered me with all kinds of things,

433
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,435
yet he thinks
asking for my number is rude.

434
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:18,971
We're on such different wavelengths.

435
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:19,872
DIFFERENT IDEAS ON WHAT'S RUDE

436
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:21,940
It must be a big deal for me.

437
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:23,242
-Asking…
-Their number.

438
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:24,743
-…for someone's number?
-Exactly.

439
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,345
That's how it feels to me.

440
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:29,314
Then what about if the other person
asks for your number first?

441
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,716
I'd gladly give it to them.

442
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:31,817
See?

443
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,652
Talking about it made me realize

444
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,686
-I'm not making sense.
-Exactly.

445
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,688
You don't have to overthink it.

446
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,425
THEY ARRIVE AT THE RECOMMENDED RESTAURANT

447
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:40,993
WITHOUT EXCHANGING NUMBERS

448
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,061
Thank you.

449
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:43,996
Enjoy your lunch, sir.

450
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,066
Hello.

451
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:49,234
I'm not even joking.

452
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:53,672
My stylist kept bringing up this place.

453
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,340
It got me so curious.

454
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,576
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

455
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,645
-Welcome.
-Hello.

456
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:01,680
We heard so much about this place
and came from Seoul.

457
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,915
Why, thank you.

458
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:06,251
-Is braised jangchi what we want?
-That's right.

459
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:07,686
Thank you.

460
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,421
Have you had jangchi before?

461
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:10,522
This will be my first time.

462
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,157
Me too. I haven't even heard of it.

463
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:15,594
Jangchi is a term used
in Gangwon Province dialect

464
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:16,762
that refers to all long fish.

465
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:19,064
Apparently, it's 90 cm long.

466
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,133
It has bones.

467
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,868
He's not a huge fan of bones.

468
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,636
I'll debone the fish for you.

469
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,171
Don't worry and just have the meat.

470
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:27,406
DON'T WORRY AND JUST HAVE THE MEAT!

471
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,143
IT'S ANNOYING

472
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:32,678
You're so annoying.

473
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:34,880
I pointed with two fingers,

474
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,014
and he made this motion.

475
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:39,218
-How long is 90 cm?
-I'm curious.

476
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,854
If it's 90 cm long, it's a super big fish.

477
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:45,657
Is your shoulder bothering you?

478
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,759
STARTLED

479
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,562
In the car,
you said you weren't awkward anymore.

480
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,864
STRETCHING OUT OF AWKWARDNESS

481
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:53,432
This feels new all over again.

482
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,101
THE TRAVEL BUDDY GETS AWKWARD
WHENEVER HE'S AT A RESTAURANT…

483
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:57,936
How many personas do you actually have?

484
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,139
It's amusing, though.

485
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:01,874
It's like trying to complete a game.

486
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,175
I can't be complacent.

487
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,511
I can't think
that you've gotten more comfortable.

488
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,815
It's all right.

489
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,820
I see a lot of scribbles.
It must be an old restaurant.

490
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:16,922
Do you scribble on walls too?

491
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:18,724
No.

492
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:21,226
-Do you?
-Yes.

493
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,095
Should we do it too then?

494
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:23,996
Sounds good.

495
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,664
THEY WILL WRITE ON THE WALLS

496
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:26,832
Write wherever you want.

497
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:28,400
As for me…

498
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:33,906
SHE CHOOSES THE HIGHEST SPOT ON THE WALL

499
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:38,577
Done.

500
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:41,914
HE COPIES HIS FRIEND AND WRITES
CLOSE TO THE CEILING TOO

501
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,182
Oh, my god.

502
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,017
HE WRITES ON A VERY HIGH SPOT ON THE WALL

503
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,218
You're super tall.

504
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:50,589
THE AIR IS HEAVY WITH AWKWARDNESS AGAIN

505
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,157
Here's the food.

506
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,325
Thank you.

507
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,561
PUTTING OUT THE SIDE DISHES

508
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:56,528
No way.

509
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,797
I haven't had cold bean sprout soup
for a while.

510
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,133
I can tell it'll be good.

511
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,467
There's stir-fried fish cake
that you like.

512
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:03,569
-I see.
-Right.

513
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:04,803
I also like muk.

514
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,672
Muk? I like that too.

515
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,040
You like these two, right?

516
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,876
STEALS

517
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:12,477
Thank you.

518
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,012
Thank you so much.

519
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,681
I like those at the far end.

520
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:19,284
CLEARING THROAT

521
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,086
I didn't think you'd play along.

522
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:23,922
HEHE

523
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:26,992
TAKING THEM BACK

524
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:30,996
FLICK

525
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:35,634
This is dangerous.

526
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:37,035
Of course.

527
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,871
It's like you throw me a bone
every time we get bored.

528
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,074
THE MAIN DISH, BRAISED JANGCHI, IS SERVED

529
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,008
Please enjoy.

530
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,043
This looks amazing. Thank you.

531
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:46,912
This is awesome.

532
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,348
The sauce looks amazing. Thank you.

533
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,850
Thanks.

534
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:53,885
This has fewer bones on it.

535
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,020
Geez, thanks.

536
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:56,488
Goodness.

537
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,491
How many times are you going
to say "gosh"?

538
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,360
Thank you so much.

539
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,328
My mouth is watering.

540
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:05,897
-Shall we dig in, then?
-Sure.

541
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,933
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

542
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,369
-I heard the sauce was exceptional.
-Really?

543
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,738
My stylist told me twice

544
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:14,840
that I should have the sauce with rice.

545
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:16,541
TRYING THE JANGCHI FIRST

546
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:19,177
NO WAY

547
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:21,647
-Watch out for the bones.
-The sauce is incredible.

548
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:22,614
Is it good?

549
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,683
I heard you like spicy food, so…

550
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:27,586
It smells amazing.

551
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:33,592
It's so good!

552
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,994
It's super tender.

553
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,996
I didn't know jangchi meat was this soft.

554
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:43,702
The softness of the meat falls
between hairtail and mackerel.

555
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,137
-It's so good.
-You're right.

556
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:52,511
-This is really good.
-It is.

557
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,379
I'd like to bring all of this home.

558
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:56,248
It's delicious.

559
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,850
The fish skin is also good.
It's nice and chewy.

560
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,719
The sauce is really good.

561
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,187
MIXING THE SAUCE INTO THE RICE

562
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,989
A BIG MOUTHFUL

563
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,960
The rice tastes so good with the sauce.

564
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:11,663
It's spicy but sweet.

565
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,700
ADDING MORE SAUCE TO THE RICE

566
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:18,003
A BIG MOUTHFUL

567
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,073
It's like tteokbokki sauce
for the grown-ups.

568
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:22,474
-I agree.
-Right?

569
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,009
That's a good way

570
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:26,011
to put it.

571
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,613
Tteokbokki sauce for the grown-ups.

572
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,616
It's so good
that almost everyone will like it.

573
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:39,991
I haven't seen sesame seeds in
bean sprout soup lately, and that's nice.

574
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:44,229
Doesn't the piece with skin remind you
of braised monkfish?

575
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:45,430
THE TEXTURE IS LIKE MONKFISH

576
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,866
Right? The skin's so soft.

577
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,502
I like the meat under the skin.

578
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:51,536
Sure.

579
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:52,871
So, you like everything about it.

580
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,742
I'm absolutely in love with the sauce.

581
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:59,277
Right? I keep mixing it into the rice.

582
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:01,446
-Something just came to mind.
-What is it?

583
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:05,117
I didn't do it out because
you might think it's too much.

584
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:06,151
Is it another role-play?

585
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:07,853
You can cut that out now.

586
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:12,391
Role-playing is all
I can think about right now.

587
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:15,394
You're too into role-playing now,

588
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,296
so shake that off
before we get in the cab later.

589
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,099
Leave it all behind on the beach here.

590
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,734
You should shake that off.

591
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,469
It'll be trouble if you go back
to Seoul like that.

592
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:26,772
-But that's my only weapon.
-Role-playing?

593
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,573
I didn't come here just to eat.

594
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:32,277
Enough with that already!

595
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:34,679
While we were talking earlier,

596
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,281
I kept thinking…

597
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,585
CHUCKLING

598
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:42,454
You see…

599
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:45,590
HE HASN'T SEEN DO-YEON YET

600
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:47,359
If I don't talk enough, it'd…

601
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,561
-Are you mad at me?
-Of course not.

602
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,264
I was doing a sketch of my own.

603
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:55,767
FOCUSING ON THE BRAISED JANGCHI AGAIN

604
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:02,040
We're done with the fish.

605
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:05,811
Now, let's go over
what we've done so far today.

606
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:08,547
We had coffee and then lunch,
so what's next?

607
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:11,149
Beats me. Sorry about that.

608
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:14,286
WHIMPERING…

609
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:16,521
I just saw the sad-looking end
of your finger.

610
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:18,557
Sweet boy, Tae-goo.

611
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:22,160
We had coffee and then lunch,
so what's next?

612
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,195
Coffee.

613
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:26,264
That's right. We'll head out
for more coffee.

614
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:27,165
Poof.

615
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:28,066
Poof!

616
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:31,770
We'll poof and disappear while seated,
then reappear on different chairs.

617
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:32,671
Right, okay.

618
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:33,939
-Got it?
-Sure.

619
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:36,475
Let's get going to the cafe.

620
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,009
One, two, three.

621
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:38,944
Poof.

622
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:39,845
Poof.

623
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:48,053
I bet we're the only ones
doing this "poof" thing in 2025.

624
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:49,688
All right, then.

625
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:52,257
I know I can count on you now.

626
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,460
You even know the best spots
to put the monkey everywhere we go.

627
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:57,362
SATISFIED

628
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:59,397
-Let's order our coffee, then.
-Sure.

629
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:01,633
First of all…

630
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:04,736
This is a cream latte
made with Chodang tofu.

631
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:06,538
-Is there a decaf option?
-Of course.

632
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:08,240
-I'll take that, then.
-And this.

633
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:10,141
Is this a non-coffee drink?

634
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,610
I'll take that.

635
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,811
-That?
-One of each, please.

636
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:15,080
Can I get also get
one iced vanilla bean latte?

637
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,016
-Decaf, please.
-Vanilla bean latte.

638
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:21,486
I'd like the tiramisu
that resembles the ocean in Gangneung.

639
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:24,155
How unique.

640
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:25,056
Poof!

641
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:26,391
POOF!

642
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,393
No way.

643
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:29,628
No way.

644
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:30,929
CAPTIVATED BY THE CUTE PEA

645
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,031
Usually

646
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:35,634
I don't find things like this fun or cute,

647
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,835
but this one is really adorable.

648
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:39,304
Shall I get you one?

649
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:41,640
CHUCKLING

650
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:42,607
-What's this?
-This?

651
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:43,775
Hold on!

652
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:46,478
It's a toy designed
to mimic the texture of tofu.

653
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:47,812
Like a stress ball.

654
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:51,116
This too?

655
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,885
"Usually I don't find things like this
fun or cute…"

656
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,321
Bouncy, bouncy.

657
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,722
I have to get this.

658
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:59,057
Let's get one of this too.

659
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:00,392
-Can we get one?
-Sure.

660
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,427
-You can't find this anywhere else.
-That's right.

661
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,462
-These are adorable.
-This…

662
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:05,897
Nice!

663
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:10,302
Isn't it adorable?

664
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:11,403
Thank you.

665
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:14,573
You should be thanking me.

666
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:15,941
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

667
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:17,008
PURCHASE COMPLETED

668
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:19,778
This is fascinating.

669
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:22,514
I didn't know you were
into props and stuff.

670
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:24,049
I'm not.

671
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:25,083
You aren't?

672
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,285
I'm not one to collect these things.

673
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:30,722
-But this was just too cute to resist.
-Is that so?

674
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,557
-And the tofu.
-That's also adorable.

675
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:34,726
You can keep this in your car
and manage your stress.

676
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:37,996
Didn't you say that
about the dolls we made yesterday?

677
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,030
Yes, tactile play.

678
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:40,799
I hear it's good for managing stress.

679
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:42,667
This isn't anything special,
but it's so cute.

680
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:45,003
LOVING IT

681
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:47,372
Hatchet Shot…

682
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:50,909
HAHAHAHA

683
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:52,777
IT'S SO CUTE…

684
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:57,048
-Just look at this.
-It's adorable.

685
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,050
UNWRAPPING THE TOFU TOY

686
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:00,418
Hold on.

687
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:01,586
-You took it out.
-Right.

688
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:05,523
The one on display felt more like tofu.
Does it seem better because it's not mine?

689
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,326
Hold on, they're different.

690
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:09,828
-What?
-Right?

691
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:11,463
Wait.

692
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:12,364
They feel completely different.

693
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,566
Maybe that's tofu for stews. Wait.

694
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,967
Is this like soft tofu?

695
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:16,868
Sir.

696
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,403
Why does the tofu feel different?

697
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:21,072
No two blocks of tofu
have the same texture.

698
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,074
Here's your tofu tiramisu,

699
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,576
cream latte,

700
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,778
and your ocean drink.

701
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:28,313
Thank you.

702
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,581
May I?

703
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:32,250
Do you prefer this one? We can trade.

704
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,551
Isn't this fascinating?

705
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:34,719
Why are you bullying my tofu?

706
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:37,422
You can make a balloon out of the tofu.

707
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,259
CHUCKLING

708
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,194
POP

709
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:46,364
SQUEEZE

710
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:48,333
HAPPILY SQUEEZING WITH BOTH HANDS

711
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:49,901
CHUCKLING

712
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,102
Sorry about that.

713
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:54,039
Who knew you'd be this happy
just playing with blocks of tofu?

714
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:56,274
-Isn't it so fascinating?
-Tell me about it.

715
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,476
Which would you like to try first?

716
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:01,046
I should have this first
to get a taste of the coffee.

717
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:03,548
That's Chodang tofu cream latte.

718
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:05,083
A HEALTHY, NUTTY CREAM LATTE
MADE WITH CHODANG TOFU

719
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,885
DAIRY CREAM, RAW SUGAR, TOASTED
BEANS, HIMALAYAN PINK SALT

720
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:09,287
-How fascinating.
-What's it like?

721
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,956
It's a tasty vanilla latte,
but with a touch of tofu.

722
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,692
-Can you taste the tofu?
-Would you like a sip?

723
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:18,863
-I see!
-It's a tasty vanilla latte,

724
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,766
-with a subtle touch of tofu.
-It's got a nice nutty flavor.

725
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:25,704
Seriously. It's so good.

726
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,038
Hey.

727
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:33,011
That's been the trend here in Gangneung.

728
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:34,913
The owners are watching us
try the food and drinks.

729
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:36,748
We should make eye contact.

730
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:38,349
I'll try the vanilla latte.

731
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:41,352
Geez.

732
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,687
That's so good.

733
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:46,191
It's sweet and…

734
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:48,059
SAVORING

735
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:48,960
APPROVES

736
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,130
You're like a coffee cupper.

737
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:54,132
It's delicious.

738
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:56,201
I'm glad I ordered this.

739
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,536
But this has got me hooked.

740
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:00,105
Really? Do you prefer that one?

741
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:02,574
I do. Vanilla latte's my favorite anyway,

742
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,008
but this is particularly good.

743
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,110
Is that more tasty?

744
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,778
It's so good.

745
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,414
This is the tofu ocean drink.

746
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:10,682
TOFU, WHITE TAPIOCA PEARLS, COCONUT JELLY

747
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,218
There's soft tofu at the bottom.

748
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:14,185
I'll try it.

749
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:17,555
No way.

750
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:19,724
It's refreshing.

751
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,559
Really? I wonder what it tastes like.

752
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:24,095
The coconut jelly and tofu together

753
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,663
create a really nice texture.

754
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:26,931
SAVORING

755
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:27,832
Isn't it unique?

756
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:28,933
It's an unusual taste.

757
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,269
It's really good.

758
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:34,072
I'm not sure where to begin with this.

759
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:36,241
I'll start with the sandy beach.

760
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:39,210
A BITE OF THE TOFU TIRAMISU

761
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,579
It's good.

762
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:43,815
It is.

763
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,050
It's so nutty.

764
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,919
I like this one too.

765
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:51,689
While going around, I've been asking you
how you find the food and the drinks.

766
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:54,459
Just like how they appraise relics
on Authentic Masterpieces,

767
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:56,194
you taste everything very seriously

768
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:58,429
and share how it was
after savoring the flavors.

769
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:00,832
You weren't kidding
about being a latte whisperer.

770
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,867
I guess it's like a hobby for me.

771
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:07,172
-Like a pastime?
-Finding and drinking good vanilla lattes.

772
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:08,573
I find joy in that.

773
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,644
I feel good when I think
about the coffee I'll have

774
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:13,978
after a meal.

775
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:17,015
I never considered it a hobby,

776
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:19,751
but it suddenly hit me right now.

777
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,821
Whenever someone asks me what my hobby is,

778
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:25,824
I usually say I don't have one
or that I like to work out.

779
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,327
But I guess I could say this is my hobby.

780
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:32,397
I've found my hobby, thanks to you.

781
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:33,765
I didn't do much.

782
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,901
SQUEEZING HARD

783
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,469
You'll pop the tofu.

784
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:43,107
That poor tofu.
Why would you squeeze it so hard?

785
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,844
Why are you turning the tofu
into soft tofu?

786
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:46,945
-Well…
-It didn't pop, though.

787
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,046
This is so much fun.

788
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,881
Was this trip

789
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:51,216
a flop,

790
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:53,718
a success,

791
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:54,686
a flop,

792
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,287
a success,

793
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,455
a flop,

794
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,523
a success, or…

795
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,425
Wait, it can't be a flop.

796
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:01,826
Is it a success,

797
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:03,094
less than a success,

798
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:05,330
-a success, or--
-It's taking too long.

799
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:06,798
Is it less than a success?

800
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:10,435
Then they'll edit at double the speed.
Now you made me forget!

801
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,136
What's his problem?

802
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,505
Who does he think he is,
the chief producer?

803
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,441
SHOOT

804
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:18,409
Look at you doing all sorts of things.

805
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,112
You're doing everything I hate.

806
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:22,981
What's with him?

807
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:24,883
Seriously.

808
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,752
What now? Why is he sitting over there?

809
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:29,420
Is this for real? Has he lost his mind?

810
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:34,325
You've changed a lot.

811
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,494
I wanted this trip to be fun for you.

812
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,629
Don't say that.

813
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:39,864
-Hold on.
-What now?

814
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:41,900
Wait.

815
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:43,801
Is this… Is this yours?

816
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:44,702
It is.

817
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:45,837
You think I took yours?

818
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:47,739
Where's mine?

819
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:48,973
Did you lose yours?

820
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:51,376
-Didn't you drop it over there?
-Wait.

821
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:53,311
No way, this is mine.

822
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:54,979
This is mine for sure.

823
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:56,614
This is mine.

824
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:59,717
I don't just steal anything.

825
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,986
Is this a designer merch?

826
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:03,354
If not, I wouldn't steal it.

827
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,791
That's odd.
I kept playing with it in my seat.

828
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:08,593
Hey, it's right here!

829
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,295
GLARING

830
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:12,697
I hid it.

831
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,665
Really?

832
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:15,934
WHILE TAE-GOO WAS ADJUSTING THE AC

833
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:18,636
HIDING

834
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:19,904
Is this okay for you?

835
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:20,805
Yes, that's fine.

836
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:23,474
I wanted to see
if you would leave with it.

837
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:25,276
I see. Geez.

838
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:27,745
I'd be upset
if you forgot to take it with you.

839
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,581
You were playing a prank on me.

840
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:31,482
A dog's barking.

841
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:34,986
A dog barked at my prank.

842
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:37,522
Lastly…

843
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:40,124
-There's no format you have to follow.
-I see.

844
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:42,527
You can write as if it's a diary entry

845
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:43,795
or a letter.

846
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:46,564
I see. Every guest has written in it.

847
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:48,967
You're writing a few words,
as it's always sad to say goodbye.

848
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:49,901
I see.

849
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,003
ENDING THE TRIP WITH A DIARY ENTRY

850
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,539
-You can listen while writing.
-Sure.

851
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:59,811
We always try our best to make
the trip comfortable for our guests.

852
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:01,079
In your case,

853
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,880
knowing you're a huge introvert,

854
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:05,016
instead of going outdoors
with all the noise,

855
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,952
we figured you'd prefer staying indoors
in a quiet space.

856
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,121
That's why we planned
this itinerary for you.

857
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:11,456
I was hoping you'd acknowledge that.

858
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:12,790
TAILORED FOR AN INTROVERT

859
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:14,392
-Just for me…
-Exactly.

860
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:16,294
…you made sure we mostly stayed indoors.

861
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:17,261
Thank you.

862
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:19,964
I appreciate your consideration.

863
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:23,134
I just wanted you to know the crew
put a lot of thought went into it.

864
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,103
Goodness, thank you.

865
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,270
Don't mention it.

866
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:31,142
THEY RESUME DIARY ENTRY

867
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:40,451
WHAT DO THEY THINK
OF THE TRIP TO GANGNEUNG?

868
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,388
Why do I feel nervous writing this?

869
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:44,322
Really?

870
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:45,857
My heart's racing.

871
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:47,658
Maybe it's the coffee.

872
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:50,294
-You've had three cups already today.
-Is that so?

873
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,430
Just kidding.
Don't feel too pressured by it.

874
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:56,267
I get embarrassed
about pouring my heart out.

875
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:08,613
GLANCING

876
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,015
GLANCING x2

877
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,118
GLANCING x3

878
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:18,389
ACTING AS IF HE DIDN'T LOOK AT HER

879
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:20,725
TRYING TO STEAL A GLANCE AGAIN

880
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:27,498
STARING

881
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:32,503
All done. I didn't look at yours.

882
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:34,105
That won't do.

883
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:36,207
-Are you drawing something?
-What?

884
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:37,175
You should draw me.

885
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,376
I'll have to look at you.

886
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:40,511
-Can I draw you?
-Sure.

887
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:42,213
I'll look away.

888
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,450
What if it comes out weird?

889
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:47,652
-What if it's bad?
-That's okay.

890
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:48,853
My curiosity trumps everything.

891
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:50,621
Oh!

892
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,457
WITH NO HESITATION

893
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:54,659
I shouldn't have begun this.

894
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:56,761
Geez…

895
00:34:58,329 --> 00:34:59,430
Can I stop?

896
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:00,465
I won't look.

897
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:03,668
I'll open my eyes
when you need to see them.

898
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:04,602
I do.

899
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:05,603
EYES FLYING OPEN

900
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,405
I need to see you straight on.

901
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:10,174
If you look away, I'll work off that.

902
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:11,843
LEANS

903
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:13,077
Why did you tell me to look away

904
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:16,214
if you were just going to lean in
and meet my gaze?

905
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:18,549
It's so funny.

906
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:21,919
You told me to look away,
but then leaned toward me to look at me.

907
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:23,688
I needed to see you straight on.

908
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:25,790
CURIOUS

909
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:27,625
ACTING LIKE SHE DIDN'T LOOK

910
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:29,227
PEEKING

911
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:32,363
EYES STRAIGHT AHEAD

912
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,031
LEANING

913
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:37,268
Geez…

914
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:39,837
SPEED UP

915
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:42,006
How is the drawing going?

916
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,876
How is he making me look?

917
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:46,144
SKETCHING

918
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,378
How do I look in his drawing?

919
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:49,347
WHATEVER…

920
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:50,915
LEANING

921
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,117
What's the point of me looking away?

922
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:54,685
I still need to see you
straight on as well.

923
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,955
HAHAHAHA

924
00:35:58,422 --> 00:35:59,624
What am I supposed to do?

925
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:02,026
I regret ever starting this.

926
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:06,030
-I shouldn't have done this.
-Why not?

927
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:10,201
HESITANT

928
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,903
Here. Let me see.

929
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:13,070
No, let's not…

930
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:15,439
Just look at it, then.

931
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,041
I'll handle the rest.

932
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:23,881
So…

933
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:25,983
The drawing's cool.

934
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,819
I mean, it's got vibes.

935
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:29,954
Hardly.

936
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,455
I think it's quite cool.

937
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,723
I mean that.

938
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:33,791
It's really cool.

939
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:34,725
No, I messed it up.

940
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,227
-Isn't it cool?
-Hardly.

941
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,029
It took me a while to respond

942
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:39,397
because it was actually good.

943
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:41,799
I was trying to see
what you found so bad about it.

944
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,834
I'm sweating from the embarrassment.

945
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,137
I'm glad you're squeezing the tofu.

946
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,471
Keep doing that.

947
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,807
Who should read it first?

948
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,676
-I'm good either way.
-Should I go first?

949
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:53,811
-All right.
-You wrote quite a lot.

950
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:57,715
I wrote whatever came to mind,
and it turned into a lot.

951
00:36:58,516 --> 00:36:59,884
"The end of our trip to Gangneung."

952
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,520
"Tae-goo, I'm truly grateful
for such a joyful

953
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:05,089
and eventful day-and-a-half trip."

954
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,826
"It's wonderful to know
you're now part of this family."

955
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,195
"From sharing coffee and meals

956
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:13,864
to the little but deep conversations
we had along the way,

957
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:16,334
I enjoyed every moment of the trip."

958
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,604
"Side note, not all the moments were good,
but they passed quickly."

959
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,805
"End of side note."

960
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:22,540
"The Um Tae-goo I got to know

961
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:24,308
is considerate, thoughtful,

962
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:28,045
playful, has grown to like role-playing,
and does everything with passion."

963
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:29,247
"But most of all,

964
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:31,482
he's someone I want to keep talking to."

965
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:35,086
"For me, Gangneung will be remembered
as a special place

966
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:38,189
where Um Pelvis and I went
from awkward beginnings

967
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,591
to becoming closer over and over."

968
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:44,061
"After any trip,
emotions and memories stay with you,

969
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:45,896
but with the pelvis
being a body part as well,

970
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:48,332
the memories will likely stay
even longer."

971
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:50,501
"We'll meet again next time, all awkward."

972
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:51,702
"From Jang Hatchet Shot."

973
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,437
FROM JANG HATCHET SHOT

974
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:56,674
That's my letter to you.

975
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:58,009
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

976
00:37:58,509 --> 00:37:59,844
You wrote a lot as well.

977
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:02,013
That was someone else's, sorry.

978
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,915
THAT WAS SOMEONE ELSE'S, SORRY

979
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:06,851
It would've been hilarious
if he had read someone else's.

980
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:11,756
"Thank you for this special day."

981
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:14,992
"I'm grateful for the interest and care."

982
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:18,329
"Thank you for turning Gangneung

983
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,299
"into a place of nice memories for me."

984
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,501
"Jang Hatchet Shot!"

985
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:24,802
Geez.

986
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:26,037
"Thank you."

987
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:30,408
"To all the staff members
and business owners,

988
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:32,109
thank you."

989
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:37,581
I then spent the rest of my time
drawing you.

990
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:38,549
Don't be sorry.

991
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:41,786
Though it was short,
your sincerity came through.

992
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:43,521
-Thank you.
-We could sense your sincerity.

993
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:44,755
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

994
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:46,557
The trip is now over.

995
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,727
At the risk of sounding like a loser,
what's my closeness score?

996
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:50,928
A score of 98.

997
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,797
98 OUT OF 100 POINTS

998
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:54,131
But that score of 98

999
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:56,701
only applies to this exact moment.

1000
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:57,868
HAHAHA

1001
00:38:57,935 --> 00:38:58,936
Likewise.

1002
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,538
That's what I say as well.

1003
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:03,074
I spent an entire day with you,
but I get a 98

1004
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,909
for a fleeting moment.

1005
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:07,111
Even then, I'm honored
there was a moment like that.

1006
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:09,146
Now, it's dropped to 74.

1007
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:10,247
74 OUT OF 100 POINTS

1008
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:12,950
Does the score drop
the way a heartbeat does?

1009
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,619
If so, that's kind of scary.

1010
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,421
-Let's end on a high note, then.
-We're now at 22.

1011
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:18,522
No, wait.

1012
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,025
Just kidding.

1013
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,093
You're at 38.

1014
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,861
Geez, I'll stop.

1015
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:25,429
You should stop, Mr. 44.

1016
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:28,532
HOW ABOUT YOU STOP, MR. 44?

1017
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:30,501
-Just kidding.
-We've spent a long time together,

1018
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:32,703
and the more we meet,
the more time we spend.

1019
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:33,871
Hey, that's true.

1020
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:36,841
Would you be open
to a longer trip next time?

1021
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:37,908
Next time?

1022
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:39,477
A three-day trip?

1023
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,511
But well…

1024
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,847
He won't come. I can already tell.

1025
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:44,281
The "but well" is a dead giveaway.

1026
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:45,883
It's like this.

1027
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,218
AGAIN, HIS SHOULDERS ARE SWEATING

1028
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:48,919
"Thank you all so much."

1029
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:51,055
"I wish you all the best and good health."

1030
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:52,857
"Please give me your love and support."

1031
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,593
"Stay tuned to my future projects."

1032
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:58,429
Sure. We had a blast too, Mr. Um.

1033
00:39:58,496 --> 00:39:59,997
If I'm invited back on the show,

1034
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:03,467
maybe I can bring the fun quicker

1035
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:05,736
without the awkwardness at the restaurant.

1036
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:09,273
That could give me a chance
to show different fun sides of me

1037
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,875
that would feel fresh.

1038
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,144
So if you'll have me back…

1039
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:16,180
SHOOT

1040
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:18,783
Why is that so annoying?

1041
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,519
I can do this too. Hatchet…

1042
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:24,789
What's with him?

1043
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:27,291
I'm so sorry. I can't believe I said that.

1044
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:28,893
I'm really sorry.

1045
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:30,861
I must've lost my cool for a second.

1046
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,731
Anyway, I feel like
we should part ways now.

1047
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:35,166
Thanks for everything.

1048
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:36,300
Well done.

1049
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:37,301
WELL DONE

1050
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:40,671
You too, Tae-goo.

1051
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,106
I was role-playing just now.

1052
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,507
Really? Well, I wasn't.

1053
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:44,742
Is that so?

1054
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:45,876
Geez, I'm sorry.

1055
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,545
-I'm good either way.
-Sorry.

1056
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:49,079
I almost forgot to say bye.

1057
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:53,017
Do you think we stuck to the travel rules?

1058
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,151
-I…
-Yes?

1059
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:55,953
It was calling Yo-han.

1060
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,288
Call for Yo-han
when it gets uncomfortable.

1061
00:40:57,354 --> 00:41:00,090
I planned to ask for Yo-han
if I feel uncomfortable.

1062
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:03,227
But after Do-yeon got me this stuffed toy,

1063
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,930
I passed that role on to him.

1064
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:08,866
In a way, I made a new rule for myself

1065
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:12,169
that didn't include asking for Yo-han.

1066
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:13,971
But since

1067
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:17,174
it might be upsetting
to suddenly get rid of this monkey toy…

1068
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:19,076
Is that why you kept carrying it with you?

1069
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,945
I also had a blast.

1070
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:22,880
At times, I forgot about the rules

1071
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:24,715
and treated you
in a playful and friendly way.

1072
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:26,083
Same here.

1073
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:28,486
In the context of role-playing,

1074
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:31,388
I dropped the honorifics
and spoke casually to you,

1075
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:32,690
which I somehow found fun.

1076
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:34,058
I had fun as well.

1077
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:35,125
Also,

1078
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:37,661
when my hands had something to play with…

1079
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:39,296
SQUEEZING

1080
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:40,898
POOF, HERE'S THE PEA!

1081
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:44,568
I definitely felt more comfortable.

1082
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:46,904
The same goes for the tofu.

1083
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:48,172
You see,

1084
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,541
when I have something
to play with in my hands--

1085
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:51,842
You feel calm?

1086
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:53,677
Yes, I definitely do.

1087
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:55,679
So if I'm ever back on the show,

1088
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:57,414
please give me something
to hold in my hands.

1089
00:41:57,481 --> 00:41:59,316
SQUEEZE

1090
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:01,252
-Just kidding.
-How about a rattle?

1091
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:02,653
We'll get you a rattle at the very least.

1092
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,154
I can bring this tofu with me.

1093
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:05,122
Sounds good.

1094
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,191
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

1095
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:09,326
-Thank you!
-Thank you.

1096
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:12,763
Um Pelvis, can you clap the slate
before we finish up?

1097
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:14,298
Sure thing.

1098
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:16,400
One, two, three.

1099
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:17,801
Hatchet Shot!

1100
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,304
HATCHET SHOT!

1101
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:22,439
Unbelievable.

1102
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:25,709
What's with him?

1103
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,144
VERY PROUD

1104
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,179
How many times did I say that today?

1105
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:31,882
Anyway, thank you so much.

1106
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:33,183
Even the ending was perfect.

1107
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:39,189
UM TAE-GOO

1108
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:45,195
JANG DO-YEON

1109
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:57,007
It's like a scene from an ad.

1110
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,176
I'm in Buyeo now.

1111
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:01,045
That's how it seems.

1112
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:02,846
The theme of this trip

1113
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,982
is a walk through Buyeo with Yim Si-wan.

1114
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:07,651
I hope you'll understand my vibes
throughout this trip.

1115
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:09,687
I think my vibes are pretty out there.

1116
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:14,091
Oh goodness, why am I even here?

1117
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:16,527
GETTING INTO HIS CHUNGCHEONG PROVINCE VIBE

1118
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,861
Don't you remember?

1119
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,396
Remember what?

1120
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:20,898
I asked to borrow some money.

1121
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:22,366
Goodness.

1122
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,934
Yim Si-wan is the top actor.

1123
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:25,469
Jang Do-yeon is
the best show host out there.

1124
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:26,904
A MISCHIEVOUS TRAVEL BUDDY LIKE NO OTHER!

1125
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:27,972
Yim Si-wan, you!

1126
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:29,940
I WON'T HOLD BACK!

1127
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:31,508
-Unbelievable.
-What's wrong?

1128
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:32,409
JANGDOBARI WON'T BACK DOWN

1129
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:34,278
Gosh, this is so embarrassing.

1130
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:35,879
ANOTHER CHARMING ASPECT OF THIS TRIP

1131
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,648
STRESS-FREE, THRILLING ACTIVITIES

1132
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:39,583
ON TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN

1133
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:42,019
THEY LEAVE BEHIND
A BEAUTIFUL PHOTO TO REMEMBER

1134
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:43,554
THE DUO'S CHEMISTRY FILLED WITH LAUGHTER

1135
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,589
DO-YEON AND SI-WAN
JOIN THEM ON THEIR JOYFUL TRIP!

1136
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:48,626
A WALK AROUND BUYEO WITH SI-WAN
CHECK IT OUT NEXT SATURDAY AT 5 P.M.

1137
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:50,694
