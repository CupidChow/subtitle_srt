1
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:05,839
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

2
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:12,779
Hello. Bound for a breezy break
with bundles of stories in my bag.

3
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,381
I'm Jang Do-yeon
of Getaway and Go with Jangdobari.

4
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:15,749
Can you see where I am?

5
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:20,587
A neighboring country far from home.
I'm here in Tokyo, Japan.

6
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,056
I love you, everyone!

7
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,860
THE CAPITAL CITY OF JAPAN,
OUR DISTANT BUT NEIGHBORING COUNTRY

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,530
TOKYO, A TRULY MULTICULTURAL CITY

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,801
WHICH SIDE OF TOKYO WILL THEY GET TO SEE?

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,704
That's right.

11
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:40,240
Hey, guys. Yes.

12
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:42,442
Thank you, yes.

13
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,210
Show off your Japanese a bit.

14
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:45,478
My Japanese?

15
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,615
If you like beer, remember this one thing

16
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:49,916
when you go to an izakaya.

17
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:51,651
Hit me with a draft beer, please.

18
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,487
Say that, and they'll bring you
a glass of draft beer pronto.

19
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:56,523
That's it.

20
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:57,991
Do you travel to Japan often?

21
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,759
It's close by but still abroad.

22
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:02,829
The country is welcoming to travelers,
and the food is great.

23
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:07,200
That's why I visit Japan a lot
when I have the time.

24
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:10,870
Is there anything
you're looking forward to on this trip?

25
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:13,773
My travel buddy today knows his stuff,

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,378
so I'm excited to follow his guidance.

27
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:20,613
Right now,
my knowledge of Japan is shallow,

28
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,084
so I'm looking forward
to learning more from him.

29
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,485
That's what I'm excited about,

30
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:26,820
especially the restaurants.

31
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:31,224
You're already acquainted
with this travel buddy.

32
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,693
That's right.
I feel a weird kind of kinship with him.

33
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,797
He's known for being a true introvert,

34
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:40,934
and he feels like one of my people
because our energy levels match.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,535
That brings me comfort.

36
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,504
I'm also curious

37
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:48,274
about what made him decide
to be on this show.

38
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:49,275
I doubt it was an easy choice.

39
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:51,177
Anyway, I'll see you in a bit.

40
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:52,912
See you all later.

41
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,182
SHE ARRIVES AT THE DESTINATION,
SPEAKING A MIX OF KOREAN AND JAPANESE

42
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:58,351
That came out of nowhere, didn't it?

43
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:03,690
SUMIDA PARK

44
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:07,861
ALTHOUGH IT'S THE WEEKEND,
SUMIDA PARK IS QUIET AND LESS BUSTLING

45
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:10,463
Why haven't I been here before?

46
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,333
Haven't you been here before?

47
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,201
No, not even once.

48
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:18,805
This is why you need to travel
to places you haven't been to.

49
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:19,839
The Sumida River.

50
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,878
I, Jang Do-yeon,
seep into the ambience here.

51
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,450
What you see behind me

52
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,719
is the tallest broadcast tower
in the world.

53
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,387
Sweet. Isn't it cool?

54
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,723
It's a cloudy day,
not clear enough to enjoy the view,

55
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:38,091
but that adds a charm.

56
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,559
Wait, charming?

57
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:42,996
Which charming travel buddy comes to mind
when you hear that word?

58
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:48,368
Even among Korea's top celebrities,
he has been especially in demand.

59
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:49,836
Not only is he here for the show,

60
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:52,472
but he traveled all the way
to Japan with us,

61
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,707
and we're extremely grateful.

62
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:58,244
From what I heard, he's a true introvert.

63
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,751
THE INTROVERT IS PERFORMING A STREET ACT

64
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,457
So will the two introverts

65
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,526
manage to keep the conversation going

66
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,495
without any pauses?

67
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,030
I guess it's my job to prevent that.

68
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,331
Now, where is he?

69
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,204
TODAY'S TRAVEL BUDDY, A LOVER OF DANCING

70
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:27,874
Is he dancing?

71
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:30,944
Is he…

72
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,012
Are you sure he's all right?

73
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,881
Is he okay?

74
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,084
THE TRAVEL BUDDY DOESN'T KNOW
THAT DO-YEON IS APPROACHING

75
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:45,858
CHUCKLING

76
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,861
FINALLY, HE NOTICES DO-YEON, HAHA

77
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,664
CACKLING

78
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,066
Hi.

79
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,072
SILENTLY, THEY TAKE EACH OTHER'S HANDS

80
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:00,440
What were you up to just now?

81
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:01,874
They asked me to dance.

82
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,077
So you were dancing?

83
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:05,078
I pulled out a few moves.

84
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:06,112
Geez, I just spat a little.

85
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:07,547
-I'm sorry.
-Don't worry about it.

86
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,949
Is this something you usually do?

87
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,051
Do you start dancing
whenever you feel like it?

88
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:14,554
When I hear a song I like, I…

89
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:15,955
You dance to it?

90
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,190
Really? Even on the street?

91
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,392
Well, I don't go all crazy.

92
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,629
I just bounce to the beat as I walk.

93
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:24,130
From what I hear

94
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,199
and from what I've seen,

95
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,868
-you're quite the introvert.
-Sure.

96
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,536
That clearly doesn't stop you
from dancing.

97
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,537
I guess not.

98
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,905
I SEE

99
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:34,641
Do you become a different person
when you dance?

100
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:36,242
Yes, I think so.

101
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:39,212
-Aren't you also an introvert?
-I am.

102
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,180
Still, when you do live comedy sketches--

103
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:42,982
I go wild.

104
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,183
I'm like that too.

105
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,586
Anyway,

106
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,355
thank you for joining us out here.

107
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,058
LEE JUN-YOUNG
ACTOR & SINGER

108
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:55,461
FROM A DESERTER WITH NOTHING TO LOSE
ON D.P

109
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,731
TO A WASHED-UP POP STAR ON MASK GIRL

110
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:00,566
HE PUT HIMSELF ON THE MAP
BY PLAYING VILLAINS

111
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:04,037
HE REINVENTED HIMSELF ON THE SERIES,
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU TANGERINES

112
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:09,008
HE ALSO STARRED IN PROJECTS
LIKE MELO MOVIE

113
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:12,312
AND WEAK HERO CLASS 2

114
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,747
TODAY'S TRAVEL BUDDY
THE SON OF NETFLIX, LEE JUN-YOUNG

115
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:16,749
1 HOUR AGO

116
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,851
When was the last time you visited Japan?

117
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,220
I was here for work

118
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,723
about four to five months ago,

119
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,859
but I'm nervous because
it's my first time here on vacation.

120
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:31,497
I haven't been to Japan on a trip
or for fun before.

121
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:33,800
How long did you work here in Japan?

122
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:37,503
From 2014 to about 2022.

123
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,040
I came to Japan for the first time
when I was 18,

124
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:43,476
and all I knew in Japanese
was "I'm sorry."

125
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,144
I kept apologizing everywhere I went.

126
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:49,882
I watch this show a lot while I'm eating.

127
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,118
I've seen the episodes with Byun Yo-han,

128
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,153
Um Tae-goo,

129
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,622
Zhang Hao, and even Ga-bee.

130
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,458
What I like is how low-key
and subtle it is.

131
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:03,029
That's the main reason
I agreed to be on the show.

132
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,431
-You'll be traveling with us for two days.
-Right.

133
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:08,568
Are you excited or concerned
about anything?

134
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:12,171
Well, I haven't spoken much Japanese
since I worked here,

135
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:15,708
so I'm worried it'll be rusty.

136
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:18,678
Still, since I'm here on a trip,

137
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:22,515
I'd like to break the ice
as soon as possible

138
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:25,818
and have a fun, relaxed time with Do-yeon.

139
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,186
I'd love nothing more than that,

140
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,055
and we'll get there if I do my part.

141
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,392
This is where I spent more than half

142
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,728
of those intense years in my 20s.

143
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,630
I'm excited to see how much has changed,

144
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,065
so thank you for having me.

145
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:45,238
I heard you were active in Tokyo
for a long time.

146
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:49,742
Between 2014 and about 2022,

147
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,578
I spent a lot of time in Tokyo.

148
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,981
That's quite a while.
You must have been here often then.

149
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,015
No, not really.

150
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,818
I only saw this place
when I was passing by in cars.

151
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:02,155
Shibuya is where I stayed.

152
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:03,189
-Shibuya?
-Yes.

153
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,925
-Where the famous Scramble egg is?
-That's right.

154
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:06,893
Right.

155
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,129
AWKWARD

156
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,532
It's only awkward in the beginning.

157
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,267
I'm fine with that.

158
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,235
-It'll be all right.
-I think I'm good.

159
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:20,072
There's a Netflix logo on your backpack.
Could I take a look?

160
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,507
It's Labubu!

161
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,776
That was a gift.

162
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:24,710
No way.

163
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,813
Why is Maeng-gu hanging here like laundry?

164
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,781
Isn't it cute?
He's one of my favorite characters.

165
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,683
Is that the reason? These are adorable.

166
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,185
When did you get this backpack?

167
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:33,319
You've done a lot of Netflix shows.

168
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:36,556
When I was filming Melo Movie,

169
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,725
the director gave it to me as a gift.

170
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,461
-Do you wear this often?
-Yes?

171
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:42,361
-Really?
-Yes.

172
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:46,165
Don't people recognize the backpack
and realize you're a celebrity?

173
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,901
People are too busy
to pay attention to me.

174
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,636
Of course. They're all on their phones.

175
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:53,139
So it doesn't inconvenience me.
Anyway, it has a lot of pockets,

176
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,807
-which I love.
-That's so cool.

177
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,477
-There's a theme to today's trip.
-What is it?

178
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:59,579
Save it in my heart.

179
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,015
-You have to join me for that one.
-Oh no.

180
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,417
How do you do it again?

181
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,518
INTROVERT NEEDS HELP :'(

182
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,787
-Do I also have to do that?
-We're just showing off.

183
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:10,356
-Save it in my heart.
-Save.

184
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,859
THE TWO INTROVERTS DO THEIR BEST

185
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:14,894
That's the theme of this trip.

186
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,196
It's because you like to take photos.

187
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:20,199
That's right. Taking photos
has become a hobby of mine.

188
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,568
During our trip,

189
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:26,772
I'm going to take photos of you
with a film camera.

190
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,708
-Do you usually use a film camera?
-Yes.

191
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:29,742
How charming.

192
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,244
You qualify. Now, let's go.

193
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,178
Thanks.

194
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:33,980
GETTING AWAY
WITH A HALFHEARTED OPENING SEQUENCE

195
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,416
-I'm glad we have good weather.
-Exactly. I was worried it might rain.

196
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,352
EPISODE 4
TAMING SOMEONE 12 YEARS YOUNGER

197
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,420
Did you pick up any new slang?

198
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:42,355
ICDRN.

199
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,023
ICDRN? What does that mean?

200
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,825
-Does it mean you're happy?
-That's right.

201
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:50,696
"I could die right now" basically means
I'm in paradise.

202
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,298
I learned that at a fan meet-and-greet.

203
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,201
Is the word a mispronunciation
of the Korean word for heaven?

204
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,503
I thought it came from "la la la."

205
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,739
I think it's along those lines,

206
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,340
but I don't know for sure.

207
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:03,042
Who knew? ICDRN, was it?

208
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,113
Would you like to walk on this side
just in case?

209
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:10,049
YOU'RE GIVING ME BUTTERFLIES

210
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,317
Can I read into that?

211
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,385
-What?
-Can I read into that?

212
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:15,288
Don't tell me it was so
you could have more space.

213
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:16,389
Of course not.

214
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,424
-Sorry.
-Come on.

215
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,593
IT'S FUN TO TEASE HIM

216
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,296
Check out that plate number. It's 7777.

217
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,464
What kind of luck are we in for today?

218
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:26,566
-Do you believe in those things?
-Four sevens.

219
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:27,500
I don't.

220
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,035
-Do you?
-I'm very superstitious.

221
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,071
I'm a true believer.

222
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:35,141
-After you. Excuse me.
-It's nice and cool in here.

223
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,545
You wouldn't have had the time to travel.

224
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:43,282
Right. It's been so long
since I went on vacation.

225
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,818
What's a priority for you when you travel?

226
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:46,752
Resting.

227
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:48,621
IT FEELS LIKE
WE SHOULD TURN THE CAMERAS OFF

228
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,222
Maybe you should take a break.

229
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:52,858
-You seem exhausted.
-You go on vacation

230
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,595
to relax and recharge.

231
00:09:55,661 --> 00:10:00,132
I'm not a fan of vacations
that are busy and eventful.

232
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,136
You don't like moving around
and doing things on a tight schedule.

233
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:05,271
-No.
-You don't like that.

234
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:06,172
How about this, then?

235
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,774
Is there a place
you've always wanted to travel to?

236
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:10,176
That was Japan for me.

237
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:11,777
When I have the time,

238
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:15,147
I want to try living here for a month.

239
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,383
I haven't completed
my military service yet,

240
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,052
so maybe I'll get that chance
after I'm discharged.

241
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,455
-Weren't you born in the year of the ox?
-I was.

242
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:23,923
Same here.

243
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,424
HE WAS BORN IN 1997
SHE WAS BORN IN 1985

244
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,460
-No wonder.
-Call me Auntie.

245
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:28,527
A BIG AGE GAP THAT MAYBE FEELS SMALL

246
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:29,528
Got it, Auntie.

247
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,499
It's nice being here with my nephew.

248
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,401
Jun-young, my hotshot celebrity nephew.

249
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,036
The age gap is 12 years.

250
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,871
-You can address me casually.
-Casually?

251
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,406
Yes.

252
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,474
-Maybe I should.
-I mean,

253
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,043
we'll be on another show together
in two weeks.

254
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,945
Sure. Actually, you're right.

255
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,513
We'll be in Busan together.

256
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,582
I'll look to you for guidance.

257
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,616
Come on.

258
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:52,985
Trust me.

259
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:55,721
FLIRTING TO THE MAX BY AN INTROVERT

260
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:56,789
I'm a macho girl.

261
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:57,923
PROUD

262
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,892
We now have to decide

263
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,061
-on the rule for this trip.
-The rule.

264
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,964
What do you want it to be?

265
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,932
What don't you want to do?

266
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,369
I know we're filming a show,
but it's still a trip.

267
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,572
We keep saying we should get comfortable,
but that's not easy.

268
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,007
So I hope we can feel less awkward.

269
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:16,842
-I want my travel buddy
-Sure.

270
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:18,144
to be less uncomfortable.

271
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,479
I also don't want him
to regret coming here.

272
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:23,549
Please don't let him feel
like going home, not even once.

273
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,451
And when we wrap up,

274
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,954
I hope he feels even the tiniest bit sad
that the trip is ending.

275
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:30,756
Something like that.

276
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,324
I'm not asking for much

277
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,093
even though that was a long list.

278
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,196
What are the things
we should absolutely do?

279
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,364
You should speak casually to me.

280
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:39,498
-Casually?
-Yes.

281
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:42,535
That means I'll treat you casually too.
Are you good with that?

282
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:43,936
OF COURSE

283
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:45,004
-I'm good.
-Got it.

284
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,606
Calling me a senior feels
too stiff and formal,

285
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,508
-so just use my name.
-Do-yeon.

286
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:50,409
Got it.

287
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,611
I'll call you by your name
and keep things casual.

288
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,413
What if after all this,
we meet in two weeks

289
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,948
-and go back to being formal?
-"Hello, Mr. Lee."

290
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,116
No way.

291
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,384
I won't return to that.

292
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:00,586
I won't go back.

293
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,589
How are you so good at hosting shows?

294
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,124
-How so?
-You're…

295
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,326
-Even though I'm an introvert?
-It's not that.

296
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,463
I'm a big fan of your style of comedy.

297
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,631
You make people laugh
without putting others down.

298
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,133
That's not true.

299
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,334
I'm sorry.

300
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,469
About what?

301
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,471
I made fun of you
at the Blue Dragon Film Awards.

302
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,909
JUN-YOUNG WENT ON STAGE THINKING HE WON
AFTER CONFUSING JUN-HYUK'S NAME FOR HIS

303
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,044
JUN-HYUK: JUN-YOUNG, YOU MADE MY DAY

304
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:27,146
I MIXED UP YOUR NAME WITH MINE,
SO MAYBE WE'RE MEANT TO BE

305
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:28,147
LET'S GRAB A BITE SOMETIME

306
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:31,417
WHEN DO-YEON CAME ON STAGE TO RECEIVE
HER AWARD SHE TEASED HIM BY SAYING,

307
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:34,887
"THE CAMERA CATCHES JUN-YOUNG BEFORE
ANNOUNCING THE WINNER FOR EVERY CATEGORY"

308
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:37,089
-Why did you text me afterwards?
-I felt guilty.

309
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,858
-I wasn't upset about that at all.
-Come on.

310
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,292
I felt awful afterward.

311
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,628
It was completely my fault.

312
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,397
We think the whole thing was hilarious

313
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:47,633
and joke about how you became
the man of the hour,

314
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,170
but you must have been extremely
embarrassed by your mistake.

315
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:56,041
I wasn't happy with myself
for teasing you about your mistake,

316
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,511
so I texted you because I felt bad.

317
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:02,047
Thanks to your comment,
the mood lightened up.

318
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:05,518
To be honest, I wanted to go home
after Part One of the show.

319
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,787
-I can relate.
-After Part One ended,

320
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:10,256
I went to Jun-hyuk and apologized.

321
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:11,223
Being as kind as he is,

322
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,858
he said he found it funny.

323
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,995
"We haven't seen each other for a while,
so thanks for the laugh."

324
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,397
Right after that,
I came down with body aches.

325
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,233
I wasn't and probably never
will get used to having

326
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,601
that much attention on me.

327
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,170
Is that why you cut your livestream short?

328
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,506
Honestly, it cracked me up. What was that?

329
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:28,874
I was worried I'd make a mistake.

330
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:31,310
During livestreams,

331
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,512
I've never had
that many people tune in before,

332
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,515
but so many people showed up that day.

333
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:38,918
It was a number I've never seen.

334
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:41,887
Hello.

335
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,722
JUN-YOUNG BEGAN LIVESTREAMING AS USUAL

336
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:47,059
LETTING HIMSELF SWAY WITH THE RHYTHM

337
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:51,263
AFTER A WHILE,
HE NOTICED THE NUMBER OF VIEWERS

338
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,298
Six thousand?

339
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,533
AM I SEEING THIS RIGHT?

340
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,534
What the…

341
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,904
THE LIVESTREAM HAS ENDED

342
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,907
The comments were flying by
at record speed,

343
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:05,044
and people kept pointing out
how shocked I was.

344
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,279
I shut it down
before I could say something wrong.

345
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,348
I ended it without even saying goodbye.

346
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:10,616
Your expression totally got me.

347
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,284
You were wide-eyed like a rabbit

348
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,186
and then shut it off almost immediately.

349
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:15,621
Are you planning another session?

350
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,223
I did one recently,

351
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,958
but I didn't check the viewer count.

352
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:20,659
I didn't look.

353
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,528
You tried really hard
not to look at the number.

354
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:25,397
Someone pointed out in the comments
that I was trying hard not to look.

355
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:26,298
They knew.

356
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,267
Your fans must think you're adorable.

357
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,702
I told them I wasn't going to look.

358
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:30,803
AN ADORABLE REBELLION
IN THE EYES OF THE FANS

359
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,438
What do you do in your free time?

360
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,907
I dance at a studio.

361
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,742
You must really dance a lot.

362
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:40,546
Did you find time to dance
even while you were filming other series?

363
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:42,314
After filming,

364
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,417
if I'd had an extremely stressful day,
I'd call my crew

365
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,219
saying I wanted to dance.

366
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:48,687
They'd come meet me without a word.

367
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,056
They can just tell when I've had

368
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,158
a crappy day.

369
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,760
Instead of saying you're stressed out,

370
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,263
all you have to do is say
you want to dance.

371
00:14:58,497 --> 00:14:59,498
That's so cool.

372
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,566
I actually have two left feet.

373
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:01,467
You do?

374
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:02,735
Yes, absolutely.

375
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:05,237
Not only that,
I couldn't even carry a tune.

376
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:07,006
My parents laughed whenever I sang.

377
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,275
How did you get so good then?

378
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:10,676
I guess my personality played a part.

379
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,012
Even though I'm not good at something,

380
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,749
I, at least, don't want people
to think I'm terrible.

381
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,451
If you put your mind to it,
you can get it done.

382
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:20,552
That's true.

383
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,254
I feel like it's a blessing

384
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:23,856
and a curse.

385
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:24,857
How can it be a curse?

386
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,593
It's the same with food.
Let's say something's delicious.

387
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,894
That's all I eat.

388
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,496
-You stick to one thing.
-Right.

389
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,332
How is that a curse,
especially in this line of work?

390
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,701
When I asked my staff

391
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,536
whether I had stressed them out at all,

392
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,739
they said everything was fine,
but they wanted to stop eating ramen.

393
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:42,041
JUN-YOUNG'S FAVORITE RAMEN

394
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,343
-That's all I ate.
-Right. The choice of menu matters.

395
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,646
When I don't have projects lined up,
I always eat ramen.

396
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,415
Do you like finding good restaurants?

397
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:50,549
GOOD RESTAURANTS…

398
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,052
Doesn't that matter to you?
What about spots you have to line up for

399
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,720
or ones people recommend?

400
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:55,821
Waiting in line?

401
00:15:55,888 --> 00:16:00,459
I stopped minding it
after I fell in love with ramen,

402
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:01,760
but before that…

403
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,062
-You couldn't take it?
-No.

404
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,163
I hated waiting in line so much

405
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,765
that I'd go to nearby places
or ones that weren't crowded.

406
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:09,802
You still had ramen no matter what,
which is kind of scary.

407
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:10,970
It's terrifying.

408
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,072
-It was like this.
-Yes?

409
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:16,675
I used to live
with all the UKISS members at the time,

410
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:20,713
and there was a ramen place we went to
for two to three weeks straight.

411
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,014
-Is that where we'll eat today?
-Yes.

412
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:24,350
A SURGE OF EXCITEMENT

413
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,451
I'm so hungry.

414
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:31,924
HOW GOOD WILL THE RAMEN BE
AT THE PLACE A RAMEN LOVER RECOMMENDED?

415
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,927
I can't wait.

416
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,196
I've never eaten
at this specific branch before.

417
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:38,097
Really?

418
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,700
ENTERING THE RAMEN PLACE
JUN-YOUNG WAS FOND OF

419
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:44,570
What's good here?

420
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:45,871
This is what I always had.

421
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,373
Really? Then I'll have that too.

422
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:49,975
This dish is spicy,
just not by our standards.

423
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,643
Love it. I'm good with spicy food.

424
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,245
I'll have whatever you recommend.

425
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,080
I'll have it with soft boiled eggs.

426
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,148
Same for me.

427
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,751
There's a cold option and a hot option.

428
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,719
-What do you recommend?
-I have mine hot.

429
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,054
I'll have that too.

430
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,189
There's large and extra large.

431
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,291
-I'll have regular just in case.
-Regular?

432
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,860
Is there anything you'd like to add?

433
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:09,094
I want to try the boiled dumplings!

434
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:10,629
Sorry about that.

435
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,264
-I lost my cool just now.
-I know.

436
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,565
It's just that I love dumplings.

437
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,202
REGULAR SPICY TSUKEMEN, BOILED DUMPLINGS,
"LARGE" SPICY TSUKEMEN

438
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:20,305
AFTER MUCH THOUGHT,
JUN-YOUNG SWITCHES FROM REGULAR TO LARGE

439
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:21,974
It's done.

440
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:28,280
I think I'll love this.

441
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,216
I can't wait.

442
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,653
How did you discover this place?

443
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,657
SOOHYUN, one of the UKISS members,

444
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,659
told the others about this place,

445
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,927
and the food turned out to be amazing.

446
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:45,164
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you so much.

447
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:49,868
There's another branch
of this restaurant in Shibuya,

448
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:52,971
and SOOHYUN and I collaborated
on a dish there.

449
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:54,973
-No way.
-We collaborated with the restaurant.

450
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,041
Actually…

451
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:57,910
What is it?

452
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,313
I paid for my meal today,

453
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,748
but I can eat here for free.

454
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,184
-How so?
-For the rest of my life.

455
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,618
Did they include that
in the collaboration?

456
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:09,655
I lost my wallet once,

457
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,123
so this is from another UKISS member.

458
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:14,893
This is so cool.

459
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,296
No way. Who knew this existed?

460
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:19,698
Excuse me.

461
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:22,234
This is so cool.

462
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:23,535
Is this still valid?

463
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,070
-Of course.
-Really?

464
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:28,407
-Would you like additional toppings?
-No, we're good.

465
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,409
I just wanted to check if this was valid.

466
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:31,777
But I do appreciate the offer.

467
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,479
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

468
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:35,180
-It's still valid.
-Really?

469
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,583
What was that about some toppings?

470
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,652
-He asked if I wanted extra toppings.
-Really?

471
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,154
You're like a prince.

472
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,023
My prince!

473
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,026
-That's why we always ate here.
-You're the tsukemen prince.

474
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,195
Now you know why we ate here
for three weeks straight.

475
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,930
That's so cool.

476
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:53,832
EMBARRASSED

477
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,501
EXPLORING THE SPICE OPTIONS
WHILE THEY WAIT

478
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:56,835
Oh, this looks tasty.

479
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,971
-This too.
-This is fried onion.

480
00:18:59,037 --> 00:18:59,938
This looks good.

481
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,909
Later, we'll be served tsukejiru,

482
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,778
-which we'll dip into.
-Is that a dip?

483
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,314
That sounds delicious.

484
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,350
You can customize it with vinegar,

485
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,952
which is what I do.

486
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:15,154
What about this shichimi powder?

487
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,121
-No.
-No on the powder?

488
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:18,357
-Adjust it to your taste.
-I can't wait.

489
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,693
Excuse me, can we get a bib apron?

490
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,995
Great. Thanks.

491
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:24,429
Thank you so much.

492
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,265
Would you like one?

493
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,866
-You're wearing white, so go ahead.
-I'm good.

494
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:29,401
It's fine.

495
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:31,436
TAKE IT, DO-YEON

496
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,471
Honestly, I'm fine.

497
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:33,472
NO, YOU TAKE IT

498
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,174
You're wearing nothing but white.

499
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,043
You're wearing all white on top,

500
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,478
so even a small splash would show.

501
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,180
BOILED DUMPLINGS
THAT'LL FILL THEM UP FOR NOW

502
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:42,648
-This looks so good.
-Thank you.

503
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,451
BOILED DUMPLINGS

504
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:48,287
It's so good!

505
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,755
I absolutely love dumplings.

506
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:51,657
-Dumplings?
-Yes.

507
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:52,891
Excuse me.

508
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,727
Can we get some plates?

509
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:01,200
HIS RADIANT SMILE CAN LIFT EVERYONE'S MOOD

510
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,735
Talk about spreading the happy virus.

511
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:05,237
You feel welcome.

512
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:06,638
I should smile a lot too.

513
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,776
Excuse me. Could we get another bib apron?

514
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,110
What did you say?
Did you ask for one more?

515
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:13,946
Yes, I asked for another.
Thank you so much.

516
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,615
-You're fluent in Japanese.
-Not really.

517
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:18,417
You're humble too.

518
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,120
This bib apron is something
a paper doll would wear.

519
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:24,523
Sorry for the wait.

520
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,291
Here's your regular spicy miso tsukemen.

521
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,093
The regular one is for her.

522
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,230
-Thank you.
-Please be careful, the broth is hot.

523
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:33,465
Got it. Thank you so much.

524
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:37,536
TSUKEMEN: JAPANESE RAMEN
SERVED WITH NOODLES YOU DIP IN BROTH

525
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,782
IF THE SOUP HAS COOLED @#$!~%@&

526
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,251
Got it.

527
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:54,620
What did he say?

528
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:55,821
That's a secret.

529
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:58,557
I'll save it as a surprise for later.

530
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:00,158
Really? Got it.

531
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,228
Please let me know if you want the soup

532
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:04,396
to be hotter.

533
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,098
Hold on, are we meant to drink this broth?

534
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:07,399
-Yes.
-I see.

535
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,369
It's so good.

536
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,170
It's really rich and thick.

537
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,339
DO-YEON QUICKLY TRIES THE BROTH HERSELF

538
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,175
I love that it's nice and hot.

539
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:18,577
It's even better in this weather.

540
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,380
-Try the soup and see if you like it.
-Sure.

541
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,848
-Just this?
-Yes.

542
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:25,050
This is insane.

543
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,184
HOW'S THE TSUKEJIRU ON ITS OWN?

544
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:30,856
WILL DO-YEON LIKE IT?

545
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:34,092
That's awesome!

546
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,227
Now, take this and…

547
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,896
-Should I add that?
-About two spoonfuls.

548
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:38,797
Got it.

549
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:41,833
It's mildly spicy.

550
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,202
Actually, it hits the back of the throat.

551
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:49,174
THIS TIME, SHE TRIES THE SOUP
WITH THE FRIED ONION FLAKES

552
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,811
PROPERLY DIGGING IN
TO THE DISH FROM HIS PAST

553
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:01,253
Can I add all the noodles in here?

554
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:02,788
MMM

555
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:04,723
Is it good?

556
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,892
It's so good.

557
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:13,598
YUMMY!

558
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,235
SLURPING THE NOODLES,
HIS NOSE ALMOST IN THE BOWL

559
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:18,570
The spice really hits
the back of the throat.

560
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:20,439
Even the noodles are tasty.

561
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,174
It's so good.

562
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:24,609
I'll try the meat next.

563
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,781
YUMMY!

564
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:31,750
SHE'S ANNOYED THAT IT'S SO TASTY

565
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:32,651
I'm over the moon.

566
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:33,919
This is so good.

567
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,421
I should've ordered
five more pieces of meat.

568
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,156
It's so good.

569
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:40,158
SINCE HE ORDERED A LARGE BOWL,
HE CAN EAT TWO PIECES AT A TIME

570
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:41,426
How can it be this tender?

571
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,996
The meat's soft, and I love how it smells.

572
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,200
I'm trying this next.

573
00:22:58,777 --> 00:22:59,644
MMM

574
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:03,281
The dumplings are amazing.

575
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,853
WHY DID I ONLY JUST FIND OUT
ABOUT THIS PLACE?

576
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:08,854
This feels great.

577
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,455
Everything's so good.

578
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,324
Does anyone mix rice into this soup?

579
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:15,127
They didn't have rice
when I used to eat here.

580
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:16,762
You couldn't order any.

581
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:18,897
This is all that they had.

582
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,298
Just the tsukemen.

583
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:22,067
-They didn't have any sides?
-No.

584
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:25,003
But the dumplings are delicious.

585
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:29,307
TURNS OUT THEY MAKE MEAN DUMPLINGS TOO

586
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,711
How were you able to receive a gold card?

587
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:37,716
We posted a lot on social media
about how delicious the food here was.

588
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,218
UKISS KEPT GIVING THE PLACE A SHOUTOUT
WHILE WORKING IN JAPAN

589
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:42,320
We even came here for livestreams.

590
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,392
The restaurant gave each member a card
as a gift.

591
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,761
We came to eat here the very next day.

592
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,130
They must've been delighted.

593
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:53,665
We wanted to see if it actually worked.

594
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,034
Of course. They made you a card

595
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:58,470
in a shade of gold, of all things.

596
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,641
We always came here to eat
after wrapping up an exhausting gig.

597
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,544
-And you always ordered this dish.
-Right.

598
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,881
The owner must've been pleased.

599
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:10,816
NO WONDER THEY COLLABORATED WITH UKISS

600
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:15,086
EATING THE BOILED EGG IN A SINGLE MOUTHFUL

601
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:18,957
The egg's no joke.

602
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:20,358
-That's the highlight of the dish.
-Right.

603
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:23,361
Do-yeon, hasn't your soup gotten cold?

604
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:27,032
I'd like it to be hotter.

605
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:28,099
-Hotter?
-Yes.

606
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:31,436
Do they heat it up for us?

607
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:32,571
Not exactly.

608
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,177
THE OWNER COMES BY AGAIN WITH A SMILE

609
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:42,247
Please place your spoon here.

610
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,482
Put it here.

611
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:45,617
LIKE THIS?

612
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:50,322
SHE NEVER EXPECTED A HOT STONE

613
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:51,389
What the heck?

614
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,290
Like this.

615
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:54,759
PLACE THE HOT STONE IN THE SOUP
AND COVER IT WITH THE SPOON

616
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,861
Then…

617
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,966
I'll stop in about 30 seconds.

618
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:03,568
That's so clever!

619
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:06,004
THE SOUP STARTS TO BOIL
AS SOON AS THE STONE GOES IN

620
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:08,240
No way.

621
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,308
I was shocked when I first saw this.

622
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:11,610
This is adorable.

623
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,178
How did they even think of this?

624
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:17,449
Do you take the stone out
after 30 seconds?

625
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,818
-No, eat the soup as is.
-With the stone in it?

626
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:25,090
-It's as hot as before.
-I almost burned my tongue.

627
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,591
This is nice.

628
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,194
It's like a stew that we boil as we eat.

629
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,000
-This reminds me of something.
-Sure.

630
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:37,168
It's about this stone.

631
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:39,804
I met up with some friends one day

632
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,741
and drank more than I normally do.

633
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:44,609
I ended up getting wasted.

634
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,645
Then I suddenly got a craving for this,

635
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:50,482
so I rushed over here and had a bowl
before they closed.

636
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,616
-On your own?
-Yes.

637
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:52,984
-I went home just fine.
-Sure.

638
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,487
I washed up and went to bed,

639
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,855
but in the morning,

640
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:58,023
I could still smell the ramen.

641
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,558
Right.

642
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:00,892
I was so drunk

643
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:03,995
that I left with the stone
in my jacket pocket.

644
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,064
OH MY GOODNESS…

645
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:08,600
The very next day, I came by and…

646
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,602
-Did you return it?
-I deeply apologized.

647
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,504
I hope they didn't take away
your gold card.

648
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,273
They were like,
"Hey, you're here. Have a bowl."

649
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,576
-They're so nice.
-"You're going to eat, right?"

650
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:20,011
That reminds me of friends

651
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,714
who get drunk
and sneak some of the beer snacks

652
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:24,683
from karaoke rooms into their pockets.

653
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,352
Are you a fan of noodles, Do-yeon?

654
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,289
I only wrote down what I liked
without considering you.

655
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:32,624
Don't apologize. I love noodles.

656
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,359
Really? That's a relief.

657
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:38,163
Ironically, when we moved on
to the third season,

658
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:41,499
we decided to try something new
on all our trips from now on.

659
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:43,635
-Doing something new on trips?
-It's like this.

660
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,503
Doing what you wouldn't normally do.

661
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,472
This is a trip,
and that's what trips are about.

662
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:49,107
We'll just take on the challenge head-on.

663
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:51,042
We might actually enjoy ourselves.

664
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,243
You never know.

665
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,511
HE'S NERVOUS FOR SOME REASON…

666
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:54,846
Have you ever tried kart riding before?

667
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,350
I did once
after getting my driver's license.

668
00:26:58,416 --> 00:26:59,417
Dressed as Super Mario?

669
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:02,020
-No, in my own clothes.
-I see.

670
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:03,088
I vowed never to…

671
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,257
How did it feel
to have everyone's attention?

672
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:08,259
It's like a spotlight
is following you around.

673
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,061
Everyone looks at you.

674
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:12,464
KART RIDING ON CITY STREETS
WASN'T EASY FOR AN INTROVERT

675
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,000
Everyone looked at me,
from kids to older men,

676
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:16,901
no matter where they were from.

677
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,038
Could we rewrite that part of your memory

678
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:23,074
right here on this show?

679
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:25,510
Will you be okay with it?

680
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,278
Me? I hate the idea.

681
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,048
Don't be ridiculous.

682
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,317
Will there be a lot of people in Shibuya?

683
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:34,285
The streets will be packed.

684
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:35,487
That part of Japan?

685
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:38,757
You'll find people from all around
the world there, Koreans included.

686
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:42,027
Food shouldn't go to waste,
so can I have more of the dumplings?

687
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:43,228
Would you like one?

688
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:44,796
-I'll have one of them.
-Sure.

689
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:46,865
Don't force yourself.

690
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:50,769
Isn't it good?

691
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:56,708
It's so good.

692
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:58,076
THE DUMPLINGS ARE TASTY IN EVERY BITE

693
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:01,813
THEY EMPTIED ALL THEIR PLATES AND BOWLS

694
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,714
Let's go.

695
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:04,182
WE'RE DONE, SO LET'S GO

696
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:05,984
-I enjoyed the meal.
-Same here.

697
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,454
AFTER EATING THE TSUKEMEN FROM HIS PAST,
THEY HEAD OFF TO GO-KART RIDING

698
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,189
A 25-MINUTE DRIVE TO MONSTER KART

699
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,529
FAILS TO HOLD BACK HER LAUGH

700
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:18,863
I'm terrible at these things.

701
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:20,932
HAHA

702
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,168
I'm not good at this.

703
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:24,969
I'll look outside.

704
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,304
-Do-yeon.
-Yes?

705
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,539
Turn this way.

706
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:29,207
-Look at me.
-Oh no.

707
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:32,911
I know the camera is on me, so I can't.

708
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:34,179
PEEKING

709
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,516
I'll try to look as natural as possible.

710
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:39,951
-Is that yours?
-Yes.

711
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:42,087
-It's pretty.
-It was a gift from a fan.

712
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:43,421
-Can I take a look?
-Sure.

713
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:46,925
It's so cute.

714
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:49,594
I brought a camera
that isn't likely to let me down.

715
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,097
What do you usually take photos of?

716
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:54,199
People, nature,

717
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:55,867
-scenery, or buildings.
-I guess

718
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,969
I take photos of all of them.

719
00:28:58,036 --> 00:28:58,903
-All of them?
-Yes.

720
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:00,672
All of them.

721
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:02,540
Why did you look away?

722
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:04,442
I'm really bad at taking photos.

723
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:08,046
I get so embarrassed
in front of the camera.

724
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,648
I loved how you looked just now.

725
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:12,717
Really? Okay, I'll try to feel
less awkward about it.

726
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:15,620
For a second, I felt my toes tense up.

727
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:18,022
We all have something that…

728
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,525
(ADJUSTING THE AC)

729
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,559
You must be cold.

730
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:24,362
Not really.
I just like rubbing my arms like this.

731
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,931
HAVING HER HANDS IN HER SLEEVES
CAN BE MISLEADING

732
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:29,400
-Looks like I went overboard.
-Hardly.

733
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:31,369
I just love myself too much.

734
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,505
I rub my own skin
as a way of showing myself some love.

735
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,674
The AC is perfect.

736
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:37,642
SHOULD I GIVE IT A TRY?

737
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:39,911
This gives you a sense
of comfort and security.

738
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:41,246
This? Doesn't it?

739
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,816
Is there anything
you wanted to do in Japan?

740
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:46,584
More than that,

741
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:49,554
there's something
I've been wishing for lately.

742
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:54,425
If I ever get some free time
in my schedule,

743
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:57,595
I'd love to travel the world
to enter dance battles.

744
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:01,032
Those competitions aren't held every day.

745
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:03,768
Don't you ever get offended?

746
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,971
-What do you mean?
-During dance battles,

747
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:09,474
some dancers will mock you
right to your face.

748
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:10,775
They don't do that.

749
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:13,344
-Really?
-People have the wrong idea about them.

750
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:15,113
Have I been watching
the wrong kind of battles?

751
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,915
They don't tease you that harshly
in real competitions.

752
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:19,851
Everyone's just there to have fun.

753
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:22,353
I went to one last month.

754
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,788
-Where?
-A battle.

755
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:25,356
I entered a two-on-two dance battle.

756
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:26,825
How is that done as duos?

757
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:30,595
Do you all prepare your dances differently
for each song,

758
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,030
taking the variables into account?

759
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:36,534
No, the DJ will freestyle it
and play a random song.

760
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:38,570
You dance to that.

761
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:39,904
So? How did it go?

762
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:42,707
I teamed up with Giseok
from BANKTWOBROTHERS.

763
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:44,876
-There's a video of us.
-Let's see it!

764
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,644
Here you go.

765
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:50,114
This was in August.

766
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:56,387
You're so cool.

767
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,393
HE'S NOTHING LIKE HIS ACTOR SELF

768
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,229
MOVING LIKE A FRESH FISH

769
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:05,797
No way.

770
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,336
What was that just now?

771
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,839
In these battles,
you don't plan your next moves

772
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:16,674
-and just let them come to you?
-Yes.

773
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:17,775
The moves should flow.

774
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:18,810
FREESTYLING EACH MOVE

775
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,278
You looked like you were in the zone.

776
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:21,246
I'm getting a call.

777
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:23,414
BUSYBE? Isn't he also in BANKTWOBROTHERS?

778
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:25,083
You're pretty much part of their crew.

779
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:26,985
It's like we're joined at the hip.

780
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,520
Go ahead and take it if it's urgent.

781
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:31,155
Hey, brother.

782
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:33,458
ONE, TWO

783
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:36,094
Actually, no. I'm in Japan right now.

784
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,061
IT'S NOT EASY…

785
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:39,497
-Got it.
-Love you.

786
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,132
What was that?

787
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:44,202
You love me? Got it.

788
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:45,637
I love you too.

789
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:48,039
Bye.

790
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:50,108
Hey, hold on.

791
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:53,011
Jang Do-yeon knows who you are.

792
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,245
She knows you guys.

793
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:56,247
Of course I do. They're famous.

794
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,082
You know who she is too?

795
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:59,284
Sure, go back to sleep.

796
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,485
BUSYBE: I KNOW WHO JANG DO-YEON IS

797
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:02,587
You met her while filming
Street Man Fighter?

798
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,055
-That's right.
-Yes, of course.

799
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:06,391
Do-yeon hosted the show.

800
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:07,725
I only had eyes for her.

801
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:08,893
He only had eyes for you.

802
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,197
-I love you.
-"I love you?"

803
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,735
I'll hang up then.

804
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:19,737
Enough with the nonsense.

805
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:20,638
Got it.

806
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:22,507
-Bye.
-Nonsense?

807
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:26,778
You were so tall
that you were all he could see.

808
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:29,113
CUT, CUT, CUT

809
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,615
Boo.

810
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:32,417
-BUSYBE, boo.
-Boo.

811
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:34,485
Of course I seemed tall.
I was next to HAHA.

812
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:38,990
He's not shy about expressing his love.

813
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:39,924
That caught me off guard.

814
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:41,859
He declared his love
when he heard I was filming.

815
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:46,030
Given your physique,

816
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:49,067
you'll look incredible doing the vogue.

817
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:53,371
That style of dancing suits you perfectly.

818
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:55,740
-I'm not kidding, you know.
-Maybe I should learn it.

819
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,141
Remember the poses you used to do?

820
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:59,877
I mean it. They're not funny at all.

821
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:01,045
PHYSIQUE MADE FOR VOGUING

822
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:02,647
-Thanks.
-I mean it.

823
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:03,915
How sweet of you.

824
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,651
In voguing, you strike
the same types of poses.

825
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:08,519
I'd love to learn it.

826
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,389
You picked up the dance
for Jennie's song in no time.

827
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:13,358
-Jennie?
-Jennie?

828
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:14,559
What did you dance to?

829
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:15,760
NO, NOT THAT…

830
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,894
Oh no.

831
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:18,329
Please don't.

832
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:19,697
That was me

833
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,966
just trying to imitate the dance.

834
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,535
That has nothing to do with voguing.

835
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,739
No way. You're actually quite good.

836
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:29,340
-Really?
-You don't have two left feet.

837
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:30,975
-Not at all.
-As if.

838
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,446
HER BODY STILL REMEMBERS
THE RHYTHM FROM WANDO

839
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,949
Look at you,
adding some feeling to the moves.

840
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,517
You're so good.

841
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:42,987
-I saw a lot of potential.
-Really?

842
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:44,889
You should be dancing.

843
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:48,026
-I was surprised by how well you vibed.
-Really?

844
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:49,293
How was I vibing?

845
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,895
The moves had a hip vibe.

846
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:53,831
-Even during the opening today…
-Was I trying too hard?

847
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,299
HIP, HIP

848
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,734
That's something you need.

849
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:57,835
Really? Do you mean that?

850
00:33:58,302 --> 00:33:59,804
JUST A FEW HOURS AGO…

851
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,372
THE VIBE SHE WAS OOZING WITH

852
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,243
-Like this?
-In freestyle hip-hop,

853
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:07,879
-you need that cool vibe.
-A cool vibe?

854
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:10,815
A cool vibe?

855
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:13,117
SHE LOOKS LIKE A TIN MAN IN NEED OF OILING

856
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,353
-Were you swearing just now?
-Of course not.

857
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,888
DON'T GET THE WRONG IDEA
SHE WASN'T SWEARING

858
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:18,456
That wasn't it. Of course not.

859
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:19,724
It sounds like fun.

860
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,392
How about going dancing tomorrow?

861
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:23,127
Me? I'll do it off camera.

862
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:24,328
It's embarrassing.

863
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,197
You should teach her some basic moves.

864
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:27,165
I'm embarrassed.

865
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:28,900
TOMORROW, WHEN THE SUN IS HIGH…

866
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,134
HIT BY DANCE FEVER (?)

867
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:34,439
A STEP ABOVE JENNIE FROM WANDO

868
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,409
DANCING DO-YEON IN TOKYO
COMING SOON…

869
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,112
That will be us in a moment.

870
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,113
What do you mean?

871
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:46,083
Oh, no!

872
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,718
-That…
-Is that what I have to drive?

873
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:50,755
-My gosh.
-I'm seeing Minions here.

874
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:52,857
Thank you.

875
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,459
GO-KART EXPERIENCE
MONSTER KART

876
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:55,660
-Hello.
-Hi.

877
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,630
-I'm Kana.
-Hi, Ms. Kana.

878
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:01,566
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

879
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:02,934
Nice to meet you.

880
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:07,805
THE KARTS DO-YEON AND JUN-YOUNG
WILL DRIVE TODAY

881
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,708
RACING ACROSS THE CITY OF TOKYO

882
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,776
EXPERIENCING THE EXHILARATION

883
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:15,279
A KEY ACTIVITY TO ENJOY IN TOKYO

884
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:17,615
TOKYO GO-KARTING

885
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:20,685
-Should I explain in Japanese or English?
-Japanese, please.

886
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:21,586
-Japanese?
-Yes.

887
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:24,322
-Got it.
-Do-yeon, would English be better?

888
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:25,523
I can't understand either language,

889
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,625
so you should understand it yourself
in Japanese.

890
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:29,894
If you explain it in Japanese,
I'll translate.

891
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,829
-Sure thing.
-Thanks.

892
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:34,365
This is the accelerator,

893
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:36,501
-and this is the brake.
-The brake.

894
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:40,271
Pressing both at once
will make the kart stop,

895
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:41,539
so please don't do that.

896
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:45,810
The kart will stop if you press
both together, so don't do that.

897
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:48,112
-Press one at a time.
-One at a time, okay.

898
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,413
Speed up

899
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,615
and speed down.

900
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:51,816
Got it.

901
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:54,051
The right, the left.

902
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:56,154
Noted.

903
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,356
That'll be all. Do you have any questions?

904
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:00,124
-We're good.
-Good.

905
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:01,259
-Any questions?
-No.

906
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,393
-No questions.
-Got it.

907
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,695
You can take the yellow kart.

908
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,831
The pink one's for you.

909
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:14,672
IMMEDIATELY GETTING IN THE KART

910
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,641
This is the accelerator.

911
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:18,109
To the right. To the left.

912
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,010
REVIEWING WHAT SHE LEARNED

913
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,045
NERVOUS

914
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:22,413
Is "tanoshii" the word for fun?

915
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,549
-I'm having fun.
-I'm having fun.

916
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:26,117
I'm having fun right now.

917
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:33,124
I'm even more nervous than I was
for my driver's exam.

918
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,226
Seriously. I'm not kidding.

919
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:38,930
This is something we'll never forget.

920
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,731
With you, of all people.

921
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:43,134
We'll be racing across Tokyo.

922
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,902
PHEW…

923
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,805
Yes.

924
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,807
-Let's have fun.
-Yes, have fun with this.

925
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:50,775
-Yay!
-Yay!

926
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:52,977
(REVVING)

927
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:53,878
WHOA

928
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,380
OFF TO A ROARING START!

929
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:00,017
I'M SCARED

930
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:01,419
See you later.

931
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:02,553
SEE YOU LATER

932
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:04,722
I can't believe this.

933
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:10,595
HE SEEMS SKILLED AND RELAXED
WHILE SHE SEEMS NERVOUS

934
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:15,299
THE BUMPY RIDE STILL HAS HER
A LITTLE SCARED

935
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:19,637
Goodness. No way.

936
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:21,172
The breeze is cool against my face.

937
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:25,509
-Two lines, please.
-We're coming to a stop.

938
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,711
Here's where I should wait.

939
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:27,912
SWOOSH

940
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:29,413
Do-yeon, nice.

941
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,449
SHE'S BETTER AT THIS THAN EXPECTED

942
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:32,383
Okay.

943
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:34,518
Do-yeon.

944
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,354
I didn't expect you to be
so passionate about this.

945
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,789
-I'm not.
-Okay, back to one line, please.

946
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:39,824
One line, okay.

947
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,492
-Oh no. I'll go first.
-Sure thing.

948
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,728
SWITCHING LANES WITH EASE

949
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:47,565
(SHE'S NOT NERVOUS ANYMORE)

950
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:49,800
Nice.

951
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:51,769
I'm having fun.

952
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,972
This is fun.

953
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:57,975
I like the cool air.

954
00:37:58,042 --> 00:37:59,677
RACING THROUGH THE HEART OF TOKYO

955
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:02,613
I'm starting to get used to it.

956
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,148
It's a lot of fun.

957
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:08,486
SPREADING WIDE

958
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:10,588
SPREADING WIDE

959
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:11,922
SQUINTING

960
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,624
LICKING

961
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:16,627
-Are you good?
-I'm doing fine.

962
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:18,162
-This is fun.
-Are you having fun?

963
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:19,563
-This is a blast.
-Are you good?

964
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,365
-I'm good.
-Okay.

965
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:26,837
Do-yeon, you seemed like
you were getting ready for a race.

966
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,773
From behind,

967
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,474
I saw you doing this.

968
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:31,976
JUN-YOUNG SAW DO-YEON BE ROUGH AND TOUGH

969
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,678
The sleeves were getting in the way.

970
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:36,514
Guys, over here.

971
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,915
Say cheese.

972
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:39,750
Cheese.

973
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,018
This is so much fun.

974
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:45,089
-Good job.
-Thank you so much.

975
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,692
We're seeing more and more people now.

976
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:50,461
I hope it gets dark soon.

977
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,334
I feel like I'm locking eyes
with Jung Ho-yeon.

978
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,501
HAHA

979
00:38:58,135 --> 00:38:59,870
It's like she's saying,
"Having fun, are you?"

980
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:02,006
-Do you drive yourself around?
-Sure.

981
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:06,477
Yes, but I bet this will be
the first and the last time

982
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,214
I do this kind of driving.

983
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,149
-All right, off we go!
-Okay.

984
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:13,417
Same here.

985
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,756
THEY'RE OFF AGAIN TO EXPLORE TOKYO!

986
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:23,260
THEY SEE MORE PEOPLE AS THEY HEAD DOWNTOWN

987
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:24,295
All these people…

988
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,199
We're beginning to see that

989
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:30,368
there are more and more people
on the street.

990
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:35,339
THE INTROVERTS BEGIN TO FEEL THE HEAT

991
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:38,943
EMBARRASSED

992
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,012
THE PEOPLE WARMLY WELCOME THE INTROVERTS

993
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:44,715
TOUCHED BY THEIR ATTENTION

994
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:47,218
This is driving me nuts.

995
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:49,053
We kept turning left.

996
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,289
INTENSE EYE CONTACT

997
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,158
THE STREETS ARE DANGEROUS FOR INTROVERTS

998
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,427
GASP!

999
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,397
IS HE FILMING JUN-YOUNG ON HIS CAMERA?

1000
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:01,065
Someone took a photo of me.

1001
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:07,037
AGAIN, THEY GAIN ALL THE ATTENTION

1002
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:09,407
AWKWARD

1003
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:11,642
Right. Happy New Year.

1004
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:13,511
A BELATED NEW YEAR'S GREETING

1005
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,046
Hasn't it been ten months
since the year started?

1006
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:17,848
I guess a new year
just keeps coming around.

1007
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,184
I wonder what Koreans will think

1008
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,521
when they see us on the street like this.

1009
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,389
We're here on vacation and…

1010
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:27,892
And we're riding karts.

1011
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:31,095
-We'll speed up from here.
-Got it.

1012
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,129
Make sure to keep up.

1013
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:34,565
We're going to speed up from here,

1014
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:36,600
-so keep up.
-Got it.

1015
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,436
I should focus.

1016
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:39,937
ROLLING UP THEIR SLEEVES,
GETTING READY TO SPEED UP

1017
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:43,140
HER TONGUE STICKS OUT
ONCE THEY'RE GOING FASTER

1018
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:46,110
CHUCKLING MANIACALLY

1019
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:49,847
THEY'RE DEFINITELY GOING FASTER
THAN BEFORE

1020
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:51,882
STICKING TONGUE OUT

1021
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,652
(A MASTER AT OPERATING THE KART)

1022
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:01,192
Here we go.

1023
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:03,093
Okay.

1024
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,568
Hurrah!

1025
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,770
THEY ENTER THE TUNNEL AT HIGH SPEED

1026
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,107
Check out this clear view.

1027
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:22,947
We're now in Shinjuku.

1028
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:25,850
SHINJUKU
THE LARGEST OF TOKYO'S 3 MAJOR CITY HUBS

1029
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,752
I'm seeing Shinjuku in a different light.

1030
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:29,887
BUSTLING WITH PEOPLE

1031
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:31,188
Do-yeon, earlier,

1032
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:34,558
some Koreans walking by
called out our names

1033
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,227
really loudly.

1034
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:38,529
"Hey, it's Jang Do-yeon
and Lee Jun-young!"

1035
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:41,065
-I was startled.
-No way.

1036
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:42,700
-I probably heard wrong.
-You were hearing things.

1037
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:45,436
Do you know the movie Hollow Man?

1038
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:48,138
The lead turns invisible
after taking a serum.

1039
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:50,808
That's how we are right now. Don't worry.

1040
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:53,944
THOUGH EMBARRASSED,
THEY'RE GREETED BY AN INCREDIBLE VIEW

1041
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:02,853
PASSING SHINJUKU, GLOWING WITH NEON LIGHTS

1042
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:10,461
NEXT, THEY ARRIVE IN SHIBUYA,
THE BUSIEST AREA OF TOKYO

1043
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,333
IT FEELS ODD TO SEE THEM IN KARTS TOO

1044
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:21,105
HAHA

1045
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:23,507
Hey, they're our friends.

1046
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:29,079
They're our friends.

1047
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:31,081
ENCOUNTERING SOME FRIENDS
IN THE HEART OF TOKYO

1048
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:32,149
This is fun.

1049
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:35,853
Riding around the area I used to live?

1050
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,354
It's highly embarrassing.

1051
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:38,856
I think I'm doomed.

1052
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:41,492
Do people recognize you?

1053
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:42,960
Earlier,

1054
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:45,729
there were some Koreans

1055
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:48,632
who said both our names clearly.

1056
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:51,869
This is fun.

1057
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:54,838
I appreciate
all these different experiences.

1058
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:55,739
A DAY SPENT AS AN EXTROVERT

1059
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,409
(WHERE AM I?)
(WHO AM I?)

1060
00:42:58,475 --> 00:42:59,510
What do I do?

1061
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:01,345
(THEY'RE QUITE CLOSE… HEHE)

1062
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:04,815
This is my first time
seeing people walking around Shibuya

1063
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:06,283
from this height before.

1064
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,751
It's wild.

1065
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:11,388
We've been
in lots of people's photos already.

1066
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:14,058
HAHA

1067
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:16,360
As least someone's happy.

1068
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:21,966
THEY WRAP UP GO-KARTING AROUND TOKYO

1069
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:25,736
THEIR STEPS FEEL LIGHTER
NOW THAT THEY'VE LOOKED AROUND THE CITY

1070
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,077
(HI)

1071
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,578
HI

1072
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:35,679
HI

1073
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:38,182
There's always someone taking photos of us
whenever we stop.

1074
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:42,386
NOW THAT IT'S COMING TO AN END,
THE INTROVERTS TRULY ENJOY IT

1075
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:45,489
THEY'RE SAD NOW THAT IT'S OVER

1076
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:50,894
INTROVERTS WRAP UP THEIR GO-KARTING

1077
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:53,364
HAHA

1078
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:56,133
I feel like I was in an F1 race.

1079
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:57,735
Thank you.

1080
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,703
-Did you have fun?
-Thank you.

1081
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:02,272
We absolutely did. Thank you so much.

1082
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:03,173
Thank you.

1083
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,575
THE FUN GO-KART RIDE IS NOW OVER

1084
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:07,811
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

1085
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:15,786
WHAT WILL THEY DO NEXT ON THEIR TRIP?

1086
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:17,621
My stubble grew back
faster than ever today.

1087
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:20,457
You should go-kart
whenever you want to grow a beard.

1088
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:21,625
What will we have to eat?

1089
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:24,528
We're having monjayaki,
one of Tokyo's most famous dishes.

1090
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:26,363
May I take the lead on this one?

1091
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:28,832
Excuse me.
Could we start with some draft beer?

1092
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:30,668
I LOVE IT, HAHA

1093
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:31,802
-Sure.
-Nice!

1094
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:33,370
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1095
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:34,638
A REFRESHING GLASS OF BEER!

1096
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:37,141
Damn, that's so good.

1097
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:38,142
No way.

1098
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:41,378
Hold on. I'm going to look around.

1099
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:42,746
I'd love to win that.

1100
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:44,048
Please let it be a watermelon.

1101
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:46,283
I'm taking them all.

1102
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,217
Let me try again.

1103
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:48,285
I should try that one.

1104
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:49,887
This one's way better.

1105
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:51,221
Do-yeon, please sit back down.

1106
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:53,590
-Could I try this one?
-Get back here!

1107
00:44:53,657 --> 00:44:55,225
What the hell is this?

1108
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:56,493
THE RESTAURANT'S SPECIAL

1109
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,628
HOW DOES THE MONJAYAKI TASTE WHEN
IT'S BEEN COOKED WITH HELP FROM FRIENDS?

1110
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,530
This is hilarious. Are you kidding me?

1111
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:00,798
Will it be just us?

1112
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:01,799
NEXT, THEY TAKE STICKER PICTURES

1113
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:04,702
WE ACTUALLY MAKE A CUTE COUPLE

1114
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:05,836
HOW DID THEY TURN OUT?

1115
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,272
Promise not to throw these away.

1116
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:09,506
Why would I?

1117
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:12,443
-My old neighborhood.
-We're off to Kamiyamacho.

1118
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:14,578
A lot of new shops opened up.

1119
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:16,280
I don't remember this or this.

1120
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:18,015
-Can you see it?
-I do from here.

1121
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:18,916
WHAT MEMORIES DOES THIS PLACE HOLD
FOR JUN-YOUNG?

1122
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:21,485
Over there. Do you see that tall building?

1123
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:22,519
One, two, three.

1124
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:24,221
EXCITING AND HEARTWARMING CHEMISTRY
OF A 12-YEAR AGE-GAP DUO

1125
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:26,290
