1
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,872
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

2
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:10,443
WHERE ARE WE…?

3
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,947
Hello. Bound for a breezy break…

4
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:18,785
Hello. Bound for a breezy break
with bundles of stories in my bag.

5
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,553
I'm Jang Do-yeon.

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,789
You wouldn't guess it at first glance,

7
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,091
but it's currently a little over 5 a.m.

8
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:27,160
And not that you'd be wondering,

9
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:29,229
but I left home at 3:20 a.m.

10
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:31,364
Then I put on my face

11
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:33,233
and headed back home.

12
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:34,367
Why, you ask?

13
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,603
That's because today's travel buddy

14
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:38,772
happens to be my neighbor.

15
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:40,607
Do-yeon.

16
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:41,941
WHO ON EARTH COULD IT BE?

17
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:43,877
I'm finally headed to this person's house.

18
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,079
I only need a single word

19
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,847
to give you a clue about them.

20
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:49,783
Queen.

21
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:54,421
She's the sexy queen
this era has been waiting for.

22
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:57,223
That's odd.

23
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,360
I'm only just getting to her place,
but I already feel drained.

24
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,329
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK

25
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:05,265
Yes?

26
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,600
EVEN HER VOICE MAKES DO-YEON LAUGH

27
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:08,668
Do-yeon?

28
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,671
GABEE
DO-YEON'S NEIGHBOR

29
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,872
Oh, you're glowing!

30
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:15,241
THE BREAKOUT STAR
OF THE VARIETY ENTERTAINMENT SCENE

31
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:16,876
AND GLOBAL DANCER

32
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:18,478
What should we do with you?

33
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,413
-I came because I missed you.
-Oh my.

34
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,783
When you were on Radio Star,
you mentioned how you'd texted me.

35
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,519
A lot of people enjoyed that story.

36
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,556
You asked if we could go
to the sauna and pool together.

37
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:30,657
I'm crazy for saunas.

38
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:33,326
GABEE'S WISH IS TO GO
TO A SAUNA WITH DO-YEON

39
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:34,928
GULP

40
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:36,930
You're not trying to bring me down,
are you?

41
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,199
Is it okay if I wear a mask?

42
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,366
GABEE MADE DO-YEON SHY

43
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,802
I won't come on too strong.

44
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,405
WILL THE HOT AND COLD PAIR
MAKE IT TO A SAUNA OKAY?

45
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:48,875
FIRST REUNION AFTER SALON DRIP 2

46
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,910
-Please come in.
-May I?

47
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:51,811
RUNNING BAREFOOT

48
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:53,046
Then excuse me.

49
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:56,616
You're actually here in my home.
I can't believe it.

50
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,252
Your place is so colorful.

51
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,720
COLORFUL HOME TAKES AFTER GABEE

52
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,422
This is… You have so much stuff.

53
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:03,590
Hold up.

54
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,758
Do you have a show somewhere?

55
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:07,160
AREN'T WE GOING ON A TRIP?

56
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,395
My shoes for today. They're brand new.

57
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,231
Where do you even buy shoes like these?

58
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,899
I buy them abroad.

59
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,002
I feel so underdressed beside you.

60
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,905
I'm devoid of all color.

61
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,641
-I have no color.
-I can't wait. This'll be fun.

62
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,010
You've traveled with other people, right?

63
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,012
I have. You're my fourth guest.

64
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,247
-I am?
-Yes.

65
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,915
Are the trips always a single night?

66
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,950
Isn't the blood going to your head?

67
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:35,688
Wow, you look great.

68
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:41,628
IT'S TOO EARLY FOR THIS ENERGY

69
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:44,030
-And one last check.
-You always do this?

70
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,835
-It suits you.
-It does, right?

71
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:49,869
THE AURA OF A QUEEN

72
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,238
PUMP IT!
(RUN AWAY)

73
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,307
Have some water, Do-yeon.

74
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:55,508
Great, thanks.

75
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:56,743
Would you like some water?

76
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:57,744
SUDDEN CHANGE OF MOOD

77
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,280
Have you eaten? Fancy a banana?

78
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,950
Wait, so you walk around the house
in heels like that?

79
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,319
Banana, anyone?

80
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:07,787
A banana for you, Do-yeon?

81
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:08,755
I'm good.

82
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,690
It's a perfectly ripe banana.

83
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:11,891
Then may I take one?

84
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,226
-Of course you may.
-Okay, then.

85
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,895
It's weird. I could have sworn
I was so full earlier.

86
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,030
GOT A BANANA FOR LATER

87
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,097
I have to ask.

88
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,733
Are you heading somewhere after our trip?

89
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,336
I thought it was just a one-night trip.

90
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,838
What do you mean?
I only packed for one night.

91
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:26,906
With this thing,

92
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:30,043
you'd think this was Jung Saem Mool's bag.

93
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,377
Jung Saem Mool's bag?

94
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:33,580
A lot of makeup artists actually use this.

95
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:35,381
Yeah, they take it on trips.

96
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,217
-Shall I do your makeup?
-Mine?

97
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:38,751
Sure.

98
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:43,990
Is it just me,
or have they gotten even whiter?

99
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,192
Have they really? That's not good.

100
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,495
I think it just feels that way
because I haven't seen you in a while.

101
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,265
It feels like we're in Beverly Hills
or something.

102
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,368
I could have sworn we were in Ichon-dong.

103
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:58,404
Deary me.

104
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,173
STARING

105
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,242
I'm so excited. I can't wait.

106
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,043
Thanks for being so excited.

107
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:07,213
-Thank you.
-I'm not your luggage manager, am I?

108
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,816
No, you're not. You're my friend.

109
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,551
You're not my manager.

110
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,186
Thank you.

111
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,189
I'm no color. I have no color.

112
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,726
Why do we look so different?

113
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,428
I look like an elementary school kid
who's had a growth spurt.

114
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,397
PRETTY DIFFERENT LOOKS

115
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:25,465
I'm so hyped!

116
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:26,666
Let's go.

117
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:29,969
-Driving manager?
-She's really doing that?

118
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,938
Driving manager!

119
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:35,208
(BACKING OFF)

120
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,444
It's so much fun flustering Do-yeon.
What should we do?

121
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,546
I don't think I can stop myself.

122
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,950
-The driving manager is actually here.
-Driving manager!

123
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,285
(RUN AWAY)

124
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,353
Where are you, driving manager?

125
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,755
Oh, there he is!

126
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:50,723
It's like magic.

127
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,959
SHARING A RIDE WITH THE QUEEN
TO THE AIRPORT

128
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,594
You running away is priceless.

129
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,796
Wow, the lights are great.

130
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,332
I feel exhausted.

131
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:04,470
-I really enjoyed watching Salon Drip.
-You did?

132
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:07,407
I really do like you,
and I think that came across.

133
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,374
You were adorable.

134
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,043
I was gushing over you.

135
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:11,377
THAT'S HOW MUCH I LIKE YOU

136
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:13,980
Wait, so am I your first female guest?

137
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,581
Yes, you are.

138
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,986
Not only are you the first woman,

139
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,988
but you're also very different
in temperament.

140
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,257
FIRST EXTRA-EXTROVERTED GUEST

141
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,593
On the show, you mentioned
wanting to go to the sauna together.

142
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,196
Since you agreed to travel with me,

143
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:33,099
we'll be going on a trip
that's tailored just to you.

144
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,901
In Taiwan, there's a hot springs town.

145
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,936
TODAY'S DESTINATION

146
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,639
TAIWAN

147
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:43,910
TAIWAN, HOME TO GABEE'S FAVORITE THING:
HOT SPRINGS

148
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,613
WHAT ADVENTURES LIE AHEAD OF THEM?

149
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:56,589
EPISODE 9:
BETWEEN HOT AND COLD

150
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:59,826
We'll come back with prunes for fingers.

151
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:01,294
-I'm so hyped.
-You should be.

152
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:06,132
My go-to sauna ritual is to warm myself up
for about five minutes inside.

153
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,167
Seven or eight minutes works too.

154
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,436
Then I jump straight into cold water.

155
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:11,904
You like that?

156
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,107
It's my favorite thing in the world.

157
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:17,377
They say it gives you
a heavenly dopamine rush.

158
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:20,613
When I was really stressed,
that's how I relieved all my stress.

159
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,783
Are there also health benefits?

160
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,351
I think I heard

161
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:26,919
there were?

162
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:30,990
Fact-check manager?

163
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,258
Fact-check manager?

164
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,527
A COLD PLUNGE AFTER THE SAUNA
STIMULATES CIRCULATION

165
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,829
AND BOOSTS METABOLISM,
BENEFITING OVERALL HEALTH

166
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,766
And from this trip on,
we've got a new rule.

167
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,835
We have a daily conversation cap.

168
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:46,572
NEW RULE MADE IN THE FIRST 30 MINUTES

169
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,841
All right, let's hear it, then.

170
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,644
How high is the cap?
Let's see if it's enough for me.

171
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:55,181
I have this thing where I break out
in hives if I keep my mouth shut.

172
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,183
That's why we're going to the hot springs.

173
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,620
So you can take a plunge
if you have a reaction.

174
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,021
Let's say

175
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:05,091
you're at a sauna, and there's a fire.

176
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,459
Where would we cover?

177
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,895
-Let's cover our faces.
-Yes, we should.

178
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:11,998
They wouldn't know it's me
just by seeing my body.

179
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,767
In my case, I'm so obviously me,
even if I cover my face.

180
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:15,668
That's true.

181
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,004
My body's very outspoken.

182
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,306
But only you can rock your body.

183
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,507
My body practically screams

184
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,042
that I'm Gabee.

185
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,578
I'm Gabee. Hey!

186
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:28,114
I'm Gabee. Oh my God!

187
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,618
Can we take a picture?
One sec. I forgot I wanted to.

188
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,791
Do you always take pictures
on your way to the airport?

189
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,561
Not really, but I'm with you,
so this is special.

190
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,296
Thank you.

191
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:44,530
YOU GET ME?

192
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,799
-I'll send it to you.
-I'm gonna eat the banana now.

193
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,935
Yes, please do.
It should be nice and ripe.

194
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:51,938
It's even clearer in this picture.

195
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:53,473
That you're a beauty.

196
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:54,540
Hey, don't say that.

197
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,509
You get that a lot, don't you?

198
00:07:56,576 --> 00:08:00,413
That you look
so much more beautiful in person.

199
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:02,415
A little bit.

200
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,950
You have a different aura.

201
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:06,919
You're so tall, like a supermodel.

202
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,556
I wonder what the camera crew is doing,

203
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:14,260
for everyone who sees me
to say I look better in person?

204
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,629
We should blame the cameras.

205
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,297
What are they even doing?

206
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,266
My apologies.

207
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:24,103
Leejung was on Salon Drip too, right?

208
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,273
-She was.
-She told me she had fun talking to you.

209
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,308
She said you often go over
to each other's houses.

210
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,377
All the time.
Leejung and I are really close.

211
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,212
I heard that she lives close.

212
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:34,747
Yes, she does.

213
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:39,452
We live close, so we meet up pretty often.

214
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,054
So you squeeze in time to meet
despite your busy schedules?

215
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:42,955
Yes.

216
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,557
I think it's really important.

217
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,225
-Hanging out with friends.
-Yes.

218
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:49,195
Meeting people in the same line of work

219
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:54,033
lets you share your professional concerns.
I think that's really valuable.

220
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,168
Nowadays,

221
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,806
I've been thinking a lot about the phrase,
"Right time, right place."

222
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:02,375
That's right.

223
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:04,744
There's a time for everything,

224
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,313
and a lot of things
are beyond our control.

225
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,482
Wait, what? Are you possessed?

226
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,386
Those kinds of thoughts.
We talk about stuff like that.

227
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:16,422
"Right time, right place"?
Yeah, there are people you meet like that.

228
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,658
ARRIVED AT INCHEON AIRPORT!

229
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,860
-Off we go.
-Let's go.

230
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,629
Looking at you,
I don't feel like I'm in Seoul.

231
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:24,931
Wait, we're in Incheon.

232
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,902
What city do I remind you of?

233
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,039
Ichon-dong.

234
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:34,640
NON-STOP LAUGHTER WITH THE ICHON GALS

235
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,976
A TWO-AND-A-HALF-HOUR FLIGHT TO TAIWAN

236
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,978
(WEATHER'S GRIM)

237
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:42,582
TAOYUAN AIRPORT

238
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,650
Jang Do-yeon.

239
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:49,388
MADE IT THROUGH FIRST,
WAITING FOR DO-YEON AT THE GATE

240
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:50,523
JANG DO-YEON

241
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,358
(WHEN'S SHE COMING?)

242
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,460
THRILLED AT THE THOUGHT
OF MESSING WITH DO-YEON

243
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,930
(FOUND HER)

244
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:00,533
JANG DO-YEON

245
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,268
Hello.

246
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:03,569
(LOOKING AWAY)

247
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,038
Wait, I'm here!

248
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,441
Do-yeon, I'm here!

249
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:10,576
What took you so long?

250
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:13,045
How was your trip over here, Do-yeon?

251
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,046
Was it okay? Yes?

252
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,617
I'll be your tour guide for the day.

253
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:20,386
It's good to meet you.
It's raining a lot today. Very humid.

254
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,989
-Are you okay?
-Are you possessed again?

255
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,425
How many times does that happen in a day?

256
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,127
You're hilarious.

257
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,029
It's raining outside. Will you be okay?

258
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,031
-It's pouring.
-It is.

259
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,566
I think, in terms of weather,

260
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,967
we're screwed.

261
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,503
-Today's weather…
-The weather's grim.

262
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,005
But our trip won't be.

263
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:40,840
The weather's awful,

264
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:44,076
but my energy's still up.
What are you gonna do about it?

265
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,413
Do you think I'll be stuck
inside my hotel the whole time?

266
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:53,252
-Do you need to change your shoes?
-I already did. And I have a raincoat.

267
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,820
They're so glamorous.

268
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,722
GLAMOROUS BUT COMFY SHOES ON

269
00:10:56,789 --> 00:11:01,527
Let's go. Rainy Taiwan.

270
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,130
(CHECKING HERSELF OUT)

271
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:06,165
-Do you feel energized from your nap?
-Yes.

272
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,167
Totally refreshed.

273
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,903
You slept like Sleeping Beauty. Like this.

274
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,473
-Sleeping well is such a blessing.
-I do sleep really well.

275
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,476
-You didn't wake up?
-I didn't wake up at all.

276
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:20,479
-I woke up once when I smelled food.
-Just after we took off?

277
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:23,282
-But I forced myself to sleep again.
-That was a good choice.

278
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,884
In case you might be hungry,

279
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,085
I brought some snacks.

280
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,087
-A little bit of snacks.
-Oh my God.

281
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:28,988
Thank you!

282
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,790
Taiwanese pudding.

283
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:31,957
I think it's famous.

284
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,427
-Bubble tea.
-Oh, bubble tea?

285
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,195
Thank you.

286
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,098
It's delicious.

287
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,000
-It's yummy!
-It is? That's good.

288
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,368
It's so good.

289
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,837
People drink a lot of this in Taiwan.

290
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,406
-I see why people love bubble tea.
-Right?

291
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:50,042
Even though it's a little wet,

292
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:51,343
it's very atmospheric.

293
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,579
Saunas on rainy days are really charming.

294
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,414
Getting into water when it's raining?

295
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,315
Of course.

296
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,085
So you're gonna rain?
Then I'll just jump in the water.

297
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:00,519
SUDDENLY TAKING ON THE WEATHER

298
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,254
I'm just going to dive right in.

299
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:05,591
Queen Gabee, do you always feel like
someone's picking a fight with you?

300
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,927
What, you think I'll lose?
I'm gonna go out.

301
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,829
GETTING MORE AND MORE EXHAUSTED WITH TIME

302
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:11,731
You're a warrior.

303
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,432
I love that. "Warrior."

304
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,334
You're Warrior Gabee.

305
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:20,272
So, we're headed to Wulai.
I looked it up, and it means hot springs.

306
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,542
WULAI, AN INDIGENOUS VILLAGE
FAMOUS FOR ITS NATURAL HOT SPRINGS

307
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:27,012
THE MILDLY ALKALINE HOT SPRING
IS NICKNAMED "THE BEAUTY BATH"

308
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,548
-Wait, so the water's carbonated?
-Yes.

309
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:32,518
-That's cool.
-It's meant to be good for your skin.

310
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,686
Sounds awesome.

311
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,756
What makes it even more special
is that it's home to Indigenous people.

312
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:39,125
A HOT SPRING SPOT
OCCUPIED BY INDIGENOUS PEOPLE

313
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:40,793
Then, when traveling,

314
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,962
what's most important to you?

315
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,097
It's only a one-night trip,

316
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,501
but shouldn't we try
to make the most of it and have fun?

317
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,903
Number one is who I'm going with.

318
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,205
That's important to me too.

319
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,509
For me,
that makes up about 80% of the trip.

320
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:59,078
What do you look for
in a travel buddy, then?

321
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,580
How much I like them.

322
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,785
What would I have to do
to make you like me?

323
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:08,754
My feelings for you are already at 100%.

324
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,089
The second thing

325
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:11,957
is the weather.

326
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:18,664
(WHAT DO WE DO?)

327
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:21,400
The weather tends
to determine my mood on a trip.

328
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,236
-But some people like rain.
-Right.

329
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,338
I think today's weather is decent.

330
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,741
It's not the kind of weather
that forces you to stay in.

331
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,142
Right, of course.

332
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,011
Third for me is the food.

333
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:34,980
You didn't seem picky,
but your list is pretty long.

334
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,884
That's pretty much everything.

335
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,252
What should we avoid?

336
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,655
I'm good with anything except coriander.

337
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:46,158
I honestly eat anything.
You'll be surprised.

338
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:47,793
I like tteokbokki…

339
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,694
Hey!

340
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,629
Isn't Smile Tteokbokki so delicious?

341
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,398
-Smile Tteokbokki?
-In Ichon-dong.

342
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,033
I've seen it but never tried it.

343
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:57,203
-Why haven't you tried it? You're nuts!
-Smile Tteokbokki?

344
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,871
That's a massive deal.

345
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,806
The Yongsan Station will come for you.

346
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:01,707
Seriously?

347
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,643
How can you live in Ichon-dong
and not have tried Smile Tteokbokki?

348
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,578
How does it taste?

349
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:08,981
It's not a super red gochujang sauce.

350
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,883
It uses chili flakes,
so it tastes brighter.

351
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,117
GULP

352
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,254
But the downside is,
you end up eating too much.

353
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,590
I should try it. I've never been.

354
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,992
I'm craving tteokbokki now.

355
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:24,129
-Still, we should eat Taiwanese food.
-It's nice sharing our favorite spots.

356
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,399
This isn't in our neighborhood,
but I found this brilliant place.

357
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:30,069
They give you yukhoe,
which you wrap in brisket.

358
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,104
And you top it off
with a shot of soju and beer.

359
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,940
Oh my God. It's so good.

360
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,510
If you take the yukhoe
and wrap it in the thinly cut brisket…

361
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,146
It's hot and cold.

362
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,848
So you like stuff that's hot and cold.

363
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,253
You like extremes. Hot, then cold.

364
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:48,621
Hot, then cold.

365
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,723
-It sounds delicious.
-And drinks.

366
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,292
-Do you like lamb skewers?
-I love them.

367
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,928
-Know the great place in Hannam-dong?
-I don't know.

368
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,396
I should write this down.

369
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:58,831
They have a sweet corn jeon.

370
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,636
I thought someone zapped you.

371
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,872
-Sweet corn noodles.
-Their sweet corn noodles are great.

372
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,341
I love them. It's slightly spicy.
Hot noodles.

373
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,411
And when I want to eat close to home,
I go to…

374
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,013
I've never… Wait, that place?

375
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,948
I've had a lot of grilled fish there.

376
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:17,283
-Grilled fish.
-Yes, it's good.

377
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:20,185
-Have you been to the Ichon Market?
-I have.

378
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,421
In the alley, there's a mandu place.

379
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,857
-I know that one.
-It's a small shack, but delicious.

380
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,259
-They have great shrimp dumplings.
-Yes, they do.

381
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,694
And mushroom dumplings.

382
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,763
DROOLING…

383
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:32,331
Shall we go back to Seoul?

384
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:41,040
We should have just met near home.
We got on a flight all the way to Taiwan.

385
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,509
A food tour with you would be so much fun.

386
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:46,378
Can't we shoot an episode
around our neighborhood?

387
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,348
-Our neighborhood?
-Can't you come sometime?

388
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:50,316
Not a bad shout.

389
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:53,452
-There's a lot of good food in the area.
-Sounds good to me.

390
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,987
I love our area.

391
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,355
I feel so at peace.

392
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,590
-Right?
-That's why I love our area too.

393
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,659
This is nice.

394
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,562
This is so nice. I think it's true

395
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,165
that what's most important
is who you travel with.

396
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,434
-Thank you.
-You need to get along.

397
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,469
-That's good.
-Honestly.

398
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:14,106
Shall we decide on some rules
for your trip?

399
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,407
-Rules for today?
-Yes.

400
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:19,078
Is there anything you want to do,
or anything you'd like me to do?

401
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,646
Not really.

402
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,715
Like giving you some time to yourself.

403
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:24,683
Yes, please.

404
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,385
Like "Please don't come to my room."

405
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:27,553
Yes, please…

406
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:28,687
(DON'T COME TO MY ROOM)

407
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,857
That should not happen.

408
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,692
PROTECTING HER SPACE

409
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,661
I'll lock my door shut,

410
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:38,063
then swallow my key card.

411
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,334
No, I'm just kidding.
There's nothing like that.

412
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:43,902
Then is there anything

413
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:45,771
that you'd like to try with Gabee?

414
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,113
Things to try?

415
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,414
Gabee and I

416
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:59,184
have never had drinks together,
so we could have some over good food.

417
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:01,687
I wanted to say that,
but I didn't want to come on too strong.

418
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:02,921
That's totally fine.

419
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:04,757
-Drinking alone with you.
-Sure.

420
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:05,924
Without any cameras.

421
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,729
I only move when there are cameras.

422
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,498
I went a step too far.

423
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:13,699
I'm just kidding.

424
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,801
A pleasant drink.

425
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,102
Yeah, we're on vacation.

426
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,505
We're abroad, so we should drink
some Taiwanese beer.

427
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,273
Taiwanese beer.

428
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,475
I can't wait.

429
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,211
A drink with a good meal is the best.

430
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:29,081
Recently,
I've been into whiskey and tequila.

431
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:30,616
So Jaejae told me,

432
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,285
"You're following in my footsteps."

433
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,154
-She's a whiskey drinker.
-Yes.

434
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,955
"You're following in my footsteps."

435
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:40,259
-How many years older is she?
-She's three years older than me.

436
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,728
Her Chinese zodiac is a horse.

437
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,730
Mine's a chicken. What's yours?

438
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,799
Me? Mine's a cow.

439
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,667
Cow? I get on well with cows.

440
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,868
-Don't lie.
-I swear!

441
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:52,404
Earlier, you asked me my star sign.

442
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,306
"When's your birthday?"

443
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,607
"It's March. It's passed."

444
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:56,875
"Then are you an Aries?"

445
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,043
"No, a Pisces."

446
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,678
"I get on well with Pisces."

447
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,448
FLIRTING WITH STAR SIGNS
NO CHANCE OF INCOMPATIBILITY

448
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,516
Then you asked, "What are Pisces like?"

449
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,286
And you said,
"I don't know. I'd have to look it up."

450
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:13,792
I'm still grateful.
It's nice of you to say that.

451
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,861
But honestly,
I get on really well with cows.

452
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,030
Chickens and cows get along.

453
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,099
Because Seung-heon's is a cow,

454
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:22,067
and I've read that they get on well.

455
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,569
-Are you a chicken?
-Yes.

456
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:24,503
Chicken.

457
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,539
I like chicken

458
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,375
because my zodiac animal is a chicken.

459
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,278
-It's the chicken song.
-There's an actual song?

460
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:34,613
I made it.

461
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:39,518
I like beef

462
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,020
because my Chinese zodiac is a cow.

463
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:43,388
Moo.

464
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:48,193
DRIVING DEEPER INTO THE MOUNTAINS

465
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,262
It looks like the home
of a mountain spirit.

466
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:51,864
With a celestial maiden taking a bath.

467
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,899
-There's so much green.
-There is.

468
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:56,301
I love the fog.

469
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:58,737
I strangely do.

470
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:06,311
AFTER A ONE-AND-A-HALF-HOUR DRIVE,
WE'VE ARRIVED AT WULAI

471
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:09,548
This is the Wulai Village,
and if we go this way,

472
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:12,117
we can get foot baths for free.

473
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,185
Really?

474
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,553
-For free?
-Free.

475
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:19,591
The hot springs here are naturally made.

476
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,861
I heard the locals here
like to use them too.

477
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:25,831
-It's so quaint.
-Right? Such a cute neighborhood.

478
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,166
Look at the painting.

479
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,867
It's huge.

480
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:30,435
It's so cute.

481
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,037
It's written here. "Wulai."

482
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,405
All right!

483
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:34,740
I'm sorry.

484
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,109
-All right, Wulai.
-All right, Wulai.

485
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,644
JOINS IN TO KEEP GABEE'S SPIRITS UP

486
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,380
This is such a pretty neighborhood.
I love it.

487
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:44,550
It's not too crowded and not too loud.

488
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,084
It's pretty cute.

489
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:49,388
I think a lot of locals come here.

490
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:52,791
Would you look at that?
The path is so lovely.

491
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,761
I think this painting
is of the Indigenous people.

492
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,397
The Indigenous people
look incredibly charismatic.

493
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:01,200
-I want to ride this.
-What is it?

494
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,601
Let's ride it.

495
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,903
I think it'll be a thrilling ride.

496
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,407
It's so picturesque.

497
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:10,042
The trees are so lush.

498
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,544
Is this a massive boulder or a mountain?

499
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:17,149
It feels like we're in Gangwon-do
in the summer.

500
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:19,751
-I get you.
-You feel me?

501
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,954
The green here is somewhat greener.

502
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:22,921
Exactly.

503
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,590
He's doing martial arts.

504
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:25,757
Wow, you're right.

505
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:28,126
-Like Qi exercises.
-It looks like it, yes.

506
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:30,028
-How fascinating.
-I like it here.

507
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:32,197
You don't get to see this very often.

508
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:34,099
He's swimming.

509
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,468
I think we wash there before we go in.

510
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:37,703
You're right.

511
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,806
We're just going to dip our feet.

512
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:41,873
Yes, just our feet.

513
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,175
I'll just wash my feet.

514
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:44,943
It's nice and cool.

515
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,112
-Shall we go?
-Yes.

516
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,582
Where should we take a seat?

517
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,684
-Wow, it's warm.
-It is?

518
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,120
It's so warm. It's really warm.

519
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:58,557
It's the perfect temperature.

520
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:01,393
-It's not too hot.
-Yes, it's the ideal temperature.

521
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:06,632
I think the hot water is coming out
from underneath here somewhere.

522
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,767
The water here's cold, though. Touch it.

523
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:10,802
You're right.

524
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:12,738
This place is so nice.

525
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:14,373
We're in the middle of hot and cold.

526
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,543
So we enjoy the hot water,

527
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:20,779
and when we feel a little too warm…

528
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:22,714
-You go to the cold water?
-Right away.

529
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,049
Wow, Do-yeon!

530
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,051
Do-yeon, there are fish!

531
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:26,952
-Where?
-There.

532
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,454
-Hey, you're right. I wanna see.
-They live here.

533
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,925
-It's too cold.
-It's nice and cool.

534
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:36,295
It's very deep.

535
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:38,730
Then, when you're feeling cold,
you go back in.

536
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:43,502
So warm.

537
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:45,370
Wow.

538
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,875
Wow. Bravo.

539
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:53,312
It's harder than you'd think
to dive in like this, you know.

540
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,347
It was such an elegant dive.

541
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:58,016
This is fascinating.
It's like a whole different world.

542
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,252
If I go in here, it's…

543
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:04,523
Please be careful.

544
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:06,391
Lucky you have long legs.

545
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,427
Na-rae would just fall in.

546
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,595
Her head would be in the water already.

547
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,731
Lucky I'm me.
Na-rae would have gone for a dive.

548
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:15,767
Maybe someone's under there
playing a pipe.

549
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:18,303
Wait. Are you okay in there?

550
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,513
GIGGLING OVER AN IMAGINARY PIPE

551
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,482
We can check the water depth with this.

552
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:34,386
What is this place?

553
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,656
I think I like it.
I really like this place.

554
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:40,158
Taiwan and I get along.

555
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:41,727
Taiwan and I mesh really well.

556
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,229
-Such a peculiar place.
-I want to try catching one.

557
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,831
I think I can.

558
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:48,767
-Please be careful.
-Okay.

559
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:50,502
Oh my!

560
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,271
-They're really smart.
-Did they swim away?

561
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:55,774
Please don't go. I can't go any further.

562
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:56,842
They're so smart.

563
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:57,976
Come on.

564
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:00,245
THUMBS UP

565
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:02,080
-They're not easy to catch.
-Koreans?

566
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:03,882
-Yes, Korean!
-We're Korean!

567
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:05,350
That's great!

568
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:08,086
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

569
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,421
You're a great diver!

570
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:13,425
I like Korean music.

571
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,293
-Korean music?
-K-pop?

572
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,028
-G-Dragon!
-Rose?

573
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:19,364
Did he say "Multiflora Rose"? Hold up.

574
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,900
Do-yeon heard him as multiflora rose.
I heard G-Dragon.

575
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,935
Not multiflora rose.

576
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:25,904
Not multiflora rose.

577
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:28,707
-I was thinking about his age.
-Come on, now.

578
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:31,276
There's a song by Jang Sa-ik
called "Multiflora Rose."

579
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:34,713
-Oh, G-Dragon?
-G-Dragon.

580
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,314
I'm so embarrassed.

581
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:40,919
Taiwanese Dragon!

582
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:43,622
-T-dragon.
-He's an awesome guy.

583
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:47,192
This place is so much fun.

584
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:49,861
Bravo!

585
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,430
Okay!

586
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,599
You enjoy the hot springs,
then catch a few fish.

587
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,168
-Then go for a dive.
-A dive.

588
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,172
Wow, he's good.

589
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:01,907
It's like watching a coming-of-age movie.

590
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:04,409
It's so peaceful here.
This place is great.

591
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:05,911
I love it here.

592
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:07,579
It's nice being in nature.

593
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:09,714
I didn't spot any fish.

594
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,316
Please sit.

595
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,287
I can't wrap my head around it.
How is it so warm here?

596
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,389
Exactly. It's so nice and warm.

597
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,291
And it's drizzling.

598
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:20,292
Right.

599
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:23,395
The view's great.

600
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:25,564
This is nice.

601
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,868
It's such a nice place.
The perfect inspiration to write a poem.

602
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,369
What sort of poem?

603
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:34,673
She was a Pisces

604
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,776
I was a Scorpio

605
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:41,446
Her zodiac animal was a cow

606
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:44,382
Mine was a chicken

607
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,651
No matter how we look at it

608
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,487
We were made to be

609
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,322
Don't bother resisting

610
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:51,723
My charm is like Lucifer's

611
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:58,663
How drained do you feel right now?

612
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,332
-How exhausted are you?
-Exhausted?

613
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:01,766
I'm actually recovering.

614
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,735
-This place is doing that, right?
-It's great.

615
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:07,372
-That's the power of foot baths.
-This is so nice.

616
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,974
This place is lovely.

617
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:11,543
This is a gift from nature!

618
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:18,250
GIVING THANKS TO NATURE

619
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:19,518
GIVING THANKS TO GOD

620
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:21,720
GIVING THANKS TO EVERYONE

621
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:22,821
GIVING THANKS TO THE RAIN

622
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,356
GIVING THANKS TO THE WARM WATER

623
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:25,957
But, above all…

624
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:30,228
THE GREATEST THANKS TO NETFLIX

625
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:33,198
Tudum.

626
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:36,935
I love the atmosphere.

627
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:39,604
You can go diving
and snack on a watermelon over there.

628
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:41,339
Because being in the water
makes you hungry.

629
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:43,575
And when you get cold,
you come here to warm up.

630
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:45,076
And repeat.

631
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:48,413
I'm not entirely sure,
but this feels like a love tub.

632
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,649
-A couple's tub.
-Yes, exactly.

633
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,751
-A couple's tub.
-Or a family tub.

634
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:54,319
They look great together.

635
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,154
They look so peaceful.

636
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,957
Maybe it's because they live with nature,
but they look so peaceful.

637
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,192
This is so nice.

638
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:03,161
I think it's even better
because you're with me.

639
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:05,063
-Honestly.
-Thank you.

640
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,298
Truly.

641
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,633
I'm having such a great time
because you're here with me.

642
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:10,135
That's so sweet of you.

643
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:12,938
Hey. Let's check out the love tub later.

644
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:14,272
Hey!

645
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,840
Hey! Let's use the love tub.

646
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:16,975
The love tub…

647
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:18,376
It feels a little too soon.

648
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,078
REJECTED

649
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,050
Let's leave on a high note.

650
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:27,352
-I'm hungry, Do-yeon.
-Wait, you are?

651
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,188
I said that because I thought
you'd want to stay longer.

652
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,490
Give the piper his pipe back.

653
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:33,558
Yes, I will.

654
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:34,993
-He's still underwater.
-Is he?

655
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,194
Take your pipe, sir.

656
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:37,862
-He's got it.
-Good.

657
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,331
-Let's go.
-We're free to go now.

658
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:40,298
Let's go to eat.

659
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:42,200
They're making their own coffee.

660
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,770
Could we try a sip?

661
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:46,671
Okay.

662
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,340
-Really? Thank you!
-Thank you!

663
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,875
Taiwanese oolong tea?

664
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,614
Thank you!

665
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,248
It's slightly tangy.

666
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:00,585
It's not the oolong tea we know.

667
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:04,122
This is lovely.

668
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,024
It's delicious.

669
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:10,061
It feels like my body temperature
has gone up a couple of degrees.

670
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,329
Isn't this lovely?

671
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:13,098
It is. Today's been perfect.

672
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,636
I love this.

673
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,240
FEELING WARM FROM THEIR KINDNESS

674
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,143
I really love this place.
It has such a great vibe.

675
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,145
We've had a great time.

676
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:28,413
Let's go.

677
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,149
RECHARGED AFTER A PLEASANT REST
SURROUNDED BY NATURE

678
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,585
-Now, we're going to eat.
-Great!

679
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,754
-Did I tell you about the boar sausages?
-Yes.

680
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,390
Boar sausages.

681
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:40,025
I think it's there, Do-yeon.

682
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:41,960
Wow, what's this?

683
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,428
It looks exciting.

684
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,997
The entire place is fascinating
and feels new.

685
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:47,832
It's so pretty.

686
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,101
It looks just like a hot spring town.

687
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,003
And the more I listen to this,

688
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,138
it feels like white noise.

689
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:54,906
-Right?
-It's easy on the ears.

690
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:01,146
It feels like a very mystical place
where anything could happen.

691
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:03,448
You're absolutely right.

692
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,617
-It's a little unrealistic.
-It is.

693
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:09,421
It feels entirely different
on the other side of the valley.

694
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:10,522
How pretty.

695
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:11,690
There's a lot to see.

696
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,425
Maybe it's there?

697
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:15,760
-There are a lot of people.
-You're right.

698
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:17,762
WULAI OLD STREET

699
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:21,199
A TRADITIONAL STREET
PRESERVING WULAI'S PAST AND CULTURE

700
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:24,736
WHERE YOU CAN EXPERIENCE VARIOUS FOODS,
CRAFTS, AND INDIGENOUS CULTURE

701
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:27,172
They sell a lot of sausages.

702
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:29,574
-There are a lot of people.
-This place looks popular.

703
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:31,176
This looks delicious.

704
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,247
I think they're queuing. Are you okay?

705
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,983
Queen Gabee is moved.

706
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,353
I can't contain myself.
They look so tasty.

707
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,156
She's talking to the camera
more than she's talking to me.

708
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:46,591
OH MY GOD

709
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:50,762
She's not talking to me,
but she's talking to the cameras.

710
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,530
I'm pretty rich,

711
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:55,500
so I'm going to splurge
as if I'm Paris Hilton.

712
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,802
Clearly, you exchanged money
at the airport.

713
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,037
Hush.

714
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:02,874
Wow, she's buying a whole load.

715
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,076
Oh, like that?

716
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:07,378
You douse it in sauce,
then eat it with garlic.

717
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:08,880
With a slice of garlic?

718
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,381
Thank you.

719
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,650
I can't wait. They look delicious.

720
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:17,722
The smell is totally up my alley.

721
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:18,757
This is crazy.

722
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:21,059
You know what this smells like?

723
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:23,762
This smells exactly like
the sausages we'd eat

724
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:27,499
at the end of the day
back in elementary school.

725
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:29,134
-It smells great.
-The ones that sizzle.

726
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,468
There's no way these taste bad.

727
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:32,871
See? I told you they would snap.

728
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:35,573
Wow.

729
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:42,080
It's so good.

730
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,949
It's seasoned on the inside.

731
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:47,485
Let's try it like the locals do.

732
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,188
These sausages are so good.

733
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:51,823
They do have a little…

734
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,858
-Some spices?
-Yes, they have spices.

735
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:56,294
-But it's so good.
-Not overpowering at all.

736
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:58,897
-They're not an issue at all.
-It's so good.

737
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:01,733
This time, I'll try it with garlic.

738
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,242
It's not too spicy.

739
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:12,911
This is so good.

740
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:18,116
The slight kick of the garlic
blends really well with the sausage.

741
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:20,285
It's not spicy at all. It's perfect.

742
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:22,187
-It elevates the taste.
-Right?

743
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:24,189
The aftertaste is lovely and crisp.

744
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:25,156
This is so good.

745
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:27,091
This place is so good.
Please come and try this.

746
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,393
It's your loss if you don't.

747
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,265
This place is so good.

748
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,269
HER MOVES SAY IT ALL

749
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:43,474
TIME FOR A QUIZ
WHAT'S GABEE TRYING TO TELL US?

750
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:45,310
You're saying, "Try them. They shred."

751
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:47,712
-So delicious.
-Really tasty.

752
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:51,449
They're perfectly seasoned and very chewy.

753
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:55,119
They're so addictive.
It's very hard to walk away after one.

754
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,754
I guess this is a market.

755
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:58,590
You saw I'm loaded, right?

756
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,025
-Tell me whatever you want.
-Do-yeon!

757
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,194
What's this?

758
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,296
-What is this?
-What might it be?

759
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,265
-Shall we try it?
-Yes, shall we?

760
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:08,233
What is this?

761
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:09,834
-Mochi!
-Mochi?

762
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:12,704
XIAOMI MASHU
AN INDIGENOUS TAIWANESE RICE SKEWER

763
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:13,671
Thank you.

764
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:14,572
Tteok.

765
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:15,473
Tteok?

766
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:18,076
I guess a lot of Koreans come here.

767
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:20,545
I love trying small bites of everything.

768
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:21,446
Me too.

769
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,149
The grill isn't too hot.

770
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:27,485
Sweetened condensed milk.

771
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,254
-And peanuts.
-Peanuts?

772
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:31,489
(THUMBS UP)

773
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:36,160
It's very hot.

774
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,897
-It looks so good.
-Thank you!

775
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:40,265
Are you bad with hot food?

776
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:42,867
-Shall I try it?
-I think you'll burn yourself.

777
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:44,636
Shall we wait, or should I try it now?

778
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:46,137
-Shall we buy drinks first?
-Sure.

779
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:47,906
This place sells Indigenous drinks.

780
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:50,108
What do you recommend?

781
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:52,911
HERO SOMIJU, AN INDIGENOUS DRINK
MADE FROM FERMENTED SORGHUM

782
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:55,213
DELICATELY SWEET,
WITH A PLUM-LIKE TARTNESS

783
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,348
-Shall we try it? Indigenous drinks.
-It looks good.

784
00:31:57,982 --> 00:31:59,017
Cheers.

785
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:01,986
Smells like plum.

786
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,955
-It does.
-Like plum wine.

787
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,929
-It tastes like plum.
-It's good. So good.

788
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,897
It has a fermented taste.

789
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:15,833
It's like plum wine, but more tart.

790
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,002
-It tastes very fresh.
-It is.

791
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:24,642
MABULAU
A SWEET DRINK WITH A TINGLING FINISH

792
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,244
It smells like rice.

793
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:30,581
It's so sweet.

794
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:33,251
-This tastes great.
-This one…

795
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:35,753
It's like makgeolli, but sweeter.

796
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,622
-Yeah, it's very sweet.
-I like both.

797
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,958
CAUGHT BETWEEN THE TWO
BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH GOOD

798
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:42,660
This is tricky.

799
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:45,196
I think this will pair better with food.

800
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:46,664
Sounds good. It's a little crisper.

801
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,933
-I think it will be good on ice.
-Let's go with this.

802
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,835
ONE BOTTLE OF THE PLUM-FLAVORED DRINK

803
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:53,037
Would you like to try this now?

804
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,343
I think my throat is feeling
the alcohol now.

805
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,045
You could totally live here.

806
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:02,513
What's this?

807
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:06,284
She dances according to the menu.

808
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,888
Let's go!

809
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,692
It's really soft.

810
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,761
-Let me try it.
-Go on.

811
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:18,997
It's super soft.

812
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:22,200
So soft, right? Isn't it good?

813
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,369
Let's go!

814
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:25,870
Let's go, Jang Do-yeon!

815
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,873
-It's so good.
-Right?

816
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,009
It's not chewy, yet it's so good.

817
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:32,810
Perfect as an appetizer.

818
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:35,246
So good. The peanut powder is delicious.

819
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:38,182
IN LOVE

820
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,252
NOW THEY'VE HAD A FEW BITES OF STREET FOOD

821
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:44,322
All right, then. Let's go for dinner.

822
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:46,891
It's so fun trying new foods.

823
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:50,928
I have a feeling that the food here
will be to our taste.

824
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:51,829
I do too.

825
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:54,599
I think their local food
will be so delicious.

826
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:58,536
-I'm so excited we'll be drinking.
-So am I!

827
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,705
I want to take the plum wine,

828
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,640
pour it over ice,

829
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,243
and then add a dash of Sprite.

830
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:07,345
-Doesn't that sound good?
-It sure does.

831
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:09,580
HEADED TO DINNER TALKING ABOUT FOOD

832
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:10,782
RECOMMENDED BY LOCALS

833
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:13,651
A TRUE TASTE OF TAIWAN
AT A ROADSIDE EATERY

834
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:17,055
INEVITABLE YUMMY NOISES

835
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:18,923
(STILL MAKING THEM)

836
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,559
DO-YEON'S SUDDEN REACTION OUTBURST

837
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:23,428
Sis!

838
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:24,896
Thank you!

839
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:26,898
BUT THIS QUEEN WON'T GO DOWN
WITHOUT A FIGHT!

840
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:28,800
Oh my God!

841
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:31,035
SO GOOD, REALLY GOOD, CRAZY GOOD

842
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:32,637
VOTE FOR YOUR REACTION QUEEN!

843
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:34,272
JUST WHEN WE THOUGHT THE DAY WAS OVER…

844
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:36,607
Do-yeon?

845
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:37,909
AN ONSLAUGHT OF QUESTIONS

846
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:39,977
Do you enjoy love talk?
When were you last asked out?

847
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:42,180
We've covered love,
so now let's talk breakups.

848
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,448
GULP

849
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:45,316
FINALLY SNAPPED AND WENT ALL OUT

850
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:46,751
Babe, can you get dressed?

851
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:48,786
Spending time with Gabee
can never be dull.

852
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:50,288
UNTIL DO-YEON EVENTUALLY BROKE DOWN

853
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:51,389
Shin Gabee, please leave.

854
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:52,757
WILL THEIR DAY

855
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:54,192
EVER COME TO AN END?

856
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,993
Never have I ever had a crush recently.

857
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,728
Three, two, one.

858
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:58,896
-I have.
-Have you?

859
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:04,235
I STILL HAVE A QUESTION LEFT
AND I PROMISE IT WON'T TAKE LONG…
