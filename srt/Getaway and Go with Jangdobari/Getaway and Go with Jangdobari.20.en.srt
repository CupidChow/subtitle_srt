1
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:05,839
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

2
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:07,874
I'm greeting you today

3
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:09,542
from the city of romance and art.

4
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:11,411
This is Paris.

5
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:14,280
I'll introduce her as my mon amie.

6
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:17,283
I'm film director Yi Ok-seop.

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,353
If I were given the chance to go anywhere,

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,489
I'd definitely go to Monet's house

9
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:25,258
or see his work here in the city,
not anywhere else.

10
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:27,694
Who knew I'd get to visit
the Orangerie Museum?

11
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,330
AN ENDLESS DISPLAY OF MONET'S ART!

12
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:31,598
No way.

13
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:32,866
I don't know why, but I love this one.

14
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:34,267
That looks incredible.

15
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:36,269
We're now off to Monet's house.

16
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:37,637
What a beautiful morning.

17
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,905
What a beautiful scene.

18
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,440
Isn't this like a scene from a movie?

19
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:41,975
THE HOUSE OF MONET
THAT DO-YEON WANTED TO VISIT

20
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,476
This is amazing!

21
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,211
How is this someone's house?

22
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:47,380
Even the stems are pretty.

23
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,015
Look. That one's a famous piece of his.

24
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,551
I can't believe I'm seeing it.

25
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:54,621
Are we off to the restaurant
where Monet used to eat?

26
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:56,389
Yes, we're off to that salon.

27
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,125
The steak's incredible.

28
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:00,760
That's a satisfying chew.

29
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,996
After this, we're heading back to Paris.

30
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,397
-Cheers.
-That was delicious.

31
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:05,799
WHAT WILL AWAIT THEM IN PARIS?

32
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:06,699
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

33
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:07,734
Thanks.

34
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,842
We'll wrap up our short
yet jam-packed time here

35
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,044
and head to Paris from Giverny.

36
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,182
What a pretty neighborhood.

37
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,585
Of all the places he could've lived,
he chose Giverny.

38
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:26,953
I'm sure he had his reasons.

39
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,589
Did he see this place
as a reflection of himself?

40
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,659
Or maybe he changed
and grew to resemble this town.

41
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:34,060
That's a possibility.

42
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:37,764
All artists are great in their own way,

43
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:38,898
including you.

44
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:39,933
How am I an artist?

45
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:41,167
Of course, you are.

46
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:45,605
Whenever I listen to Yoon Jong-shin's
music, I feel that way about him.

47
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:48,141
What I admire about him most
is his ability

48
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,943
-to continuously create music.
-Absolutely.

49
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,179
His greatest achievement is that
he's still relevant in the industry.

50
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:56,816
I grew up listening to his music
and still find new songs of his today.

51
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:58,885
I can totally relate.

52
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:02,055
Recently, Ko Hyun-jung appeared
on Salon Drip 2,

53
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,525
and it made me reminisce about the person
I was during each of her projects.

54
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,627
Sandglass, The Great Queen Seondeok,

55
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,395
-What's Up Fox, etc.
-Of course.

56
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,798
"Where was I and what was I doing

57
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,366
-at the time?"
-There's also Woman on the Beach.

58
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,101
Yes, that movie too.

59
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,604
All artists are master craftsmen.

60
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,406
Like the beloved Sunwoo Yong-nyeo.

61
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,375
-I want what she has.
-I know.

62
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:24,644
If I manage to live that long,

63
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:27,247
I wonder what my life would look like.

64
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,782
I'd love to still have a healthy liver

65
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:32,752
and be able to sit in the sun,

66
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,954
read, nap, have a beer,

67
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,357
nap again, and chat.

68
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,959
It'd also be nice
if I had a pleasant personality

69
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,162
so a few friends would want
to be around me.

70
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:43,396
Like Monet?

71
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,365
What?

72
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:47,433
Yes, you're right.

73
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,635
Thanks.

74
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:50,003
What do you think I said?

75
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,804
"Like today."

76
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:53,773
I'll let you keep believing that.

77
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,809
Isn't that what you said?

78
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,211
CONFUSED

79
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:00,013
Did you call me a difficult person?

80
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,048
No, I said, "Like Monet."

81
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:05,018
-Monet had a lot of good friends.
-I thought you said, "Like today."

82
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,153
-It hurt a little just now.
-Why?

83
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,656
I could've said
what you thought you heard,

84
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:10,890
but it didn't cross my mind,

85
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:13,693
and it hurts that you were moved
by what I hadn't said.

86
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:16,329
LAUGHING

87
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:17,463
Do you know what I mean?

88
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,599
SHE FEELS GUILTY
ALTHOUGH SHE DID NOTHING WRONG

89
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:20,900
It's all good.

90
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,203
IT'S OKAY, I'M FINE…

91
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:29,509
DOZING OFF

92
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,449
-What?
-It's nothing. Go back to sleep.

93
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:37,951
I wasn't sleeping.

94
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:43,957
KNOCKED OUT COLD

95
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:50,930
GIVERNY, A 1 HOUR AND 10 MINUTE DRIVE,
PARIS HOTEL

96
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,433
After napping a bit in the car,

97
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,134
we made it back to Paris.

98
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,302
ARRIVING WHILE DOZING OFF
IN THE CAR

99
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:58,738
Merci.

100
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:06,980
-It feels like a new college dorm.
-I know.

101
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:07,880
- CHECKING IN -

102
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:10,516
We've lost a lot of daylight already.

103
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,651
You're right.

104
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:12,719
This is nice.

105
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:20,827
DISCOVERING THE UNCANNY
AND BIZARRE WITHIN BEAUTY

106
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:27,367
-Why are you filming that?
-I don't know.

107
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,570
LAUGHING

108
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,606
They handed me the camera,
so I figured I should do something.

109
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,843
THE SELFIE CAMERA SEEMS LOST

110
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:39,412
Make it look like you're practicing
for your vlog.

111
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,114
Like a newbie vlogger?

112
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:42,849
PARIS VLOG

113
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:44,484
Right now, we're…

114
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,785
SNORTING

115
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,387
My vision's bad,
so I can't see what's happening.

116
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:51,024
The sound of my own voice
just gave me the chills.

117
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,327
-Right now, we're--
-A lot of vlogs use closed captions now.

118
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,395
I see.

119
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:56,896
I'll do this.

120
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:01,401
Where we're headed now is a bistro
that serves home-style French food.

121
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,403
It's popular with locals,

122
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,606
and even tourists visit
after finding it online.

123
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,376
Keep going. It seems promising.

124
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:11,444
Unlike Giverny,

125
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:15,682
Paris isn't as sunny,
though I like how cool and breezy it is.

126
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:18,718
I don't know if you like that weather too.

127
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,720
What was that?

128
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,122
Who knows?
I must have the wrong idea about vlogs.

129
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:26,125
She's a friend from my college club

130
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:29,295
who I met while studying in France.

131
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,431
She's Ok-seop Lee.

132
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,234
-Ok-seop Lee lived here--
-I'm Marthe.

133
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,937
-This is for my vlog, remember?
-Oh, right.

134
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,040
Do you know how vloggers
sometimes film their friends

135
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,208
from the neck down?

136
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,010
Should I film you that way? Got it.

137
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,279
-Cut me off from the neck down.
-That's how I'm filming you.

138
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,481
Marthe, what do they serve
at this restaurant?

139
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,851
It was one of my mentor's
favorite bistros.

140
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,253
Professor Julien, was it?

141
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,223
-From culinary school.
-Of course.

142
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,424
CULINARY STUDENTS IN BERETS

143
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:02,095
Anyway, I'm off to the bistro

144
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:04,497
recommended by Ok-seop Marthe Lee.

145
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:05,665
See you later.

146
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:07,834
You even covered the lens.

147
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,069
THE NEWBIE LEARNED TRICKS
FROM OTHER VLOGGERS

148
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,339
SEEING DOWNTOWN PARIS

149
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:14,941
This is so cool.

150
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,578
THEY ARRIVE AT THE RESTAURANT

151
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:21,447
No way. This looks so cool.

152
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,183
Guys, we're finally here.

153
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,253
Merci.

154
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:32,525
This looks cool.

155
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,328
It's so pretty. Look.

156
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,399
This must be a local hot spot.

157
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:40,400
Looks like it.

158
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,142
Are you sure this isn't a movie set?

159
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,344
Could these people be extras?

160
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:53,379
They all look like actors.

161
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:55,882
What's with this place?

162
00:06:58,651 --> 00:06:59,786
GIGGLING

163
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:02,088
It's like we're wearing these hats
just because we're in France.

164
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,757
Back at Monet's house,
there were a lot of people in hats.

165
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,492
Yes, there were a lot.

166
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,627
The vibe is different here.

167
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:11,130
This was the latest fashion trend
in Giverny,

168
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,632
but maybe not in Paris.

169
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,701
Let's not be intimidated.

170
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,236
UGH

171
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:20,773
-I'm already intimidated.
-I'm intimidated too.

172
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,741
I feel small.

173
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,743
Can you guess what I thought
when I walked in here?

174
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,344
"Maybe I should take this hat off."

175
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,582
I doubt it would make any difference,

176
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,118
but I wanted to take it off.

177
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,454
WHY DO I FEEL LIKE
I'M GETTING SMALLER…?

178
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,656
It can't just be the hat, right?

179
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,859
Our lack of confidence will show…

180
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,260
-Got it.
-…so don't cower.

181
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:42,261
You're right.

182
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:43,996
It's not like we did anything wrong.

183
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:45,565
Want to see some confidence?

184
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,367
Careful with that.

185
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,736
THIS IS THE CONFIDENCE
WE BROUGHT FROM GIVERNY

186
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,971
It's not helping.

187
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:53,940
My gums might bleed.

188
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,608
IT MIGHT JUST HURT HER

189
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,610
Is this the menu?

190
00:07:58,511 --> 00:07:59,645
It's the menu.

191
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,148
Since we had meat for lunch,

192
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,283
let's go with snapper or ahi tuna.

193
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,451
Snapper.

194
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,987
Let's have the grilled snapper

195
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,556
and also a dessert. Good.

196
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:12,758
Is there any escargot?

197
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,328
Escargot? Hey, here we go.

198
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:19,265
"Six large, shelled wild Burgundy snails."

199
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,700
-Burgundy snails?
-That's the dish.

200
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,168
Are they burgundy?

201
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,269
Beats me.

202
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:27,907
We'll have six large,
shelled wild Burgundy snails

203
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:30,276
and grilled snapper. Okay.

204
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,283
Snails sound delicious.

205
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,452
GLANCING

206
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,587
GLANCING

207
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:42,622
LAUGHING

208
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,623
What is it?

209
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,491
Why are the hats so hilarious?

210
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,293
Weren't these a thing in Giverny?

211
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,096
-Can I take mine off when we eat?
-Maybe…

212
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:52,498
QUIETLY

213
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,767
-That's much better.
-Really?

214
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,103
We should dress for the occasion.

215
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,638
The hat didn't vibe with Paris.

216
00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:59,705
(NOT EMBARRASSED AT ALL)

217
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,775
Foreigners in hanbok
at Gyeongbokgung Palace

218
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:03,809
look really charming.

219
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:04,944
I'm sure we look just like them.

220
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,145
-Let's believe that.
-Got it.

221
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,024
GRILLED SNAPPER

222
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:23,496
TUNA TARTARE

223
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,665
6 WILD, SHELLED WILD BURGUNDY SNAILS

224
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,799
This is great.

225
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,168
-Hey.
-What is it?

226
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,604
I prepared this as a surprise for you.

227
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,439
This spells your surname "Yi."

228
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,475
"YI" IN YI OK-SEOP

229
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:41,814
How's that? Ew.

230
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:42,882
Not funny, is it?

231
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,851
That looks like a carrot for rabbits.

232
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,420
I haven't seen anything like it before.

233
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,722
This smells incredible.

234
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,258
I'm getting a nutty aroma.

235
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:58,030
Nice. This looks good.

236
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,366
IT'S SO SOFT,
IT CUTS LIKE BUTTER

237
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,634
This looks delicious.

238
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,404
I'll slice them into big pieces
since they fall apart easily.

239
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,074
Is that the sauce?

240
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,175
I don't know what that is…

241
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,476
-I see.
-…but it looks like sweet pumpkin.

242
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:11,877
Take this.

243
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,245
Thanks. I'll enjoy.

244
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,047
There's a lot of pumpkin puree.

245
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,217
That's the skin.

246
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,187
The skin is delicious.

247
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:22,188
YUMMY~!

248
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,523
It's chewy in a good way.

249
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:27,860
Even more so than chicken skin.

250
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,996
It has a crispy texture,

251
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,264
but it's also soft and chewy.

252
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:34,967
The fish is moist as well.

253
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:38,471
I could eat about 2 kg of that skin alone.

254
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,373
I could too. It's not heavy at all.

255
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:43,009
Let's try the wine next.

256
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,613
WHITE WINE THAT PAIRS
WELL WITH SNAPPER

257
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:51,984
That's delicious.

258
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,087
What was this again? The dish.

259
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,390
I read what it was earlier, but I forgot.

260
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:58,958
It sounded delicious, so I ordered it.

261
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,199
-I like all the oil.
-It's tuna.

262
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:10,970
It's good.

263
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,538
It's tangy!

264
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:15,074
Anything you eat here that looks like beef

265
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:16,642
always turns out to be tuna.

266
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,044
Yeah, it's really soft.

267
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:21,914
NEXT, THE ESCARGOTS

268
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,484
-It's still warm.
-That looks good.

269
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:26,952
Here you go.

270
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:30,890
Is that basil I smell?

271
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,728
How is it? Isn't it good?

272
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,396
It's nice and chewy.

273
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:38,531
We had this in Japan, remember?

274
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,367
We had baby snails.

275
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,637
The oil tastes so good.

276
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,441
I like that the seasoning isn't overdone.

277
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,177
-I'll dig one out for you.
-Sure.

278
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,279
Careful, the sauce might splash on you.

279
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:54,246
STRUGGLING

280
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:58,484
THE SNAIL WON'T COME OUT

281
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,352
I think I'm holding it wrong.

282
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,822
This isn't easy.

283
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,058
Would it take days or years
of living in France

284
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,426
to be able to do that?

285
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:10,396
It's like pulling whelk out
from its shell.

286
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,597
How did you manage this?

287
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,065
I grabbed it with my fingers.

288
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:15,768
(TONGS OUT)

289
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:17,770
PULLING IT OUT THE WAY
SHE'D PULL OUT WHELK MEAT

290
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,705
Try twisting it out.

291
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,474
I did it.

292
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,374
SUCCEEDS IN ONE GO

293
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:24,577
Thanks.

294
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:28,581
I actually like what's in the shells.
Kind of like how I enjoy fish skin.

295
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,751
Have the snail meat.

296
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,419
I like the shell.

297
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,187
Do you chew the shell?

298
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,190
No, I just suck on it like it's candy.

299
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,859
LIKE SHE WOULD A GOBSTOPPER

300
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,828
This oil tastes incredible.

301
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,464
I wouldn't mind drinking it from a bowl.

302
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:50,803
DIPPING THE BREAD
IN THE OIL SAUCE INSTEAD

303
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,339
GLANCING AROUND

304
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:54,774
-I'll dip it in this.
-There's more here.

305
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,944
It feels rude to dip my bread
on someone else's plate.

306
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:00,179
It's not like we're strangers.

307
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,314
I'm your mon amie.

308
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,416
Monami? What's that?

309
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:06,285
It means friend.

310
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,587
-Is that the word for friend?
-Yes.

311
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,190
Monami, the pen brand?

312
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:14,560
We've been friends with their pens
without knowing it.

313
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,462
What language is that?

314
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,363
It's from here.

315
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:18,531
Is it French?

316
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:20,900
I had no idea.

317
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:21,934
FOR 38 YEARS, SHE DIDN'T KNOW

318
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,135
What about Mi Na-mi?

319
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,037
You mean, Oh Na-mi. She's Korean.

320
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:27,373
I even got her name wrong.

321
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:28,874
Did you call her Mi Na-mi?

322
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:30,276
Isn't that a Japanese name?

323
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:31,644
GIGGLING

324
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,914
Guess what I almost said.

325
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,482
Miracles of the "Minami" General Store.

326
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:37,583
It's Namiya, not Minami.

327
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,186
Looks like we both got something wrong.

328
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,688
-We still understood each other.
-Then it's all good.

329
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:44,156
ODDLY, THE TWO FRIENDS
CAN STILL COMMUNICATE

330
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,992
Not only is the food tasty,
but the vibe is just as good.

331
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,727
THE GOOD-VIBE DINNER IS OVER

332
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,396
I enjoyed the meal.

333
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:51,764
I enjoyed it too.

334
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:56,068
-What is it?
-The night view is spectacular.

335
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:00,005
We enjoyed the night view
of the countryside yesterday.

336
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,074
-Tonight's the city.
-Exactly.

337
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:04,243
The food was so good.

338
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:08,447
NIGHT FALLS OVER PARIS…

339
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:12,852
NOW THAT THEY'RE FULL,
THEY HEAD TO THE NEXT LOCATION

340
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,954
During one of our trips,

341
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,222
we agreed that if we had time,

342
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,924
-we'd watch a movie at a local theater.
-I know.

343
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:22,494
Even if we couldn't understand
the language. It'd be a new experience

344
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,530
just to imagine what the words are.

345
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,765
We're finally getting to that.

346
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:28,267
We're off to a local theater.

347
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:32,671
I heard something interesting
about this theater.

348
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,741
You can buy a ticket for just one movie,

349
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:36,909
or you can get a subscription.

350
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:40,246
-So you pay a certain amount in advance?
-That's what I heard.

351
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:47,453
I wondered if adopting that system
could help the movie industry in Korea.

352
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,656
If that kind of system were introduced,

353
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,393
would you subscribe with a monthly fee?

354
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,461
I would.

355
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:58,297
People like me would end up saving money
by doing that.

356
00:14:58,364 --> 00:14:59,899
Yes, of course.

357
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:03,369
Look, we must still be on a main street.

358
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,337
THEY ARRIVE AT THE MOVIE THEATER

359
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,507
-Is this the power of online searching?
-People are lined up.

360
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,743
This feels like a movie set.

361
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,344
ÉCOLES CINEMA CLUB

362
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,746

364
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:20,653
BUSTLING WITH
MOVIE-GOERS OUTSIDE

365
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:23,022
What a charming little place.

366
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,189
I know.

367
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,891
-It's so charming.
-Could it be

368
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,593
-like Cinematheque Seoul Art Cinema?
-Yes.

369
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,328
Isn't this font adorable?

370
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,864
It is. The sign alone already charmed me.

371
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:32,765
MOVIE THEATER
CHARMING SIGN

372
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,566
WHIRRING

373
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,568
That must be the sound
of the film rolling.

374
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:44,543
INSIDE THE THEATER

375
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:47,713
That's so cool.

376
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,715
A PROJECTOR AND MANY MOVIE REELS

377
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:57,222
VARIOUS MOVIE SCENES ARE POSTED
HERE AND THERE

378
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,259
DIRECTOR YI'S EYES SPARKLE,
BEING IN PURE CINEMA HEAVEN

379
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:02,695
That movie looks like fun.

380
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:04,797
Even Blow Up is playing.

381
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,199
That's a movie we both love.

382
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,569
There are two of my favorite movies.

383
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,539
-There's Aftersun.
-I love that movie too.

384
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,276
Do they show Oldboy here too?

385
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:18,510
You're not kidding.

386
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:21,246
That's the movie showing
before the one we're seeing.

387
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,148
Someone's sticking the letters on
one by one.

388
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,417
-What?
-That's so cute.

389
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,754
AN ANALOGUE VIBE THE EMPLOYEE
STICKS ON EACH LETTER

390
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,656
Bonsoir.

391
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,559
Two tickets for No Country for Old Men.

392
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,060
No Country for Old Men.

393
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,470
Look at all these people.

394
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:46,839
THEY HAVE TO WAIT OUTSIDE
UNTIL THE MOVIE STARTS

395
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:48,607
WHO WILL WATCH WITH THEM

396
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,009
The people here must love movies.

397
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,610
This is so cool.

398
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:55,114
I'm sure this movie has been released
in theaters before.

399
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,949
Exactly. That's what stuns me.

400
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,150
Is that why they're here?

401
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,785
To see the movie again in a theater

402
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,120
because they already know it?

403
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,756
If Edward Scissorhands were played
in theaters again,

404
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,791
-I'd drop everything to go see it.
-Really?

405
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:10,763
MAGGIE, too.

406
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,197
, THE MOVIE
DIRECTED BY OK-SEOP

407
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:13,298
I wasn't quick enough, was I?

408
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,401
It's fine.

409
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:17,369
We're going in.

410
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:18,937
THEY FINALLY ENTER THE THEATER

411
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,206
I wonder if they run ads before the movie.

412
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:22,808
Everything's going to be fascinating.

413
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,243
THE TICKETS ARE
THOROUGHLY CHECKED

414
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,677
NODDING

415
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:29,214
It was like getting checked
before being let into a club.

416
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,449
So hipster.

417
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,285
I'm curious to see
how the locals watch movies.

418
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,186
Do they make any noise

419
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,255
-or eat popcorn?
-Are they really quiet? Exactly.

420
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:39,124
-This is so pretty.
-I know.

421
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,126
AT THE END OF THE STAIRS

422
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,730
A THEATER
WITH BRIGHT RED UPHOLSTERED SEATS

423
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,532
I'm loving the seats.

424
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:47,966
Wait.

425
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,102
It's like watching two movies.

426
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:54,173
THE SCENERY IN THE THEATER
LOOKS LIKE A MOVIE ITSELF

427
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,808
Wasn't this directed by the Coen Brothers?

428
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,576
Was it?
All I can remember is Javier Bardem.

429
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,913
I remember the directors
being the Coen Brothers.

430
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,782
-I think you're right.
-Right?

431
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:05,818
I vaguely remember the names.

432
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:08,654
THE MOVIE FINALLY BEGINS

433
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,922
-Paramount.
-Paramount.

434
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,125
It's time for English listening practice.

435
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:19,164
NO KOREAN SUBTITLES
ENGLISH LISTENING BEGINS

436
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:21,633
Don't go.

437
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:24,736
(COVERING HER MOUTH)

438
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:27,005
How can his eyes and mouth express
such different emotions?

439
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:35,180
(A GRISLY SCENE)

440
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,150
This is so scary.

441
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,685
It's grotesque.

442
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:47,459
BIT BY BIT, THEY'RE DRAWN
INTO THE MOVIE…

443
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:49,928
WINCING

444
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:52,965
WINCING TOO

445
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:56,235
THE MOVIE NOW
REACHES ITS MIDPOINT

446
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:57,636
SNORING

447
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,411
THE EXHAUSTION
FROM THE TRIP SUDDENLY HITS

448
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,680
DO-YEON CATCHES THE SLEEP BUG

449
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,884
A TIGHT SCHEDULE
FROM THIS MORNING

450
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,485
MAKES THEM GIVE IN TO SLEEP

451
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:19,625
THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO WAKE UP…

452
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:23,462
THE MOVIE ENDS

453
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:28,467
SMACKING LIPS…

454
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:32,304
THOUGH THEY'RE SLEEPY,
THEY STAY UNTIL THE END CREDITS

455
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,440
It's so warm in here.

456
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,279
-I slept like the dead.
-Me too.

457
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,881
You weren't obvious.

458
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,616
Meanwhile, I was like this.

459
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,485
I saw you headbanging and figured

460
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:48,053
I should at least stay awake but…

461
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,154
DO-YEON ALSO JOINED HER FRIEND

462
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,189
You can picture it, right?

463
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:52,791
This isn't easy.

464
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,128
Now,

465
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,564
we're about to see the Eiffel Tower
in a special way at 1 a.m.

466
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,634
WHITE EIFFEL

467
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,403
A SPECIAL "WHITE SPARKLE"
DISPLAY SHOWN ONCE A DAY

468
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,371
AT 1 A.M. FOR 5 MINUTES

469
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:11,343
THEY CHANGED INTO WARMER CLOTHES
AND ARRIVED AT CHAMP DE MARS

470
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,546
This looks quite different
from the steel tower I saw during the day.

471
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,081
It's so cool.

472
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,282
EIFFEL TOWER LOOKS DIFFERENT
AT NIGHT

473
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,318
What will it look like at 1 a.m.?

474
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,252
At 1 a.m.?

475
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,654
It'll be a breathtaking sight.

476
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,289
I haven't seen it either,

477
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,559
and I'll probably be more amazed
by it than you.

478
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,394
WHAT WILL THEY SEE WHEN
THE EIFFEL TURNS WHITE?

479
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:30,896
There are a lot of people.

480
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:33,498
THEY SIT IN A SPOT
WITH A GREAT VIEW OF THE TOWER

481
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,067
There's a reason this is so popular.

482
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,236
It's truly something to be proud of.

483
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:41,240
-Can we show this off for a second?
-Sure.

484
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:44,376
We got matching temporary tattoos today.

485
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,678
OK-SEOP GOT A TEMPORARY TATTOO
ON HER ANKLE

486
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:50,048
DO-YEON GOT ONE ON HER THIGH

487
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:53,785
This is for anyone wondering
who this person is.

488
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,320
This is me,

489
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,356
and it was drawn

490
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:00,792
by the famous Korean cartoonist
Heo Young-man.

491
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:01,860
You can't tell

492
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,363
if I'm smiling or crying,

493
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,932
but my expression carries

494
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:10,369
the joys and sorrows of life.

495
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,471
Thank you, Mr. Heo.

496
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,374
Mr. Heo, thank you.

497
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:19,411
SHE'S EMBARRASSED FOR NO REASON

498
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:22,080
Écoles Cinema Club, was it?

499
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:22,981
Yes.

500
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,549
The seats were stunning.

501
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,951
I also loved the seats,

502
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:27,886
and it was fun to be around many people.

503
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,922
The theater was packed with people,

504
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:32,190
but then everyone left--

505
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:33,825
Just one person stayed seated.

506
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:34,793
I looked behind me…

507
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,862
-He stayed for the end credits.
-…and he was like this.

508
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:39,765
I wanted to look at him, so I did.

509
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:40,999
-He was handsome.
-I know.

510
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,535
I SAW HIM TOO,
HE WAS HANDSOME… HEHE GIGGLING

511
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:48,006
THE HANDSOME YOUNG MAN
WHO LEFT AFTER THE END CREDITS

512
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,274
It just so happens…

513
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:51,443
He had the manners to stay
for the end credits.

514
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:55,747
When I didn't yet know it was good manners

515
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,650
to stay for the end credits,

516
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:02,621
I used to find people like him so cool.

517
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:05,824
Even with my mind blank,

518
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:09,027
I stayed through the end credits,

519
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:14,099
wishing someone would think
I was cool and inspiring too.

520
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,467
That's how I was.

521
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:17,469
Just one minute to go.

522
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:18,437
One minute?

523
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:19,971
I'm excited.

524
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:21,506
What will we see?

525
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:22,841
I can't wait.

526
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:26,778
What's going to happen,
and where will it start?

527
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,914
The lights will suddenly go out,

528
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,750
and it'll say "Director Yi Ok-seop…"

529
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:32,818
LAUGHING

530
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:34,252
"…forever."

531
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:36,254
"Go, Korea!"

532
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:38,323
"Go, KPop Demon Hunters."

533
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:42,961
Who knows?

534
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,298
That might be why I dragged you to Paris.

535
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:47,899
Who knows?

536
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:50,268
It might say,
"Wishing Your Country the best."

537
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:52,337
DIRECTOR YI OK-SEOP
FOREVER

538
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:54,106
You're unbelievable.

539
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:55,407
TOUCHED

540
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,809
They've all started filming.

541
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,478
-Here we go.
-No way.

542
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:02,013
-Wow.
-Hurry. Look!

543
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,081
Hurry. Look!

544
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:05,350
WOWWW!!!

545
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:07,052
SCREAMING

546
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:10,021
THE LIGHTS GRADUALLY GO OUT

547
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:15,494
THE EIFFEL TOWER DAZZLES IN WHITE

548
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,295
It's like it's snowing.

549
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:23,568
It looks like fireworks.

550
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:26,938
It'll be beautiful even from afar.

551
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:28,440
It's like a Christmas tree.

552
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,911
A GIANT CHRISTMAS TREE
ILLUMINATING PARIS

553
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:36,415
SHE LOWERS THE CAMERA
SHE WAS FILMING WITH

554
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:40,852
TAKING IN THE WHITE EIFFEL
WITH HER EYES

555
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,822
STRETCHING HER NECK

556
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,458
This will get rid of neck wrinkles.

557
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:52,097
I feel like I should say "Happy New Year"
while watching this.

558
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:53,865
ENTRANCED…

559
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,267
It's Christmas in summer.

560
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:00,839
Is it just me,
or are the lights flickering faster?

561
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:02,774
It definitely got faster.

562
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,015
They're going up.

563
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:11,716
THE 5-MINUTE WHITE EIFFEL EVENT

564
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,752
OH~

565
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,087
That was the White Eiffel event.

566
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:16,988
Cool, right?

567
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,890
I had no idea they did this.

568
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,659
It's a first for me too.

569
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:22,394
OBVIOUSLY WANTING MORE

570
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,895
THE WHITE EIFFEL BRINGS THE DAY
TO A BEAUTIFUL END

571
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:24,863
What a day.

572
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:28,366
Why don't we do a briefing
on the whole day today?

573
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:30,235
What did you enjoy the most?

574
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,470
The most?

575
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:32,637
Of all the things we did today.

576
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,474
My favorite moment was
when we visited Monet's garden.

577
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:39,411
If I could be reborn,
I'd like a happy life like Monet's,

578
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,147
painting what I love in a space

579
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:45,283
I can call my own.
In that moment, I was jealous.

580
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:48,320
Was this his studio?

581
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:51,289
MONET'S HOUSE AND GARDEN
THEY VISITED EARLIER THAT DAY

582
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:52,757
It's so pretty.

583
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,759
Is that Monet's boat?

584
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,628
I've always wanted a boat like that.

585
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:57,529
I want that boat.

586
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,264
I'm so jealous.

587
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:06,905
MONET CAPTURED
HIS OWN SPACE ON CANVAS

588
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,240
Can you imagine the joy?

589
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:11,643
He must've been so happy.

590
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,711
-While he painted?
-Yes.

591
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:14,212
Absolutely.

592
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,983
-I also enjoyed his favorite restaurant.
-Me too.

593
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:20,051
-I loved that street.
-Same.

594
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:22,120
-The Écoles Cinema Club was also great.
-Right.

595
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:25,790
It was fun to watch
the other people in the theater.

596
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:29,895
That's one of the best things
about going to a theater.

597
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:33,398
Whether it's a comedy or something funny,

598
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:36,301
instead of laughing alone
and being done with it,

599
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,671
the joy doubles
when you share it with others.

600
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:41,873
Since the movie was in English,

601
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:44,075
it took us longer to understand, but…

602
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:45,110
GIGGLING

603
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:46,845
-We couldn't do anything about that.
-Right.

604
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:50,181
We were half a beat late
getting the humor.

605
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,385
In any case, it was an eventful day.

606
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:54,986
-Let's go.
-Sure.

607
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,054
LET'S HEAD TO THE HOTEL

608
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:57,589
Bye.

609
00:25:58,456 --> 00:25:59,624
You were stunning.

610
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:00,759
What a view.

611
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,129
Today gave us a taste of every season.

612
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:06,164
We even got to enjoy Christmas.

613
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:09,801
We enjoyed a touch of fall today.

614
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,070
Tomorrow will feel like midsummer, right?

615
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:13,004
Of course.

616
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,813
DAY BREAKS
ON THE LAST DAY IN PARIS

617
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:28,620
AN ENERGETIC MORNING
IN CENTRAL PARIS

618
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:30,722
It's cold.

619
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,157
It's a little chilly today.

620
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,826
It might be because it's early,
but the air is cool.

621
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:38,296
Unlike yesterday, today is cloudier.

622
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,165
Shall we?

623
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:41,967
WHAT ADVENTURES LIE AHEAD
FOR THEM TODAY?

624
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:43,668
HOTEL, A 30-MINUTE DRIVE,
CAFÉ DES DEUX MOULINS

625
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:47,472
The weather is gloomier than usual today.

626
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:49,574
It's always like that
on the last day of a trip.

627
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:50,475
That's true.

628
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,410
They want us to stay and come back.

629
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:56,448
Even though it's our last day,
we'll make it worthwhile.

630
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:58,116
We'll have even more fun than yesterday.

631
00:26:58,183 --> 00:26:59,918
Right now, we're headed

632
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:01,486
to the cafe featured in Amélie.

633
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:05,256
Jean, how old were you
when you watched Amélie?

634
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:07,626
When did it come out again?

635
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:09,894
Is that when you watched it?

636
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,197
No, I watched it years later.

637
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:14,966
Let's see. It came out in 2001.

638
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:16,635
WAS RELEASED IN 2001

639
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,103
I was in middle school.

640
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,170
That was a long time ago.

641
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:23,141
For the college interview at my school,

642
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,243
many of my friends talked
about the director,

643
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,078
-Jean-Pierre Jeunet.
-How so?

644
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,413
As their favorite movie director.

645
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,882
He had a unique style.

646
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:32,050
Did they talk about Amélie?

647
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:34,386
Amélie and Delicatessen.

648
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:36,655
When you see his films,

649
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:39,424
you can tell they're his
because of his distinctive style.

650
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,394
Although Amélie is generally
a sweet movie,

651
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,928
there's something a bit bizarre about it.

652
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,563
-That's true.
-You know what I mean.

653
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:50,135
What I loved about Amélie is how the story
revolves around the little things in life.

654
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:51,102
The small moments of happiness.

655
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,570
That's all it takes to be happy,

656
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,272
and it made me realize
how little it really takes.

657
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:57,375
[PLOT OF ]

658
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:59,444
SHY AMÉLIE WORKS
AS A WAITRESS IN A CAFE

659
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:04,582
SHE FOUND JOY IN GOOD DEEDS
AND MADE THEM HER MISSION

660
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:06,251
I can't dance to music like this.

661
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:09,621
Marthe, come on. Join me.

662
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,724
Just like Amélie, let's do

663
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:15,827
-a few good deeds today.
-I'd like that.

664
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:18,763
In the movie, she found her own happiness

665
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,532
-by helping others.
-Exactly.

666
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,769
This is the Pont Alexandre III.

667
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:28,540
Pont Alexandre III?

668
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:33,011
PONT ALEXANDRE III
A BRIDGE THAT CROSSES THE SEINE

669
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:35,447
KNOWN AS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
AND INTRICATE IN ALL OF PARIS

670
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:43,154
-Look, they're taking wedding photos!
-That's beautiful.

671
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,827
Wow, that's so cool.

672
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:49,994
Wedding photos on a bridge?

673
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,665
Are they called maids?

674
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:54,766
You mean, bridesmaids?

675
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,334
The friends next to the bride.

676
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,536
-They're bridesmaids.
-Bridesmaids.

677
00:28:58,603 --> 00:28:59,437
Have you been one?

678
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:02,307
I appeared in a friend's
wedding photos once.

679
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:03,341
What about at the wedding?

680
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:06,277
Do the friends dress up
for the actual wedding as well?

681
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:08,179
I haven't had that chance.

682
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:11,049
I was a bridesmaid
at a friend's wedding once,

683
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,018
and it was just as bizarre as that movie.

684
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,287
LAUGHING

685
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:18,323
I had to wear a green dress.

686
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:19,724
I felt like

687
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:24,028
I was a fairy in one of his films,
but too old for the part.

688
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,631
-How many bridesmaids were there?
-Two.

689
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,566
-And you both wore green dresses?
-Yes.

690
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:29,768
Some time ago,

691
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:32,604
a producer friend of mine

692
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:37,542
asked Na-rae and me to perform
the wedding song at his ceremony.

693
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,879
Since it was a joyful event,
we were both honored to sing for him.

694
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,548
We performed Blue in Your Heart as a duet.

695
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,383
Despite both of us being eager,

696
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:48,419
we couldn't quite hit all the notes.

697
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:50,955
A few odd notes slipped out

698
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:52,724
as we sang.

699
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:55,593
We couldn't sing in harmony at all,

700
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,861
and I felt terrible.

701
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:59,731
Those strange bits in beautiful moments

702
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,132
-are what we love.
-Exactly.

703
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:02,867
We seek them out on purpose

704
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:03,935
and enjoy them.

705
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,670
KOREAN AMÉLIES WHO LOVE
THE STRANGE WITHIN THE BEAUTIFUL

706
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:06,704
Merci.

707
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:08,473
BEFORE THEY KNOW IT,
THEY ARRIVE AT THE CAFE

708
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,541
Geez.

709
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,845
NICE~

710
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:15,480
The buildings are stunning!

711
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,582
-Is that the Moulin Rouge?
-That's right.

712
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:23,855
THE MOULIN ROUGE,
A HISTORIC CABARET IN PARIS

713
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,156
I stayed around here once.

714
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:26,658
-Over there.
-Where?

715
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:29,427
I stayed right across
from the Moulin Rouge.

716
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,095
It must be a familiar place.

717
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,398
-I wouldn't say "familiar," but--
-I was only here two days.

718
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:34,766
Still, you must recognize it.

719
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,935
Did they have these back then?

720
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,269
-Yes.
-These shops?

721
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:42,340
Here it is.

722
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:45,009
Is this where Amélie worked as a waitress
in the movie?

723
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,445
She probably came to work
around this time each day.

724
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:50,782
CAFÉ DES DEUX MOULINS

725
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,217
Gosh, I love the colors.

726
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:55,920
HALT

727
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:57,989
(AFTER YOU ^^)

728
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,257
How was that?

729
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:00,558
-That was me being kind.
-Good deed.

730
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:02,493
There's a photo of Amélie.

731
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,562
-Wow.
-You had that hairstyle once, right?

732
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:10,001
AN EXTRAVAGANT INTERIOR
BEHIND THE DOORS

733
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:13,972
TRACES OF  CAN BE FOUND
AROUND THE CAFE

734
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:14,906
Over here.

735
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:16,441
We can sit over here.

736
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:18,376
THEY SIT AT A SUNLIT WINDOW TABLE

737
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:20,011
Bonjour.

738
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:21,079
-Bonjour.
-Bonjour.

739
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,848
FASCINATED

740
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:26,251
Want to see a cat selling fruit?

741
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:27,252
Where is it?

742
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,487
Isn't it adorable?

743
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,522
-It's trudging around the stall.
-It's adorable.

744
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:33,358
Aren't the chairs beautiful?

745
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:34,392
Everything's pretty.

746
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:35,593
WHAT WILL THEY ORDER?

747
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:37,896
-There's something we should try.
-What is it?

748
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:39,230
-The creme brulee.
-Sure.

749
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:40,431
I'll have that too.

750
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:41,733
Here it is.

751
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:43,801
It's called the Amélie.

752
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:44,869
You're right.

753
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:47,672
It's Amélie's creme brulee. How cute.

754
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,474
THE WAITER SEEMS BUSY

755
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,209
Let's look at him until he notices us.

756
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:52,377
Here he comes.

757
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,446
He's an actor.

758
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:57,115
What, an actor?

759
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:01,519
SMILE

760
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:03,388
Wait.

761
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:12,363
He must be an aspiring actor.

762
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:13,831
GAZING

763
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:17,268
SHY

764
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:29,013
Got it.

765
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:29,914
Merci.

766
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,287
No wonder. He has that look about him.

767
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:39,924
A SHORT MOMENT
THAT FELT LIKE A MOVIE

768
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:41,559
Should I have said I'm an actor too?

769
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,161
CHUCKLING

770
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:45,496
-I missed my timing, didn't I?
-We'll tell him later.

771
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:47,999
He doesn't seem that interested.
What if he's like, "So what?"

772
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:50,068
He cut us off with "Tell me."

773
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:52,070
He just told us to order.

774
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:53,671
I won't tell him, then.

775
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:56,407
It's a good deed not to say things
people don't want to hear.

776
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,479
STARING

777
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,983
That man at the bar in the hat
looks so cool.

778
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:07,318
(AGREEING)

779
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:08,519
He's like someone in a movie.

780
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:10,254
A GENTLEMAN STRAIGHT OUT OF A MOVIE

781
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,590
We're the ones in front of the camera,

782
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,525
yet it's the others
who look like movie stars.

783
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:20,865
He looks like Joe Pesci
from Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas.

784
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,433
Do I have a thing for Joe Pesci?

785
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,006
THE DRINKS ARRIVE AS THEY MARVEL

786
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:32,610
-Geez.
-Merci.

787
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,412
Look at this glass cup.

788
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,948
-Look, isn't it pretty?
-It is.

789
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:39,283
THE CREME BRULEE IS SERVED RIGHT AWAY

790
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:42,820
Ta-da.

791
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,661
-Merci.
-It has to cool down to harden.

792
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:52,096
Right.

793
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:53,197
It's so pretty.

794
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:55,166
I didn't know it'd be this big.

795
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:56,067
-This?
-Yes.

796
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:57,802
-Let's crack it together.
-Sure.

797
00:33:58,669 --> 00:33:59,871
How do you do it? Like this?

798
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:01,806
Anyway we want, I guess.

799
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:05,309
Cracking the top layer is always fun.

800
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,911
THE CARAMELIZED SUGAR CRACKS

801
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:09,113
How crunchy would it be?

802
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,615
THEY EACH TAKE A SPOONFUL

803
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:12,483
CHEERS

804
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:16,054
It's not that sweet.

805
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:17,522
What?

806
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:18,956
It's not that sweet.

807
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,325
It's good.

808
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:25,329
I haven't had pudding this thick before.

809
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,364
Isn't it a pudding?

810
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:27,465
ANOTHER BITE RIGHT AWAY

811
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:28,966
This is like steamed eggs.

812
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:30,268
That's what I was about to say.

813
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:31,903
Isn't it just like steamed eggs?

814
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:32,804
Yes.

815
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:34,939
AFTER TAKING A BITE
OF THE CREME BRULEE,

816
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,107
SHE SIPS HER EARL GREY TEA

817
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:38,042
Now, this.

818
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,745
DO-YEON TAKES A SIP
OF HER CAPPUCCINO

819
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,647
It's so good.

820
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:44,916
This is the perfect combo.

821
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:46,017
MARRIAGE OF COFFEE,
TEA & DESSERT

822
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:46,918
It's really good.

823
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:49,454
I wonder if Amélie would be doing well.

824
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,189
WOULD AMÉLIE BE DOING WELL
FOR HERSELF?

825
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,890
She'd be around 50.

826
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:55,426
-Over 50.
-She might be overwhelmed by the happiness

827
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:58,129
returned to her
for all the good she's done.

828
00:34:58,196 --> 00:34:59,630
COULD BE LIVING
IN GREATER JOY AS A REWARD

829
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:01,732
I also like that movie

830
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:03,434
starring Audrey Tautou.

831
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:05,770
-Do you know the movie, La Délicatesse?
-I don't.

832
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:07,705
The movie is so cute.

833
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,609
There's a guy who falls
for Audrey Tautou's character,

834
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,578
and they kiss before really getting

835
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,747
to know each other. That's why
the Korean title is Starts With a Kiss.

836
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:19,050
Lucky her.

837
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,151
Did you say it'd be moist?

838
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:21,986
-I said, "Lucky her."
-Oh, I see.

839
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:23,754
EMBARRASSED

840
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:25,356
I bet it was a little moist but sweet.

841
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:30,728
Still, there must've been
a signal between them

842
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,530
-to kiss like that.
-Of course.

843
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:36,033
There must've been nonverbal cues,
and that's what they noticed.

844
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,438
Were there any times
when you mistook one of those?

845
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:41,506
Many.

846
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,977
There were more than a couple
of embarrassing moments.

847
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:47,778
Has that ever happened to you too?

848
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:51,983
Back in college, classes were filled
with students from different departments.

849
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:54,652
Whenever someone liked my assignments,

850
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:57,522
I told my friends they had a crush on me.

851
00:35:57,588 --> 00:36:00,791
My friends told me to cut it out,
so I grew past that awkward phase.

852
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:02,560
That phase of my life is behind me too.

853
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,762
We had to go through that phase.

854
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,931
Otherwise,
we'd still be misreading compliments.

855
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:11,135
It's good that we're able to know
where we stand.

856
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:13,204
Let's say you're in your twenties,

857
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:14,672
-living in France.
-In this time?

858
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,375
-Which part-time job would you get?
-Me?

859
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:20,745
I love bread so much,

860
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:22,313
-So a bakery?
-I always have some for breakfast.

861
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,983
After graduating from high school,
I worked at a franchise bakery in Korea.

862
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:27,652
That's how much I love bread.

863
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:30,721
-People who come in to buy bread…
-They're in a good mood.

864
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:32,256
…are always in a good mood.

865
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:35,126
They're cheerful
when they come to buy cake.

866
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,461
It was a lot of work, but I had fun.

867
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,463
One of the toughest tasks

868
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,798
was preparing

869
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,868
over 100 cakes on Christmas Eve.

870
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:45,169
Almost all of them were sold.

871
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:46,137
Did you bake the cakes?

872
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,940
The cakes came in almost ready to sell,

873
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:51,943
and we decorated them with syrup
to make them look appealing,

874
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:53,611
topping them with fruit
on the whipped cream.

875
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:55,813
I glazed the cakes with syrup,
put cherries on top,

876
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,848
boxed them, and sent them out.

877
00:36:57,915 --> 00:37:02,019
It was like all the locals
came to our bakery to buy cakes.

878
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:05,223
Anyway, I was cleaning up,
getting ready to close for the night,

879
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:08,192
when the boy I liked came in to buy a cake

880
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:09,594
with his girlfriend.

881
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:11,963
I considered

882
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:14,398
smushing one of the decorative cherries.

883
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:17,034
-You still seem bitter about it.
-Of course.

884
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:19,103
I was going through a tough time,

885
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,105
but then I saw
that he had a new girlfriend.

886
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,774
The girl was pointing out
the cakes to him,

887
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:25,743
and there I was, glazing one.

888
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:29,547
A BITTER FEELING

889
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:30,915
Which part-time job would you get?

890
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:35,119
-Me?
-Here is Yi Ok-seop in her twenties

891
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:36,120
living in Paris.

892
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:39,590
I'd like to work
at the nearby Moulin Rouge,

893
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:40,858
in the ticket office.

894
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,159
I could work the booth.

895
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:44,462
Wouldn't that be cool?

896
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:48,633
Remember the guy
at the Écoles Cinema Club?

897
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:50,601
-The ticket booth employee?
-He was so cool.

898
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:53,738
Usually at the theater,

899
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:55,773
they check tickets like this,

900
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,075
though now it's all done with bar codes.

901
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:00,311
But this is how cool that guy was.

902
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,179
He was like this.

903
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:04,582
CHIC

904
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:07,418
He was wonderful.

905
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:09,754
RELAXED

906
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,356
I thought about working
at the ticket office

907
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:15,626
while studying to become
a musical director someday.

908
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:17,862
But since I'm still in my twenties,

909
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:19,764
I'd probably be doing…

910
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,999
Doing menial tasks,
but you'd still following your dreams.

911
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:25,069
I pictured myself dreaming of being
just like the people I work for.

912
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,605
-That's why a job at CGV…
-Did you work there?

913
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,073
No, but I really wanted to.

914
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,476
I admired the part-timers
at movie theaters

915
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,913
-simply because I loved movies so much.
-Really?

916
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,983
This was a treat.

917
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,818
THEY'VE POLISHED OFF
THE CREME BRULEE

918
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:42,920
-I'm not too full, just right.
-Exactly.

919
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,655
It's not a bad idea to start the day

920
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:45,790
-with dessert.
-I know.

921
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:47,058
I've never done that before.

922
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:48,292
A SATISFYING MORNING DESSERT

923
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,294
We're now off to Montmartre.

924
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:52,063
HEADING FOR MONTMARTRE
BEFORE THEY'RE LATE

925
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:54,065
At the end of this trip,

926
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:57,535
will we want to come back someday,

927
00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:59,203
or will we think

928
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,806
this is our last time in France?

929
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:04,375
The last day of a trip

930
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:06,911
-is never just fun.
-I agree.

931
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:08,245
We keep thinking we're leaving soon.

932
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:10,915
We forget all the fun we had
once we leave.

933
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:13,417
It's always a bummer.

934
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:14,518
I'm reminded of

935
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,854
when we went to Japan together.

936
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:19,457
It's always bittersweet on the last day,

937
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,826
so even though we still had one more day,

938
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:23,194
we agreed to drag our suitcases around…

939
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:26,130
-To trick ourselves.
-…pretending it was our last.

940
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:28,833
We need to trick our brains.

941
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:30,267
Yes, and that's what we did.

942
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:31,769
We agreed to bring our suitcases,

943
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:33,804
but decided not to since they were heavy.

944
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:36,374
ATTENTIVELY

945
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,580
There was a sanitation worker

946
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:44,315
with stunning red hair.

947
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:47,017
Everyone here is unique in their own way.

948
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:49,086
That's why it's a joy to watch the people.

949
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:54,458
PARIS, A CITY EXUDING ROMANCE
AND INDIVIDUAL CHARM

950
00:39:57,194 --> 00:39:58,763
BEFORE THEY KNOW IT,
THEY FIND THEMSELVES AT MONTMARTRE

951
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:00,664
Who's that person in white?

952
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:02,666
In white clothes?

953
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,002
-Is that a person or a statue?
-Isn't it the KFC Colonel?

954
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,071
Isn't it moving?

955
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:09,140
Aren't his clothes flapping in the wind?

956
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:11,175
-I think it's a statue.
-Is it?

957
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:13,477
-Hey!
-What is it?

958
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:15,546
We can see the whole city from here.

959
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,214
No way.

960
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:19,316
-Let's head down there.
-Sweet.

961
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:21,552
THE WHOLE OF PARIS
CAN BE SEEN ALL AT ONCE

962
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:24,822
I was told
this is the highest point in Paris.

963
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:28,025
MONTMARTRE, THE HIGHEST POINT IN PARIS

964
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:30,528
Let's head over there.

965
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:32,997
No way.

966
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:35,132
How refreshing is this?

967
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,500
It's a panoramic view.

968
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:37,902
We would've regretted not coming here.

969
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:40,004
JAW DROPPING-

970
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,672
What a view.

971
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,408
-See the water down here?
-Where?

972
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:45,910
Is it a lake?

973
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:47,445
-No, not a lake but--
-A fountain.

974
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,848
It's soothing to listen to the fountain.

975
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:53,284
-Everything about this is beautiful.
-Tell me about it.

976
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,853
ENJOYING THE VIEW

977
00:40:58,155 --> 00:40:59,190
It's pretty.

978
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,460
-See the carousel over there?
-Right.

979
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:04,562
There's even a carousel.

980
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:05,696
You can see it rotating.

981
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:08,132
THE CAROUSEL ADDS
A TOUCH OF ROMANCE

982
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:11,368
-The church.
-Yeah, the church.

983
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:13,003
What was its name again?

984
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:15,239
The Basilique du Sacré-Cœur de Montmartre.

985
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,740
-Let's look inside.
-We can see inside.

986
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:19,810
-I love churches. They're beautiful.
-Me too.

987
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:22,480
-You were baptized and named.
-I'm Justina.

988
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:23,981
-Yes, Justina.
-Right.

989
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:26,717
If you were given a Christian name,

990
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,385
Christina would be perfect for you.

991
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:29,286
Then,

992
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:32,523
shouldn't I talk like this?
"I'll pray today."

993
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:34,325
LAUGHING

994
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:36,694
In Korean variety shows, being Christina

995
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,062
means having that voice.

996
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:40,631
I also like Glara as a name.

997
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:41,999
Glara? Do you mean Clara?

998
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:43,367
-No, Glara.
-Is it Glara?

999
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:44,468
I've never heard of it.

1000
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:47,771
-Our dads have the same Christian name.
-That's right.

1001
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:48,939
Petro.

1002
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,574
-I'm simply Petro's daughter.
-Right.

1003
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:53,744
People are waiting in line.

1004
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:54,645
Where?

1005
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:57,281
The line's really long.

1006
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,315
I know.

1007
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,151
-This must be the schedule.
-You're right.

1008
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:02,686
"Saturday, 7 a.m."

1009
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:05,122
There's mass at 11 a.m.

1010
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:07,791
And one at 10 p.m.

1011
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:11,662
Are they all waiting in line
to enter the church for mass?

1012
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:15,499
They must be a mix of locals
and tourists here for mass.

1013
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:16,901
LOCALS AND TOURISTS ALIKE
ARE WAITING FOR MASS

1014
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:18,836
How amazing.

1015
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:20,571
ENTERING THE CHURCH ISN'T EASY
AS IT'S A POPULAR DESTINATION

1016
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:22,006
It's a bummer but…

1017
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:24,575
Maybe next time.

1018
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:26,343
Will we get another chance?

1019
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:28,445
BUMMER,
BUT PERHAPS ANOTHER TIME

1020
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:30,848
Do we still have time to look around?

1021
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:33,651
How about we hang a friendship padlock?

1022
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:34,952
How? What do you mean?

1023
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,755
We'll get a padlock and hang it there.

1024
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:38,789
Sure.

1025
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,325
Do you take card?

1026
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,393
Let's buy this one.

1027
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:43,694
-They don't accept credit cards.
-Really?

1028
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:45,462
We'll hang an invisible one then.

1029
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:47,164
Sure. I'll pretend to have one.

1030
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,766
We don't need to add another one.

1031
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:50,568
There are already so many here.

1032
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:52,102
-Another good deed.
-Over here.

1033
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:53,704
-You hang it, and I'll lock it.
-Sure.

1034
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:55,573
I can't get it to latch on.

1035
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,274
Just a second.

1036
00:42:58,142 --> 00:42:59,543
There. I got it.

1037
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:01,378
What did you write on it?

1038
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:03,080
May our friendship last forever.

1039
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:06,850
-It's locked in place.
-Bye.

1040
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,218
-Let's go.
-Sure.

1041
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:09,520
Only those who are kind can see it.

1042
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:10,688
FOR OUR EVERLASTING FRIENDSHIP

1043
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:13,290
The name of this place
sounds like the one I wanted.

1044
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:14,191
Marthe.

1045
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,593
That's right. Marthe.

1046
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:16,827
Yes, Marthe.

1047
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:17,995
Today, I'm a dreamer.

1048
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:20,965
-The guy from the movie?
-I can't remember his name.

1049
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:22,866
Mr. Dreamer.

1050
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,668
FOUR NIGHTS OF A DREAMER (1971)

1051
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:28,038
Why do you think the male lead
fell in love with Marthe?

1052
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:33,010
Whether it was that male lead or not
doesn't matter.

1053
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:35,879
Marthe just wasn't emotionally available.

1054
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:36,880
Right.

1055
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,183
But those are the kinds of people
everyone chases after.

1056
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:40,784
-It's amusing, isn't it?
-It is.

1057
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:43,253
Wait, it moved!

1058
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:45,089
See? I was right.

1059
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:46,924
I saw him move.

1060
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:48,993
If you give him money…

1061
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:50,094
-He'll move.
-Right.

1062
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:52,696
Thanks to them, we get to see him move.

1063
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,199
-No way.
-Look.

1064
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:56,300
-Wow.
-I'm amazed.

1065
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:57,701
He made sure he'd be comfortable

1066
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:59,203
by wearing Crocs.

1067
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:03,207
Right? He'll be on his feet for a while,
so he should be comfortable.

1068
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,776
If we hadn't seen him up close,

1069
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:08,078
we would've thought the statue was gone.

1070
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,079
Once he got off work.

1071
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:13,217
There must've been something
he needed to get from his pocket.

1072
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:14,852
When he lifted his robe,

1073
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:16,520
I saw he had pink pants on.

1074
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:18,656
-Pink shorts.
-Really?

1075
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:20,057
That's cute.

1076
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:22,626
MR. STATUE IN PINK SHORTS
WATCHING OVER MONTMARTRE

1077
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:24,395
SNIFFING

1078
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:26,597
I don't know if it's ammonia I'm smelling.

1079
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,599
That's from people who urinated

1080
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,200
after drinking too much.

1081
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:33,437
I'm sure the smell is strong
because it's built up over time.

1082
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:35,472
Such a beautiful city,

1083
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:36,974
but it reeks.

1084
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:38,108
I like this stuff.

1085
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:39,543
It reminds me of Amélie.

1086
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:41,345
BEAUTIFUL YET QUIRKY MONTMARTRE
CHARMING LIKE

1087
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:43,714
Today, we'll be kind to others

1088
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:47,351
and find the bizarre in what's beautiful.
We'll search for the stench.

1089
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:50,087
We might be able
to spot the beauty in that.

1090
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:52,489
I think that combination
is what makes it charming.

1091
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:53,624
That's so true.

1092
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:57,561
I grew even fonder of Mr. Statue
after seeing him in pink shorts.

1093
00:44:57,628 --> 00:44:59,363
-That and the Crocs.
-Right.

1094
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:02,399
Why do we find those little details
so charming?

1095
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:05,269
Rather than being perfect,
everyone needs a bit of a silly side.

1096
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:08,872
Maybe it's because we need a few flaws

1097
00:45:08,939 --> 00:45:10,307
to be more approachable.

1098
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,277
Perfect people just aren't as charming.

1099
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:18,215
WHAT KIND OF QUIRKY
AND BEAUTIFUL THINGS

1100
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:20,651
AWAIT THEM NEXT WEEK?

1101
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,253
We're super lucky.

1102
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:25,222
We're always fortunate on trips.

1103
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:28,392
-To eating, drinking, and friendship.
-Friendship.

1104
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:30,127
EVERYTHING WILL
COME TRUE

1105
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:32,096
-The doors to a new world open.
-I know.

1106
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:34,465
We're at Pont Neuf,
the place we'd only heard about.

1107
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:37,634
I have a new dream.

1108
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:38,902
I want that for my wedding.

1109
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:41,505
Isn't there a restaurant
from a movie you enjoyed?

1110
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,006
Yes, from Me Before You.

1111
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,875
I remember seeing it from this angle.

1112
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:47,344
I'd only seen this cafe in a movie,

1113
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:48,612
and now I'm here.

1114
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:49,947
I can't wait.

1115
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:51,515
You absolutely love Balzac.

1116
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,584
It's like going
to a friend's birthday party.

1117
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,753
OK-SEOP'S FAVORITE NOVELIST

1118
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:57,054
Wait. There's Balzac.

1119
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:59,123
FACING BALZAC!

1120
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:00,090
That's so cute.

1121
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:01,024
LOOKED AROUND HIS WORKROOM~!

1122
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,160
His desk is so small.
I sort of knew it would be.

1123
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:04,394
I never even dreamed of this.

1124
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:06,063
TOUCHED

1125
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,064
Keep saying it out loud.

1126
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:08,499
That way, it'll come true.

1127
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:09,733
That's crazy.

1128
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,268
It can't be.

1129
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:13,303
-Tell me this isn't lucky.
-Just live long enough.

1130
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:14,204
FINAL STORY IN PARIS

1131
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:15,973
A Square's Dream.

1132
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:17,941
Today, it's a square.
Yesterday, it was Monet.

1133
