1
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:05,839
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,443
BY A POND SURROUNDED
BY THE FRAGRANT SMELL OF GRASS

3
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:15,882
WHERE 10 MILLION LOTUS FLOWERS
STRETCH OUT LIKE A SEA OF GREEN

4
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,620
I didn't think it'd be this spacious.

5
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:24,024
Here's the theme I chose for today's trip.

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,959
I bring you Neighborhood.

7
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:29,062
Today, I greet you in Buyeo.

8
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,130
My gosh.

9
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:31,998
With the sun out,

10
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:34,134
the day couldn't be better.

11
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,503
TODAY'S DESTINATION

12
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:38,371
BUYEO, SOUTH CHUNGCHEONG PROVINCE

13
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,641
THE CAPITAL OF BAEKJE
WHERE HISTORY LIVES AND BREATHES

14
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:45,645
LOOK FORWARD TO A TRIP
THAT'LL GO DOWN IN THE SHOW'S HISTORY

15
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,047
PORYONGJEONG

16
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,784
A BACHELOR APPEARS AT PORYONGJEONG,
FAN IN HAND

17
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:55,488
THE SHY TRAVEL BUDDY HIDES BEHIND A FAN

18
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,393
Hello. Bound for a breezy break
with bundles of stories in my bag…

19
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,694
Is this okay?

20
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:03,163
Aren't they too loud?

21
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,898
Sorry about that.

22
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,635
Hello. Bound for a breezy break
with bundles of stories in my bag.

23
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,703
I'm Jang Do-yeon
of Getaway and Go with Jangdobari.

24
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,740
Today, I greet you
from the heart of Buyeo's culture.

25
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,342
I'm in Buyeo.

26
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,410
Guys,

27
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:19,412
doesn't this scream nature to you?

28
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:20,580
What could be better, right?

29
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:22,682
Water, sunlight,

30
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,250
and trees.

31
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:26,486
Want to enjoy nature with me?

32
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:28,455
I can't only be the one
to connect with nature.

33
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:30,457
A travel buddy will join me today.

34
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:34,494
He's been rising in global popularity,

35
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,931
and even I'm wondering
how we got him on the show.

36
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:40,600
Though I call him a buddy,
we're basically strangers.

37
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,803
I've only seen him in passing
before today.

38
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:48,475
I'll be enjoying Buyeo today with him,

39
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:49,843
which excites me.

40
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:51,978
I'm a bit worried
things might be awkward, but…

41
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:54,848
Are these birds chirping?

42
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:56,015
Am I hearing birds?

43
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:57,150
Aren't those cicadas?

44
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,485
Cicadas?

45
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:01,554
We should feel bad for cicadas.

46
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:05,125
They endure so much just to be born,

47
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:07,193
only to die days later.

48
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,495
That's why…

49
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,165
The cicadas must have heard me
because they've gone quiet.

50
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,833
Because heart-to-heart connections exist,

51
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,301
we must always be nice.

52
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:16,503
Anyway,

53
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,805
let's go meet my travel buddy.

54
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:21,274
I'll head toward him
with a spring in my step.

55
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,676
How can she have so much energy

56
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,645
in the morning?

57
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,647
Unbelievable. I'm amazed.

58
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:31,718
He's standing in front
of the center of Poryongjeong.

59
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:35,822
Is he someone
who was meant to be in the center?

60
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,892
I'll make my way to him,
one step at a time.

61
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:43,429
Hey, there are fish in the pond!

62
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,498
I see fish.

63
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,536
FISH HAVE GATHERED TO GREET DO-YEON

64
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:52,972
I'm 40, an age
when I'm still fascinated by fish.

65
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,509
That's surprising.

66
00:02:58,244 --> 00:02:59,245
I don't see any over here.

67
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:00,947
Actually, I do. There are more fish.

68
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,749
SUCKING TEETH

69
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:06,653
She takes a step and reacts,
then takes another step and reacts again.

70
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,288
It'll take her forever to get here.

71
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,591
Look at the fine weather we have.

72
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,493
My travel buddy

73
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,330
isn't moving an inch
with his face hidden behind a fan.

74
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,799
How close do I have to get
for my travel buddy to budge?

75
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,501
Check out how cool he looks.

76
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:23,570
This feels like an ad.

77
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,273
It feels like an ad sponsored
by the Korea Tourism Organization.

78
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,476
RUNNING

79
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,811
Hello!

80
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,415
How long are you going to keep that fan
over your face?

81
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,749
I don't know.

82
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:39,552
You probably heard me
as I was crossing the bridge.

83
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,087
-I didn't.
-You didn't?

84
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,056
-It's good to meet you.
-The pleasure is mine.

85
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:45,024
EITHER WAY, IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU

86
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:49,295
YIM SI-WAN
ACTOR

87
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:54,334
FROM PORTRAYING A PSYCHOPATH KILLER
IN UNLOCKED

88
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,102
How do you memorize rap verses
with that brain of yours?

89
00:03:56,603 --> 00:04:00,673
TO PLAYING A VILLAIN THAT IS BOTH
GOOD AND BAD IN SQUID GAME 2 AND 3

90
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:05,945
THE ACTOR WHO ALWAYS DELIVERS, YIM SI-WAN

91
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:09,182
THIS TIME, HE RETURNS AS AN ASSASSIN
WHO KILLS OTHER ASSASSINS IN MANTIS

92
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:11,551
HE'S BEEN GAINING POPULARITY
FOR HIS SEXY AND STRIKING ACTION SCENES

93
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:13,253
What took you so long?

94
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,654
HOW WILL HE IMPRESS US ON THIS TRIP?

95
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:17,857
We've settled on a concept,
and the theme of this trip

96
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,126
is a walk through Buyeo with Yim Si-wan.

97
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,628
-Think of Neighborhood.
-Sure.

98
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,396
Things might seem awkward right now,

99
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,965
but that magical moment will hit
during the trip.

100
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:29,569
You'll find yourself
becoming comfortable around me

101
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,704
even before we're close,

102
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,674
sharing things
you never imagined you would.

103
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,376
-So don't you worry.
-Sounds good to me.

104
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:40,246
I've always wanted to get
to know you better,

105
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,215
and I hope this opportunity

106
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,983
will let us do that.

107
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,084
I like the sound of that.

108
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:48,187
It's good you have the fan because you can
cover your face when things get awkward.

109
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:51,624
I'll quickly go into mute mode

110
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:52,759
or something like that,

111
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:54,193
-so don't mind me.
-Sure thing.

112
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,428
I'll keep the fan for that.

113
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,929
Sounds good. I like it.

114
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:58,798
-Shall we get moving, then?
-Sure.

115
00:04:58,865 --> 00:04:59,932
Got it.

116
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:04,504
PORYONGJEONG

117
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,975
EPISODE 4
COME OUT AND PLAY: A WALK AROUND BUYEO

118
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,443
You dyed your hair, didn't you?

119
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,978
How did you know that?

120
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:14,447
It's pretty obvious.

121
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,349
That can't be your natural hair color.

122
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,584
-Is it for a new project?
-My new album.

123
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,654
I've been wanting to be a solo artist,

124
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:27,126
so I dyed my hair for the first time
in over a decade.

125
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:30,330
Since I kept working
on acting projects back to back,

126
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:33,299
I couldn't change my hair color.

127
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,368
It's been over a decade
since I last dyed my hair

128
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,736
after bleaching it.

129
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,905
-That's a bold move.
-I know.

130
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,541
Could you tell us about the album

131
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:45,311
without giving away any spoilers?

132
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:48,581
The songs I've recorded for the album

133
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:52,752
will be easy for people
to sing along with.

134
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,354
Does that mean fewer high notes?

135
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,421
Well…

136
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,057
There are some high notes for my range,

137
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:02,061
but the melodies will be easy to remember.

138
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:07,200
I went with songs that fit that category.

139
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,935
Your fans will be thrilled.

140
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,437
-I hope they will be.
-Of course, they will.

141
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:14,741
We've gotten to see you a lot as an actor,

142
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,542
but not much as a singer recently.

143
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,444
It's been a while for me too.

144
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,380
-You must've enjoyed it.
-Right.

145
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,182
-This must be it.
-Here.

146
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:24,450
-It is.
-This is it.

147
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:25,518
You throw in a coin and…

148
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,420
LOTUS FLOWERS THAT GRANT WISHES
WHEN COINS ARE THROWN IN

149
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:28,721
Coins are quite rare these days.

150
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:30,523
How many would you like?

151
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,627
Me? I think I'll need more than a few.
The flowers are pretty far away.

152
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,930
The coin has to make it in
one of those lotus flowers.

153
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:39,198
Do you have a wish?

154
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:40,299
-A wish?
-Yes.

155
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:43,069
-Here's something I want to share.
-What is it?

156
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,872
Though I don't seem like it,

157
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:49,475
people around me say
my personality is a little unusual.

158
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:54,180
The things I'm into are
on the quirkier and nonsensical side.

159
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,681
That's why I hope,

160
00:06:55,748 --> 00:07:00,453
while spending this day with you,
you'll understand my vibes

161
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,588
throughout this trip
even if it's just a show.

162
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,890
I see.

163
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,324
I hope you'll get me.

164
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:08,995
-You want me to get your vibes.
-That's right.

165
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:11,464
-Sounds good.
-I think my vibes are pretty out there.

166
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:12,532
-Really?
-Yes.

167
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,234
Now I'm curious. Okay, got it.

168
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,302
What will you wish for?

169
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,470
My wish?

170
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:20,306
As long as the camera's on you,

171
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:24,076
you'll just say good things
no matter how you feel.

172
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:28,815
That's why I hope you don't say
"I told you I didn't want to do this"

173
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:31,517
to your manager when you're alone.

174
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:34,220
You know what I mean, right?

175
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,388
-I do.
-I hope there won't be

176
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,323
a single moment like that
during this trip.

177
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,424
Got it.

178
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:39,992
-That seems easy enough.
-Here we go.

179
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,595
-They're pretty far away.
-They're far away.

180
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,564
Let me get it to bounce.

181
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,166
FLING

182
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,468
IT BOUNCED OFF THE RIM

183
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:49,802
This isn't easy.

184
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,804
I know, but we're good
since we have all these coins.

185
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,673
DO-YEON'S UP NEXT

186
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,008
Be good and land in there.

187
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:58,945
It's harder than I thought.

188
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:00,246
It'll go in this time.

189
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,382
-That was close.
-It's all in the attitude. It'll go in.

190
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,017
-Here we go. Two, three.
-You're right.

191
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,085
It's all in the attitude.

192
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:07,653
BOUNCING OFF

193
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,523
-The attitude.
-Believe you'll make it.

194
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,691
It'll go in. I know it.

195
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:12,892
That's the spirit. Like in Squid Game!

196
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,160
-No!
-Here I go.

197
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,528
-It'll go in.
-I got it.

198
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,931
THE LAST COIN BOUNCED OUT OF THE FLOWER

199
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,100
SERIOUSLY…

200
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,535
Now I'm pissed.

201
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:24,270
The last one almost made it.

202
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,172
-Hold on.
-It…

203
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,640
-I'll get us some pebbles.
-Sure.

204
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,442
-Let's not leave until we get it.
-Right.

205
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,811
-I'm competitive about these things.
-Sounds good. Same here.

206
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,814
-Do you like games like this? I do.
-I believe in things like this.

207
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,349
For me, it triggers

208
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,317
-my competitive side.
-Your competitive side?

209
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:40,219
It's more like my desire
to accomplish something.

210
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:41,787
I don't necessarily want to win, but…

211
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:42,889
I found a pebble.

212
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,358
Did you? Okay, nice.

213
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,360
Okay, here goes.

214
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,762
BOUNCE

215
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,397
IT'S NOT EASY EVEN WITH PEBBLES

216
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:52,965
You did it!

217
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,033
FINALLY, ONE WENT IN

218
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,204
GUYS, I DID IT

219
00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:59,839
YOU ROCK, DO-YEON

220
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,374
SOMEWHAT OF A MANIC CELEBRATION

221
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,410
-That felt so good.
-Only I have to make it now.

222
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,213
WILL SI-WAN ALSO SUCCEED LIKE DO-YEON?

223
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:10,082
-You can do it. There are enough pebbles.
-Okay.

224
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,485
I'll aim for that flower over there.

225
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,353
-The green one.
-The green one?

226
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,855
Any one of those would be fine.

227
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:16,923
You think?

228
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,859
So close!

229
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,261
I didn't throw it far enough.

230
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:25,531
-Hey!
-I got it.

231
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,667
HE NEARLY FAILED BUT STILL SUCCEEDED!

232
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:31,437
GUYS, I SUCCEEDED TOO

233
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,139
EXPLODING WITH MADNESS

234
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,041
I got it.

235
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:36,175
I'm so happy.

236
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,677
-Okay.
-We're good now.

237
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:39,378
What a relief.

238
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:40,646
-That could've haunted us.
-I know.

239
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:45,651
A 22-MINUTE DRIVE FROM GUNGNAMJI POND
TO GARIMSEONG ZELKOVA TREE

240
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:49,655
How long has it been since
your most recent acting project ended?

241
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,692
It's been about half a year.

242
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,795
I've had work and other events
during that time,

243
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:58,331
including the premiere for Squid Game.

244
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:02,568
Once I finish working on my new album,

245
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,904
I'll be able to rest before it's released.

246
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,239
-Still, I went on that walk.
-Where?

247
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:11,377
I personally felt like
I was experiencing extreme burnout.

248
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,812
-When? Recently?
-Yes.

249
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,614
I worked for eight years
after my military discharge

250
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,816
without taking any breaks.

251
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:21,487
At one point, I couldn't even spare
the energy to meet other people.

252
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:24,390
I didn't have the energy
for even my close friends.

253
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,826
-The mind and body are connected.
-Exactly.

254
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:30,262
I knew something felt off,

255
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:34,033
so I decided
to stop seeing people altogether.

256
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,703
-I took the Way of Saint James pilgrimage.
-Really?

257
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,672
It took about 40 to 50 days.

258
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:40,806
-You went alone?
-Yes.

259
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,308
How was it?

260
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,410
For me,

261
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,678
it was amazing.

262
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:50,650
I was able to sort myself out
and shift into a new mindset.

263
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,619
Embarking on that walk

264
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:58,057
became a turning point in my life.

265
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:02,728
Have you always wanted to go
on that pilgrimage?

266
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,930
-Not at all.
-Did the idea suddenly hit you?

267
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:09,035
To me, travel was all about relaxing,
not wearing myself out.

268
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:10,603
-It's no easy feat.
-Exactly.

269
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,906
I never considered going there, but being
mentally exhausted changed my mind.

270
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,977
I heard about someone else's experience

271
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:21,180
and realized it was exactly what I needed.

272
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:25,618
What about that person's experience
spoke to you?

273
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:29,288
Apparently, one day,
they just decided to up and leave.

274
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,758
They struggled because of pouring rain,

275
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:35,261
and miles of walking gave them blisters,

276
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,063
but it was still a joy.

277
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:40,332
I was touched by how they felt free
even in hardship.

278
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,634
-They felt free?
-Yes.

279
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,835
"What am I hearing?"

280
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,904
"How can you feel free
when you're exhausted?"

281
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,674
The sleeping arrangements aren't ideal,
and you're surrounded by many people.

282
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,843
You have to stay in guesthouses, you see.

283
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,245
-Normally, that sounds like a nuisance.
-Right.

284
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:56,015
Everything's unfamiliar.
The people and your surroundings.

285
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:59,118
Still, they felt free
in the midst of all that.

286
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:02,521
It made me realize that there was
something special about the pilgrimage.

287
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,657
The entire route is 800 kilometers,

288
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,194
but I couldn't make it
all the way to the end.

289
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,330
I got hurt and even had to go
to the emergency room.

290
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,631
-You went to the ER?
-Yes.

291
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:14,300
Why? What happened?

292
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,502
My legs were so swollen

293
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,571
that I couldn't take a single step.

294
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:21,273
Both legs became swollen and red.

295
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,275
-From walking too much?
-Yes.

296
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,611
I thought it'd be easy
since all I had to do was walk.

297
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,948
While I was in Korea,
I worked hard to stay fit.

298
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:32,284
Although it was only 10 kilometers,
I ran regularly,

299
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,853
I boxed,

300
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,622
and I even trained
with a personal trainer.

301
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:39,525
I figured walking wouldn't be
a problem for me

302
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,527
and ended up overexerting myself.

303
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,897
I really wanted to finish the pilgrimage
in the time I had.

304
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:48,501
But without any warning,
my body just gave out.

305
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,637
Wasn't it scary getting injured
so far from home?

306
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:54,039
That was the moment I felt most liberated.

307
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,107
-How so?
-Oddly enough.

308
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,977
While I was in serious pain
and being hauled off to the ER,

309
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,880
I started to feel that sense of freedom.

310
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,649
-How ironic.
-I felt alive.

311
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,551
That sensation fascinated me.

312
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,621
The pain was so severe
that I couldn't even take

313
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,189
a single step,

314
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:13,559
but since I couldn't possibly
finish the pilgrimage,

315
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,195
my goal shifted to something new.

316
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,564
HE BROKE FREE OF HIS OBSESSION
TO FINISH THE WALK

317
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:23,903
Finally, I could tell myself to walk
only as much as I could manage.

318
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,939
I wasn't there to finish the pilgrimage

319
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:30,209
but to work through my mindset.

320
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,746
Only then could I define my real goal.

321
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,248
That's when I felt freedom inside me.

322
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,819
That was when I understood
why people make this pilgrimage.

323
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:44,490
It teaches you a lesson in that way.

324
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,058
How intriguing.

325
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,126
-Right?
-Yes.

326
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:52,198
In a way, I've saved
the last 300 kilometers for another time.

327
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:54,066
No way. That's so cool!

328
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,669
A day will come when I'll need
to go on the pilgrimage again.

329
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,506
You're right. You didn't fail but chose to
leave the 300 kilometers for another time.

330
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,377
-It was great.
-The Way of Saint James.

331
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:08,047
Even though this is only a one-day trip,

332
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,716
we try to make it more enjoyable
for both of us.

333
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,052
It's nothing fancy,
but we come up with a rule.

334
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:14,186
What rule?

335
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:15,421
For instance…

336
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,456
On my trip with Ga-bee,

337
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,359
since she's more energetic than I am--

338
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:21,861
She's more energetic than you are?

339
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,529
I set a speaking quota.

340
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:26,165
I said I would quit speaking
if the quota was exceeded.

341
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:27,600
That was the rule.

342
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,368
The rule ended up getting broken--

343
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,003
-I quite like that.
-Really?

344
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,072
Once I hit my speaking quota--

345
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,307
-Would you like to go quiet? Sure.
-Yes.

346
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,542
-That should be the rule.
-Really?

347
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:37,610
-Yes.
-Got it.

348
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,547
So this is how she must've felt.

349
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:42,882
I want to get you talking.

350
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:44,884
-Got it.
-Also,

351
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,919
I'd like you to speak to me casually.

352
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,053
I'm younger, after all.

353
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,121
-Got it.
-Good.

354
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,523
Can I speak casually as if I'm above you?

355
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,992
Sure.

356
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,394
-I'd like to be disrespected.
-Really?

357
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:58,397
-I don't draw any lines.
-Still, it's only for one day.

358
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:00,866
-You're right.
-It's just for today.

359
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,269
The beauty of this show is that
we start out knowing it'll end.

360
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,137
-We know that it'll end.
-Exactly.

361
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:08,073
Let that be your safety net
and talk as casually as you like.

362
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,676
Instead of it being just one-way,

363
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,579
you can be casual with me too,

364
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,514
-but I won't force it.
-Sure.

365
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,750
-Be understanding even if I seem awkward.
-Jeez.

366
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:18,851
Please be awkward.

367
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,152
FEEL FREE TO BE AWKWARD

368
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,655
Anyway, we're at our destination now.

369
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:24,857
Of all the possible destinations,

370
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,425
here's why we chose Buyeo.

371
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:30,162
This is the filming location
of a drama series you were in.

372
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,031
There's also this.

373
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,334
Didn't you come here to learn
the dialect for Boyhood?

374
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:36,402
Language training.

375
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:37,937
Yes, language training.

376
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,906
-It's key to pick up the native accent.
-Exactly.

377
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:43,108
That's why we came to Buyeo.

378
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:44,843
Maybe with this opportunity…

379
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,947
Just so you know,
I haven't visited this place

380
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,215
since filming Boyhood

381
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,784
-and The King in Love.
-Never?

382
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,986
Thanks to your show,
I'm getting the chance

383
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:55,554
-to visit this place again.
-What a relief.

384
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,656
Since you're the senior here in Buyeo…

385
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:58,857
Are you sure I know more?

386
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:00,793
Since you're more familiar with Buyeo,

387
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:03,495
we'll spend the day discovering

388
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:04,563
-its highlights.
-Sounds good.

389
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,700
-It's a walk around Buyeo.
-Let's discover what Buyeo has to offer.

390
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:08,968
Sure thing.

391
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,303
When were you last here?

392
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,638
It was for The King in Love. There.

393
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:13,706
Right here?

394
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,708
-It's right here.
-There we go.

395
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:17,142
My Sassy Girl,

396
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,679
Tale of Fairy, and The King in Love.

397
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,148
DRAMA SERIES FILMED AT GARIMSEONG FORTRESS

398
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,084
Don't you find this fascinating too?

399
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,352
I do.

400
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,420
This was filmed in 2017?

401
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,722
That was eight, nine years ago.

402
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,157
No way.

403
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:35,461
Did you spend a long time filming in Buyeo
for that project?

404
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,396
No, not that long.

405
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:41,200
We came here just to shoot that scene.

406
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:42,835
We filmed mostly on the MBC set.

407
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:45,904
Do you like to walk?

408
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,406
I love going on walks.

409
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:48,941
That's great to hear.

410
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,111
I asked because
we're coming up to some stairs.

411
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,848
-Is that okay?
-I can handle that much.

412
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:56,915
-Really?
-Yes.

413
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:58,584
-I like to walk.
-That's nice to hear.

414
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,785
Many others are here too.

415
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,822
AFTER CLIMBING AN ENDLESS FLIGHT
OF STEEP STAIRS

416
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,760
THE LOVE TREE OF GARIMSEONG FORTRESS
GREETS THEM IN FULL GLORY

417
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,095
Do you like hiking up mountains?

418
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,196
I do.

419
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:12,898
I have to work out anyway,

420
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:16,402
so hiking mountains lets me enjoy

421
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,804
the process.

422
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,243
What sports do you enjoy
purely for fun and not as exercise?

423
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,310
Swimming.

424
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,378
-Swimming?
-Yes.

425
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:27,546
I like being in the water.

426
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,782
I love to swim.

427
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:32,117
Whenever I come across water,

428
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,253
I'm like… Do you know

429
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,721
how horsehair worms are?

430
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,624
-Horsehair worms?
-Like horsehair worms,

431
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,392
the water calls to me.

432
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:41,560
It calls to you?

433
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,028
I'm getting a weird vibe from him.

434
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,496
The water begs me to dive in.

435
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,331
-Is it like a sound in your ear?
-Yes.

436
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,866
-Have you always liked the water?
-Yes.

437
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,335
I go crazy at the sight of clear water.

438
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:54,540
No way.

439
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,142
Considering the effort,

440
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,777
-the view is amazing.
-Right?

441
00:17:58,844 --> 00:17:59,945
If this is what's offered--

442
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,413
Wow, talk about efficiency.

443
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,116
All it takes is a short walk up?

444
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:05,851
I feel like

445
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,454
we use a lot of the same vocabulary.

446
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,721
-Really? Like what?
-Yes.

447
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:10,789
Efficiency.

448
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:14,526
-Productivity.
-Efficiency and productivity.

449
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,594
-I see.
-Ability.

450
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:16,662
EFFICIENCY, PRODUCTIVITY, ABILITY

451
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,433
THEY REACH THE TOP AFTER AN EFFICIENT HIKE

452
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,901
This must be it.

453
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:24,236
-It's been so long.
-This tree.

454
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,438
I heard this was a famous tree.

455
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:30,375
LOVE TREE: ITS NAME CAME
FROM A BRANCH SHAPED LIKE HALF A HEART

456
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,911
THIS 400-YEAR-OLD ZELKOVA IS
A POPULAR PHOTO SPOT FOR COUPLES

457
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:34,513
It feels different

458
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,449
now that I'm seeing it again
after so long.

459
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:40,352
When filming, you rarely feel much
from the locations themselves.

460
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,187
-Exactly. It's a place of work.
-That's right.

461
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:43,288
It's only a place of work.

462
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:46,358
-Once it's tied to work, anything nice…
-Of course.

463
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,627
We need to find the heart shape.

464
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:49,695
-A heart?
-Yes.

465
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:52,464
Don't you think the half of a heart…

466
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:53,565
is this?

467
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,900
Wouldn't this be it, Do-yeon?

468
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,736
-Like this?
-Yes, this.

469
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,272
Picture a branch
that's mirrored on the other side.

470
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,008
-Then…
-Then it'll create a shape.

471
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,076
-Right?
-You're right.

472
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,344
Right?

473
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,713
You look like a bachelor from the past

474
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,681
who ended up in modern times.

475
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,885
It's like you quickly threw on that shirt.

476
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:13,952
You look amazing.

477
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:15,821
It's like a scene from an ad.

478
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:16,889
Stay right where you are.

479
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,824
I'll do that.

480
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,259
I'll take the shot.

481
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,426
One, two, three.

482
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,029
One, two, three.

483
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,831
THEY FONDLY TAKE PHOTOS OF EACH OTHER

484
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:26,899
One, two, three.

485
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,840
You looked like a model
in a bottled water ad.

486
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,776
That means you look fresh.

487
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:39,745
And you…

488
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:40,812
Wring out a compliment.

489
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:42,648
-Watermelon juice.
-Watermelon?

490
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:45,083
-Is it because of my clothes?
-You were modeling watermelon juice.

491
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,552
Nice. I like watermelon.

492
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:49,488
TODAY'S TRIP IS EXTRA REFRESHING AND SWEET

493
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,191
It's nice and cool up here.

494
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,494
-That's something I like.
-Yes?

495
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:58,030
I like how you don't get overly excited

496
00:19:58,096 --> 00:19:59,798
about the little things.

497
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,234
It's important that travel buddies
have the same energy level.

498
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,636
-Really? That's a relief.
-That's important.

499
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,772
But suppose you came up here

500
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:08,507
and suddenly burst into tears,

501
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,008
overwhelmed at being back in Buyeo.

502
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:12,477
"It's been so long, Buyeo!"

503
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,346
I'd cry alongside you.

504
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,548
I cater to whomever I'm with,
so don't worry.

505
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,850
-I do too.
-You seem like a person

506
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:21,787
who keeps things calm
instead of overreacting.

507
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,355
That's why I'm keeping it dry.

508
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,657
If you get wild, I'll match that vibe.

509
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,792
-Really?
-I'd match the energy.

510
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:29,695
Goodness gracious. I'm here in Buyeo!

511
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,230
This soil.

512
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:32,331
This grass.

513
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,499
I can't believe I'm in Buyeo!

514
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,001
(PLAYING DUMB)

515
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,803
Si-wan, you said you'd play along.

516
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:41,673
Oh, goodness. Why am I even here?

517
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,475
-I'm in Buyeo of all places.
-Buyeo!

518
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,310
-That tree!
-The tree.

519
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:47,179
-Goodness.
-Thank the Lord for this tree.

520
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,281
What about that over there?

521
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:52,484
That's where I filmed Boyhood.

522
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:54,419
Thanks.

523
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:55,487
Let's sit.

524
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:58,290
Goodness.

525
00:20:58,357 --> 00:20:59,358
That felt great.

526
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,892
THANKS FOR PLAYING ALONG

527
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:01,960
PROUD

528
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:04,263
-Let's talk about something cheery.
-Sure.

529
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:05,364
-I'm feeling great.
-Really?

530
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,299
Around the time this episode is released,

531
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:10,235
-Mantis will be too.
-That's right.

532
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,938
Here's a brief intro to the story.

533
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:16,608
-We know it's a spin-off of Kill Boksoon.
-A spin-off.

534
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:19,511
It follows the story
of an organization of hired assassins.

535
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:23,315
There, I play an assassin

536
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:25,651
who's hired to kill people.

537
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:27,286
I'm an assassin,

538
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,888
but one that is paid
to kill other assassins.

539
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,958
Because of that, I'm not portrayed
as a straight-up villain.

540
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,693
I'm an assassin with a human side.

541
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,695
To film the scenes,

542
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:39,564
you must have done action sequences,
being a killer and all.

543
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,634
Of course.
I even trained at a stunt academy.

544
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:43,902
There were many action scenes.

545
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,137
-Because you had to kill?
-Yes.

546
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:46,838
What's your weapon of choice?

547
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:49,708
I'm dubbed Mantis,

548
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:53,745
and I wield two sickles
that make me look like one.

549
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,649
You probably strike here to kill someone.

550
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,785
That's not a classic weapon. Why sickles?

551
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:01,253
Were you raised on a farm?

552
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,121
There were many options to choose from.

553
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,290
Why I fight with sickles
is never explained.

554
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,625
That's never revealed?

555
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:09,261
That will probably come up
in the Mantis spin-off.

556
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,362
Got it.

557
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,664
-So, you attack with two sickles?
-Yes, two sickles.

558
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:14,032
-You look like a mantis.
-Right.

559
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:15,867
Like this.

560
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,170
GROSSSSSS

561
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:20,272
What's the most difficult thing
about action scenes?

562
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,008
Compared to other actors,

563
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:25,110
I'm not as scared.

564
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,778
-To do stunts?
-That's right.

565
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:30,649
Still, what I found hardest
about this project

566
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:33,952
was that I had to play a stylish assassin.

567
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:39,725
Because of that, I had to fight
in dress shoes with higher heels.

568
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:42,327
Wow, I bet you looked sexy.

569
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:43,528
On one foot,

570
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:46,031
there was a scene
where I had to balance on one foot,

571
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,466
but because the heel was high…

572
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,570
-Jeez.
-I bet it'll mesmerize the viewers.

573
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:53,705
Those watching would want
to be killed by you.

574
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:56,808
I say that because The Merciless

575
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,077
is the project I loved you in the most.

576
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:02,347
The movie itself was quite stylish.

577
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:04,349
She really seems to be

578
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:06,084
a huge movie fan.

579
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:08,453
A lot of people have seen The Merciless.

580
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,688
I never said they didn't.

581
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,358
You're absolutely right.

582
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:15,394
I keep getting ahead of myself.

583
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:17,696
Sorry, that was careless of me.

584
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:18,997
I apologize for that.

585
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:22,467
Anyway, Squid Game turned into

586
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,603
-a worldwide sensation.
-Right.

587
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:26,138
Can you feel how popular you've become?

588
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:28,540
Can you tell you've gained
many new global fans?

589
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:32,043
I was told you popularized
the word "sibal" around the world.

590
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:35,347
You introduced the word "sibal" globally.

591
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,983
I knew something was off
from the start, sibal!

592
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:41,486
"SIBAL BOY" STIRRED THE HEARTS OF FANS

593
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:43,855
-That's a good thing, right?
-Of course.

594
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,290
Because it helped promote Korea.

595
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:49,127
It means you brought the character to life
and delivered a good performance.

596
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:50,328
It's the same with this show.

597
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:53,064
You can go beyond having fans
just in Korea.

598
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:55,033
Getaway and Go with Jangdobari.

599
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,068
I think today will mark the show's

600
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:58,503
turning point.

601
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:59,871
We'll ride on your fame

602
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,339
and let the show soar.

603
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:02,474
You're already doing great.

604
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:03,875
-"Si-wan, please."
-Come on.

605
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,744
It's something to be grateful for.

606
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:06,945
It'll be me riding your fame.

607
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,847
What? That's nonsense.

608
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:09,948
How about we go eat?

609
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:11,316
Sounds good. I'm hungry.

610
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:12,851
Come on.

611
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:14,719
Off we go.

612
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,658
THEY LEAVE LOVE AT THE TREE
AND HEAD OUT TO LUNCH

613
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:24,830
-I'll move to the other side.
-Such a gentleman.

614
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,266
SHOWING CHIVALRY
ON THE WAY TO THE NEXT STOP!

615
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,334
So nice and cool in here.

616
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,002
FROM GARIMSEONG ZELKOVA TREE
TO BUCKWHEAT NOODLE RESTAURANT

617
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,337
What do you think is more polite?

618
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:37,175
Opening the door versus
scooting over to the other side.

619
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:39,945
It's a mystery I've yet to solve.

620
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:44,082
-What counts as better manners?
-Scooting over to the other side?

621
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,952
It's uncomfortable for anyone
to scoot over to the other side.

622
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:48,987
-It's bothersome.
-You have to crawl inside.

623
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:51,790
What should I do to show better manners?

624
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:54,860
That's something I think about on my own.

625
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,262
(SEEKING BETTER MANNERS)

626
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,630
You're a busy man.

627
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:01,900
I think crawling in
and sliding over to the other side

628
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:03,902
shows better manners.

629
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:06,471
That means I'll have to get in first.

630
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:09,774
Really? I think it's more courteous
to open the door.

631
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,309
We all think differently.

632
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:16,648
I opened the door to show good manners,

633
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:19,451
and you entered first to be polite.

634
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,853
People can think

635
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:23,822
in such different ways.

636
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:25,790
THEY ARRIVE AT A SPOT
THAT OOZES GOURMET VIBES!

637
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,325
-It's a tasty place.
-Is it?

638
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,361
How about pulling out chairs?

639
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:30,795
Pulling out chairs?

640
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:33,698
(PLEASE SIT)

641
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:34,833
(PLEASE SIT YOURSELF)

642
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,068
THEY KEEP PULLING OUT CHAIRS
BUT NO ONE SITS

643
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:38,303
We were being uselessly polite.

644
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:42,240
In a way, showing good manners

645
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,209
-goes against efficiency.
-That's true.

646
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:45,277
Sure.

647
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:47,445
-It shows you're at ease.
-Of course.

648
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,981
Anyway, this place…

649
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,250
I heard the perilla oil makguksu
is good here.

650
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,521
A SUDDEN BATTLE OF MANNERS?

651
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:57,889
LAYING OUT CHOPSTICKS +1

652
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,159
I'm going to have better manners.

653
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,395
WIPING THE TABLE +1
BREATH VAPOR +1

654
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:07,933
Jeez.

655
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:09,467
(I CAN'T LET HIM WIN)

656
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:10,535
BREATHING OUT

657
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:11,636
CLEANING LENS +1
ASMR +1

658
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:12,904
LAUGHING

659
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:15,407
ADJUSTING HAIR +1
ADDING VOLUME TO HAIR +1

660
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,242
CHECKING CROWN +1
FIXING BANGS +1

661
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,177
STRAIGHTENING CLOTHES +1

662
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:21,846
One, two, three, mic test.

663
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:22,981
-One, two, three.
-So annoying.

664
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,282
DO-YEON CRUMBLES WHEN SI-WAN TESTS HER MIC

665
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:25,450
I'm done being polite.

666
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:27,485
We'll stop this.

667
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:29,220
What do you want to have?

668
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:32,390
We should have the signature dishes.

669
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:34,726
Perilla oil makguksu?

670
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:36,161
-I'll have it with Cheongyang chili.
-The spicy one?

671
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:37,228
-Sounds good.
-Good.

672
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:38,296
And…

673
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:40,031
Do-yeon, hold on.

674
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:41,733
Nice.

675
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,836
THE BATTLE CONTINUES
HE WON'T LET DO-YEON WEAR OUT HER ARM…

676
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,871
-Yes!
-What if I held up your arm?

677
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,641
(BEING WELL-MANNERED BY LIFTING HIS ARMS)

678
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,643
That was clever.
You're a formidable opponent.

679
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,545
How about one boiled pork
and one raw pollack?

680
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:54,813
-I'd love that.
-Okay.

681
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,115
Sir! I'm going to cook for us.

682
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:01,052
The owner's stylish, isn't he?

683
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,488
This place must do well.
Look at his gold accessories.

684
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:04,556
A THICK GOLD BRACELET

685
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,592
Hello. I hope we didn't do anything wrong.

686
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:11,129
We'll have one perilla oil makguksu,
one Cheongyang perilla oil makguksu,

687
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:12,931
one boiled pork, and one raw pollack.

688
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,935
That was the thickest gold accessory
I've seen in a while.

689
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,370
If the owner has

690
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:21,473
a gold accessory, does that mean
the restaurant's doing well?

691
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,074
-That's logical.
-Is it?

692
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,977
Yes. What's your criteria
for choosing a good restaurant?

693
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:28,346
It has to be shabby, and the sign outside

694
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:29,981
should be missing a letter.

695
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:34,319
Are you talking about just a letter
or an entire syllable?

696
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,254
-Let's say it's Magpie Diner.
-Magpie Diner?

697
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,323
-It should read "Agpie Diner."
-Agpie?

698
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,924
Something like that.

699
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,660
Or if none of the letters are missing,

700
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:43,561
one should be hanging loose.

701
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,065
-You get what I'm saying, right?
-Hanging like this?

702
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:48,533
Magpie Diner.

703
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,202
The restaurant should have a long history.

704
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,204
You're giving me foodie vibes.

705
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:56,041
Not really. I don't know
any good restaurants I can go to.

706
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:57,942
I know more about places to order from.

707
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:00,745
What is it?

708
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:02,814
The M restaurant.

709
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,649
While we're on the subject…

710
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:07,318
I think I get why people call you
a clear-eyed maniac.

711
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:09,020
There's madness in your eyes right now.

712
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:11,690
You're scaring me a little.

713
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:13,324
Do-yeon, hear me out.

714
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:15,593
These days, I've been so into

715
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,263
-cumin wings.
-Hey!

716
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,132
You know what?
I know I can outdo you on this.

717
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,234
-I've ordered them a lot.
-Really?

718
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,303
I've been crazy about them.

719
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,938
-You've ordered them a lot?
-A ton.

720
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:28,073
-Have you?
-Yes.

721
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:29,541
I even had some yesterday.

722
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:30,608
(I LOST…)

723
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:31,743
You just want to win it all.

724
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:34,679
-You had some yesterday?
-Yesterday.

725
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,716
I recently finished the photo shoot
for my album cover,

726
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:38,850
so I could ease up on my diet.

727
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,952
I was thinking about what to eat

728
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:43,388
and decided to have lamb skewers
with kkwobarou.

729
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:46,157
From there,
I went from lamb skewers to cumin,

730
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,826
-which led to cumin wings.
-Cumin wings.

731
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,094
It's so good.

732
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,897
You know how it's served
with those chewy balls.

733
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:54,999
-Chewy cheese balls.
-Yes, those chewy balls.

734
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,434
-I love them.
-Aren't they good?

735
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:57,936
While eating the dish,

736
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:00,338
the seasoned powder sometimes clumps up.

737
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,740
That tastes phenomenal.

738
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:03,942
Aren't you a fan of that?

739
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:05,276
-What is it?
-I brought up cumin wings,

740
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:07,145
but you're trying to claim the dish.

741
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:09,180
It's just that--

742
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,249
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but this isn't a competition.

743
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:12,917
Sprinkle cumin on top of the cumin.

744
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:14,252
-That's right.
-Sprinkle more.

745
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,720
Here's the order of things.

746
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:18,156
Dip it in mayonnaise,

747
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:20,692
then coat it with cumin.

748
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,227
-That's it.
-Crunch, crunch.

749
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:25,130
While we were talking, I ate two wings.

750
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:27,398
Eat it right,
and you'll end up with only two bones.

751
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:29,300
Like this.
It looks like you yanked out fangs.

752
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,202
It's thrilling to lay them out
on the table.

753
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:33,438
To that, I take a sip of beer.

754
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:35,073
You're good.

755
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,075
What? The dish is that good.

756
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:39,310
I haven't met anyone
who's into that dish as much as I am.

757
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:41,479
Whoever made that is the true foodie.

758
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:43,748
-Cumin wings deserve the praise.
-I agree.

759
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,049
They do.

760
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,085
No way. That looks delicious.

761
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:49,254
-Who's having the spicier one?
-Her.

762
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,322
Everything looks amazing.

763
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:53,324
You didn't accidentally
pour chili powder on this, did you?

764
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:56,094
-Is this the right amount?
-Yes.

765
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:57,428
No way.

766
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:58,930
It already smells so good.

767
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,031
No way.

768
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:02,233
PERILLA OIL MAKGUKSU

769
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,535
-Thank you.
-So,

770
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:05,336
would you like anything to drink?

771
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:06,604
No, don't!

772
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:07,672
I won't have that.

773
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,808
-No way.
-That…

774
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,377
Didn't I sound like a loser just now?

775
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:13,444
I'll have it.

776
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:15,713
"I won't have that."

777
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:18,650
CALL OFF THE BATTLE!
TIME FOR REFRESHING WATER

778
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:20,518
-Gosh, that's refreshing.
-That's good.

779
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:22,420
Do-yeon, let's take a photo.

780
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,521
-Sure.
-Here we go.

781
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,758
I heard you were the one
who began the trend.

782
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,194
You were the first one
to take photos of the entire table.

783
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,163
-The one where you take it like this.
-Right.

784
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,631
-Like this.
-You started the trend.

785
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:36,201
That's what everyone does now
to fit every dish in the photo.

786
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:38,803
I'm not sure if people are copying me,

787
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,305
but that's how photos are taken now.

788
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:42,874
When did you start taking photos
like that?

789
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:44,943
Have you always taken photos
of food like this?

790
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,444
Not really.

791
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,881
This is why I began
taking photos that way.

792
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:51,816
I was at a restaurant,
and my food came out.

793
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:52,884
In Cannes.

794
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:55,420
No way. That sounded fancy just now.

795
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:58,556
I was there for the Cannes Film Festival,

796
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:02,360
and I was amazed by all the food
I'd never seen before.

797
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,362
Something was served on a skewer.

798
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:05,797
-A skewer?
-That's right.

799
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,167
It was long and dangling down.

800
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:10,368
That's new.

801
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:14,239
I couldn't fit that in the shot
from a regular angle.

802
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:15,440
So to get it in the shot,

803
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,175
-I raised the camera.
-That you should.

804
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:18,309
Is that how it all began?

805
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,510
I had no other choice.

806
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:21,312
(YEAR 2021)
(YEAR 2025)

807
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,648
That's how I started taking photos
from above.

808
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,451
Just take the photo like this.

809
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,053
This is what you get.

810
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,154
AERIAL SHOT TAKEN BY SI-WAN

811
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,257
Yours is good. Check out mine.

812
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:33,625
AERIAL SHOT TAKEN BY DO-YEON

813
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:36,461
Take it again.

814
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:38,897
Hold the camera up and tilt it this way.

815
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:41,766
SECOND ATTEMPT

816
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,968
It's much better than before.

817
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:47,138
-Should we dig in? Okay.
-Sounds good.

818
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:49,674
Do you need scissors?

819
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,742
SCRAMBLING

820
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:55,480
Why did you stop in your tracks
right when I stopped moving?

821
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:56,814
I don't know.

822
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:58,182
I have no idea.

823
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,784
Having good manners
isn't second nature to me.

824
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,853
-I realized that today.
-You saw that too, right?

825
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,288
I was caught faking good manners.

826
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:04,389
CAUGHT FAKING GOOD MANNERS

827
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:07,825
I stopped halfway and looked at you,

828
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:09,127
and you stopped too.

829
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:10,728
I'm only polite when I need to be.

830
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,198
-Sorry about that.
-You're selectively polite.

831
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,700
-Selectively polite.
-Yes.

832
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:16,968
This looks quite spicy.

833
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:20,772
SNIP

834
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:22,473
Since you cut my noodles for me,

835
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,875
can I bite yours to cut them?

836
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:25,944
Sorry about that.

837
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,312
How are my fake manners?

838
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,748
USING SCISSORS BEFORE SHE USES HER TEETH!

839
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:31,816
Whoa.

840
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:35,353
-There's something unique about this dish.
-This looks good.

841
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:44,762
YUM!

842
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:46,130
-It's good.
-This is good.

843
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:47,899
-Right?
-Oh, yes.

844
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,634
My gosh.

845
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,537
The perilla oil tastes amazing.

846
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:54,739
He deserves that gold bracelet.

847
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,341
Exactly. This is no surprise.

848
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:58,509
I wouldn't mind buying a bottle
of their perilla oil.

849
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:00,345
You know what life's all about?

850
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:02,647
It's talking about food
while you're eating.

851
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:04,182
That's the answer to life.

852
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:07,585
Talking about what to eat next
while eating your meal.

853
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,987
Nothing compares to that joy.

854
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,390
I hardly have to chew the noodles
before swallowing.

855
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,761
-Do-yeon, try it with that.
-Sure.

856
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:17,829
This.

857
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:18,963
-Raw pollack, right?
-Yes.

858
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,832
Try the noodles with some of the pollack.

859
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,034
I want to try it on its own.

860
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,036
TAKING A BITE

861
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:27,638
YUM!

862
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:28,940
It's nice and sweet.

863
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,010
TOUCHED

864
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:33,244
-It's so tender.
-I know.

865
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:35,313
-It's really tender.
-Right?

866
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,483
Even elderly people would enjoy this.

867
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:44,722
I'm glad we ordered that. Yes?

868
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:46,324
-In case it's too spicy.
-I see.

869
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:48,793
-What type of broth is this?
-What's this?

870
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,228
It was made with beef.

871
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:51,863
SIPPING

872
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,765
Goodness.

873
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:54,832
It's so good.

874
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,801
It's really good.

875
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,636
The flavors are rich yet clean.

876
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,638
-Hold on. It's sour.
-It's slightly sour.

877
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,273
-Right?
-It has a tang.

878
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,308
-That's what makes it so clean.
-It's good.

879
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:06,744
With the cool breeze…

880
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:08,579
Wait, is that the AC?

881
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:09,714
Is that the AC?

882
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,749
NO WONDER THE BREEZE WAS COOL

883
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:13,985
So much for serving up romance.

884
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,988
I was going to say, "With the cool breeze
and delicious makguksu,

885
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:18,356
this feels like heaven,"

886
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:21,292
but then I realized the AC
was blowing air into my face.

887
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,262
Do you not usually cook at home?

888
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:25,530
I do when there's time.

889
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:27,065
-You cook?
-Yes.

890
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:30,101
I once steamed king crabs at home.

891
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,538
I called some friends over,

892
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:34,639
and in the shell…

893
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,874
-Did you mix rice in?
-Like this.

894
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:39,110
-With avocado.
-No way.

895
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:40,878
We seasoned it with soy sauce,

896
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,213
and ate it like that.

897
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,381
You must eat well at home.

898
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:47,919
If you think about it, cleaning
is part of the cooking process too.

899
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:50,455
-I clean up after myself as I cook.
-You do?

900
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,623
-You're tidy too?
-While cooking.

901
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:54,425
You have it all.

902
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:55,827
Tell me one of your flaws.

903
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:58,463
How's that for an interview?

904
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:00,932
Tell me about a flaw a friend
has pointed out.

905
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:02,800
-There are a lot.
-Like?

906
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:06,003
I'm not like you,
someone who can suddenly get up

907
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,638
and do the mask dance.

908
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:12,410
I can't generate that kind of fun
in my own life.

909
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:14,445
There's nothing to it.

910
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:18,983
WOOHOO

911
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,252
Is this what you mean?
I danced because the food was good.

912
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:22,687
IT'S SO TASTY I CAN'T HELP BUT DANCE

913
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:24,088
How's this?

914
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:26,491
DANCING AGAIN BECAUSE IT'S THAT GOOD

915
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:31,129
I'm so jealous of you.

916
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:32,196
I'm jealous.

917
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:33,431
HE'S JEALOUS FOR REAL

918
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:34,866
(EMBARRASSED)

919
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:37,368
-Lucky you.
-How do I look? Are my ears red?

920
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:38,803
It's not just your ears.

921
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,707
Is my face as red as this raw pollack?

922
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:48,279
How would your friends describe
your personality?

923
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:50,915
They say I'm unique and unconventional.

924
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:52,884
In what way?

925
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,152
-I'm curious.
-That I'm an oddball.

926
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:57,822
They call you an oddball?
There's a bit of madness in your eyes.

927
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:59,590
I do whatever I set my mind to.

928
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,092
SI-WAN'S CREED:
DO WHATEVER I SET MY MIND TO

929
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,426
I just do it.

930
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:05,229
I don't give myself any other options.

931
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,633
Maybe that's why they think I'm odd.

932
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:11,869
It's a great quality to have,
especially in this line of work.

933
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:13,704
-You need to be like that.
-Of course.

934
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:15,740
Still, when I look at you,

935
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:19,911
you don't seem like someone
who would bulldoze through things.

936
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:21,712
I'm surprised by that.

937
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:22,780
-Really?
-Yes.

938
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:26,050
-You seem gentle and soft-spoken.
-Right.

939
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:28,653
But actually, you're more like,

940
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:32,690
"I do what I set out to do,
and if I decide to go, I go."

941
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:36,961
The hardware people see on the outside

942
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:38,763
-and my software--
-They're different.

943
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:39,830
They don't match.

944
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:41,132
-That's exactly what I mean.
-Right?

945
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,900
That's what I meant.

946
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:46,804
Here's how you seem.
Normally you want to keep the peace,

947
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,874
but when you get ticked off,
you want to win at all costs.

948
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:53,211
Even if you have to pull
someone's hair out,

949
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:54,645
you'll try to win.

950
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:59,050
I'm not that interested in winning though.

951
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:01,085
-Really? But you're competitive.
-Yeah.

952
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:04,188
I have a desire to accomplish,
but I'm not necessarily competitive.

953
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:07,358
I'm driven to complete missions.

954
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:08,960
That's a good quality to have.

955
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:12,263
My personality can be exhausting
because I find it hard to blame others.

956
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,966
I have only myself to blame.

957
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,001
You should try to be easier on yourself.

958
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,069
I know.

959
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:20,471
It'll be hard to recover from burnout.

960
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:23,174
Could we have some more broth?

961
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,508
Hold on.

962
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,410
Did you ask for more
because I finished mine?

963
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:27,778
What?

964
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:31,816
I should make today a day
of unusually good manners.

965
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:33,851
Is being polite always a good thing?

966
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:38,155
Are you testing how good manners
might make someone uncomfortable?

967
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:40,825
I learned good manners
while adapting socially.

968
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:43,894
As I said, I value efficiency.

969
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:47,164
What's a good manner
you always try to show?

970
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:49,700
These days, I just let others go first.

971
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,402
After you.

972
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,305
Even when getting on an elevator.

973
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,107
-I see. Always?
-Yes.

974
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:58,409
It's hard to do, although it seems easy.

975
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:01,279
I was all about efficiency,

976
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:05,383
but then I learned that there were
other things that made the world function.

977
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,551
There's more to it than efficiency alone.

978
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,186
Gosh, of course.

979
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:11,122
Nothing is a given in this world.

980
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:15,526
That's how I ended up studying manners
and reflecting on them.

981
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:18,896
-Gosh, thank you.
-Thank you.

982
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,564
JUST THEN, THE EXTRA BROTH IS SERVED

983
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,233
Gosh, thank you.

984
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,467
It's so good.

985
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:25,269
SMIRKING

986
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:28,973
You weren't flirting with me, were you?

987
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,176
Sir, is that how
you usually look at people?

988
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:35,313
I couldn't tell if you were sending me
a message with your eyes.

989
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:36,614
This is how he served it to me.

990
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:39,250
This is how food is usually served.

991
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,951
"Here you go. Please enjoy."

992
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:43,688
-They're poised.
-Yes, with poise.

993
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:45,156
But in his case…

994
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:47,525
He has a naturally smiley expression,
but still.

995
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:50,961
SERVING WITH A SMILE AS FRESH AS SPRING

996
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:52,029
I'm not kidding.

997
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:56,534
His eyebrows went up and down too.

998
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:58,536
It made me wonder.

999
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:00,738
-I couldn't help it.
-When we said it was so good…

1000
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,342
Yes, that's what he did!

1001
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:07,745
It was as if time flowed
more slowly for him.

1002
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:11,215
THE OWNER'S TIME FLOWS SLOWLY

1003
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:15,019
I heard something recently
that woke me up a bit.

1004
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:16,854
If things are easy for you

1005
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:19,557
and everything's going well,

1006
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:20,725
it means

1007
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:23,761
someone else is working extra hard.

1008
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:27,465
If I take on the hardship,
someone else will have an easier time.

1009
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,000
Exactly. It also makes sense
the other way around.

1010
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:32,937
-If I take on all the struggle--
-Why is there madness in your eyes?

1011
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,639
What is this?
How do you turn it off and on?

1012
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:36,707
You're scaring me.

1013
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:39,143
-That's what you meant.
-That's right.

1014
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,746
-If I grind myself to the brink--
-Someone will have it easier.

1015
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:45,616
-Someone will have an easier time.
-That's true.

1016
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:47,685
As you know,

1017
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:50,354
we work in an environment
designed by others.

1018
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:52,590
It made me realize
I should always be aware

1019
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:54,825
of the work others do behind the scenes.

1020
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,327
That's so true.

1021
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,629
-But it's not easy.
-You can't take anything for granted.

1022
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:01,165
-Thinking this way is also a habit.
-Sure.

1023
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,800
You need to train yourself.

1024
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:05,369
You seem to think deeply about life.

1025
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:11,509
When did you start
training yourself to think like this?

1026
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:17,114
I believe we all end up showing
our true selves on variety shows.

1027
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:20,818
No matter how hard you try to hide it,

1028
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:22,787
it comes through in what you say.

1029
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:24,054
So this is how I compromised.

1030
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:26,957
Before, I only wanted to be a good person,

1031
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:29,627
but that's easier said than done.

1032
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:31,162
So here's what I told myself.

1033
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:33,197
I'm not a remarkably good person,

1034
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,400
but I'm still someone who tries hard.

1035
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:38,936
Thinking that way felt liberating for me.

1036
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:40,538
I should train myself the same way.

1037
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,540
That's why I just do the mask dance
after meals.

1038
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,607
Like this.

1039
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,677
I'm jealous. You're so good at that.
I'm so jealous.

1040
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:48,913
Lucky you.

1041
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:51,949
-Then I drink the broth.
-It's your second bowl.

1042
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:54,084
Is this a show
where you complain about your life

1043
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:55,653
and misfortunes?

1044
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,488
-Of course not.
-Is it?

1045
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:59,523
This isn't Listen to Jang Do-yeon Lament.

1046
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,991
It's Getaway and Go with Jangdobari.

1047
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:02,860
-Are you sure?
-There's no lamenting.

1048
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:04,128
It's fine if you do.

1049
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:06,030
But if that's the concept,

1050
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:08,432
I thought I should play along more.

1051
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:09,800
No, there's nothing like that.

1052
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:15,239
I don't mind learning
about the thoughts you developed

1053
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,641
to shape your life.

1054
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:20,377
Really? But if it seemed
like I was lamenting,

1055
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:22,746
it's only because you drew that out of me.

1056
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,081
-Really?
-Yes.

1057
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,517
You seem like someone who listens well

1058
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:29,653
and easily relates
to other people's thoughts.

1059
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,622
-Really?
-Yes. There are people

1060
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:34,158
who make it easier for you
to talk about yourself.

1061
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:35,793
That's the kind of person I want to be.

1062
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:40,531
I hope to be a good interviewer.

1063
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:42,399
That's a tough gig.

1064
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:44,034
It sure is. Don't I know it.

1065
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:49,139
In the shows I'm in,
I'm mostly the one asking questions.

1066
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:52,476
But someone asked me a question recently
that completely caught me off guard.

1067
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,044
-That happens.
-You know,

1068
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:57,081
it made me realize that even
answering questions can be hard.

1069
00:41:57,147 --> 00:41:58,649
A question may not seem tough to me,

1070
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:01,418
but the person answering
might feel otherwise.

1071
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:03,754
-That's a possibility.
-Right.

1072
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:06,056
It's tough to ask a good question

1073
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:08,425
and have it met with an honest answer.

1074
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:10,928
I think it's harder for the interviewer.

1075
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:11,996
-Really?
-Because

1076
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:14,431
the interviewee just answers questions,

1077
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:17,034
-while the interviewers have to ask them.
-Because we ask them?

1078
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:20,304
You're great with words.

1079
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,373
-Want to go for dessert?
-Sure.

1080
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:27,077
That felt like
Getaway and Go with Yimsibari.

1081
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:28,612
Yimsiwaniwani.

1082
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:29,880
Waniwani.

1083
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,282
-Let's go.
-Let's go get our dessert.

1084
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:32,383
-Let's go.
-Off we go.

1085
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:34,251
Thank you so much.

1086
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,687
-We enjoyed everything.
-It was so good.

1087
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:39,356
Just how much is considered good manners?

1088
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:40,424
How's your seat belt?

1089
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:42,593
-Isn't the fan too heavy?
-Isn't your mic heavy?

1090
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,495
-Aren't your earrings heavy?
-They're fine.

1091
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,497
I don't think I've ever felt drained
by good manners before.

1092
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:47,865
BLOSSOMED FROM THE BATTLE OF MANNERS

1093
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:49,800
IS LOVE IN THE AIR…?

1094
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:52,069
SI-WAN'S BOLD BRUSH OF HER LIPS

1095
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:53,370
BUT IT DOESN'T LAST…

1096
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:55,239
DO-YEON'S EXTREMELY NERVOUS

1097
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:56,840
SI-WAN COULDN'T BE MORE RELAXED

1098
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,809
WHERE COULD THEY BE?

1099
00:42:58,876 --> 00:42:59,877
I can do this.

1100
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:01,579
ATV RIDING
FOR ACTIVITY ENTHUSIAST SI-WAN

1101
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:03,414
THEIR GOAL IS TO FINISH THE COURSE

1102
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:06,584
-Yes!
-Hold on. What do I do?

1103
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:07,651
IT DOESN'T LOOK EASY…?

1104
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:10,020
WILL SI-WAN BE ABLE TO FINISH THE COURSE

1105
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,989
WITH DO-YEON TAGGING ALONG?

1106
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:13,290
HOW TO END A TRIP

1107
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:15,426
IT'D BE UPSETTING
IF THERE WERE NO ROLE-PLAY SKIT

1108
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:19,630
I've never seen anyone marry five times
just to go on honeymoons.

1109
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:21,198
-Don't you remember?
-Remember what?

1110
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,766
I asked to borrow some money.

1111
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:24,201
HERE WE GO WITH MONEY AGAIN…

1112
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,937
That's all you need to fix
because you're sweet overall.

1113
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:28,038
She's sweet.

1114
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,673
Jang Do-yeon is
the best show host out there.

1115
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:30,874
No one's as good as her.

1116
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,209
What's with him?

1117
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:35,212
Don't be good at these things!

1118
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,447
LOOK FORWARD

1119
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:38,616
TO THEIR SIBLING-LIKE CHEMISTRY!

1120
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:42,553
A BATTLE OF MANNERS
CHECK IT OUT NEXT SATURDAY AT 5 P.M.

1121
