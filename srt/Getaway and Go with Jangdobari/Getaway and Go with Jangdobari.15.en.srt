1
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:05,839
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

2
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:08,008
Can you hear the ocean?

3
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:10,110
We're here in Gangneung!

4
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:11,478
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI SEASON 2
THE FIRST TRAVEL DESTINATION, GANGNEUNG!

5
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:13,179
There's a reason why I chose Gangneung.

6
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:15,682
He's a huge coffee lover.

7
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:18,218
Next, we're headed to a coffee place
you recommended.

8
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:19,719
I recommended a few.

9
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,054
Would you like to try that?

10
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:23,723
-I was going to win one for you.
-Really?

11
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,825
SHE GETS THE MONKEY PLUSHIE

12
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:26,993
…episodes featuring Yo-han.

13
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,529
I hadn't laughed that hard in ages,
clapping along like that.

14
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:30,830
I feel like Yo-han's here with us.

15
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:34,868
Here's the rule I set for you today.
Summon Byun Yo-han when it gets awkward.

16
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:35,935
Yo-han.

17
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:40,473
From this moment on,
this will be Byun Yo-han.

18
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,942
Cafes with delicious coffee
have a different vibe.

19
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:44,010
It's delicious.

20
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:46,613
My nickname was Hatchet Shot.

21
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:49,015
-Pelvis.
-Pelvis?

22
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,784
Have you done role-play
on a variety show before?

23
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,318
Just give me the word,
and I'll play along.

24
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,254
It feels strange to end
our six years of marriage.

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,355
Do you remember what went on yesterday?

26
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,624
I only remember how soft your lips felt
when we kissed.

27
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,858
It's not me you kissed.

28
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:00,393
We didn't?

29
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,429
I figured we could go somewhere
that's befitting

30
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:03,963
of your role as host of Simple Labor.

31
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,765
One, two, three.

32
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:09,035
ALL TOGETHER,
LET'S GO WHERE PLAIN LABOR IS DONE!

33
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:10,370
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

34
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:13,039
We'll now take this moment
to heal our souls.

35
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:15,909
Do you like making cute items like these?

36
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:19,245
I don't actually have a crafty side.

37
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:21,514
I've heard
it's a popular craft these days.

38
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,083
These are called pipe cleaner dolls.

39
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:24,617
Apparently, they're trending.

40
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,921
You can dress them up with these.

41
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:29,622
Nice. There are other accessories too.

42
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:31,858
Look, there's even a fried egg.

43
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:33,693
STARE

44
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,095
Aren't these cute?

45
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,230
EPISODE 2
WELCOME THE POWERHOUSE SHOW HOST

46
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:38,598
Go ahead and decorate yours.

47
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:41,401
There's fun in choosing these.

48
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:45,138
This is cute.

49
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:46,406
Look.

50
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,309
I see you dressed yours.

51
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,611
I can't tell if this actually looks good.

52
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:54,147
Isn't it crappy?

53
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:55,448
Gosh, no.

54
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,853
Come on. There are other things here.

55
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:01,988
There are even glasses.

56
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,490
Eyes, too.

57
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:07,127
That's cute.

58
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:10,463
CHUCKLE

59
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,965
Anyway…

60
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:14,300
Talking Rated R, was it?

61
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:15,502
TALKING RATED R…?

62
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:16,569
TALKING RATED R

63
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,872
DO-YEON MADE HER TV DEBUT
ON THE SHOW IN 2006

64
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,273
I enjoyed it.

65
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,009
LAUGHING

66
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,544
CHUCKLING

67
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,146
That was your debut show.

68
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:28,214
Right.

69
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,817
Do you know what today is?

70
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,352
Today? I don't.

71
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,421
It's the 6,941st day.

72
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,228
Time flies, doesn't it?

73
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,364
Since I debuted?

74
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:46,900
Did you actually count the days?

75
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,134
What was the number again?

76
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:50,370
It's the 6,941st day.

77
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:51,738
The 6,941st day?

78
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,741
Even I had forgotten about that.

79
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:57,143
Didn't we debut around the same time?

80
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,711
You can say you debuted twice.

81
00:02:58,778 --> 00:02:59,612
-Me?
-Yes.

82
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,615
Either Talking Rated R or…

83
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,617
Can you please stop mentioning
Talking Rated R?

84
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,986
Talking Rated R on Mnet.

85
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:10,690
Sure. Thanks for reminding me.

86
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:13,726
You debuted again
after joining the 22nd class

87
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,461
-of KBS comedians.
-That's right.

88
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,896
I see you did your homework.

89
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:21,067
In that case, it's been 6,576 days.

90
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,536
6,576 DAYS SINCE HER DEBUT ON KBS

91
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:26,773
It's like being on a date with a fan

92
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,943
who was chosen for one-on-one time.

93
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:31,344
This feels like a fan meeting event.

94
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,281
Thanks, Tae-goo.
Since when have you had a crush on me?

95
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,950
Where did you come from
to get here in Gangneung?

96
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:38,952
-Sorry?
-Where did you come from?

97
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:40,220
Where do you live?

98
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:41,521
Where do I live?

99
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,556
-I'm from around here.
-Around here?

100
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,992
I was role-playing just now.

101
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,293
I see. Well, I heard you'd be here.

102
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,062
How long have you been a fan?

103
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:50,496
A fan of yours?

104
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:52,765
Well…

105
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:57,203
From the moment I met you.

106
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,607
CHUCKLING AWKWARDLY

107
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:02,675
-Thanks.
-You see,

108
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,844
I was born

109
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,847
on March 9,
and you were born on March 10, 1985.

110
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,082
Yes!

111
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:12,051
I appreciate the affection and attention,

112
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:14,354
but it's a little overwhelming.

113
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,389
-Really?
-It's borderline scary.

114
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,560
I'm awkward by this situation.

115
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:23,596
-Really?
-Manager!

116
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,064
Manager?

117
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,234
ABRUPTLY ENDING THE FAN MEET-AND-GREET

118
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,603
Were you really born on March 9?

119
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,071
No, November 9,

120
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,339
but I was role-playing just now.

121
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:38,378
STRETCHING
CONFIDENCE IS UP

122
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,479
I see.

123
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,115
You were switching
between reality and role-playing.

124
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:44,017
You had me fooled.

125
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,686
I honestly thought
you were born on March 9.

126
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:48,554
Unbelievable.

127
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:51,024
You'll leave addicted
to role-playing at this rate.

128
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,527
If you cut back on it,
your hands will tremble from withdrawal.

129
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,763
You'll be doing it alone,
looking into a mirror.

130
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:58,531
What did you have yesterday?

131
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,199
AGAIN…!

132
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,368
You're good at taking my jokes.

133
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:03,436
I guess.

134
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,405
What's this?

135
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:07,473
Hold on. What's that?

136
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,210
This is so cute!

137
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:12,979
I'd like to wear it myself.

138
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,714
What do you think?

139
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,417
-Hey, that's really cute.
-Isn't it adorable?

140
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,851
-Would you like this too?
-Isn't this also cute?

141
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:19,919
It is.

142
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:23,089
That's not all there is.
These are all really cute.

143
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:26,592
I can't put this on
because it doesn't have arms.

144
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,927
CHUNKY

145
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,262
Its arms are gone.

146
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,230
What do I do?

147
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:32,699
It won't be able to wear it.

148
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,835
WHAT…?

149
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:37,403
You didn't put the overalls on it.

150
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,471
I couldn't dress it up

151
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,039
because it doesn't have any arms.

152
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,507
You can put them on yours though.

153
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,580
I guess I should put these on.

154
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:49,649
I should just put these on.

155
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,353
WHIMPERING……

156
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:54,554
Wait, hold on.

157
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,888
HE QUICKLY TAKES IT

158
00:05:58,324 --> 00:05:59,625
For some reason, you annoy me.

159
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:01,461
I'm only kidding.

160
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:07,166
Do you have any questions for Do-yeon,
since she's a senior show host?

161
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,568
Well,

162
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:11,170
do you come to the show prepared

163
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,939
after studying the guests?

164
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,607
-Do I think about what to ask them?
-Yes.

165
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,777
I do my homework
so that I know about them ahead of time.

166
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,079
What about you, Tae-goo?
Do you study your guests too?

167
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,347
I do.

168
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:22,915
In what way?

169
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,617
I check their profile

170
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,420
and search for them on YouTube.

171
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:28,888
We're the same. I do that too.

172
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,090
What's weird is that
the more I study about them…

173
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,558
Studying sounds odd, but still.

174
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,560
-Right?
-I feel exactly the same.

175
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:36,596
Don't you get more interested in them
the more you look them up?

176
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:37,830
You grow fond of them.

177
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,866
Exactly! That's what I was about to say.

178
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,667
If you're already fond of them,

179
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,935
you grow even fonder.

180
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,805
That's why the more I do
my homework on them,

181
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:47,673
the more excited I get about meeting them.

182
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,176
Right? My thoughts exactly!

183
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,011
-That's why--
-Who am I to get your agreement?

184
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,379
Why would you say that?

185
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,782
Please don't.
Anyway, it's what I was about to say.

186
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,617
It's fascinating
how you grow fonder of them

187
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,852
and form a fondness
that wasn't there before.

188
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,020
Exactly.

189
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,490
I become fond of every guest on the show

190
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,025
and feel nervous before meeting them.

191
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,027
Even after we finish filming,

192
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:12,198
I support them online
whenever I see their projects.

193
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,466
Isn't it nice to hear about them?

194
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,168
They don't feel like strangers anymore.

195
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:16,769
-It's fascinating.
-I know.

196
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,839
I see we have something in common.

197
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,340
You'll soon be a powerhouse
of a show host.

198
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:24,911
LAUGHING SHYLY

199
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,813
Like you were on Talking Rated R.

200
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:30,917
GIGGLING…

201
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:32,452
You're teasing me, aren't you?

202
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:34,821
I wasn't sure.

203
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:35,955
A LATE BLOOMER

204
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:39,192
Who are you closest to these days?

205
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:40,860
Who do you meet most often
outside of work?

206
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:41,994
Today…

207
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,030
Hatchet Shot.

208
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:47,767
Sorry about that.

209
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:49,035
Don't be.

210
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:51,471
You seem to enjoy that nickname the most.

211
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:52,738
I'm proud to hear it,

212
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:53,706
Mr. Pelvis.

213
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:58,211
Nice. You made an effort.

214
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:02,014
Since I couldn't tell
where its limbs were,

215
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:03,349
I wasn't able to accessorize it

216
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,717
let alone dress it.

217
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,919
What now?

218
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,354
It's still naked.

219
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,690
Here. I'll give it a try.

220
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,558
I'm serious, it's unsalvageable.

221
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,826
It's just a square.

222
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:14,927
GENTLY

223
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:15,862
Is that for me?

224
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:18,297
-The fried egg…
-Why the fried egg?

225
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,933
Didn't you say it was cute earlier?

226
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,834
I did.

227
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,069
Look, there's even a fried egg.

228
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:24,537
Aren't these cute?

229
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:26,706
Did you remember that?

230
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,942
-I love fried eggs, you see.
-Really?

231
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:30,877
I love this color too.

232
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,245
-Burgundy, is it?
-Really?

233
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:34,447
TA-DA

234
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,048
TIMIDLY OFFERING THE DOLL SHE MADE

235
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,250
Sorry about this.

236
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,455
I suddenly had to cough.

237
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:45,057
It doesn't exactly make you
want to cough though.

238
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,393
It's cute.

239
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,095
-Right?
-It's missing its eyes.

240
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:49,996
It doesn't have any.

241
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:52,231
I'm leaving that to your imagination.

242
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:53,966
Thank you.

243
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:55,935
Carry it around with you.

244
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,037
It's cute. It feels nice as well.

245
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,473
I hear it's good

246
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,009
to stimulate your sense of touch
when you're stressed.

247
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,478
-Really?
-You'll feel better by touching things.

248
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,180
That's why people play with slime.

249
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:09,448
Yes, that does make you feel better.

250
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:10,683
It's called tactile play.

251
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,719
Is that doll salvageable?

252
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,154
Oh, right.

253
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,756
Oh, it has arms.

254
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,391
It has arms, but I couldn't grab them.

255
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,126
-That's why I couldn't dress it.
-First,

256
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,261
I think it needs a trim.

257
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,797
LAUGHING

258
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:29,468
SALVAGING THE BROWN DOLL DO-YEON MADE

259
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:31,170
FOCUSED

260
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,005
You're like Edward Scissorhands.

261
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:38,945
(FOCUSED)

262
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,479
-Are those its cheeks?
-Yes.

263
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:44,016
That's cute.

264
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,985
I made it work.

265
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,255
It's cute.

266
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,824
WITH A TRIM,
HE MANAGED TO GIVE IT ARMS AND LEGS

Next, we're headed…

269
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,998
-Is it already over?
-Yes.

270
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,934
You didn't expect it, but time flew by.

271
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,970
Are you we off to eat some more?

272
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,638
Oh, please.

273
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:06,973
You're right.

274
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,075
LAUGHING

275
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,310
I hear you're a big fan of loach soup,

276
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,179
so we prepared something similar.

277
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,614
-Really?
-Yes.

278
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,049
When will you pay me back?

279
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:21,354
Will it be over if I pay you back?

280
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,688
I mean, for real.

281
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:23,789
I can give you some.

282
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,659
Tae-goo, my young friend,

283
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:30,262
we're off to have one of your favorites,
spicy floating goby stew.

284
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:32,565
Why don't you follow me out
like a good boy?

285
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,733
Got it.

286
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,601
Tae-goo, aren't you excited?

287
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:36,736
CHUCKLING

288
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,537
CLAPPING

289
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,206
-Tae-goo's happy.
-Goodness.

290
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,509
He just played along
to get me off his back.

291
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,212
We'll take a taxi again.

292
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,215
I'm hanging mine on my purse.

293
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:50,449
Isn't this cute?

294
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:53,619
They're like siblings.

295
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,288
How sweet. He won't be as lonely anymore.

296
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:58,057
I felt bad it had to sit in the back
all by itself.

297
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,693
My purse looks more chic now.

298
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,628
It's adorable,
and it goes well with my purse.

299
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:05,097
I was too embarrassed earlier

300
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,299
to explain why I used stars for the eyes.

301
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,935
Since I was making it for you,

302
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:13,372
I wondered what to use for the eyes.

303
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:16,575
Then I noticed the color
matched your eyes.

304
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,411
Are you saying there are stars in my eyes?

305
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,746
Just stop it.

306
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,282
Fire Shot.

307
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,217
He said, "Fire Shot."

308
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,021
Hear me out. As we have dinner,

309
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,190
the sun will set.

310
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:32,925
-The day flies by.
-Tell me about it.

311
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,460
I should get on with more role-playing.

312
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,064
Please, don't.

313
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,566
I haven't seen someone
who's so keen on role-playing.

314
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,301
YEONGOK SPICY FLOATING GOBY STEW
25 MINUTES BY CAR

315
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:44,737
It's embarrassing to role-play

316
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,373
-but--
-From what I can tell,

317
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,608
you say you're embarrassed,

318
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:52,278
but you actually enjoy being embarrassed.

319
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:53,879
-Is that so?
-Yes.

320
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:55,648
-There may be another factor.
-What is it?

321
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:58,484
I'm terrible at these things,

322
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,720
but you keep

323
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:02,354
-I keep throwing things at you.
-…throwing things at me.

324
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,824
Since I have a hard time playing along

325
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,727
and haven't done much,

326
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:10,296
I believe role-playing is my way
of making up for it.

327
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:13,966
Are you feeling all right?

328
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,102
JUST AS WE'RE ABOUT TO FORGET,
HE ROLE-PLAYS

LAUGHING

330
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,208
This is something I heard about you.

331
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,977
Were you really mistaken
for an armed communist guerrilla?

332
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,346
Yes, back when I had filmed Epitaph.

333
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,948
-That movie was back in 2007, right?
-Yes.

334
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,549
It's the film where I had my first line.

335
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:33,919
It was around the time
you were on Talking Rated R.

336
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,788
Sorry about that.

337
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,523
You really know how to tease a person.

338
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,591
Sorry.

339
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,727
I absolutely enjoyed Epitaph.

340
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,829
It was too scary for me to watch.

341
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,431
-Really?
-Yes.

342
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:48,100
I kept my eyes closed
and my ears covered at the theater.

343
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,802
I messed up my line so badly

344
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,371
that I skipped lunch,

345
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,040
went into the woods, and practiced

346
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,675
holding my prop gun like this.

347
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,345
-I still remember the line.
-What was it?

348
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,380
"It was next to the dead body."

349
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:05,251
That's "It was next to the dead body"
in Japanese.

350
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,019
"It was next to the dead body."

351
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,488
I kept mumbling that in the woods,

352
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,290
which surprised the hikers

353
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:14,293
dressed as a member of the People's Army
and holding a gun.

354
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,897
I explained to them
that we were filming a movie,

355
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,866
then went back to practicing my line.

356
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,202
But when it came time to film,

357
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,037
I couldn't remember my line.

358
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,205
-You forgot?
-I forgot.

359
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,574
-Oh, no.
-My mind went blank.

360
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,545
What's it like in that moment?
Don't you get stuck even more?

361
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,246
Were you able to focus after that?

362
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,148
My older brother was part

363
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,817
of the production team.

364
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:40,319
You can imagine how embarrassing it was

365
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,655
to have a family member
watch you fumbling.

366
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,657
Your brother must've felt bad for you.

367
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,192
He came up to me and reminded me

368
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,694
that I had worked on a lot
of independent movies before.

369
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:50,563
I said I was fine,

370
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:51,964
putting on a strong front.

371
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,399
The director yelled "Action,"

372
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:55,067
and I stiffened up.

373
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,335
"It was next to…"

374
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,238
-And I kept apologizing.
-Oh, no.

375
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:02,541
It was later dubbed
by my Japanese teacher.

376
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:04,243
It's not my voice you hear.

377
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,811
Really?

378
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,214
After filming ended that day…

379
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,416
I remember this clearly.

380
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:12,351
I was sitting on this side,

381
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:13,986
and while looking out the window,

382
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,958
I kept thinking I should quit this job.

383
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,159
As in acting.

384
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,361
I couldn't even deliver one line.

385
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,864
It must've been painful for you.

386
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,032
I felt I should give up
trying to become an actor.

387
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,235
At what point did things change

388
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:32,938
and make you realize this was your path?

389
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,840
The project that made me realize
this was my career path

390
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,642
-was The Age of Shadows.
-The Age of Shadows?

391
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,110
It took quite a long time.

392
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,045
Didn't you play a Japanese character
in that movie?

393
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:44,216
I studied Japanese, still shaken
from the experience in Epitaph.

394
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:46,986
Thanks to that,
I was able to overcome my trauma.

395
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:51,657
Finally being acknowledged wasn't
the reason I wanted to keep acting.

396
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,160
As I worked with the director
and other senior actors,

397
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,864
I realized what I had been doing
wasn't so wrong.

398
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:02,167
It was the first time I felt that on set.

399
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,237
Up until then,
most of the feedback I got was negative,

400
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:09,008
saying what I was doing was wrong.

401
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,109
Meanwhile, on that movie set,

402
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,645
they told me I was doing well.

403
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,314
I was complimented

404
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,550
for my work in many ways.

405
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:22,521
To hear praise from people
I considered moguls in the field

406
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,090
made me realize
I was doing something right.

407
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:28,027
I realized we were heading
in the same direction.

408
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,396
That's when

409
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,731
I told myself to keep acting

410
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,501
even though it came with challenges.

411
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,670
That was when I truly saw acting
as my line of work.

412
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:41,373
It took you a while, given you felt that
during The Age of Shadows.

413
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,509
Up until then, I often wondered

414
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:45,844
if I should quit this job.

415
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,481
Now that you have many projects
under your belt,

416
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,550
are you still nervous on set,

417
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,787
or do you enjoy it more?

418
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:57,056
Rather than the excitement…

419
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,290
Are you still worried?

420
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,959
Yes, I'm more worried.

421
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:00,859
-Really?
-Yes.

422
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:02,461
Has this ever happened?

423
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,463
Was there a scene you went into

424
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,732
knowing you had it down?

425
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,667
Having that kind of confidence

426
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,202
usually ends badly.

427
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,639
Besides, it's hard to feel that way
before a shoot.

428
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,140
You're probably aware of this too,

429
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,842
but you can't prepare for everything

430
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,011
because people aren't machines.

431
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,879
You can't always perform exactly
as you practiced.

432
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:23,482
You never know what'll happen.

433
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:26,185
In that sense,
it's much like a boxing match.

434
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,386
No matter the training,

435
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,022
you can't predict
how your opponent will strike

436
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,590
until you're in the ring.

437
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:35,694
That's why I believe I'm nervous on set

438
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,663
the way a boxer is

439
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,332
before stepping into the ring.

440
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,135
How is it for you, Do-yeon?

441
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:45,537
There must be days when you lose focus

442
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:48,340
or things just don't go your way.

443
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,042
-A lot, actually.
-Of course.

444
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,844
I still haven't gotten used to this.

445
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,946
-I meet new guests,
-You always meet someone new.

446
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,383
and the situation is unstable
because it depends on our condition.

447
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:00,085
But there are moments

448
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:04,123
when I can't believe
how enjoyable things turn out.

449
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,158
When our conversations click like a dream,

450
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:09,061
it gives me purpose and joy.

451
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,196
That joy and momentum
keep me going for a few months.

452
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:12,564
That feeling is brief though.

453
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,299
Exactly. It doesn't last.

454
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,235
While performing my scenes,

455
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:19,238
I feel overjoyed by how alive I am
in those moments.

456
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:22,508
That footage of me acting
is so precious to me.

457
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:23,575
I see.

458
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:24,510
That moment.

459
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:26,812
Have you had moments like that too?

460
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:27,880
Too many.

461
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,416
I find myself looking up videos of me
quite often.

462
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,651
Check out the clouds. Aren't they cool?

463
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:34,653
Hold on. I'd…

464
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:37,623
-I'd like to throw it.
-Throw what?

465
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:39,091
The Hatchet Shot. Sorry about that.

466
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,628
LAUGHING

467
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:44,063
The clouds are pretty.

468
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:46,231
Tell me about it. What a sight.

469
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,767
These talks we have in cabs

470
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:49,968
have been really comfortable.

471
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:52,571
I wouldn't mind taking one to Seoul
and talking the whole way.

472
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:55,240
Are you sure about that?

473
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:56,542
There aren't a lot of people

474
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,410
-in front of us.
-Is that why?

475
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:01,447
You might be uncomfortable filming on set

476
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,582
because you feel pressure to deliver.

477
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,851
Something about it is very relaxing.

478
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:07,686
Do you like eating fish?

479
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,356
It's not my favorite,
but I don't mind fish in stews.

480
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,158
Deboning the fish is such a hassle.

481
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,896
Sir, has Gangneung always been known
for floating goby?

482
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:19,998
Yes, I often eat
at this restaurant myself.

483
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,233
Really? Is it a place you eat at?

484
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,669
That means the food is good.

485
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,938
I haven't told anyone about this place.

486
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:27,906
They say taxi drivers
know all the best spots.

487
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:29,074
Exactly.

488
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,909
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

489
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:33,812
You're still holding on tight
to Yohan-utan.

490
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,315
-Spicy floating goby stew.
-Let's go.

491
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:39,384
Judging by the cars,
a lot of people must be here to eat.

492
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,655
I'm excited about the food.

493
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:45,757
Just look at the hall packed with people.

494
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,126
They must serve tasty food.

495
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:49,962
Something smells delicious.

496
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:51,263
It tells you
about the spicy floating goby stew.

497
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:55,067
Look. That's what
a floating goby looks like.

498
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,502
Aren't they adorable?

499
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:01,039
We'll have one spicy floating goby stew,

500
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:02,841
a medium-sized deep-fried sweetfish,

501
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,376
and one buckwheat pancake.

502
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,478
-Sure thing.
-Thank you.

503
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:09,014
Do you like trying new food?

504
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:12,084
I stick to what I'm used to
when I eat alone,

505
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,921
but I'm not picky when dining with others.

506
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,689
What do you eat when it's just you?

507
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:20,993
When I'm just with my manager,

508
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,495
I'll have the Korean thistle rice combo,

509
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,531
or we'll go
for spicy hairy crab and catfish stew.

510
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,266
Spicy hairy crab and catfish stew?

511
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,902
When I'm busy filming,

512
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:30,869
I usually eat those two dishes.

513
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,804
It's my way of eating healthy.

514
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,673
Besides, they're delicious.

515
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,241
Is there a dish
you've been hooked on lately?

516
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,809
I've been eating a lot of sujebi.

517
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,077
Sujebi?

518
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:42,114
It was so good I ate it for days.

519
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,316
You must be the type to stick
to one dish once you're hooked.

520
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,185
Either that, or I have similar dishes.

521
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:48,620
Here's your deep-fried sweetfish.

522
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,556
-No way!
-Thank you.

523
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,324
You have it, bone and all.

524
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:53,458
FRIED SWEETFISH

525
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,560
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

526
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,595
The fish is in season, so enjoy.

527
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,330
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

528
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,599
-Go ahead.
-Sure.

529
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,567
No way.

530
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,503
Isn't this a lot like deep-fried loach?

531
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,671
I think so.

532
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,775
CRUNCH!

533
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:13,512
Gosh, that's hot.

534
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,548
NODDING

535
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:20,819
This tastes so satisfying.

536
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,254
It's seriously good.

537
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,156
Seriously good?
It's really good, isn't it?

538
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,725
It's eye-opening.

539
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,196
CRUNCH!

540
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,699
That's delicious,
and the sweetfish is plump.

541
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:35,567
I like it more because it's plump.

542
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:38,103
-It's nice to get a mouthful of meat.
-Exactly.

543
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,439
I understand why our cab driver said that.

544
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:41,640
It's so good.

545
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:43,842
What did they do to make the batter

546
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,211
-this crunchy?
-It's really good.

547
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:47,212
I'd like some more.

548
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,081
Go ahead.

549
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,184
DIPPING IT IN THE SAUCE THIS TIME

550
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,358
It's almost like having
a mouthful of mackerel.

551
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,029
Who knew sweetfish was this tasty?

552
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,264
It's really good.

553
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:08,233
Having deep-fried sweetfish

554
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,636
-makes me want some chili.
-Does it?

555
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:14,106
This must be chili that's been deep-fried.

556
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,241
-Hello.
-Here's the spicy floating goby stew.

557
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,911
SPICY FLOATING GOBY STEW

558
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:21,146
HESITANT

559
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:24,149
I'd like to know
about spicy floating goby stew.

560
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:27,219
The floating goby is a freshwater fish

561
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,355
that lives in streams

562
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:33,592
where seawater and freshwater meet.

563
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,927
The fish itself is unattractive,

564
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,096
yet it has few bones.

565
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:39,631
-I see.
-It has few bones,

566
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:40,899
so it's easy to eat

567
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,567
since there's less risk
of getting pricked by bones.

568
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,002
That sounds good for stews.

569
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,004
What's a good way to enjoy the stew?

570
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,406
There's sujebi inside.

571
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,309
Pour some into your bowl,

572
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,444
add some rice, but not too much of it.

573
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:54,146
Just a scoop will do.

574
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:56,381
If you add too much rice,
the soup will thicken,

575
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:57,949
and the rice will get soggy.

576
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:00,585
You may add the garlic right now.

577
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,220
How much should we add?

578
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:03,855
That's quality garlic,

579
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:05,324
-so you can add it all.
-Really?

580
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,192
I'll add this
since we won't be kissing today.

581
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:08,393
GIGGLING

582
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,728
Should I leave this out just in case?

583
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:10,929
Don't you remember?

584
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,831
What? Not again!

585
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:13,765
Sorry about that.

586
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,167
STARTLED
SHE DROPS ALL THE GARLIC IN

587
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:16,301
I'm so sorry.

588
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:18,804
You win, okay?

589
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:20,472
HANDS FLYING AROUND WITH URGENCY

590
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,507
Tae-goo, you're no joke.

591
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,242
He's so charming.

592
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:26,478
FLOPPING DOWN

593
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,748
My god.

594
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:32,584
As you can see, the stew is already done.

595
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,820
That's pepper at the end,

596
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:36,822
and the other one is Sichuan pepper.

597
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:38,790
-Don't you have that with loach soup?
-It has an aroma.

598
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,792
-Should we add some?
-If you add too much,

599
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,761
it won't be edible, so be careful.

600
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,296
Got it, ma'am.

601
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,230
-Are you good?
-Thank you.

602
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:46,832
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

603
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,867
THE CHARMING RESTAURANT OWNER
EXPLAINS THE DISH

604
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:50,602
Isn't she sweet?

605
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:52,471
This is what I mean
by clicking with people.

606
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,839
I see.

607
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:57,509
What a gem.
You meet people like her once in a while.

608
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:58,844
Gosh, thanks.

609
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:01,780
No, let me.

610
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,116
Gosh, the smell.

611
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:06,518
-How can it not be delicious?
-I bet it's good.

612
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,120
That's going to be good.

613
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:09,855
-Here.
-Thanks.

614
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:12,124
-Careful, it's hot.
-I got it.

615
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,892
Add them to your liking.

616
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,294
Peppering in pepper.

617
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:17,362
-Isn't that too much?
-And you?

618
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:18,296
Absolutely.

619
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,766
I was goofing around and added too much.

620
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,634
This is just like the pepper coffee.

621
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,636
I don't think that'll be good for you.

622
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:26,905
-It's fine.
-We'll do this.

623
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:29,174
I'll take some of it from your bowl.

624
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,178
How sweet of you.

625
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,080
Why did I add all that garlic?

626
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,882
I couldn't quite get it.

627
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:38,617
You chose to ignore that line?

628
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:39,885
-I didn't catch it.
-It's fine.

629
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:41,153
-What did you say?
-It's okay.

630
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:42,988
Don't bother
with dirty comments like that.

631
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:45,223
You already took enough pepper.

632
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,092
That's enough pepper for three months.

633
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,760
All done.

634
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:50,429
-I'll now add Sichuan pepper.
-Sure.

635
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,097
How much did you add?

636
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:53,665
-Just that much.
-This much?

637
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,501
Got it. Gosh, that's good.

638
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:58,036
The Sichuan pepper

639
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,638
-Really?
-has a strong aroma.

640
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,975
-You're right, it's pretty strong.
-Right?

641
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:05,143
It's good.

642
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:06,978
There's sujebi in this.

643
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,115
It's a dish you can only have
in Gangneung.

644
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:11,216
This is…

645
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,417
It's nice.

646
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:15,287
The flavors are deeper than in loach soup,

647
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:16,521
yet still clean.

648
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:18,757
In general, they taste very different,

649
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:21,026
-and this is delicious.
-It's good.

650
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:21,960
I'm lost for words.

651
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:23,795
How can the sujebi be this chewy?

652
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:25,497
It falls somewhere between loach soup

653
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:27,466
and a spicy fish stew.

654
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,835
That sounded like a poem.

655
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,503
SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN LOACH SOUP
AND A SPICY FISH STEW

656
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,905
-I'll add some rice to mine.
-Sure.

657
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,907
It was recommended by the owner.

658
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,108
This is something else.

659
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,278
Have you had potato rice before?

660
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,281
-No.
-It's a first for me too.

661
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,624
What?

662
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:59,498
It's not just a chili.

663
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:01,700
There's something in it.

664
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,402
There's something chewy inside.

665
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:06,004
Could it be sticky rice?

666
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:07,672
It has a sticky texture.

667
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:10,242
-I ate it, but I can't tell what it is.
-Right?

668
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:11,977
Should we ask the restaurant owner?

669
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:15,080
Ma'am, what's inside the deep-fried chili?

670
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:16,948
-Where?
-Inside the deep-fried chili.

671
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,551
There isn't anything inside it.

672
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,921
They're just the seeds.

673
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,858
Nothing's inside them.

674
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:29,528
-I chewed something soft.
-Something soft and sticky.

675
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:32,297
It could be the part of the chili

676
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,734
-that holds the seeds.
-The seeds?

677
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,270
-That could be what you tasted.
-I see.

678
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:40,672
-That part of the chili was so delicious.
-Is that so?

679
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:43,475
We asked if it was something special
since it tasted too good

680
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,043
to be just a chili.

681
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,177
-Really?
-Yes.

682
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:47,946
SWOOSH

683
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:51,483
-Are you enjoying the food?
-We absolutely are.

684
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,084
Gosh, thank you.

685
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:54,019
That was embarrassing.

686
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,987
What's your favorite?

687
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:58,557
What surprised me the most

688
00:25:58,623 --> 00:25:59,824
-The sweetfish?
-was the deep-fried fish.

689
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:00,992
I know. It's so good.

690
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,260
I should have one more.

691
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:03,295
Please go ahead.

692
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,965
CRUNCH!

693
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:08,900
Are you okay not role-playing right now?

694
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,068
What was that?

695
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:14,873
This is getting old.

696
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:17,976
You know I'm kidding, right?

697
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,244
I don't.

698
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:23,582
How about an acrostic poem
for Sichuan pepper?

699
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:24,583
SMIRKING…

700
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:26,084
Sorry, just kidding.

701
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,853
I'm the worst, aren't I?

702
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,988
I'm down for it.

703
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:31,323
Gosh, no.

704
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:32,257
I'm up for it.

705
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:33,291
-Really?
-Yes.

706
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:34,225
S.

707
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,760
Did you see him?

708
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:37,395
P.

709
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:38,797
That was me.

710
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:41,299
DID YOU SEE HIM?
THAT WAS ME…

711
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:43,501
EMBARRASSED

712
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:46,972
You're quite good at it.

713
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:50,442
Nicely done, Tae-goo.

714
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:51,710
THUMBS-UP

715
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,677
Gang.

716
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:55,246
-Yes?
-Gangneung.

717
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:56,214
I see.

718
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,382
Gang.

719
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,417
Kang Ho-dong…

720
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:00,318
Neung.

721
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:03,822
Oh, no. This is bad.

722
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:05,790
I need a do-over.

723
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:06,891
-I'm so sorry.
-Don't.

724
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,393
Gangneung was a tough one.

725
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,861
Don't apologize. Neung, was it?

726
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:12,097
Jeez.

727
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:15,266
This rice paddle is adorable.

728
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,568
Rice.

729
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,036
RICE PADDLE

730
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:19,404
You're coming at it, looking to kill.

731
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,307
-Paddle.
-Paddle?

732
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:25,343
Don't worry. I have your back,

733
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,312
so take your time.

734
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,550
Nice, Tae-goo. You can get off work!

735
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,353
That'll be all.

736
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:39,090
You're free to go home.
I should learn from you.

737
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,191
Thanks for that.

738
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:41,893
Nice. What was that?

739
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,162
-That was incredible.
-Thank you.

740
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,364
Not being able to come up with one
for Gangneung hurt my pride.

741
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,901
I started off with a senior I respect,

742
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,036
but I couldn't complete it.

743
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:53,805
That was painful. Neung?

744
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:55,306
What starts with "neung"?

745
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:57,008
Neung.

746
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,578
See if this is good enough.

747
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:02,647
-Gang.
-Gang.

748
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:04,315
Kang Ho-dong said this.

749
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:07,352
-Neung.
-Some shingled hedgehog, ma'am!

750
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,354
Yes?

751
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:10,755
THE RESTAURANT OWNER ACTUALLY RESPONDED

752
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:12,824
(WHAT CAN I GET YOU?)

753
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:14,793
I wanted to tell you
how good everything is.

754
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:15,760
It's so good.

755
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:17,362
-Do you mean that?
-Absolutely.

756
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,764
I'm sorry I called you when you were busy.

757
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,199
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

758
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:22,567
I love you.

759
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,103
She gave her love only to Tae-goo.

760
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:27,572
My stomach hurts.

761
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:30,408
Now that we've enjoyed a delicious meal…

762
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:31,643
What would you like to do next?

763
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,646
After a meal, I always want coffee.

764
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,481
Really? Then…

765
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,451
Since we're in coffee capital today
for the coffee,

766
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:42,120
we'll go and enjoy some.

767
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:44,055
-I enjoyed the meal.
-I enjoyed it too.

768
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,227
I spotted something surprising.

769
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:53,765
This spicy floating goby stew and I
were both born in the same year.

770
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:54,899
How's that for a forced link?

771
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:56,101
-You two are pals.
-Sure.

772
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:57,302
Thanks, my friend.

773
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,305
I already saved the location on my phone.

774
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:01,406
Really?

775
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,742
I should save it on my phone too.

776
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:05,376
This is how you do it.

777
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:08,379
Save it in your heart.

778
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:09,347
CHUCKLING

779
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,216
SAVE

780
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:12,450
Did you think I wouldn't know?

781
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,122
You're scaring me now.

782
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:19,791
What's the real you?
I'm leaving without you,

783
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:21,860
so take the next cab. What the heck?

784
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,928
Jeez, I didn't know the monkey
was already inside.

785
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:25,063
Hop in on the other side.

786
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:26,865
Do you have any regrets today?

787
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,099
Regrets?

788
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:29,567
I don't think you're the type

789
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:32,170
to say you did everything proudly
and to the fullest.

790
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:33,705
I bet you always feel like
you could've done more.

791
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:35,273
That's true.

792
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,543
If I talked too much,
I'd wonder if I went too far.

793
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,979
If I didn't talk much,
I'd feel bad about it.

794
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:42,280
That's how I am.

795
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:45,216
I was going to describe it as adequate,

796
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,318
but it turned out better than good today.

797
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:49,587
I love how much you talked today,

798
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:51,055
and don't even get me started
on the role-playing.

799
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,457
EVEN THE ROLE-PLAYING… LOL

800
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:54,025
-You gave a lot.
-What was that?

801
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:55,493
Sorry about that.

802
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,295
Were you teasing me again?

803
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:59,998
I'm not kidding when I say

804
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:02,066
you scare me now.

805
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:06,404
-I should stop…
-You're like an agent in the shadows.

806
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,672
but I can't.

807
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:08,973
You're having fun, aren't you?

808
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,141
I bet you're addicted now.

809
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:11,176
(ADDICTED TO ROLE-PLAYING)

810
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:12,911
Look at him.

811
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,246
He keeps playing with the toes.

812
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,381
This?

813
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:18,516
I can't help it.

814
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:19,951
FIDGETING

815
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,754
I bet

816
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,257
you call Eom-ji in a different tone.

817
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,860
"Eom-ji!" I speak like that.

818
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:30,495
-Eom-ji! It's so cute.
-How about this?

819
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:33,398
When people see babies or cute pets,

820
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:35,500
they coo at them.

821
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:36,868
Not me.

822
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,671
SCRATCHING

823
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:41,673
COOING…

824
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:43,374
COOING…

825
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:44,475
SWEETIE…

826
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,978
LAUGHING

827
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:49,447
I talked a lot and did some weird things.

828
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,082
-With Eom-ji?
-No, today in general.

829
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,085
Oh, no.

830
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:57,255
I'm worried you'll stop speaking
after today

831
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:58,156
because of me.

832
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:00,792
What if you let all the words
inside you out today?

833
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,927
I even said things

834
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:04,495
I would never tell my friends.

835
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:07,232
NOT FORGETTING YOHAN-UTAN

836
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:09,100
-This place…
-Is the coffee good?

837
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,501
It's one of Gangneung's

838
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:11,836
-top three coffee places.
-Really?

839
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:13,371
It feels nice to be here.

840
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,342
Choose whatever you want.

841
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:19,444
Wait, over here.

842
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:21,646
They have a signature coffee.

843
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,848
Would you like its signature coffee?

844
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:25,884
-We'll take two of the signature coffee.
-Two?

845
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,286
-We'll call 479 when it's ready.
-Sure.

846
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:29,654
Thank you.

847
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,423
-Thank you.
-Rather than number 479,

848
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,325
can you call us Pelvis?

849
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,426
Pelvis or…

850
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,097
Hatchet Shot! That's also a good one.

851
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:40,365
Choose whichever you want.

852
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:43,534
That was clever of you.

853
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:44,769
PELVIS VS HATCHET SHOT
WHICH ONE WILL THE OWNER CHOOSE?

854
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:47,005
STARING

855
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:50,808
Seeing him in this setting
feels like a scene

856
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:53,044
from a Hong Sang-soo movie.

857
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:55,013
Wrong Then and Wrong Now.

858
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:58,516
Wrong Then and Still Wrong Now.

859
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:00,385
Now that she's said it,

860
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:02,287
I feel it too.

861
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:04,789
-Feel what?
-It's like we're on I'm SOLO.

862
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:06,190
Right now?

863
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,392
WHEN IT'S GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI?

864
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:09,193
What would you like your name to be?

865
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:13,831
I'm Yeong-suk from the 22nd class.

866
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:15,566
-Yeong-suk?
-Yes, from the 22nd class.

867
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:16,668
What about you?

868
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,736
-Give me any name you want.
-Any name?

869
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:20,571
Yeong-su's popular, so go with that.

870
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:22,307
-Yeong-su?
-Yeong-su of the 22nd class.

871
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:23,474
Can't you be Ok-sun?

872
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:26,077
Of course I can't.
That's a name for the pretty ones.

873
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:27,111
You'll be Ok-sun.

874
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:28,947
No, stop it.

875
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:31,849
Since we're having Chodang corn coffee,
I'll be Ok-sun today.

876
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,253
OK-SUN, THE FEMME FATALE OF GANGNEUNG
WHO REMINDS YOU OF YOUR FIRST LOVE

877
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:38,957
YEONG-SU AND OK-SUN'S FIRST SUPER DATE

878
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,660
Yeong-su, what do you do
in your free time?

879
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:44,595
In my free time?

880
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:46,564
I think of you, Ok-sun.

881
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,101
YEONG-SU SEIZES THE OPPORTUNITY
TO FLIRT WITH OK-SUN

882
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:54,405
No one has ever been this forward before.

883
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,373
Sorry about that.

884
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,309
-Don't be.
-Just being here alone with you

885
00:32:58,376 --> 00:32:59,777
excited me.

886
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:02,780
This is us cashing in
on the super date ticket.

887
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:06,384
Why did you choose me, of all people,
for the date?

888
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:07,418
Was it me?

889
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,087
(WAS IT ME WHO CHOSE YOU FOR THE DATE?)

890
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,288
Was it my ticket?

891
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:11,322
I see.

892
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,691
I chose you

893
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:17,762
because you introduced yourself in a rap.

894
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:20,865
I didn't expect that from you,
so I was amazed.

895
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,034
It's why I wanted
to get to know you better.

896
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,004
-I'm honored.
-Don't be.

897
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,972
I still can't believe

898
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:31,309
I got the chance to spend time with you.

899
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:32,844
You're so popular, after all.

900
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,345
Meanwhile, nobody's interested in me.

901
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:37,048
Didn't you say Yeong-cheol
was your dream guy?

902
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:40,318
-You did.
-Oh, that?

903
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,854
Maybe it's childish,

904
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,655
but I wanted to make you jealous.

905
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:48,559
-That's why--
-Did you use me to make him jealous?

906
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:49,861
No, it's the other way around.

907
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:50,928
YEONG-SU THREATENED BY YEONG-CHEOL

908
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:52,930
-Either way,
-Yes?

909
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:54,599
I'm honored.

910
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,634
YEONG-SU CONFESSES

911
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,269
Either way?

912
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,440
Will you hang out in the living room
when we get back,

913
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:03,674
or just head straight to bed?

914
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:05,576
I'm going jogging tomorrow morning.

915
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:07,045
(ADORABLE)

916
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:09,781
Tomorrow morning,

917
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:11,716
I'm going for a jog.

918
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:15,386
-What time do you wake up?
-Sorry? Oh, me?

919
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:17,422
I don't sleep a lot,

920
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:18,823
so around 3 a.m.

921
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,292
-Three?
-Yes, I'll be running for four hours.

922
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,362
I don't mind that myself.
I quite like running at full speed.

923
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:26,497
I'd like to switch seats.

924
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:29,500
YEONG-SU SUDDENLY GETS UP FROM HIS SEAT?!

925
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,435
Why?

926
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:36,474
AN UNEXPECTED TURN OF EVENTS(?)
YEONG-SU HEADS OVER TO OK-SUN

927
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,078
HE RUNS AWAY, UNABLE TO SIT NEXT TO HER

928
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,316
OK-SUN'S HEART SKIPS A BEAT
AT YEONG-SU'S BOLDNESS

929
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:46,617
My gosh.

930
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:48,252
That fox.

931
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,322
It thought my heart was about to burst.

932
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:54,158
Yeong-su!

933
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:55,760
This is Ok-sun.

934
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:59,297
Have coffee with me!

935
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:03,901
A MAN IN LOVE NEVER LEAVES HER CONFUSED
HE ALWAYS FINDS THE COURAGE

936
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:07,004
We wrapped up that I'm SOLO sketch

937
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:08,306
on a high note.

938
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:11,409
Your acting is always so convincing.

939
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:14,512
Why waste your talent
on something like this?

940
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:17,381
Mr. Pelvis, your coffee is ready.

941
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,550
UM PELVIS IS OFF

942
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:22,320
GIGGLING

943
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:24,622
-The buns are on the house.
-We'll enjoy it.

944
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,891
Hey, there, Mr. Pelvis.

945
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,960
Shouldn't you have returned
shaking those hips?

946
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:30,761
Ok-sun, just a second.

947
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:32,263
I thought we were done with that sketch.

948
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:34,298
-No way.
-Here you go.

949
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:35,633
The salt buns are huge.

950
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,935
They were on the house.

951
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:41,405
-Let's enjoy.
-Enjoy.

952
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,373
Thank you.

953
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,245
A SIP OF CREAMY LATTE
WITH THE AROMA OF CORN

954
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:51,315
Gosh!

955
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:52,717
That's so good.

956
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:55,219
SMIRKING

957
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:00,758
Since the smell of the corn

958
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:02,927
wasn't overpowering,

959
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,263
I figured I'd taste more of the coffee.

960
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:07,932
That cream on top is heavenly.

961
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,500
That's really good.

962
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:10,968
Gangneung

963
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,371
-truly is the coffee…
-The coffee capital.

964
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:14,772
-It's true.
-I know.

965
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:18,042
I love how the coffee comes through
just as it gets too sweet.

966
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:19,777
-It has a nutty taste too.
-Right.

967
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:22,513
BOTTOMS UP

968
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:24,115
Goodness.

969
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:27,218
People might think we starved you
on the show.

970
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:29,554
Of all the coffee you had today,

971
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,055
which one was your favorite?

972
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:34,025
The pepper coffee and this.

973
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:36,227
Anyway, this…

974
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:38,429
SMACKING LIPS, WANTING MORE…

975
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:39,564
Would you like some more?

976
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:41,732
Is that okay?

977
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:43,267
Of course.

978
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:44,936
We can get you as many as you want.

979
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:47,438
-Miss, can we order another cup of coffee?
-Sure.

980
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,507
-When it's ready…
-Please remove your card.

981
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,642
can you call for Mr. Dancing Hips?

982
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:53,211
Got it.

983
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:56,047
-I doubt I'll be back here.
-Here?

984
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:58,382
Isn't Gangneung famous for its corn?

985
00:36:58,449 --> 00:36:59,684
Is Chodang corn famous here?

986
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,119
It may taste different
since the corn is local.

987
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:04,488
It's more than just delicious.

988
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,591
It's deliciously unique,

989
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:08,326
and that only doubles the joy.

990
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,227
CHODANG CORN COFFEE
IS UNIQUE AND DELICIOUS

991
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:10,761
It's not easy to nail both.

992
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:15,132
Just now, it felt like I was talking
to a poet from Gangneung.

993
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,367
How about another round?

994
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:18,536
Gosh, no. Please, no!

995
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:20,371
I'm too tired for this now.

996
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:21,839
I'm exhausted.

997
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,774
I'm not kidding when I say

998
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:26,744
this exhausts me more than anything else
in my ten years of comedy sketches.

999
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,546
When you first saw me,

1000
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:31,816
did you ever think
we'd end up here together?

1001
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:34,685
IS HE STILL ROLE-PLAYING…?

1002
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,421
Do you know what's scary?

1003
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:39,957
I've done a lot of sketches with Se-chan,

1004
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:42,059
and he gives a signal before starting one.

1005
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:44,695
He grunts or does something similar
before he gets into it.

1006
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:47,632
You jump right into it without a heads-up.

1007
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:48,599
That confused me a bit.

1008
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,167
YOU CAN'T LET YOUR GUARD DOWN
SINCE HE CAN START A SKETCH AT ANY TIME

1009
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:52,670
-On trips--
-Mr. Dancing Hips, your order is ready.

1010
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:54,472
MR. DANCING HIPS GOES
TO PICK UP THE COFFEE

1011
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:57,708
I guess I didn't quite
catch the name earlier.

1012
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,043
I finally got it.

1013
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:03,114
You don't actually have to dance, okay?

1014
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,816
Thank you. I'll enjoy the coffee.

1015
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:07,184
I didn't catch what she just said.

1016
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:09,754
You don't actually have to dance.

1017
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,689
AH

1018
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:12,657
CHUCKLING

1019
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:15,259
LAUGHING

1020
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,897
HE TAKES A SIP OF THE COFFEE
THE MOMENT HE SITS

1021
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,166
-Is it good?
-It's delicious.

1022
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:23,768
-Is it?
-Yes.

1023
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:26,003
I'm glad you're enjoying it,
even though I didn't make it.

1024
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,072
(SMILING)

1025
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:32,677
At what point
do you circle your arms like this?

1026
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:34,945
When I feel awkward,

1027
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:36,714
embarrassed,

1028
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:38,649
unsure of what to do,

1029
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:39,817
or shy.

1030
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:41,385
Is that when you open your chest
like this?

1031
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:43,754
I wonder how many times
you'll repeat this move tomorrow.

1032
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:45,690
STRETCHING

1033
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:49,026
I knew this move looked familiar.

1034
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:52,229
Yo-han also did this a lot
during our trip.

1035
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:54,532
Did they teach you this move
at the agency?

1036
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:55,766
Is it a morning stretch?

1037
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:56,701
Did he do this too?

1038
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:58,836
On Salon Drip 2,

1039
00:38:58,903 --> 00:38:59,904
he kept doing this.

1040
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,873
I remember it because it stood out to me.

1041
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,443
Excuse me,
but can I stand up for a little bit?

1042
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:10,815
YO-HAN DID THE SAME EXACT MOVE AS TAE-GOO

1043
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:12,550
It's the same move.

1044
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:16,454
He must be more comfortable now,

1045
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,889
since his sleeves aren't hiked up
like they were this morning.

1046
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:21,559
Come to think of it,
you were sitting on a bench

1047
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:24,562
at Jeongdongjin Beach this morning.

1048
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:27,198
Doesn't the day feel long to you?

1049
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:28,999
It's been a long day.

1050
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:30,601
But then again,

1051
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:32,136
the time flew by.

1052
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,472
Sometimes when traveling,

1053
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:36,974
time seems to move differently.

1054
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,509
You're right.

1055
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:41,612
-How was it today?
-Today?

1056
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:43,848
I was worried
when we got to the restaurant.

1057
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:46,517
You didn't invite me just to eat.

1058
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:50,454
I feel guilty every time
you bring that up.

1059
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:51,355
We're not here to just eat.

1060
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:52,957
It's not like we're just here to eat.

1061
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:56,827
I kept thinking about
how I could do a better job.

1062
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,763
The only things I could rely on

1063
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:00,364
were role-playing and sketches.

1064
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,969
You came out swinging
with what you could do best.

1065
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:06,971
It felt like my only lifeline.

1066
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:10,274
I'm glad you went along with it
so naturally.

1067
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:12,576
This show has been so fortunate
with all of its guests.

1068
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:15,045
You gave us so much more

1069
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:16,580
than we expected today,

1070
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:18,315
so join me tomorrow

1071
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:19,483
feeling at ease.

1072
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,951
That's a thought for tomorrow.

1073
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:21,986
So when will you pay me back?

1074
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,322
That sketch
where I borrowed money from you.

1075
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:29,059
Do I actually have to pay you
for it to end?

1076
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:33,197
It feels more like you're threatening me
than doing a sketch.

1077
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,698
I gave it a try one last time.

1078
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:36,834
THEY FINISH THE LAST OF THEIR COFFEE TOO

1079
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:39,136
I'm looking forward to the coffee places
we'll visit tomorrow.

1080
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:40,805
-I'm glad.
-Everything was so good today.

1081
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:42,907
Though I'm not the cafe owner,
hearing that makes me proud.

1082
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:45,843
Then, here's a heartfelt question.

1083
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,078
We've been traveling together
for 12 hours now.

1084
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:53,984
On a scale,
how would you rate our closeness?

1085
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:57,221
From 1 to 100, where are we?

1086
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,689
Rock-paper-scissors.
The winner goes first.

1087
00:40:58,756 --> 00:40:59,857
-Rock-paper-scissors.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

1088
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:00,758
WIN, LOSE

1089
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:03,260
I need to give a good answer.

1090
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:04,728
This is just how I feel right now.

1091
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,798
I'd rate us at 71.

1092
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:09,800
TOUCHED

1093
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,669
Feel free to say a low number
if you'd like.

1094
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,505
PONDERING

1095
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:16,273
Do you feel guilty
because your number is low?

1096
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,274
It's fine.

1097
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:18,642
If a close friend is…

1098
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:19,810
A close friend?

1099
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:23,914
Let's say a close friend would
be somewhere between 70 and 100.

1100
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,683
It all comes down to
how you define the numbers.

1101
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:26,684
Absolutely.

1102
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:29,820
For me, a best friend would score 100.

1103
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:35,559
A person I stay in touch with
and spend time with…

1104
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:36,727
What would be the score?

1105
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:39,964
From 40

1106
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:42,366
-Between that and 60?
-to 60.

1107
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:43,734
Where would I be at?

1108
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,336
Since we just met…

1109
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:50,207
A closeness of zero?
Do I even count as a person to you?

1110
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:52,610
So from zero to 40…

1111
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,712
I'd rate you at 28.

1112
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:56,013
28 OUT OF 100

1113
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,683
I bet you said 28 just to cuss at me.

1114
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:01,585
Right?

1115
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,022
How can you rate me at 28?

1116
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,892
Since you couldn't say 18 outright,

1117
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:10,227
you went with 28 instead, didn't you?

1118
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:13,197
Who knew our trip would end
on such a sour note?

1119
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:14,098
SOBBING WITH TEARS OF JOY

1120
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:16,100
Thank you for that.

1121
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,537
Tomorrow, I'll call you 28.

1122
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:21,272
Sorry about that.

1123
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:23,440
We'll revisit that score again tomorrow.

1124
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:24,675
Yes, of course.

1125
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:26,710
I'd be glad just to keep
the score I got today.

1126
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:29,046
We'll have another fun day tomorrow,

1127
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:31,515
-so get some good sleep tonight.
-You all did great today.

1128
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:33,284
We really appreciate your hard work today.

1129
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,486
-I really mean that.
-Jeez.

1130
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,487
Tomorrow,

1131
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:38,756
I'll give it my best again.

1132
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:40,090
We'll regroup feeling recharged.

1133
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:42,393
-We'll meet outside the hotel at 8:30 a.m.
-Sure.

1134
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:44,929
All right. Off we go.

1135
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:46,830
Sure. You did great today.

1136
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,933
Gosh. I had a lot of fun.

1137
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:56,740
(HE ALMOST LEFT YOHAN-UTAN BEHIND)

1138
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:58,943
GOOD NIGHT: )

1139
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:01,645
THE FIRST NIGHT WITH TAE-GOO,
THE MASTER OF SKETCHES, IS OVER

1140
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:04,081
Hello, it's day two.

1141
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:05,316
I'm Umtaeguriguri.

1142
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,651
Ok-sun, did you sleep well?

1143
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:09,486
Wait, am I Ok-sun?

1144
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:10,721
Don't worry and just have the meat.

1145
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:12,590
HE'S FULLY RECHARGED FOR MORE TEASING

1146
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:14,325
-Dig in.
-I'm good.

1147
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:15,826
TEN SPOONS OF WIT MAKE THE GOLDEN RATIO

1148
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:18,262
-You don't give my heart time to flutter.
-What?

1149
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:20,564
What was that?

1150
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:22,600
Could you please stop role-playing?

1151
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:25,102
WHAT LIES AHEAD
FOR THE HUMOROUS UMTAEGURIGURI?

1152
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,606
I think you're talking a bit too much.

1153
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,308
Then they'll edit at double the speed.

1154
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,143
Now you made me forget!

1155
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:34,478
You've changed a lot.

1156
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:36,146
Why do I feel nervous writing this?

1157
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:37,114
FINALLY, IT'S THE LAST MOMENT
OF THEIR TRIP

1158
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:40,417
I get embarrassed
about pouring my heart out.

1159
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:41,785
I had a blast.

1160
00:43:41,852 --> 00:43:43,520
I wanted this trip to be fun for you.

1161
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:45,389
HER HEART SKIPS A BEAT

1162
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,424
GUARANTEEING FUN UNTIL THE VERY END!

1163
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:49,693
Like I said earlier,
you don't know when to stop.

1164
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:52,229
I haven't done open comedy sketches
in a while,

1165
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,497
and I had been wanting to.

1166
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:55,299
But now the craving is gone.

1167
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:57,368
