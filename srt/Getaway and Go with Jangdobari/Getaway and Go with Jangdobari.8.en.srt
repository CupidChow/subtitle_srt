1
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,872
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

2
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:07,607
FULL OF NERVES

3
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:09,142
AND EXCITEMENT

4
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:10,310
TRAVEL BUDDY IN CHUNCHEON

5
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:12,045
My name is Sakaguchi Kentaro.

6
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:13,279
FIRST STOP?

7
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:14,814
PHOTO TIME!

8
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,250
Three, two, one!

9
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:19,786
NEXT: DRAW EACH OTHER'S FACES!

10
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,521
SOMETHING FUNNY ABOUT HER DRAWING?

11
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:24,224
I'm sorry!

12
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,859
KENTARO DRAWS BEAUTIFULLY!

13
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:27,227
I had the best time.

14
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:30,096
THE RULE OF THIS TRIP: LEARN KOREAN!

15
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:31,431
-Nok.
-Nuk.

16
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:32,799
-Nok.
-Nok.

17
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:33,867
-Du.
-Du.

18
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:35,201
AFTER SEVERAL TRIES

19
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:36,136
-Jeon.
-Jeon.

20
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,837
-Nokdu jeon.
-Yes, that's it!

21
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:38,872
NAILED IT!

22
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:40,940
MOVING ON TO ADVANCED KOREAN

23
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:42,742
-"Hey!"
-Hey!

24
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,677
"Please put it on my card."

25
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:46,513
"Please put it on my card."

26
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:49,282
TIME TO PUT PRACTICE INTO ACTION

27
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:50,417
Hey!

28
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:54,320
I'm sorry. I don't have my card.

29
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,388
KOREAN? EASY-PEASY

30
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:57,557
Kentaro, you're a punk!

31
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:00,360
PERFECTLY IN TUNE WITH DO-YEON NOW

32
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:01,494
Split it!

33
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,230
QUICK-WITTED KENTARO
WHAT OTHER CHARMS IS HE HIDING?

34
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:05,632
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

35
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:08,935
I'm so full,

36
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,072
and I'm in such a good mood,
it's making me sleepy.

37
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,642
It can't get any better than this.

38
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:18,711
We have an expression for that in Korea.

39
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,180
"I must be in heaven."

40
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:23,583
I must be in heaven.

41
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:28,088
I feel like you've given me
the gift of comfort.

42
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:30,757
I appreciate that.

43
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:36,496
EPISODE 8: YOU CAN'T PUT A PRICE ON LOVE

44
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:42,469
Café?

45
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,572
-Cute!
-Cute.

46
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:47,006
It's a giant bear.

47
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:48,475
FLUFFY

48
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,778
-Hello.
-Hello.

49
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:57,817
-Cute.
-They are huge.

50
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,285
These guys are king-size.

51
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:00,687
KING-SIZE CARP SAYS HI

52
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:02,555
Hello.

53
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,557
What would you like to drink?

54
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:09,095
Iced coffee, maybe?

55
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,096
Americano?

56
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:11,564
Yes. Americano, please.

57
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:15,368
One iced Americano
and one omija soda, please.

58
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:19,205
Hey!

59
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,374
Please put it on my card.

60
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,109
-Hey!
-No!

61
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,411
Please put it on my card.

62
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,213
USING WHAT THEY'VE LEARNED FROM EACH OTHER

63
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,482
My card. Put it on my card.

64
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,317
-You used his card.
-Would you like a receipt?

65
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,186
-Yes, please.
-Thank you for that.

66
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,822
Thanks, really.

67
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:36,956
We'll take this and…

68
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,659
-Be careful.
-Thank you.

69
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,063
Be careful.

70
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,932
Look at you, using what you learned.

71
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:46,866
Did I do well?

72
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,602
Do you like to spend time at a café?

73
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,472
Sure, I'm quite fond of coffee.

74
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:55,175
Korea is packed with cafés, isn't it?

75
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,543
They are everywhere.

76
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:59,512
The last time I was in Korea for a shoot,

77
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,248
it was freezing,

78
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,517
yet everyone was drinking iced Americanos.

79
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:05,952
SIMPLY BLOWN AWAY

80
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,620
-Literally everyone.
-You saw right.

81
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,757
Actually, there is a word for it.
We call it "eoljuka."

82
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:11,891
Eoljuka?

83
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,695
It means, "Drink iced Americano
even if it freezes me to death."

84
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,865
But if you ask me, I'm Team Eoljuka too.

85
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:22,135
I always drink iced coffee,
even when it's freezing.

86
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,536
Excuse me.

87
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:25,505
-Enjoy your drinks.
-Thank you.

88
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:26,573
ICE-COLD DRINKS SERVED

89
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,174
What did you order?

90
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,309
It's really refreshing.

91
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,810
Omija soda.

92
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,513
-Omija soda?
-Yes, omija soda.

93
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,215
SATISFIED

94
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,051
SATISFIED

95
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:41,654
I heard it rains a lot in Japan.
Use this to keep your head dry.

96
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,157
-A present.
-Thank you.

97
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:49,629
The top of our heads seems
to come into play a lot today.

98
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,564
-That's right.
-This umbrella.

99
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:54,934
And the thing we did earlier
with the glasses.

100
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,470
TOP OF THEIR HEADS BUSY AT WORK

101
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,839
Could I ask you for a favor?

102
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,674
I'm sorry.

103
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:04,677
That's not very nice!

104
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,546
Just joking.

105
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:07,580
That was a joke?

106
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,182
For a moment, I…

107
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,151
You're such a good actor.
I can't tell if you're joking or not.

108
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,787
So, anyway,

109
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:18,124
I know you've been in a lot of works,

110
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:21,728
but there is this one scene
that really stuck with me.

111
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,830
Apparently, it's called kabedon.

112
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,132
The wall slap.

113
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,634
KNOWN AS "WALL SLAP" IN KOREA

114
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,236
Could you maybe do the kabedon on me?

115
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:31,971
CAUTIOUS

116
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,073
I'm begging you!

117
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,942
A DESPERATE REQUEST FOR KABEDON

118
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,745
That kabedon scene,

119
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:43,149
I believe, is from a movie I did
when I was 23.

120
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,217
That was ten years ago.

121
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,320
You'll be doing this
for the first time in ten years?

122
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:48,454
Yes.

123
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,156
-You'll do it for me?
-Sure.

124
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:51,557
CONGRATULATIONS ARE IN ORDER

125
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,460
But I have to tell you,
I'm not that good at it.

126
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,663
How do you know about it anyway?

127
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,331
-It's a famous scene.
-It is?

128
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,233
It felt like I was there.

129
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,434
A SCENE THAT CROSSED BORDERS

130
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:03,536
Wait!

131
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,705
Now I'm feeling shy!

132
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,907
I hope the wall doesn't get damaged.

133
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,878
How hard is the slap going to be?

134
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,214
Are you ready? The wall's ready.

135
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,283
Why am I getting nervous?

136
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,885
I'M GETTING BUTTERFLIES

137
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:20,286
It's going to be you and me.

138
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,822
KABEDON (BARIBARI VER.)
STARRING KENTARO &amp; DO-YEON

139
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,857
Let me set the scene.

140
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:26,859
We both want to pay for the drinks,

141
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,262
and it turns into a wall-slap battle
to the counter.

142
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,999
"Please put it in my card."

143
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,767
"On my card."

144
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:35,902
I'm going to say,

145
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:37,970
"Please put it on my card."

146
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,505
"Please put it on my card."

147
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:40,840
The scene starts when we get up.

148
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:41,874
GOING OVER THE MOVEMENT

149
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,079
Please put it on my card.

150
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,115
Bad boy!

151
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,050
COULDN'T HOLD THE LAUGHTER IN!

152
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,186
It doesn't make sense for me to…

153
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:54,721
Oh, not enough space?

154
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,789
Then let's start from here.

155
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,191
-Or here.
-All right.

156
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,628
Please put it on my card.

157
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,201
Please put it on my card.

158
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,172
Please put it on my card.

159
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:15,241
Come on, stop me.

160
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,175
SCRAMBLING

161
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:18,211
Please put it on my card.

162
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:19,278
No!

163
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:20,913
Please…

164
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,382
Please put it on my card!

165
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:23,449
No!

166
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:24,851
Please put it on my card.

167
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,719
Please put it on my card!

168
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:27,920
Thank you.

169
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,322
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION

170
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,223
We're sorry.

171
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:33,926
End scene!

172
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:38,765
Excellent.

173
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:42,969
What did you think of our acting?

174
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:47,840
Looks like we got five stars.

175
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,376
Thanks for playing along
with my ridiculous request.

176
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:54,147
That was my first time
getting wall-slapped.

177
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:55,815
POWER MOVE

178
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,685
Every time I have to pay with my card
in Korea,

179
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:03,489
this will be the first thing
that comes to mind.

180
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:06,159
THAT MEANS A LOT

181
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:08,694
I'll always think of today.

182
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,229
Your words…

183
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:13,533
You seem to know just what to say
to make someone feel good.

184
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,934
-Do you think so?
-Yes.

185
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:18,004
Because of what you told me earlier.

186
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,540
You asked if I ever get exhausted

187
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:24,544
since I meet and talk to a lot of guests
on this show.

188
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,613
That's actually
what I'd been really wanting to hear.

189
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,284
"Today's shoot was fun.
It didn't even feel like work."

190
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,853
That's the kind of feedback
I always aim to hear.

191
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,989
So hearing you say it first
really made me happy.

192
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:40,626
You're awesome.

193
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:46,399
The movie with the kabedon scene
was a huge hit, wasn't it?

194
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,568
Yes, it was quite popular.

195
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,170
The movie is called Heroine Disqualified.

196
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:57,109
That movie was probably the one
that introduced me

197
00:07:57,176 --> 00:08:01,047
to teenage girl fans for the first time.

198
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,916
There's a scene I love
from another movie of yours.

199
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,618
The 100th Love with You.

200
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:09,655
I think the girl was trying
to grab a book at the bookstore.

201
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:12,325
And you took it down for her. Am I right?

202
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:14,126
That's my dream scenario.

203
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,195
Because I can reach anywhere.

204
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:17,897
But you…

205
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,300
Do you mind if I ask how tall you are?

206
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,236
Just shy of two meters.

207
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:26,639
Hey, that makes two of us.

208
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:28,140
-Really?
-Yes.

209
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:29,675
I'm 174 cm.

210
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,011
I see. You are tall.

211
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,880
How about you?

212
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,015
I'm 184 cm.

213
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,184
You're really tall.

214
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,654
FEELS GOOD

215
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:45,758
People say my face
doesn't look big on screen.

216
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,463
But in person, they say it's huge.

217
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,797
What?

218
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,466
They are all quite surprised.

219
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,468
HARD TO BELIEVE

220
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,403
No, your face is freaking…

221
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,405
Freaking small? No, I mean…

222
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,173
What am I trying to say?

223
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,108
It's small.

224
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,976
MEANING: KENTARO HAS A SMALL FACE

225
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,078
I wonder why they said that.

226
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:09,048
Maybe they were teasing you.
You have an undeniably small face.

227
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,083
I have large hands.

228
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,318
Yes, I noticed.

229
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,888
They are my favorite part of my body.

230
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:22,361
Cute! Please don't translate that.

231
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,263
Too late. I already did.

232
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,065
YOUR FEELINGS ARE DELIVERED

233
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:29,635
What's your favorite part of your body?

234
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:30,703
My eyes.

235
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,973
They can look a little sleepy and dazed,

236
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,975
and that's not always a good thing,

237
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,377
but still,
they are my favorite part of me.

238
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:41,881
Someone once told me
I have pretty eyeballs.

239
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,883
Do you think they were teasing me?

240
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,419
I think that was a compliment.

241
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:48,354
-Right?
-It means you have pretty eyes.

242
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,089
But they said "pretty eyeballs."

243
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,324
STARE

244
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:54,860
Maybe that person had nothing better
to say about me.

245
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,198
No. I think that's a nice thing to say.

246
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,403
Anything else you like about yourself?

247
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,005
Maybe personality-wise?

248
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:07,974
Personality-wise,

249
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,241
I'm cheerful.

250
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:10,443
Cheerful?

251
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,745
I agree. You smile a lot.

252
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,647
And you have pretty dimples.

253
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,483
SHOWING OFF HIS DIMPLES

254
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,018
You've made them deeper.

255
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:23,856
What do you usually do at a café
on your day off?

256
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:27,159
Chat with friends?
Just zone out and do nothing?

257
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,095
If I've got an hour,

258
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:34,200
I'll probably work on my lines
for like ten minutes

259
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,569
and then zone out for the rest.

260
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:39,805
Are you good at zoning out?

261
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:40,706
Yeah.

262
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,341
Can you clear your mind?

263
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,744
I can't even meditate properly.

264
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:47,246
I try to stay still

265
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,581
and clear my mind,

266
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:53,552
but all I can think about is,
"What does it mean to clear my mind?"

267
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,958
ARE WE MEDITATING ALL OF A SUDDEN?

268
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,398
FREE FROM ALL THOUGHTS

269
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,171
OPEN

270
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,006
DON'T LAUGH

271
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:17,610
PEEKING THROUGH

272
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,113
FINDS KENTARO SMILING

273
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:23,449
What was that?

274
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,753
Looks like I've found
another perfect partner.

275
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,858
My theory is that what matters most
on a trip is who you're with.

276
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:37,063
I remember the beautiful scenery, sure,

277
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,831
but what stays with me more clearly

278
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:42,702
are the conversations we shared
and the laughter in the air.

279
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:44,737
So the travel buddy matters the most.

280
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:47,406
-Do you like people?
-People?

281
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:50,509
Do I like people? That's a hard one.

282
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:53,412
As for me, I'm definitely a people person.

283
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:57,049
I'm going to say that I do like people,

284
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,718
but I can't stand people hating me.

285
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:01,754
I also don't like the feeling
of hating someone.

286
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,858
People need to go through ups and downs

287
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,761
and even phases
where they don't like each other

288
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:11,897
to really connect,
but I'm not good at dealing with that.

289
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:14,500
Why did you say you're a people person?

290
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:18,037
I'm a narcissist,
so I love myself so much,

291
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:24,443
and I always try to share that love
with the people around me.

292
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:29,815
I think that's why it's easy for me
to open up to people.

293
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,917
We say something like that here too.

294
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:35,988
It goes, "You can't really love others
if you don't love yourself first."

295
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:42,027
When I hear someone say
they hate themselves,

296
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:45,097
I want to remind them
to love themselves first.

297
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:49,535
I guess that's why I can confidently say
that I'm a people person.

298
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,272
Maybe it's the hairstyle,

299
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,075
but you're like a big dog
that loves people.

300
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:02,081
Everyone says
I'm more like a dog than a cat.

301
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,516
You really are.

302
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:05,551
I think I saw you trotting
by the Hangang River.

303
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:13,325
Kentaro told us there's something
he'd like to do while in Korea.

304
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:18,197
When I was here for a shoot last time,

305
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,199
we went to a pojangmacha at night.

306
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,903
The atmosphere was amazing,

307
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,138
and I had such a lovely night,

308
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:29,041
so I've been wanting to go again.

309
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,477
Which spot did you go to last time?

310
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,312
SEARCHING HIS MEMORY

311
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,914
-Where was it?
-Jongno.

312
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:36,482
It was Jongno.

313
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:37,950
Jongno!

314
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,619
There's a street
that's filled with stalls in Jongno.

315
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:42,822
KENTARO VISITED JONGNO POCHA STREET

316
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:44,423
Okay, then.

317
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,293
Since you love pojangmacha that much,

318
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:49,161
we'll go to one now.

319
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:50,429
Are you up for it?

320
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,699
HE ANSWERS WITH… AN UMBRELLA?

321
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,304
What does that mean?

322
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,505
What was that?

323
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,073
What is this?

324
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,442
-What did it mean?
-I'm happy.

325
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,611
You're happy to go?

326
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,512
All right.

327
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:09,882
Let's go there
and pick this up over a nice meal.

328
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,717
Okay. Good.

329
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:12,618
Let's go.

330
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,422
OFF TO A POJANGMACHA WITH GREAT VIBES

331
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,157
10-MINUTE DRIVE TO NAMCHUNCHEON POCHA

332
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,826
How was the pocha you went to in Jongno?

333
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:22,094
I enjoyed it.

334
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,897
It was buzzing with people.

335
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,766
When I come to Korea,

336
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:31,971
I usually eat at local restaurants.

337
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,741
I even visited the same pocha twice
because I liked it.

338
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,844
I think I'm drawn to places
that are loud and full of energy.

339
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:44,550
You have yatai in Japan.
How is it different from pocha?

340
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:47,152
These days in Japan,

341
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,689
it's hard to find places
where yatai stalls naturally gather.

342
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:55,361
You can only find them in yatai streets,
which are designated tourist spots.

343
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:59,498
But in Korea, locals casually stop by
at pojangmacha for dinner after work.

344
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:03,168
In Japan, yatai have kind of become
something special and rare,

345
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:07,406
but in Korea, pojangmacha still feels
like just another place to eat.

346
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,876
It seems like a part of everyday life,
and that's really cool.

347
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,579
-We're here.
-Thank you.

348
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:14,780
A POCHA JUST FOR KENTARO

349
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,649
-This is the place.
-All right.

350
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,890
"YOU FIRST" STANDOFF

351
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:29,295
SUCH A CONSIDERATE COUPLE

352
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,632
So? What do you think?

353
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:38,304
I've never seen a pocha
this clean and tidy.

354
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,172
Yes, pocha is known for its buzz,

355
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:44,076
but tonight I went for a more chill vibe
to enjoy some good food and drinks.

356
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,611
SOUNDS GOOD

357
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:46,812
Let's see.

358
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,380
I wonder what you'd like.

359
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,016
We can order everything from here.

360
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:55,387
I heard this pocha makes
awesome jjolttaegi jjigae.

361
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,456
-Can I recommend something?
-Sure.

362
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,858
Then we'll have one jjolttaegi jjigae.

363
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:02,061
You like jeon. Let's order some jeon.

364
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,829
There's beef jeon,

365
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,230
potato jeon,

366
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,366
and kimchi jeon.

367
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,702
Which one do you like?

368
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:10,602
Me?

369
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:13,839
I love all of them.
Why don't you pick one of the two?

370
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,741
Beef or potato.

371
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,645
Beef jeon? Great choice.

372
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,781
What drinks do they have?

373
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,184
Soju, beer, and… draft beer?

374
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:27,853
They have draft beer?

375
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,089
-I'll have the draft beer.
-Cool.

376
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,624
To order, you have to say, "Sajangnim?"

377
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:33,525
Again?

378
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:34,660
Sajangnim.

379
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:35,561
Sajangnim?

380
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,130
Sajangnim?

381
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,466
We'd like to order.

382
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:43,435
We'll have one jjolttaegi jjigae.
Is it spicy?

383
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,637
You can choose how spicy you'd like it.

384
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:46,572
Can we?

385
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,173
How spicy do you want it to be?

386
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,043
It might make me sweat,
so medium spicy, please.

387
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,078
Medium spicy, it is.

388
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:56,048
One beef jeon.
One of the thicker cuts, if that's okay.

389
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:59,184
And two draft beers, please.

390
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,154
I'm going to take this off.

391
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,756
Could you move the mic?

392
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:05,891
I'm sorry.

393
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,292
You're so polite.

394
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,862
You should have some drinks too.

395
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:10,929
Draft beer?

396
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,866
One, two, three, four, five…

397
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:14,867
For the staff?

398
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,502
Let's wait until the shoot's over.

399
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:17,436
THANK YOU ANYWAYS

400
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,338
I hear you like jjajangmyeon.

401
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:20,339
I love it.

402
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,573
You do? Okay.

403
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,478
Jjagyechi is a combination
of instant jjajangmyeon, egg, and cheese.

404
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,280
I think you will love it.

405
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,149
That sounds delicious.

406
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,584
Then you should go over there and say,

407
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,987
"We'll also have one jjagyechi, please."

408
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,255
Excuse me!

409
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,490
One jjagyechi…

410
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,092
-One jjagyechi?
-Yes, please.

411
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:41,760
Sure. Thank you.

412
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,263
-Excellent!
-Excellent.

413
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,099
GOOD ON YOU, SAJANGNIM

414
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,301
A CAUTIOUS TOAST

415
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,075
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT

416
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,142
It's so good!

417
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,511
Great job, everyone!

418
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,512
THAT'S A WRAP

419
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:03,115
That's a classic punk move.

420
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,249
You're not going anywhere.

421
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:05,150
BOO-HOO

422
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,288
WHAT'S THIS?

423
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,024
DELICIOUS!

424
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,258
-Good, huh?
-Yeah.

425
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:15,661
This goes really well with drinks.

426
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,696
It's perfect with beer.

427
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:21,200
Yes, you keep reaching for more
until you become an alcoholic.

428
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:25,104
-Dangerous stuff.
-It tastes just right.

429
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,573
Do you shop at Coupang too?

430
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:30,242
I starred in a Coupang Play series.

431
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,411
What Comes After Love.

432
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,613
STARRING KENTARO &amp; LEE SE-YOUNG

433
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,014
Oh, with Se-young?

434
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,616
That was a Coupang series.

435
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:38,617
I mean, you…

436
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:42,221
you must have watched it.

437
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,288
Yes!

438
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,225
That's a lie.

439
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,493
It was a blast.

440
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,394
My all-time favorite.

441
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,131
Come on. Now you're just lying.

442
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:53,899
Forgive me!

443
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,268
I can't watch everything.

444
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:57,803
When you have the time.

445
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,538
I can't watch every show.

446
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,642
But it really took me by surprise.

447
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,411
I had just assumed
you'd only be working in Japan,

448
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:10,048
so seeing you collaborate
with a Korean actor was very interesting.

449
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:13,552
While shooting that project,
something hit me for the first time.

450
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:18,557
Everyone on set,
including the staff, was Korean,

451
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:21,260
and I couldn't communicate with anyone.

452
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:26,932
That made me feel like everything
I'd built up until then just disappeared.

453
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,501
But even though
we couldn't communicate verbally,

454
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:33,005
we had the script as our guide.

455
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:36,108
And as long as everyone
was focused on that,

456
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,911
the language barrier
wasn't as much of an issue.

457
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:40,979
That was the lesson I learned.

458
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:44,917
I'm sure that really broadened
your perspective.

459
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:46,952
Yes, before that,

460
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,923
I'd always worked in spaces where words
and feelings naturally connected.

461
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:52,858
Even now, that's still mostly true.

462
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,060
But working in a different environment

463
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:58,096
made me feel like I'd grown stronger

464
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:00,365
and maybe a little deeper too.

465
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,702
So it's the same today.

466
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:08,440
Even when I'm surrounded
by Korean colleagues, like I am now,

467
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,709
I don't find myself hoping for too much.

468
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:15,414
I think I've become someone
who can just enjoy the unfamiliar.

469
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,616
That's good to hear because I was worried.

470
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,518
You just said you felt at ease,

471
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,987
and honestly, it seems to me

472
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,123
like you're actually having a good time
in your own way.

473
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,858
That's a huge relief for me.

474
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:31,330
GRATEFUL TO EACH OTHER FOR MANY THINGS

475
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,397
Thank you.

476
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,133
Who are you bowing to?
It's just the two of us.

477
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,269
Oh, I don't see anyone else.

478
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,972
GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR TOO

479
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,709
There's this game
that's very popular in Korea.

480
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,344
It's called Balance Game.

481
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,212
-Balance?
-Yes, Balance Game.

482
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,349
The fun of this game is that it makes you

483
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:54,152
not want to choose either option
or makes you want both.

484
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:57,222
Mind if I throw a question your way?

485
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,490
I want to try.

486
00:20:58,557 --> 00:20:59,691
Here's an example.

487
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,893
A beautiful and precious memory

488
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:03,929
versus ten billion won.

489
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:06,498
If you choose money,
you can't have the memory.

490
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,934
You have nothing to do
but throw the money around.

491
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,170
But if you choose the memory,

492
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,006
that's all you will have.

493
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:16,608
Even if you're out in the cold,
you will be like,

494
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:19,911
"At least I had fun back then."
That's all you will ever do.

495
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:21,046
Pick one.

496
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,281
KENTARO'S CHOICE?

497
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,915
Memory or money?

498
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:25,484
Money.

499
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,688
Nothing beats money!

500
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:32,858
I'm going to use the ten billion won
to make new memories.

501
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:34,660
Are you kidding me?

502
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:35,694
What's wrong?

503
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:37,863
You're a smooth talker.

504
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,233
KENTARO WINS

505
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,869
If you get stuck
in the emotions of the past,

506
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:46,271
it gets harder to build anything new.

507
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:50,142
So maybe it's better
to have no good memories at all

508
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,679
and use the money
to make good memories going forward.

509
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:56,782
I'm not sure
if that's the right way though.

510
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:58,750
That's so right.

511
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,419
That's fine. Thank you.

512
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,254
Is this beef jeon?

513
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:03,889
Looks delicious.

514
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:05,624
THINLY SLICED BEEF
COATED WITH FLOUR AND EGG

515
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:06,525
Thank you, sir.

516
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:09,394
One more, please.

517
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:10,796
Sir?

518
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:12,664
GULP

519
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:15,000
Magic.

520
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:16,468
NEXT UP

521
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:17,803
-Jjolttaegi jjigae?
-Yes.

522
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,538
What exactly is jjolttaegi?

523
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,473
It's a word in the Chungcheong dialect,

524
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,342
meaning pork leg.

525
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:24,743
Which part of the leg?

526
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,081
RIGHT HERE

527
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:30,615
You could've just said it!

528
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,950
PORK SHANK AND SHOULDER

529
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,985
You're a riot.

530
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:35,787
It tastes a bit like maeun tang.

531
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:37,589
That's amazing.

532
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,858
-Let it come to a full boil first.
-Thank you.

533
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,327
JJOLTTAEGI JJIGAE
CHUNGCHEONG-DO-STYLE DURUCHIGI

534
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:43,729
A RICH AND SPICY DISH

535
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:47,532
MADE BY SIMMERING PORK LEG, GOCHUJANG,
SQUASH, AND POTATO TOGETHER

536
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,802
TRY THE BEEF JEON FIRST

537
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:53,305
WITH GARLIC CHIVE KIMCHI

538
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,973
Wrap it up and enjoy.

539
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,941
Okay.

540
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:59,111
I'm learning Korean these days.

541
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:01,913
I mean, I plan to really focus on it
from now on.

542
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,715
Next time we meet,

543
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:07,352
we'll be able to talk a lot more.

544
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:10,689
No, I'm going to master
how to speak Japanese.

545
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:15,293
Meeting you has really fired up
my motivation to study.

546
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,601
Delicious, isn't it?

547
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:24,569
Delicious.

548
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:26,905
It's hard to find beef jeon
that tastes this good.

549
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,173
THEY'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE

550
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,074
It's amazing.

551
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:31,143
JJAGYECHI COMING UP

552
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,411
Thank you!

553
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:33,979
This is something.

554
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:35,113
Try this.

555
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,783
CHAPAGETTI
TOPPED WITH CHEESE AND FRIED EGG

556
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,251
Let me mix it up.

557
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,586
Do you have anything like this in Japan?

558
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,488
In Japan?

559
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:46,191
I don't think there is.

560
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:49,161
It's really good.

561
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:56,635
There was a scene
where I had to eat jjajangmyeon,

562
00:23:56,701 --> 00:24:01,139
and the one the crew made for that shot
was really good.

563
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:04,776
Dig in.

564
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:06,344
Let me get you some jjigae.

565
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:08,346
Do you like mushrooms?

566
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:10,382
-Yes, I do.
-You do?

567
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,783
Do you like tofu?

568
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,418
Yes.

569
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,520
Do you like squash?

570
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:16,421
Yes.

571
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:17,956
GLANCE

572
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,491
Do you like me?

573
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:20,826
Yes!

574
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,562
Yes! Got the clip!

575
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,030
THIS ONE'S GOING IN THE TEASER

576
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:27,499
So that's what it was all about.

577
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,702
-You'd do it for me?
-Yes.

578
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:33,338
-Tofu?
-Yes, tofu.

579
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:34,739
-Do you like…
-Yes.

580
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:37,676
-Do you like leeks?
-Yes, I do.

581
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,078
Meat?

582
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,379
I like meat.

583
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,815
Do you like me?

584
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,684
Yes!

585
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:47,419
Hot!

586
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,353
Here.

587
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,688
Thank you.

588
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:51,723
Oh no.

589
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:54,059
You're blushing on both cheeks. So cute.

590
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:54,960
Really?

591
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,461
Just a little.

592
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:57,696
PINKISH GLOW

593
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,900
Let me try the jjagyechi now.

594
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:03,235
Go ahead.

595
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:04,903
Trust me. It's going to be good.

596
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,838
HIS FIRST TASTE OF JJAGYECHI

597
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,412
POP

598
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:17,616
That's the happiest he's looked all day.

599
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:19,251
It's delicious.

600
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:23,755
A TASTE OF JJOLTTAEGI JJIGAE TOO

601
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,690
It's so tasty.

602
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:26,825
KENTARO JOINS IN

603
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:29,227
This is really good. Nice and spicy.

604
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:32,030
Is it not too spicy?

605
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,500
It's perfect.

606
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:36,701
Good to hear.

607
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,336
You're eating so well.

608
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:40,872
It honestly makes me feel great.

609
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:41,773
Well,

610
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,342
the food is really tasty though.

611
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:47,379
Still, you keep saying nice things,
and it makes me feel good.

612
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:49,381
-Thanks for treating me.
-It's nice.

613
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:50,448
Having fun?

614
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:51,917
Yup.

615
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:53,685
Cute!

616
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,555
Please don't translate that.

617
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:57,522
It's embarrassing.

618
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:58,657
CAN'T HIDE HER FEELINGS

619
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,660
Man, I have to stop doing that.

620
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,962
Would you like to try the noodles?

621
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,764
Sure, I'd love to.

622
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:08,733
KINDNESS IN HIS BONES

623
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,304
This is so good.

624
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:15,140
Yes, you looked genuinely happy.

625
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:17,609
Not too much.

626
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,812
SERVED WITH A THOUGHTFUL TOUCH

627
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:22,414
And some egg too. Oh my!

628
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,381
A BIG PIECE FOR YOU

629
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:25,283
Enjoy your meal.

630
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,551
Thanks!

631
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:30,422
In Korea,

632
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:32,958
people say "Enjoy your meal"
at restaurants,

633
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:36,494
which isn't really a thing in Japan.

634
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:40,131
I think it's such a wonderful expression.

635
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:45,837
Traveling with you
made me realize something.

636
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:50,809
All these little things I took for granted
turned out to be really special.

637
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:54,713
Like when people say
"Enjoy your meal" in Korea,

638
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,247
I didn't think much about it.

639
00:26:56,314 --> 00:27:00,085
But thanks to you, I see now
how warm and meaningful that phrase is.

640
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:03,321
The cultural differences
seem to really stick with me.

641
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,223
Like you said earlier about drinks,

642
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,893
things like "Enjoy your meal"
are just part of everyday life in Korea,

643
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,230
but to me, it sounds
like a very nice thing to say.

644
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,666
That's why I enjoy traveling.

645
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:18,870
Can I…

646
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,006
Is it okay?

647
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,977
-Sajangnim.
-Sajangnim.

648
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:27,679
"Can we get two more beers?"

649
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:29,080
Can we get…

650
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,082
-Two.
-Can we get two more beers, please?

651
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,350
THAT'S MY BOY

652
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,022
Time for some magic.

653
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,390
What magic?

654
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:39,457
Here

655
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:41,926
is a white tissue.

656
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:46,665
What just happened?

657
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,335
Do it one more time.

658
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:52,804
Look. It's just an ordinary tissue.

659
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:53,905
Yeah, it is.

660
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:54,806
All good?

661
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:56,708
I took it from here.

662
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:58,543
And now…

663
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:02,814
TA-DA

664
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:06,117
Show me your sleeves.

665
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,118
Not here.

666
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,286
IT'S REALLY MAGIC

667
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:11,956
Do this.

668
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:18,530
How did you do it?

669
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,071
What was that?

670
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:30,442
What was that?

671
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:31,643
DUMBFOUNDED

672
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,777
What in the…

673
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:33,712
What was it?

674
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:35,346
HOW DID HE DO IT?

675
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,483
-What happened?
-Impressive, huh?

676
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,585
Where did you learn the trick?

677
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:42,187
I didn't learn it from anyone.

678
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:43,421
Where did it go?

679
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:44,823
Where did it come from?

680
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,425
I was more surprised
when you pulled it out from here.

681
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:50,562
I tossed it behind your ear.

682
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:55,767
That was fun.

683
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:57,902
MAGIC TRICK REVEALED

684
00:28:57,969 --> 00:29:00,472
When I was rubbing it between my palms…

685
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:03,808
DID YOU GUYS CATCH THAT?

686
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:11,816
-You dropped it?
-Yes.

687
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,284
THE KEY IS TO DROP IT IN A FLASH

688
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:18,056
I'm so angry that I fell for that!

689
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:21,459
So you dropped it
before rubbing your palms together?

690
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:22,427
Yes.

691
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:23,895
What a laugh.

692
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,798
I'm having so much fun.

693
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,399
So, Kentaro,

694
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,870
we met this morning and spent
the whole day traveling together.

695
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,972
I'd love to hear how it was for you.

696
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:39,377
I had a great time.

697
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:43,882
I'd say the vibe that you give off
puts people at ease

698
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,851
like a pleasant breeze.

699
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:49,554
I really felt that
while spending time with you.

700
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:52,423
We just met today,
and I even did a magic trick,

701
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,825
which I don't normally do.

702
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,861
So, I really had a great time.

703
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:58,196
That's sweet.

704
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,502
Do you feel like
you opened up a lot today?

705
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:05,904
Yes.

706
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:07,438
Very much.

707
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:11,142
I thought I was in a movie. "Very much."

708
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:12,877
I really did, thanks to you.

709
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:14,279
I appreciate that.

710
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:20,385
The camera caught
what we did today, of course,

711
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:22,787
but writing it down hits differently.

712
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:25,590
So I'd love for you to write something
about our trip.

713
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:29,127
It can be like a short journal
or a message to me.

714
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:30,995
It can be anything, really.

715
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:34,632
Could you please write a short message
to wrap up the day?

716
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:36,868
Where do I write it?

717
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:37,969
Where?

718
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,237
Right here.

719
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:41,139
TAKE THIS

720
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:42,473
Use this pen.

721
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:44,642
You can write it here.

722
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:48,746
Do you keep a journal?

723
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,649
-No, I'm afraid not.
-Really?

724
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:53,718
It might be a little awkward.

725
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:54,619
DAZED

726
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:59,390
IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE HE LAST WROTE

727
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:04,395
A BRIEF PAUSE, THEN HE STARTS TO WRITE

728
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,984
I learned that from my first travel buddy.

729
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:28,353
This is why friends matter.

730
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:29,287
I see.

731
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:31,022
Always choose the right people.

732
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:34,158
FOCUSES ON HIS JOURNAL AGAIN

733
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:49,507
Finished.

734
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:52,176
-You're finished? Hold on.
-All right.

735
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:56,681
ENJOYING SOME FREE TIME
AFTER FINISHING FIRST

736
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,418
What did you enjoy the most today?

737
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:06,090
I enjoyed every single moment today.

738
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:10,128
I got chills because I was just writing,
"I enjoyed every single thing."

739
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:14,198
HEARTS IN PERFECT SYNC

740
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:18,870
Okay, now it's time to read what we wrote.

741
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,906
Let's have the winner go first.

742
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:23,708
Rock, paper, scissors.

743
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:24,676
LOSER - WINNER

744
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:26,411
FEELS GOOD TO GO FIRST

745
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:28,846
TA-DA

746
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,316
A SINCERE NOTE ADORNED WITH A DRAWING

747
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:32,850
Could you read it for me?

748
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:35,320
"It was a good time,
with a pleasant breeze blowing."

749
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:37,188
"I hope to see you again."

750
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:38,790
"Thank you, Team Do-yeon."

751
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,459
That's so romantic.

752
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:46,564
It's my turn now.

753
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,600
"You never stopped smiling
in unfamiliar surroundings,

754
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,002
and I'm grateful for that."

755
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:54,105
"I hope you'll look back
on this trip every now and then,

756
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:56,174
even after you're back in Japan."

757
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,609
"Thank you
for making this day so special."

758
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:01,245
"Arigatou. I enjoyed every single thing."

759
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:04,916
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

760
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,584
Are you going to take my drawing?

761
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,686
Sure, I'd like to take it with me.

762
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:10,922
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

763
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,825
-When will you throw it away?
-I won't.

764
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:15,660
-I won't throw it away.
-Promise me.

765
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:16,661
I will.

766
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:19,931
I'd be sad if I found it dumped
somewhere in Incheon Airport.

767
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,499
Don't worry.

768
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:22,667
I'm going to Gimpo Airport.

769
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,839
Are you serious?

770
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:30,241
I hate you!

771
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:31,175
Don't worry.

772
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:32,110
SUCH A TEASE

773
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,444
That was gold.

774
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,412
Saiko!

775
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:35,413
SAIKO = BEST

776
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,881
Kentaro is saiko.

777
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:40,385
JUST KIDDING

778
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:42,086
PORTRAIT EXCHANGE

779
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:44,055
-It's an honor.
-I'm sorry.

780
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:45,623
I'm going to take mine.

781
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,025
I'm glad.

782
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:51,596
No one's really drawn me like this before.

783
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:53,264
-Sorry.
-Forgive me.

784
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:55,566
No one's drawn you so badly.

785
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:58,636
No, I'm just so happy that you drew me.

786
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:02,440
Thank you so much, Kentaro.

787
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:04,776
Thank you even more.

788
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:06,878
Think of me at least five times, okay?

789
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:10,148
Whenever you take your card out
or slap a wall.

790
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:13,017
I'm not sure
I'll ever be slapping a wall again.

791
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:14,552
Just slap every wall you see.

792
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:21,359
I think Do-yeon is the first person
to slap me against a wall.

793
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:22,794
I can't get that out of my head.

794
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,595
Then today's trip is a success.

795
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:26,764
Sajangnim.

796
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,401
-Please put it on…
-Hey!

797
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:32,970
Please put it on my card!

798
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:35,907
THE "TAKE MY CARD" SKETCH NEVER ENDS

799
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:38,476
COVERS HIS EYES

800
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,446
KENTARO'S CARD IS CHOSEN

801
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,848
Saved my money!

802
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:45,483
POLITE TO THE END

803
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,684
Thank you, sir.

804
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:52,256
I'm sorry.

805
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,328
But really, it's an awesome drawing.

806
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:58,763
You don't have to say that.

807
00:34:58,830 --> 00:34:59,831
TOUCHED

808
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:03,734
HE MUST REALLY LIKE HIS PORTRAIT

809
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:08,806
What was today's trip worth
to each of you?

810
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:10,741
In actual money?

811
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:18,483
To me, it's worth this card's full limit.

812
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:20,418
The limit on this card?

813
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,320
It's ten billion won!

814
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:23,988
Is it worth ten billion won?

815
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:25,890
It's priceless, of course.

816
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,426
To me, today is worth 50 billion won.

817
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:30,361
100 billion for me.

818
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:33,831
If so, then two trillion for me.

819
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:36,334
Two point five.

820
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:40,905
Honestly, I can't put a price on it.

821
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,240
It's 76,000 won.

822
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,542
BRILLIANT TIMING

823
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:47,111
Kentaro, don't worry.
We'll split the bill.

824
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:48,446
-Split it?
-Yeah.

825
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:50,815
But since you ate more than I did,

826
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:52,517
you should pay 40,000 won.

827
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:54,519
I'll pay 36,000.

828
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:55,586
That's a wrap.

829
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:57,655
Thank you, everyone.

830
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:01,259
-Thank you.
-You win, Kentaro.

831
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,728
In Korea… Is it the same in Japan?

832
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:05,296
Do you shake hands for goodbye?

833
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:06,497
Yes, of course.

834
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:07,965
-Thank you for today.
-Thank you.

835
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:09,033
Thank you.

836
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:11,769
Shimai!

837
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:12,837
The end.

838
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:18,442
-Nice work, everyone.
-Thank you.

839
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,378
You've all done so well.

840
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:26,918
KENTARO

841
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:33,991

WHOSE DOOR IS DO-YEON KNOCKING ON?

844
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:48,739
Do-yeon!

845
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:50,942
QUEEN GA-BEE IS HERE

846
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:52,443

TO HER FOURTH DESTINATION

848
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,446
What a cute little village.

Nice.

854
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:06,123
It tastes so good!

FEEL IT WITH YOUR WHOLE BODY
CRAZY DELICIOUS LOCAL FOOD

-What's with her? Any kiss plans?
-Kiss plans?

857
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:15,733
-Anyone ask you out?
-Three days ago.

858
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,236
-For real?
-He's here. Wanna meet him?

859

THE AMBITIOUS CONTENDER

864
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:29,213
IS SHE THE NEW QUEEN?

865
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,249
PLEASE CALL ME QUEEN BARI

866
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:33,651
If she's not a model, then who is?

867
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:35,519
BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE TWO QUEENS

868
