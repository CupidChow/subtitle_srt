00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:09,275
ON A DAY FULL OF CHERRY BLOSSOMS…

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,847
Hello. Bound for a breezy break
with bundles of stories in hand.

4
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:15,582
I'm Jang Do-yeon of Jangdobari.

5
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:19,219
Do you see behind me?

6
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:20,854
These are double cherry blossoms,

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,424
currently trending on social media
among Gen Zers.

8
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:27,460
There's a reason we're here today.

9
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:32,165
Today's travel buddy has told us
that they have memories of this place,

10
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:33,400
so we're here in Chuncheon.

11
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:38,538
TODAY'S DESTINATION
CHUNCHEON

12
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,408
NAMI ISLAND

13
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:50,984
TODAY'S TRAVEL BUDDY
WHO HAS MEMORIES OF CHUNCHEON

14
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,286
To give you a clue about today's buddy,

15
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:55,522
he really loves Korea,

16
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:57,424
and I really love this guy.

17
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,393
I've really admired his work,

18
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,562
though I'm not sure what he thinks of me.

19
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,564
I'm curious why he agreed
to come on our show,

20
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,299
and I'm a little nervous.

21
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:07,901
I'm a little all over the place.

22
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,037
I guess it just means I'm nervous.

23
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:14,074
Then, let me go and meet
today's travel buddy.

24
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,709
DEMURE

25
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:20,146
Guess who my travel buddy is!

26
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:22,382
TEEHEE

TRAVEL BUDDY AWAITS ON A BOAT

29
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,440
I'm a little nervous.

30
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:53,213
HEADED TO MEET HIM NOW

31
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:57,650

Nice to meet you. My name is Jang Do-yeon.

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,162
Let's have a great trip together.

36
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:11,231
SNEAKING OVER AFTER A QUICK RECAP

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,201
Nice to meet you.

38
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:19,405
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

39
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,207
My name is Jang Do-yeon.

40
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,743
-Let's have…
-Looking forward to our trip.

41
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,345
-Let's have a great time.
-Right.

00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,407
I look forward to our trip together.

49
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,976
Do you know me, by any chance?

50
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:58,611
Of course I do.

51
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,946
How do you know me?

52
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,348
I've seen one of your shows.

53
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,284
Which show?

54
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,020
I saw your show
when you had Son Suk-ku on.

55
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:10,390
KENTARO HAS SEEN
SON SUK-KU'S EPISODE OF SALON DRIP 2

56
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,492
Can I ask what you thought of it?

57
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:17,864
Well, I saw that Son Suk-ku
is a huge fan of yours.

58
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:21,000
You two talked very openly
about a variety of topics.

59
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:24,804
I thought it was a great show,
seeing how you talked so openly.

60
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,839
So I'm really looking forward to today.

61
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,007
You are?

62
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:30,310
But I'm not very good at Korean,

63
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,446
so I apologize in advance
if that causes you any inconvenience.

64
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:34,380
Not at all.

65
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,883
I'm also not very good at Japanese.

66
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:37,984
That's not a problem.

67
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,786
-Thanks in advance.
-Thanks in advance.

68
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:41,221
We might be bowing forever.

69
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,189
Okay, then.

70
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,557
Okay, then.

71
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,059
Hey, it's coming.

72
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,126
DEPARTING FOR NAMI ISLAND

73
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:49,095
Wait, you speak Korean?

74
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,331
-Just a little.
-A little?

75
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,933
I also know a little Japanese.

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,769
Earlier, you said,
"Let's have a great time together."

77
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,638
That and "Beer, please."

78
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,274
"One draft beer, please"?

79
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:04,077
A MUST-KNOW PHRASE FOR BEER LOVERS:
ONE DRAFT BEER, PLEASE

80
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:06,212
-It's tasty.
-Tasty.

81
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,181
-Very, very tasty.
-Very tasty.

82
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,817
-Very, very delicious.
-Very delicious.

83
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:11,884
That's all I can say.

84
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:12,785
That's all?

85
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,287
Does that mean "a little"?

86
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,256
I really enjoyed your film.

87
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:17,223
The Parades.

88
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,324
-The Parades.
-The Parades?

89
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,026
-Thank you.
-I saw it on Netflix.

90
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,327
What did you think of it?

91
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,196
I really loved The Parades.

92
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:27,000
These days, I'm very interested
in the afterlife.

93
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,501
It's my current obsession.

94
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,436
So I loved it.

95
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:31,371
Over there!

96
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,007
-The afterlife.
-The afterlife?

97
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:35,775
THE AFTERLIFE

98
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:36,776
There? Right.

99
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,411
Let's have fun while we're still alive.

100
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:39,412
Let's do our best!

101
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,014
Yes, let's!

102
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,916
-Do you like to travel?
-Yes.

103
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:46,219
And I prefer being surrounded by nature

104
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,588
to being in the city.

105
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:52,358
How many times have you been
to Nami Island, our destination today?

106
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:53,926
I'm sure you're not curious,

107
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:56,362
but I once went with an ex-boyfriend.

108
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:57,764
-You did?
-Yes.

109
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,866
How are you doing?

110
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,201
FRANTIC WAVING

111
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,936
There's a drone too.

112
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:06,039
I'm doing just fine!

113
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,543
Is it okay to say things like that?

114
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,612
-Yeah, it's fine.
-Are you sure?

115
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:13,680
It's fine.

116
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:18,818
I've also been to Nami Island before.

117
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:20,720
When did you come?

118
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,055
Last December.

119
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:23,589
What brought you to Nami Island?

120
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:27,060
I'd always stayed in Seoul,

121
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:33,366
but our crew recommended the place
as a good tourist spot.

122
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,068
What did you do here?

123
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:36,602
I didn't have much time…

124
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,137
Wow, what? You freaked me out.

125
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:42,208
Are you actually Korean?

126
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,043
No, I only speak a little.

127
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,280
I'm studying Korean at the moment.

128
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,748
Oh, you're studying Korean?

129
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,183
Actually, I also…

130
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:52,485
My skills are an embarrassment, but…

131
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:56,556
Japanese?

132
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:57,990
-Right.
-Yes.

133
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,026
It's brand new.

134
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,260
PRACTICALLY UNUSED

135
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:03,029
That's why I'm so bad.

136
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,430
Did she buy it for today?

137
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,499
-Yes.
-Wait, really?

138
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:07,800
But it's brand new.

139
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:11,003
And, while traveling today,

140
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,340
I thought we could take some photos,
so I brought this.

141
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,542
Thank you. I'll take some of you.

142
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,544
-Of each other.
-I see, okay.

143
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:20,246
Is it not heavy?

144
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:23,182
-Oh, it's fine.
-Are you sure?

145
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:26,319
Aren't you cold?
It's a lot colder today than I'd expected.

146
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,955
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm okay. This is thick.

147
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:29,856
That's good.

148
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,592
It's colder than expected today, so…

149
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:34,260
Wow, you're great at Korean.

150
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,495
Everyone.

151
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:37,597
-Be careful.
-Oh my!

152
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:38,731
He's so sweet.

153
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:39,899
You're so kind.

154
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,033
Not at all.

155
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,368
And cute!

156
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,071
No, please.

157
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:50,410
ARRIVED AT NAMI ISLAND

158
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,479
Then what did you do
the last time you were here?

159
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,081
The last time I came,

160
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,216
there was a lot of snow.

161
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:00,653
There were a lot of campfire spots.

162
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,089
-We grilled marshmallows.
-Marshmallows!

163
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,057
That's so adorable.

164
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,460
There was so much snow back then,

165
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:10,897
but right now, there's so much green.
It's so lush it's lifting my mood.

166
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:14,167
If you like nature,
there should be a lot for you to see.

167
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:19,105
Then what sort of traveler
are you normally?

168
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,673
I don't really plan ahead.

169
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,577
I think I'm the type to travel
wherever my heart takes me.

170
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,379
Then, when you're traveling,

171
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,281
you enjoy freedom?

172
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,850
So you'll do something
if you're drawn to it?

173
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:31,918
Exactly.

174
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:37,423
-What is it?
-This path is stunning.

175
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,925
You're right. I just saw it.

176
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,128
You picked up on it earlier than me.

177
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,297
It really is stunning--

178
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,298
Wait, what is it?

179
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,433
Are you… Are you okay?

180
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:49,435
It makes me want to run.

181
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:50,837
Are you running away from me?

182
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,538
Do you want to go home?

183
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:57,343
It's such a beautiful path
that it makes me want to run.

184
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,111
I thought I'd try since we're on a trip.

185
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:00,513
It's so pretty.

186
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:02,682
-It's pretty.
-Pretty.

187
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,417
-Pretty.
-Yes, pretty.

188
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:09,188
It's not the very first thing I learned,
but a Korean phrase I learned early on is…

189
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,824
-One more of this, please.
-One more of this?

190
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,026
I learned it immediately.

191
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,929
I learned "One more of this, please,"

192
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,165
and "Receipt, please."

193
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:24,770
Why do you know how to say
"Receipt, please"?

194
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,706
If I don't collect the receipt,

195
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,508
it's hard to do my tax returns.

196
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,010
You're a humorous guy.

197
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,479
You have a great sense of humor.

198
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:37,149
Then, let's come up with
some rules for our trip.

199
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:39,652
Anything you want me to avoid doing

200
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,455
and anything you'd like me to do.

201
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,958
I think it would be good to have a theme
or a goal for us to achieve.

202
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,094
What shall we do?

203
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:49,829
What could we do?

204
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,467
How about I try to learn
some Korean phrases during our trip?

205
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,102
Hey, that sounds good.

206
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:59,205
-Then I'll learn some Japanese phrases.
-Yes.

207
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,640
Hey, you're replying in Korean.

208
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,410
THE RULES OF THIS TRIP:
LEARN EACH OTHER'S LANGUAGES

209
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,513
What are these…
Oh, they're double cherry blossoms?

210
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,748
Double cherry blossoms.

211
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:11,951
They're different
from the weeping cherry blossoms in Japan.

212
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,420
DOUBLE CHERRY BLOSSOMS
WITH MULTIPLE LAYERS OF PETALS

213
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,456
They're very full.
Is that the right way of saying it? Full?

214
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:18,824
Yes.

215
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,928
The weeping cherry blossoms in Japan
droop down like this.

216
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,196
JAPANESE CHERRY BLOSSOMS
DROOP LIKE WILLOW TREES

217
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,001
They're so pretty.

218
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,805
Oh, photos.

219
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:34,974
Photos? Yes! I'll take some photos of you.

220
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,242
Why don't you

221
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,011
stand behind the flowers?

222
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,747
Behind the flowers?

223
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,082
One with the blossoms.

224
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,151
Shall I just stand here?

225
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:47,386
Yes!

226
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,122
Should I smile or not?

227
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,458
Not a wide smile, but just slightly.

228
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:54,727
Just slightly?

229
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,165
I feel a little shy.

230
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,700
Three, two, one!

231
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,072
You counted "three, two, one" in Korean.

232
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:08,741
Why don't you stand in the same spot?

233
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,177
-Okay.
-I'll take one of you.

234
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,813
Wow, it's like a movie poster.

235
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,448
Wow.

236
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,383
It's a photo spot.

237
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,051
You look so… wow.

238
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:22,955
You look great.

239
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,791
One, two, three.

240
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,697
-Was it good?
-Good?

241
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,799
It's so pretty. Like a movie poster.

242
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:39,639
The weather's lovely.

243
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,541
Yes, it's warmed up a bit.

244
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:43,709
Do you like walking?

245
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,879
I do like walking, yes.

246
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,718
Ostriches!

247
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:53,786
They're so cute.

248
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,288
But they're quite big.

249
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:01,761
But it's called Gangtrich,
meaning it's a gangster ostrich.

250
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,666
GANGTRICH'S HOME

251
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:08,868
The reason it's a gangster ostrich

252
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:11,303
is it stole and ate a tourist's lunch.

253
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,873
-It did?
-It's so cute.

254
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:14,974
Hello.

255
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,643
If you get too close…

256
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,578
it might approach you.

257
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:21,447
PROTECTIVE

258
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:24,583
CAREFUL

259
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:27,253
Its feet are huge.

260
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,588
How fascinating.
Have you seen ostriches before?

261
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:31,691
Never this close, no.

262
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,192
They're cute.

263
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,293
Cute.

264
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:36,762
Wow, look at that!

265
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,000
There are a lot of animals.

266
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,302
They're kinda cute.

267
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:46,539
How adorable. Just look at them!

268
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,474
APPROACHING CAUTIOUSLY

269
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,009
Be careful.

270
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,143
TURNING AWAY

271
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,878
No, they're just leaving.

272
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,782
They're leaving. They're not interested.

273
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,218
Just look at them.

274
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:00,386
They're so cute.

275
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:05,124
What if we approach them slowly
and pretend we have food?

276
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:07,159
RUBBING HIS FINGERS

277
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:10,996
It thinks you have food, so it's…
It's running away.

278
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,499
RUTHLESS

279
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,102
They're not interested. This is hilarious.

280
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:17,803
Where are you guys off to?

281
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,940
QUIETLY CARRIES HER BAG

282
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,776
They're actually waddling.

283
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,112
NOPE

284
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,115
-Wow, they're big.
-This guy here.

285
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,916
It has a lump on its forehead.

286
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:32,818
WADDLING TOGETHER

287
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:33,753
They're so cute.

288
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:36,622
What's over there?
They're all waddling over in a trance.

289
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,525
Oh, it's their food.

290
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,861
I guess it's time for food.

291
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,295
I see they eat cabbages.

292
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:45,464
NOTICED HER BAG

293
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,166
Oh my, thank you.

294
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:49,769
They're adorable.

295
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,437
So cute. They're drinking water.

296
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,038
They're adorable!

297
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,509
WAILING

298
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:58,511
I think that's a peacock crying.

299
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,580
So they sit up in trees like that.

300
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:04,350
It's saying "Yes."

301
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,451
It's a complete mess.

302
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:07,920
WAILING SOME MORE

303
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:09,455
An absolute mess.

304
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,591
So you like animals.

305
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:14,894
Yes, I do. But I've never had the chance

306
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,329
to see ostriches and peacocks this close,

307
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,399
so I'm having a lot of fun.

308
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,239
Does Japan have Life4Cuts?

309
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,140
Sticker photos.

310
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,409
We have sticker photos, yes,

311
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,113
but I don't think I've seen Life4Cuts.

312
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,915
It's everywhere in Korea.

313
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:40,252
We can choose headbands here to wear.

314
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,122
Hey, why don't we choose each other's?

315
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,623
Sure, okay.

316
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:49,862
This here is poop.

317
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:51,564
I'm joking, of course.

318
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:53,833
What's this?

319
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,038
I'm choosing this one.

320
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,673
CHOOSING EACH OTHER'S HEADBANDS

321
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,008
-A flower.
-A flower?

322
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,014
You look cute.

323
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,150
Why did you pick this one for me?

324
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,484
BOBBING

325
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,119
Aren't those bear ears?

326
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,855
I just thought it would suit you.

327
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:20,359
BOBBING TOGETHER

328
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:21,594
It's shaking a lot.

329
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:24,663
This is fun.

330
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,668
We're going to take some photos.
Come on in.

331
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,504
SHOOTING FOUR CUTS

332
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:34,707
SNAP

333
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:35,608
Damn it.

334
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,277
FIRST PHOTO BLOWN

335
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,047
SNAP

336
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,151
This is so annoying.

337
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,486
What is that?

338
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,722
I think we're too inexperienced at this.

339
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:50,890
You're right.

340
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:56,228
It's okay.
We can cover it up with a filter.

341
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,730
Bright?

342
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,865
Bright? Sounds good.

343
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,904
You can save this video on your phone.

344
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:13,479
FOUR CUTS TO REMEMBER
THE FLOWER AND THE BEAR

345
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,615
I'm having so much fun today.

346
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:18,951
LOVERS' GAZEBO

347
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,654
I heard that you're a great drawer.

348
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,456
UM…

349
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:25,858
My drawings are

350
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,026
so-so.

351
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,160
-So-so?
-Yes.

352
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,495
Then shall we see?

353
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:30,763
Sure.

354
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:31,697
PREPARED

355
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,533
But, Do-yeon,
aren't you a great drawer yourself?

356
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,434
Me?

357
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,371
I majored in visual design

358
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,374
but got in through
the English special admissions track.

359
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,610
One of my professors saw my drawings

360
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:46,845
and said they should remove the track.

361
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:50,182
My skills are nagari.

362
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,450
NAGARI: FALSE LOANWORD FOR FAIL

363
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:56,588
But you must have studied things
like composition and design, right?

364
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,023
All of that was nagari.

365
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,992
That's why I'm doing what I do now.

366
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,798
Then shall we draw each other's faces?

367
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,199
Each other's faces?

368
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,102
I've already said
my skills are nonexistent,

369
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,603
so I apologize in advance.

370
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,038
As for me…

371
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,941
Drawing people's faces is difficult.

372
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,609
It is, yes.

373
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,746
Even if it's not an exact likeness,

374
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,482
we can try to draw each other
based on our impressions

375
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,284
from our time together so far.

376
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:26,251
It's up to you.

377
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:27,987
The rules are

378
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:30,055
we can't get mad at each other.

379
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:31,190
Of course.

380
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,791
And no going back to Japan.

381
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,094
I can't leave for Japan?

382
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,495
I'm worried you might run away.

383
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:40,466
Let's get drawing, then.

384
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:41,533
I'm nervous.

385
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,470
INTENSE GAZE

386
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:45,471
LOOK

387
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:46,905
PEEK

388
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:48,907
STARE

389
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:53,812
My drawing's awful.

390
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:58,117
It won't be.

391
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,319
It won't be? You understand everything.

392
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,706
Why are you smiling?

393
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:24,676
This is harder than I imagined.

394
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:26,645
Drawing people's faces

395
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:29,448
is quite the challenge.

396
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,851
I haven't seen yours, but don't worry.
I'm sure it's better than mine.

397
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,219
No, just one second.

398
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,622
What the heck is this?

399
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:47,566
When you draw, where do you start?

400
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,968
I normally start with the eyes,

401
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:52,504
but today,
I tried starting with your fringe.

402
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,972
I think that was a bad move.

403
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,708
Where do you start, Kentaro-san?

404
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,712
I started by drawing your hair.

405
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:03,315
You did the same as me.

406
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,288
From our conversations until now,

407
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,557
what do you think
the rest of our trip will be like?

408
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:16,328
A leisurely trip where I feel at peace.

409
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,767
You get to meet a lot of people

410
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:24,103
and talk to a lot of guests, right?

411
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,504
I do.

412
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:29,508
Does that ever get exhausting at all?

413
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,144
Everyone has a different personality.

414
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,512
You're right.

415
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,148
Ahead of every shoot,

416
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,917
I get a little anxious and scared.

417
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,185
Right.

418
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:41,854
But, from every conversation,

419
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,591
I take away something new.
I learn something from everyone.

420
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,260
So it feels like I'm learning.

421
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:51,597
So I can't wait to find out

422
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,966
what I'll learn from you
during today's trip.

423
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,602
That's a great way of looking at it.

424
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:59,838
I'm going to absorb all of this wisdom
and become omnipotent.

425
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,374
I'll become the world's oyabun.

426
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:03,275
OYABUN: BOSS

427
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,513
I think you will, though.

428
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:10,816
If you absorb all these good traits
from various people.

429
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,050
I just try my best.

430
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:13,352
I'm shimai.

431
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:14,353
SHIMAI: FINISHED

432
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,255
I'm also finished.

433
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:22,194
Who'll show theirs first?

434
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,795
Let's do rock, paper, scissors.

435
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:24,963
Rock, paper, scissors?

436
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:25,864
Rock, paper…

437
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:28,734
Wait, who shows theirs first?
The winner or the loser?

438
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,202
The winner shows theirs first.

439
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,804
The winner, understood.

440
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:33,772
Rock, paper, scissors.

441
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,875
(LOSER) (WINNER)

442
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:39,444
What should I do?

443
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,547
My drawing is honestly disrespectful.

444
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:42,915
Not at all.

445
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,917
Shall we reveal them together?

446
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:46,919
Then

447
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:48,387
look at mine first.

448
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,159
TAKING PEEKS

449
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:58,964
I'm sorry!

450
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:00,299
You did a great job.

451
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,734
I'm so sorry!

452
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:04,336
You did a great job.

453
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:10,309
My drawing looks
as though it's not quite finished.

454
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,010
You did a great job.

455
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,279
REVEALING KENTARO'S FACE

456
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,050
I messed up.

457
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:19,785
He looks way too chubby.

458
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:20,686
Do I?

459
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:23,589
I was so busy chatting
that I gave you chubby cheeks.

460
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:24,957
But this…

461
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,793
-It's me today.
-I feel terrible.

462
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:30,195
-I'm so sorry.
-You can instantly tell it's me.

463
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:31,697
I feel so bad.

464
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:34,132
I'm so sorry. Maybe I should try to…

465
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,401
Maybe I can slim the cheeks somehow.

466
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:37,302
Like this, maybe?

467
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,504
You have such a strong jawline, but I…

468
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,907
People will see this and think,
"Oh, it's Sakaguchi."

469
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,275
I feel so bad.

470
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,978
She wrote, "I'm sorry."

471
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,747
-May I talk you through it?
-Shoot.

472
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:53,685
Well, from the get-go,
I knew I could never capture

473
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:57,089
that beautiful face of yours.

474
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,791
So rather than try to capture your beauty,

475
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:01,827
I went for some key characteristics.

476
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:04,529
Earlier, when we were taking photos,

477
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,899
you were so lovable, bobbing your head
with that flower headband on.

478
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:10,102
So I added the flower right here.

479
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:13,205
And your hair's curled nicely,
so I added that.

480
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,108
Your long lashes and tall nose.

481
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:17,743
Your tightly shut lips when listening.

482
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:22,848
But I finished off the face like this,
which messed it all up.

483
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,549
Please, not at all.

484
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,785
So, looking at the final product,
I'm sorry.

485
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:29,521
It's awesome.

486
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:31,056
You honestly did a great job.

487
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,358
I'm so sorry.
He did such a lovely drawing of me.

488
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:36,662
But my drawing is incomplete.

489
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:39,231
Could you please explain your drawing?

490
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,567
When I started drawing this,

491
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:47,506
I wanted to capture the beauty
of Do-yeon's side profile.

492
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:49,908
But then

493
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:53,578
I sensed you may have moments
of feeling the fleeting nature of things,

494
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,247
so I just drew you like this.

495
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,148
Wow.

496
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:58,684
That's so poetic.

497
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,522
He has such a handsome soul.

498
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:07,359
That was just my impression of her.

499
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,262
I'm so flattered.

500
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,999
This has been
the highlight of today so far.

501
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,233
That makes me happy.

502
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,668
-You're the best.
-The best?

503
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,403
Kentaro, you're the best.

504
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:24,776
Why does he look more swollen
every time I look at it? It's odd.

505
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:26,745
He keeps getting chubbier.

506
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:28,447
This is also an awesome drawing.

507
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,215
It's the worst.

508
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:31,283
I'm sorry.

509
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,218
Can I get this later…

510
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:34,386
Wait, can I take this?

511
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,321
Of course!

512
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:39,725
Of course. And I'm going to take this.

513
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,861
Aren't you hungry?

514
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,429
I am hungry, yes.

515
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,599
Then shall we go to eat something warm?

516
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:49,701
Let's go.

517
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:50,802
Sure, let's go.

518
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,205
This way.

519
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,778
Man, I was nervous.

520
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:04,416
It was a little chilly
by the lake earlier,

521
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:06,118
so we're going to eat something warm.

522
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:09,788
There's a hearty and nourishing meal
Koreans eat to recharge.

523
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,022
It's called samgyetang.

524
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:12,557
Have you ever had it before?

525
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:16,561
Is that the dish with an entire chicken?

526
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,830
Yes. A whole chicken
with its legs crossed.

527
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:19,998
Right, yes.

528
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:21,900
I've tried it before.

529
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:25,937
Park Bo-gum once invited me

530
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:29,508
to have dinner with him.

531
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,077
That's what we ate then.

532
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,079
How do you two know each other?

533
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:40,886
I once attended MAMA to present an award,

534
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:42,854
and he was hosting.

535
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:46,191
We got to know each other then,

536
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:52,164
and so whenever I'm in Korea,
we get in touch and grab a bite to eat.

537
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:55,534
Does Bo-gum speak Japanese, then?

538
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,036
Or do you speak in Korean?

539
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,238
We mix the two.

540
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,975
Sometimes we'll speak in English.

541
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:08,513
When neither of us understands,
we seek the help of an interpreter.

542
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,551
So you met through work
but have built a personal relationship.

543
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,985
Exactly.

544
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:18,723
Whenever I'm in Korea,
I don't know how to best spend my time.

545
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:23,829
So he often recommends places I should go.

546
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:25,197
But more than anything,

547
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:28,467
I love spending time
over a good, hearty meal.

548
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,770
-Here, come in.
-Sure.

549
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:34,372
Look at this place.

550
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:36,308
It's nice.

551
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:37,476
This is nice.

552
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:38,410
It is.

553
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:42,781
There's this?

554
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,350
We met these guys earlier.

555
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:46,551
On Nami Island.

556
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:47,619
Right, ducks.

557
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:50,589
Do you remember?
How they waddled like this?

558
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:54,359
Hello.

559
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:55,627
-Hello.
-Hello.

560
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,863
We have nokdu samgyetang
and silky fowl samgyetang.

561
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:58,763
Then…

562
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,065
Do you like mung beans?

563
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:01,666
Yes, I like it.

564
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:04,035
Two nokdu samgyetang
and nokdu pancakes, please.

565
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:06,304
And for drinks,

566
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:07,939
shall we try fresh makgeolli?

567
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,074
Sure.

568
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,041
-Please.
-Sure.

569
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:11,009
Please.

570
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,846
I'm speaking Japanese to a Korean now.

571
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,882
Deary me, I'm pretty much Japanese now.

572
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:22,320
In our country, mothers-in-law
often feed their sons-in-law samgyetang

573
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:25,590
to give them strength.

574
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:28,326
So there's a tradition of catching hens

575
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:30,395
when the son-in-law comes over.

576
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:31,863
SAMGYETANG, A DISH SERVED WITH CARE

577
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,865
When I think of samgyetang,

578
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:38,236
I think of it as being a dish
that is good for your health.

579
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:39,504
You're right.

580
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:42,474
There seem to be
a lot of healthy ingredients.

581
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,942
Many of them are used as medicine.

582
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:47,112
Have you tried this before?

583
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:48,580
I haven't.

584
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,682
I haven't had fresh rice wine in a while.

585
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,785
(ALLOW ME)

586
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:56,187
Please don't treat me like an elder.

587
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:00,258
It's pretty much water.

588
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:01,593
THE MAKGEOLLI IS CLEAR…?

589
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,195
-You need to shake it.
-Why aren't you shaking it?

590
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:11,169
Let's shake it up and try again.

591
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:14,606
Is it okay to shake it like this?

592
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:16,007
I think it should be fine…

593
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,609
Yes, I think it's fine.

594
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:19,778
Right, there it is.

595
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:20,979
This is it.

596
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,682
This is entirely different.

597
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:27,118
DON'T FORGET TO SHAKE YOUR MAKGEOLLI!

598
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,456
Wishing you health.

599
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,024
Thank you for the food.

600
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,498
-It's good.
-Right? It's really good.

601
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:43,301
TODAY'S MAIN DISH
SAMGYETANG IS SERVED

602
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:44,769
Wow.

603
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,408
NOKDU SAMGYETANG
MILD AND NUTTY, MADE WITH MUNG BEANS

604
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,477
It's so fragrant.

605
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,511
It's hot.

606
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:55,046
Yes, please be careful.

607
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:58,083
Do you start with the drumsticks
or the breasts?

608
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:59,117
The drumsticks.

609
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:00,685
The drumsticks.

610
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:02,087
Thank you so much.

611
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:03,021
NOKDU JEON

612
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:06,224
MADE WITH GROUND MUNG BEANS,
CRISPY ON THE OUTSIDE, NUTTY ON THE INSIDE

613
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:13,131
Wow, it's nutty.

614
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,900
I can actually taste the mung bean.

615
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:22,207
It's so nutty.

616
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:24,676
-It's good.
-Is it?

617
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,779
Please season it to your liking.

618
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,584
And try the nokdu jeon.

619
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,985
-Chijimi.
-Chijimi.

620
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:37,055
Is chijimi called chijimi in Korean?

621
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:38,623
-We call it jeon.
-Jeom?

622
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:40,425
-Jeon.
-Jeong.

623
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,128
-Jeon.
-Jeong.

624
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:45,530
-Jeon.
-Jeon.

625
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:46,798
GOT IT ON HIS 4TH TRY

626
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:48,667
-Nok.
-Nuk.

627
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:49,701
-Nok.
-Nog.

628
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:50,902
-Nok.
-Nok.

629
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:52,103
-Du.
-Du.

630
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,438
-Jeon.
-Jeon.

631
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:56,274
-Nokdu jeon.
-Nogdu jom.

632
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:58,710
TRYING TO NAIL THE PRONUNCIATION

633
00:27:58,777 --> 00:27:59,878
-Nok.
-Nok.

634
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:01,546
-Du.
-Du.

635
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,348
-Jeon.
-Jeon.

636
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,216
Nokdu jeon.

637
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:06,384
Nokdu jeon.

638
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:08,620
Yes, that's it! Go ahead and eat now.

639
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:11,756
You've passed! Go on.

640
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:14,092
CRISP

641
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:16,995
This is good.

642
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:20,832
It's so crispy.

643
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:26,805
-That's delicious.
-Right?

644
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:30,709
When you were asked to come on this show,

645
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:33,278
what made you say yes?

646
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:36,681
I saw your show on YouTube,

647
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:41,453
the one that's like a talk show.

648
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,621
After watching that, I wanted to meet you.

649
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:50,028
I thought I'd love to have
a conversation with you.

650
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:52,030
Thank you for saying that.

651
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:55,233
And what's your impression of me now?

652
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,701
MEATY QUESTION

653
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:58,269
You're really…

654
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:02,974
You've made me feel so comfortable
that I've been able to be myself.

655
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:07,879
It almost makes me a little worried

656
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:10,882
about whether this can air.

657
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:12,650
Wow, really?

658
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:18,523
My one goal before having you on
was to make you feel comfortable.

659
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:20,725
TOUCHED

660
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:21,626
Cheers.

661
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:25,196
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

662
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,969
Earlier, we talked about drinking.

663
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,204
I would guess this is a breeze for you.

664
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,372
What's your limit?

665
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:36,641
I don't know my limit.

666
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:39,544
Maybe three bottles of soju?

667
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:41,780
Wow.

668
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,314
-Would you like some more?
-Yes.

669
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:45,250
You're a great drinker.

670
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:47,852
Thank you.

671
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:52,824
(MY TURN)

672
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:53,725
NO, SIR

673
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,793
READING THE MOOD

674
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:56,094
PLAYFUL TEASING

675
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,568
Thank you.

676
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:19,651
I think it's specific to Korean culture

677
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:23,154
to support someone's glass
when they pour themselves a drink.

678
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,192
You're absolutely right.
You touch the glass like this,

679
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:28,626
or say "Bluetooth" if you're far.

680
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:30,695
-Oh, Wi-Fi?
-Wi-Fi.

681
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:33,264
It's "Wi-Fi"! Not Bluetooth!

682
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,133
I'm so embarrassed!

683
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,070
Bluetooth is much longer to say, so…

684
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:40,805
I feel so ashamed.

685
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:44,042
LEARNING KOREAN CULTURE FROM KENTARO

686
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:48,746
In Korea,
people really enjoy making toasts.

687
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:51,416
-Right, we do.
-In Japan, we only do the first glass.

688
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:56,154
Then why don't you make a toast,
and then we'll clink glasses?

689
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:00,758
-Today is…
-Today is?

690
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,560
This show…

691
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:03,661
FLUENT

692
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:08,166
I don't know.

693
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:09,334
You don't know?

694
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,268
My Korean is…

695
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,303
Thanks to you all…

696
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,872
FLUENT AGAIN

697
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:15,673
…I'm having so much fun.

698
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,075
Thank you.

699
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:18,243
Thank you!

700
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:19,410
How sweet.

701
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:22,180
I barely managed!

702
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:24,115
Now we'll toast my way.

703
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,085
The person making the toast
should stand up.

704
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:33,591
So, Kentaro is here today from Japan.

705
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:38,162
All in all, here's to hoping
he maintains a good impression of Korea.

706
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,831
NOD

707
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,833
When we take the mic off him,

708
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,302
let's hope he can say,
"Well, this was fun."

709
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:46,537
I will grind my body and soul
into today's shoot

710
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:48,706
to make it the best trip of his life.

711
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,341
I vow this

712
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:52,610
in front of you all today.

713
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:55,613
Now, for the toast.

714
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,349
Let's enjoy our youth.
We're not getting any younger!

715
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:08,059
You really went all in for that toast.

716
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:10,595
Do you remember today's rule?

717
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:11,496
Rule?

718
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:14,065
Right, to learn some Japanese?

719
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:15,199
Later,

720
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:17,368
after this meal,

721
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,637
we'll be moving to a café. There…

722
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:23,174
You have to do this motion too.

723
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:24,742
"Hey!"

724
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,480
"Please put it on my card."

725
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:31,149
That means I'd be paying, right?

726
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:35,086
But you have to do the motion. "Hey!"

727
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:39,857
Once I order and say,
"We'll be paying with this,"

728
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:41,259
you have to go…

729
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:42,293
"Hey!"

730
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:44,729
"Please put it on my card."

731
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,099
I think I'll be able to use this.

732
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:50,368
"Please put it on my card."

733
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:51,402
Please put it…

734
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,303
Please put it…

735
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,572
-On my card.
-Please put it on my card.

736
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,473
Hey!

737
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,308
MASTERED IT

738
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:58,576
Now, teach me something.

739
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:02,780
It's all right.

740
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:04,716
Wait, so I'd be paying?

741
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,286
KENTARO… I NEVER TOOK YOU
FOR THAT KINDA GUY

742
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:10,421
Wow, he's a genius.

743
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:13,458
I mean, I guess you'd be smart
given your career.

744
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,196
What was it again?
Please repeat it for me.

745
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:20,064
When they try to get out their card…

746
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:22,667
-It's all right.
-It's all right.

747
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,702
-Please put it on this card.
-This cart?

748
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:28,406
-Please put it on this card.
-Please put it on this card.

749
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,274
Please put it on this card.

750
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,175
Then you'd say,

751
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:32,176
"Hey!"

752
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:34,679
"Please put it on my card."

753
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,915
INFINITE CYCLE OF OFFERING TO PAY

754
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:40,218
Until the café closes for the day.

755
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:41,419
Yeah, okay.

756
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:43,421
The cashier would ask us to "Please stop!"

757
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:46,057
"Stop!"

758
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:49,594
The most important thing
is the "Hey," right?

759
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,262
And the "It's all right"?

760
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,332
Please put it on this card.

761
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:56,000
-On this card.
-You've got it.

762
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,103
Wow.

763
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:00,838
Makgeolli shimai.

764
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:01,906
Shimai?

765
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:03,508
Do you not say "shimai"?

766
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:05,209
When would I say "shimai"?

767
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,211
The word is a little

768
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:09,647
outdated.

769
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:10,882
It sounds old.

770
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:15,486
OLD PERSON HANGS HER HEAD IN SHAME

771
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,455
AHEM

772
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:20,591
After chugging the drink, copy me.

773
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:22,293
Down it.

774
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:26,864
GLASS ABOVE HER HEAD

775
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:29,233
FASCINATED

776
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,935
Is it to show the glass is empty?

777
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:34,705
That was great.

778
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:38,276
-Shimai.
-Shimai.

779
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:42,213
Kentaro.

780
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,115
Card…

781
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:45,550
Hey!

782
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,720
I'm sorry. I don't have my card.

783
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,657
-Thank you.
-Kentaro, you're a punk!

784
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:55,927
-Thank you.
-Kentaro, you're a punk.

785
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:57,695
Split it!

786
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,564
I don't have my card. I'm so sorry!

787
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:01,766
-Split it!
-Thank you!

788
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:05,136
-Shimai.
-Shimai.

789
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:09,674
FULL BELLIES AND GOOD MOODS

790
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,975
A HEAVENLY TRIP

791
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,043
BUT DON'T GET TOO COMFY!

792
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,978
WE'RE IN FOR AN ENDLESS BATTLE
OF OFFERING TO PAY

793
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:16,047
Please put it on this card.

794
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,617
WHO WILL WIN THE GLORY OF PAYING?

795
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:22,720
SOMEWHERE KENTARO ALWAYS VISITS
WHEN HE COMES TO KOREA?

796
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:23,721
A pojangmacha?

797
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,223
JUST FOR KENTARO

798
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:28,726
WE'VE PREPARED THE BEST
OF KOREAN STREET TENT FOOD

799
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:29,961
EVEN DO-YEON'S IN LOVE?

800
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:31,028
NODDING WITH JOY

801
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:32,096
It's so good!

802
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:34,065
AND THE SCENE WE'VE ALL WAITED FOR

803
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:34,999
-Like mushrooms?
-Yes.

804
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:35,933
-You like tofu?
-Yes.

805
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:38,503
-Do you like me?
-Yes!

806
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,273
AND A JANGDOBARI VERSION

807
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:44,242
Do you like me?

808
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:45,810
Yes!

809
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:47,812
YOU CAN'T HELP BUT LOVE

810
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,881
HIS PURE AND WARM CHARM

811
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,350
COMING TO YOU LIKE A MAGICAL DREAM

812
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:53,284
What was that?

813
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,253
I can't believe
I met another perfect partner.

814
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:58,689
THE PERFECT PARTNER RETURNS NEXT WEEK…!
