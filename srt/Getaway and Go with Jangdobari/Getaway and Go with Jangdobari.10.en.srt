33
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,949
I was told that this place
is one of the local favorites.

34
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,051
It feels like a roadside eatery.
I love it.

35
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,387
Shrimp dumpling sounds nice.
What do you think?

36
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:29,022
I've been craving dumplings!

37
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,490
Shrimp dumpling, it is.

38
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:32,826
-Wanjatang looks tasty.
-Let's order that too.

39
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:36,029
Can you recommend a good dry noodle dish?

00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:45,805
-Let's add naejangtang.
-Naejangtang.

44
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:47,240
How do you say that?

45
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,375
-Neizang tang.
-Neizang tang?

46
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,310
SOUNDS SIMILAR

47
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:51,478
Okay, good.

48
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:52,879

SOMEONE IS GETTING NERVOUS

61
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,840
IS SHE PLAYING CHARADES?

62
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:22,942
That, and this…

63
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:23,843
Delicious!

64
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,744

72
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,028
Oh, that's right.

We can order side dishes too.

74
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,432
SCANNING

75
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,801
Do-yeon, I don't know what this is,
but it looks good.

76
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,637
-Let's have that.
-Looks just like gopchang.

77
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:51,838
Pick anything you want.

78
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,640
-Are these two the same?
-I think so.

79
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,375
I think you picked the good ones.

80
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:57,744
OWNER'S RECOMMENDATION

-Let's have these two.

83
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,984
(THE OWNER HAS HER HANDS FULL)

84
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:06,920
What should we call the owner?

85
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:09,522
"JIE JIE" MEANING OLDER SISTER

86
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:12,392
-Oh, jie jie!
-That sounds like Jaejae.

87
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,726
-Your friend Jaejae.
-Jie jie?

88
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:14,761
Jie jie?

89
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:18,565
Let me fix it up for you just a little.

90
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:19,566
Heat them up?

91
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:22,135
-She's doing something.
-She's warming them up.

92
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:28,241
PORK BRAISED WITH SOY SAUCE, GARLIC,
GINGER, LEEK, AND MORE

93
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:31,277
She's made it look even more delicious.

94
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:33,713
This has to be good.

95
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,981
It smells amazing too.

96
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,021
I'm so excited.

97
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,524
-Try it.
-I'll take this one.

98
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,028
FOOD KEEPS COMING

99
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:50,096
Look at this one.

100
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,734
Delicious.

101
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,303
-It's so soft.
-I can taste sesame oil.

102
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,304
So good!

103
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,106
-Very nutty.
-Soy sauce and sesame oil.

104
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:03,943
This is insane.

105
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:07,347
LOU MEI: A TAIWANESE-STYLE BRAISED DISH

106
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:12,085
TOFU, EGGS, VEGETABLES, AND MEAT SIMMERED
IN SOY-AND-SPICE BROTH

107
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:14,554
THEN TOPPED WITH LEEK AND GINGER

108
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:16,623
This place is awesome.

109
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,925
It's strongly seasoned, but it's good.

110
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,796
This tastes
like it's more than just boiled tofu.

111
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:25,331
This must be the sauce.

112
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:30,203
Is it good?

113
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,738
It suits your taste, huh?

114
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,040
It's basically a soy sauce-based dish.

115
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,442
I can taste a hint of ginger,
which is good.

116
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:39,012
How does it taste so good?

117
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:39,946
Let's try this too.

118
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,681
DRY NOODLES WITH SOY SAUCE,
GARLIC, AND MEAT

119
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:42,649
Gan mian.

120
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:46,686
This looks like a treat.
Oh my God, it smells great.

121
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,988
Savory.
Wait, it kind of smells like jjajang.

122
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:51,724
-Right?
-Yeah.

123
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,825
I can smell jjajang.

124
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:53,960
Neizang tang!

125
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,161
Naejangtang?

126
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:57,630
CLEAR SOUP DISH MADE WITH PORK OFFAL

127
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:58,898
Let me give it a taste.

128
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,236
It's got all the tasty ingredients.

129
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,604
STEAMY

130
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,339
I'm going to try the noodles.

131
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,275
Let's have a reaction battle
to see who enjoys it more.

132
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,477
It won't be easy for you to beat me.

133
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,279
I've lost already.

134
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,214
Come on, give it a go.

135
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:16,916
I don't fight a losing battle.

136
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,451
Gong wan tang!

137
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,687
-Gong wan tang.
-Gong wan tang!

138
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,524
Jie jie! Xie xie!

139
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:28,594
STRIKES FIRST

140
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,935
I didn't see that coming.

141
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,503
That caught me off guard.

142
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,405
I would never win against you.

143
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:40,873
But you just did.

144
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,142
-The food's all here. The table's full.
-It's all here?

145
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,277
That was hilarious.

146
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,517
It doesn't have any of that meaty odor.

147
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:52,585
So good.

148
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:54,520
Shui jiao!

149
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:56,289
Dumplings!

150
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,028
Delicious.

151
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,031
Delicious.

152
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:06,866
Delicious.

153
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,368
HELP ME…

154
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:12,038
Shrimp!

155
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:12,972
What's wrong with her?

156
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,541
Delicious.

157
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,245
Sorry.

158
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,314
-I learned from you.
-Sorry that I tried.

159
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,617
That was the last dish.
I laughed too much.

160
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,953
This is delicious. It's a bit mild.

161
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,621
I guess these go well together.

162
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,390
I wanna taste the shrimp dumpling.

163
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,632
The wrapper tastes amazing.

164
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,401
Dip it in the soy sauce.

165
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,269
The soy sauce is not too salty.

166
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:48,708
Oh my!

167
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,981
So delicious. It really hits the spot.

168
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:59,385
I have to tell the owner
that she's done a great job.

169
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:00,787
Jie jie?

170
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,488
Delicious.

171
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,123
-Thank you.
-Delicious.

172
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:06,392
You're the best.

173
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,262
-Customers just keep coming.
-Yeah.

174
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:10,863
TASTING GAN MIEN

175
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,065
A perfect place
to just drop in for a bite.

176
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:16,068
-Nice and mild, isn't it?
-Uh-huh.

177
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:18,204
It's not too strong. Whenever I go abroad,

178
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,939
the food is always so salty.

179
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,941
The food here is not salty at all.

180
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,743
-It's delicious.
-That's good.

181
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,646
Places that cater to tourists
usually season their food heavily.

182
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:27,547
Yeah.

183
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,081
They have to hit the baseline.

184
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,553
You're good at choosing dishes.

185
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,154
-Was it a good choice?
-Yeah.

186
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,123
-This is awesome.
-Smirk.

187
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:42,161
I get why this is a side.
It goes well with the mains.

188
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,497
-The flavors balance out better.
-Exactly.

189
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:55,007
This noodle is soy sauce-based,
and it's very mild.

190
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:58,311
It's not salty at all. It's very mild.

191
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,613
And it smells like jjajangmyeon.

192
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,116
On the other hand,
this side dish has a strong, salty flavor.

193
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,285
That's why they taste amazing together.

194
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:07,820
-The best choice ever.
-Yeah.

195
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,389
This one's got a strong chive smell.

196
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:14,227
Peek inside the wrapper,
and a big shrimp is nestled in here.

197
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,896
On the side stage,
garlic chives are fan dancing.

198
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:21,934
Like this.

199
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,341
They are all wrapped inside the flour.

200
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,910
Wow, I haven't heard that one before.

201
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,416
I've been dying to ask this.

202
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:41,721
You know how dancers dance
with their facial muscles too?

203
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,689
It's crucial. It's like salt.

204
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:45,825
Like MSG.

205
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,827
It's the best thing
as long as you don't overdo it.

206
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,929
You do a lot of this stuff, don't you?

207
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:57,670
That's so cool.

208
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,805
I don't force it. It comes out naturally.

209
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,607
One more thing about dancing.

210
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:04,343
You have to applaud
when a performance ends, right?

211
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,045
-Try this.
-How do you do it?

212
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,914
-Snap your fingers.
-I've seen it in SWF.

213
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,916
-What does it mean?
-"Good job."

214
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,150
It means "Good job"?

215
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,687
Jie jie.

216
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,188
GOOD JOB

217
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,862
It looks fancy. Like this?

218
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,466
Yeah, it makes me feel
like I'm dancing too.

219
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,805
I learned something good.

220
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,509
Nice. The joy that food brings is immense.

221
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,711
So right. That was an amazing dinner.

222
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:41,080
Is there anything that you don't eat?

223
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,281
-There is one.
-What?

224
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:43,182
Red beans.

225
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,285
HER FAVORITE FOOD

226
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,687
I hate red bean kalguksu.

227
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,623
Why? Are you a ghost?

228
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,359
You got me.

229
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:56,295
I am a ghost.

230
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,564
Why don't you like red beans? Any reason?

231
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:02,568
I don't think
I like the sweetness of red beans.

232
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,470
-They are sweet, you know.
-Yeah.

233
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,505
I mean, red bean kalguksu?

234
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,008
Your hair's the color of red beans.

235
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,445
I'm gonna dye it. I don't like it anymore.

236
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,080
That was a joke!

237
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:16,549
We were going to eat red beans after this.

238
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,017
For me, that's…

239
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,922
-What is this?
-It means closure.

240
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:25,157
-Oh, your door is closed?
-Yeah.

241
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,859
Please open it again. That was a joke.

242
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:27,860
I'm closed for the day.

243
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,138
Are we having red beans?

244
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,673
-No!
-Okay, then.

245
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,574
OPEN ENDING

246
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,578
Isn't it nice to eat outside
when it's raining?

247
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,347
It feels quite romantic.

248
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:52,318
EVERYTHING IS PERFECT IN THIS MOMENT
EVEN THE WEATHER

249
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:55,788
It feels so good to listen
to the sound of rain without getting wet.

250
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,357
You have to be outside.

251
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,593
-Where you can feel the breeze.
-Open air. Exactly.

252
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,962
-I'm loving this.
-I like the vibe here right now.

253
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,031
It's night already.

254
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,600
Oh yeah. The sun's gone down already.

255
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,536
-About that drink we bought earlier…
-Right!

256
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,738
-We also talked about beer.
-I almost forgot.

257
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,640
-Can we drink them now?
-Great idea.

258
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,376
Since we can't have them here,
let's go to the hotel first.

259
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:18,911
-Okay.
-Get some snacks.

260
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,579
THEY PLANNED TO HAVE A DRINK TOGETHER

261
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:23,249
I saw a convenience store over there.

262
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,151
-Jie jie.
-Jie jie.

263
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:26,085
Bill, please.

264
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:29,755
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

265
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:31,757
Jie jie!

266
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:36,529
Thank you!

267
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:37,763
Thank you.

268
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,832
People here are so kind.

269
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,168
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

270
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,003
BELLIES FILLED UP NICELY

271
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,538
The air feels so warm.

272
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,981
PICKING OUT DRINKS AND SNACKS
TO ENJOY AT THE HOTEL

273
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,891
THAT'S A LOT OF STUFF YOU BOUGHT

274
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,527
We're ladies, so we don't eat much.

275
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,429
We grabbed just a handful.

276
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:11,497
We're ladies, you know.

277
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,365
These ladies have full bellies.

278
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,034
-We can't eat much.
-Of course not!

279
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,569
-Just a light bite.
-That's right.

280
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,138
Just enough to help Gabee go to bed.

281
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,741
Think of it like chewing gum after dinner.

282
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,109
Some people overdrink.

283
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:25,244
I hate it when people do that!

284
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,379
NUMBER ONE RULE FOR LADIES:
NO HEAVY DRINKING

285
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:28,981
So uncivilized.

286
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:32,952
Let's keep it light.

287
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:44,630
Fancy hotel.

288
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,165
Looks promising.

289
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,001
We're just going to quench our thirst,
so to speak.

290
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,870
-Okay.
-Get changed into something comfy.

291
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,805
-And no heavy drinking.
-Never!

292
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:55,407
-I'm not interested at all.
-I despise it.

293
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,079
-Let's reunite in about 30 minutes.
-Awesome.

294
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,213
GIRLS' NIGHT BEGINS SOON

295
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,582
Want me to dress more lightly? Sure thing.

296
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,087
I love this place, by the way.

297
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,421
GETTING READY IN THEIR OWN ROOMS

298
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,758
30 MINUTES LATER

299
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,661
I'm off to Do-yeon's room now.

300
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,530
I brought these from Korea for Do-yeon.

301
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:18,430
(FACE MASKS)

302
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,833
I promised not to go to her room,

303
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,568
but she did invite me!

304
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:25,971
Set the table.

305
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,676
GETTING READY TO GREET THE QUEEN

306
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:32,178
Thank you.

307
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,023
Do-yeon!

308
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,059
Do-yeon!

309
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,662
-Hello.
-May I come in?

310
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:51,997
-That's where you stop.
-Right here?

311
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,766
Let's talk like this.

312
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,034
No way!

313
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,636
-A little bit closer.
-Yeah?

314
00:13:57,703 --> 00:13:59,438
One more step.

315
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,074
I brought these for you.

316
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,009
-My favorite face masks.
-Really?

317
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,145
-They are all for me?
-Of course.

318
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:07,780
How thoughtful.

319
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,150
That's what you get from your girl Gabee.

320
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:18,090
So, we have beer
and the indigenous drink we bought today.

321
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:19,158
I want both.

322
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:20,759
INDIGENOUS DRINK FIRST

323
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,361
But let's have this one first.

324
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,096
How about we mix it with soda?

325
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,398
Okay. I'll get the things
you bought from the store.

326
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:29,835
Just one for now?

327
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,337
-Yes, and the ice too.
-Ice.

328
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:35,407
It goes without saying
that the minibar must not be used.

329
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,543
You can't even touch it. Some minibars…

330
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,677
I SURRENDER

331
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,279
They charge you the moment…

332
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,348
EVEN THE QUEENS ARE SCARED OF MINIBARS

333
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,650
…you take your hand off.

334
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,186
Don't get drunk and touch the minibar.

335
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:48,921
-You'll be doomed.
-Seriously.

336
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:51,423
They won't let you go home.
That must not happen.

337
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,425
-Let's drink it on its own first.
-Good.

338
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:56,295
-Then we'll mix the soda.
-I'm so excited.

339
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,267
TAIWANESE INDIGENOUS DRINK

340
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,534
Hope it doesn't explode.

341
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,171
Let me pour you a glass, Your Majesty.

342
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,840
-Thank you.
-Please.

343
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:10,743
-Just a sip.
-Let me.

344
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,011
A PALATE CLEANSER

345
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:14,380
Your Majesty.

346
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:15,681
BACK AND FORTH

347
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,782
Just a sip.

348
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,255
GIRLS' NIGHT KICKS OFF

349
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,626
YES, IT SMELLS JUST RIGHT

350
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,261
It's quite strong.

351
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,600
So delicious. So refreshing.

352
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:35,801
So tart.

353
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,736
I think it would taste better cold.

354
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:38,871
-Ice coming up.
-Okay.

355
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,440
-Drink it like whiskey.
-Cool.

356
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,109
GLUG

357
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,413
-What?
-Water is pouring out.

358
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:49,615
HALF ICE, HALF WATER

359
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,718
Don't care.

360
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,454
-I thought it was a water dispenser.
-Dispenser-style cocktail.

361
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:59,024
-Even better.
-Don't know, don't care!

362
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,827
A dash here, and a dash here.

363
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:04,296
-I have a good feeling about this.
-Me too.

364
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,899
I'll give it a taste first.

365
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:11,971
Tastes like flavored soda.

366
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,273
-It could use more alcohol.
-Yeah?

367
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,874
I'll add just a bit more.

368
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:17,943
-Good, huh?
-More alcohol.

369
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,578
-Just a dash.
-Yeah.

370
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,879
JUST A DASH FOR THE LADIES

371
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:27,152
NOT BAD

372
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:28,887
-This is good.
-Not strong at all.

373
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:31,423
Yeah. It's really good.

374
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,659
I can't stop eating now.

375
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:37,396
SNACK PARTY IS ON

376
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:38,397
Sunflower seeds.

377
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:44,870
In packets, I see.

378
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:54,113
Now, that's a spread!

379
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,482
An elegant banquet is all set.

380
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:57,583
You should eat first.

381
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:58,851
I'll have the sunflower seed.

382
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,252
DO-YEON'S PICK
SUNFLOWER SEED

383
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:01,387
I'm going to try this.

384
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:02,454
GABEE'S PICK
LOCAL SNACK

385
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,758
CAN'T RESIST AN INSTANT REACTION

386
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:09,495
Whoever made this snack must be so proud.

387
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:11,830
-It tastes like fried seaweed.
-Yes!

388
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:13,632
-Plus puffed rice.
-I agree.

389
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:15,801
TASTY SNACK CALLS FOR A DRINK

390
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,202
-So good.
-Goes down like water.

391
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:19,038
-The sunflower seed is good.
-So good.

392
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,107
Eat all of this,
and your teeth will be spaced out.

393
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,544
-Better watch out for my fake tooth.
-Exactly.

394
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:28,080
-Don't use the same gap twice.
-Okay.

395
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:31,617
GLUG

396
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:33,585
Heavy drinking. I despise it.

397
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,587
-Tastes amazing.
-Want some more?

398
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,456
More water or more ice?

399
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:40,692
Ice, of course. It's definitely ice!

400
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,194
-Thanks.
-Ice coming up.

401
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:43,395
BETTER LUCK THIS TIME?

402
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,197
TREMBLING

403
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:49,401
It's fine.

404
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,370
I thought it might gush out.

405
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,705
It scared me a little.

406
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,143
-It's so delicious.
-So good.

407
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,080
You've got to wrap up a trip
with a few drinks.

408
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:03,749
It's not like we're drinking too much.
I said it again.

409
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:05,217
Didn't I?

410
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,219
Ladies drink lightly.

411
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:08,554
Just a nightcap.

412
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,289
You're good at picking out good food.

413
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,124
Right? I think I do.

414
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,792
-A master muncher.
-Yes, I am.

415
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,097
Munch. Master.

416
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:20,566
Say,

417
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:23,735
what would happen
if both your hands and feet were tied up?

418
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,372
You have something really delicious
in your mouth.

419
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,174
-But you can't express it.
-Hands and feet?

420
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,376
-I would have my head.
-Head?

421
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,480
-What if you can't move your neck?
-What?

422
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,982
What if you have rings around your neck?

423
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:45,057
OH DEAR

424
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,658
Thought I couldn't do it?

425
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:48,827
Thought I couldn't do it?

426
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,029
HER FLASHY MOVES CAN NEVER BE TIED DOWN

427
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,731
Wait a minute.

428
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,366
I need beer.

429
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,935
FETCHING BEER TO TURN DOWN THE HEAT

430
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,414
QUICKLY GRABS JUST THE DRINKS THEY BOUGHT

431
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,283
So horrible. So scary.

432
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,418
What about those cup noodles?

433
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,087
-What noodles?
-The ones down there.

434
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:16,622
They're not free.

435
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:19,158
-They're so seductive.
-You have to pay for these.

436
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,260
-It's reeling us in.
-I know.

437
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,462
-That's mean.
-Don't seduce us.

438
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,564
Did you just…

439
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,166
What are you doing?

440
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:33,038
-I'm old enough to find that fun.
-So silly.

441
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,578
There goes that beautiful sound.

442
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:41,280
Cheers.

443
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,582
Taiwanese beer.

444
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,087
Is it good?

445
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,490
I'm not familiar with this taste.

446
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,660
It's got a hint of ale,

447
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:57,196
is light on the palate,
and is pleasantly aromatic.

448
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:59,998
I went to Harbin
and had a Harbin beer, you know.

449
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,901
-That's on my must-do list.
-At the beer factory.

450
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:03,936
WATCH EPISODE 2

451
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:06,972
I once went to Chile.

452
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,441
I can't remember the name,
but there was this Chilean beer.

453
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,009
It was just amazing.

454
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:14,513
It was kind of on the thicker side.

455
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,750
I guess the Chilean beer you had
was one of the strong ones.

456
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:21,853
Did it make you
feel like you've taken a chill pill?

457
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:24,923
Oh no.

458
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,825
CHILL PILL KICKS IN

459
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,665
POSSESSED

460
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,167
"So funny!"

461
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,704
So this is how you sell a joke.

462
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,038
Just say it, and then…

463
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,574
Like this?

464
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,509
"So funny!"

465
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,713
-That's a new trick I learned today.
-Thank you so much.

466
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:49,181
TALK SHOW SKILL UNLOCKED

467
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,951
I'd love to appear on your YouTube show,
Diva Village Queen Gabee.

468
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:53,852
-For real?
-Yeah.

469
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:54,820
You'll join us?

470
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:56,088
-Yeah.
-Really?

471
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:57,456
What do you wanna star as?

472
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,291
Just a girl doing what she does.

473
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,361
That sounds fun.

474
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,497
I bet tons of people
would love to be on your channel.

475
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:08,467
There are quite a number of them.
Even I am surprised.

476
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:09,735
But…

477
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:11,970
But?

478
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:14,072
That's the thing I respect about you.

479
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:17,142
-You have to cater to your guests, right?
-Right.

480
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:19,578
And that doesn't seem easy at all.

481
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:24,549
But your universe is so well put together…

482
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,551
-Are you swallowing your burps?
-Yes.

483
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,020
I've been doing it all along.

484
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:28,920
BUSTED

485
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:30,689
EMBARRASSING

486
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,791
A burper recognizes a burper
when they see one.

487
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:33,959
I'm a full-on burper.

488
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,597
I think you're a shy burper.

489
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,937
(LAUGHING HER GUTS OUT)

490
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:47,739
I knew she would catch on.

491
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:51,143
I was worried that she would notice
while I was burping.

492
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,144
That's hilarious.

493
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,479
I had beer with Byun Yo-han
on my first trip.

494
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:58,483
You can't hold back the burps
when all that carbonation builds up.

495
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,285
He tried to be polite at first.

496
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:01,420
"So, Do-yeon--"

497
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:03,822
"For me, I--"

498
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,591
In the end, he just let it out.

499
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,294
That's a bonding experience.

500
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:11,330
-"Burp!"
-That must've brought you two closer.

501
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:15,834
From what I saw, it was like he burped
and stumbled forward at the same time.

502
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,636
Oh, you mean backward?

503
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,705
-Yeah, that's what I saw.
-"Burp!"

504
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,674
There's no stopping the body's urges.

505
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:25,944
Do you have anyone
you'd like to have on your show?

506
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,246
-On my show?
-Yes.

507
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,784
I like having superstars on my show,

508
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,653
but it's a lot of pressure.

509
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,456
-When you work with superstars…
-I really can't mess up.

510
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,157
Yeah, we've all been there.

511
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:42,694
My thoughts are not so different
from yours.

512
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:46,198
I don't take all the comments seriously,
but the kind I really dread is…

513
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:49,201
"That's all you can talk about
with such a great guest?"

514
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:51,737
That kind of comment
makes me feel embarrassed.

515
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:53,805
I don't get it.

516
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:57,476
Isn't it more interesting
to talk about the little things?

517
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,711
"What do you like to eat with soju?"

518
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,346
I don't know what the correct answer is.

519
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:03,415
You really shouldn't worry about that.

520
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:07,219
But if you think about it,
you can't please everyone.

521
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:08,220
That's impossible.

522
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,921
By the way,

523
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,723
what's your ideal type?

524
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:16,561
Where did that even come from?

525
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,897
I thought I drifted off or something.

526
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,699
We were just talking about

527
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:24,870
how a host should think
when a superstar guest is on the show.

528
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:28,440
I think I just wanted to jump straight
to talking about love.

529
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:29,574
-Did you?
-Yes.

530
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:30,642
My ideal type?

531
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:33,512
Wait, I think I asked you this
when I was on Salon Drip 2.

532
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,046
You did. My ideal type?

533
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:38,784
-A humorous person.
-I remember you saying that before.

534
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:39,851
What's yours?

535
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:41,720
Still Gong Yoo?

536
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,690
Why is your mouth watering?

537
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:51,196
I think my ideal type is kinda fuzzy now.

538
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,532
My type is just whoever I'm into.

539
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,234
-That's true.
-I don't have a type anymore.

540
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:57,903
I totally get you.

541
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:00,639
Now, I just like whoever I like.

542
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,707
Is there something
you never cared for before

543
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,576
but now find charming?

544
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:07,646
I never used to think much
about people who are smart.

545
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:09,714
But now I find them attractive.

546
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:13,952
I don't know why.
I find intellectual people attractive now.

547
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:17,622
And you know those
who are tough on the inside?

548
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:22,394
I like people who are strong-minded
and not gullible.

549
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,329
And modest at the same time.

550
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:26,932
That's important.

551
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:29,267
I think I'm drawn to that type.

552
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:32,404
I also like people
who look like they've been loved a lot.

553
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,706
Meeting and working with a lot of people,

554
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:37,542
I found that some just show
that they've got someone to count on.

555
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:41,279
Not the people with rich parents
who back them up financially.

556
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:43,615
These people give off the vibe

557
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:46,017
that there's always someone
rooting for them.

558
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:46,918
Yeah.

559
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:49,321
I have something like that too.

560
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:51,790
-I'm drawn to those who are relaxed.
-Me too.

561
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:53,391
When I see someone like that,

562
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:58,597
I always wonder what it could be
that makes them so firm and stable.

563
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:01,199
-That's exactly what I'm drawn to.
-Yeah.

564
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,835
Watching someone stay calm, unhurried,

565
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:05,537
and perfectly in their own rhythm

566
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:08,273
makes me wonder, "What's their secret?"

567
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,308
I love talking about love now.

568
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:11,977
-Love talk?
-Yeah.

569
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:13,378
Do you enjoy love talk?

570
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:14,513
Can't get enough of it.

571
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:18,383
Okay, then. Be honest with me.

572
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,652
-When were you last asked out?
-Me?

573
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,721
What's the definition of "asked out"?

574
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,257
"Grab a bite with me."

575
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:26,458
"Grab a bite with me"?

576
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,425
In that case, yes.

577
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:30,495
Someone literally asked
if I'd eat with them.

578
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:31,563
DOPAMINE OVERFLOW

579
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,564
What day is today?

580
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:33,665
Friday…

581
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:35,233
Three days ago.

582
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,601
Who was it?

583
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:39,004
We were on set,
and this person came to my waiting room

584
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,872
and said, "Grab a bite with me."

585
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:42,374
Really?

586
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,341
Yeah.

587
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:44,609
It was Do Ji-won.

588
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,011
Come on.

589
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,047
THE QUEEN IS FURIOUS

590
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,815
I'm sorry.

591
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:53,418
That was the only time I got asked out.

592
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:55,420
AWKWARD

593
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:57,422
Not funny, Do-yeon.

594
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:59,090
Ji-won asked me out.

595
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:02,961
I bet you get asked out a lot.
You meet actors all the time.

596
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:05,230
Nah, there's nothing.

597
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:07,332
Come on! Now that's a lie.

598
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,634
-It's not.
-That's an obvious lie.

599
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:10,802
I'm serious.

600
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:17,909
Do I have to reveal my boyfriend
hiding out here?

601
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,544
BOMBSHELL

602
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:21,413
No, wait!

603
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,481
-Wanna meet him?
-We're not ready for this!

604
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:24,849
I'm not ready to meet--

605
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,418
Babe, can you get dressed?

606
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:27,752
I'm not ready to meet him yet.

607
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:28,920
THE QUEEN SURRENDERS

608
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:32,357
I wish I had someone.

609
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,625
Come on.

610
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:36,061
Whatever. I'll believe you.

611
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,563
-We prepared something.
-What is it?

612
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,600
A gift for whoever shares
the most honest dating story.

613
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:44,035
It's Kavalan, a Taiwanese whiskey.

614
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,136
Kavalan is famous.

615
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:46,404
LIMITED EDITION WHISKEY

616
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:48,940
An honest dating story? This is bad.

617
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:52,143
How did you even get this?

618
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,546
-The local coordinator got it for us.
-Really?

619
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,880
TOUCHED

620
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:59,284
We'll give it to the one
who tells the most honest dating story.

621
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:00,819
I kissed someone yesterday!

622
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,856
A KAVALAN-INDUCED KISS CONFESSION

623
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:06,658
I'M NEVER LETTING THIS WHISKEY GO

624
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:09,127
My brain stopped for a moment there.

625
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:12,030
A CONFESSION THAT STARTLED THE QUEEN

626
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:14,165
-I lost it.
-"I kissed someone yesterday!"

627
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,701
Can I see inside the box?

628
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:18,870
It's got 57.1% alcohol.

629
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,542
It's majestic.

630
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:25,577
TEMPTING

631
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:29,014
Share a dating story with us. Be honest.

632
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:33,084
Okay, then. So that's how you wanna play.

633
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:36,254
I get it. I really do.

634
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,590
Never have I ever had a crush recently.

635
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,525
In the last three years.

636
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:42,060
Nope, make it one year.

637
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:43,128
Crazy!

638
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:44,329
DOPAMINE ADDICTION

639
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,765
Let's go at once.

640
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,333
Three, two, one.

641
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,467
-I have.
-Yes.

642
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:54,272
LOSING THEIR MINDS

643
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:56,841
DOPAMINE EXPLOSION

644
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:58,677
OH, STOP IT

645
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,748
BLUSHING

646
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:08,053
Okay, the next question is mine.

647
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:12,023
The person I had a crush on
is a celebrity.

648
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:15,927
Three, two, one.

649
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:17,295
(QUIET)

650
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:20,498
Wait!

651
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,369
KEEP TALKING

652
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:25,270
But why?

653
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,714
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?

654
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:38,450
IN FULL FRENZY MODE

655
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,488
I just drooled.

656
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:48,593
Take the Kavalan. I don't care.

657
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,630
Mine is not a celebrity.

658
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:54,632
-Yeah?
-Closer to a non-celeb.

659
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:56,735
What do you mean, closer?

660
00:28:56,801 --> 00:29:00,138
This person is somehow involved
but not technically a celebrity.

661
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:01,806
God, I'm drained.

662
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:06,244
Let's stop here.

663
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:08,446
Mine's not active right now, but…

664
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:09,414
I'll stop here.

665
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,049
LADIES' CRUSH STAYS UNDER WRAPS

666
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:16,020
WHY AM I PARCHED?

667
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,422
It's just a crush,

668
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:20,191
so I just thought to myself,
"That guy is charming."

669
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,961
Have you ever confessed your feelings

670
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:25,096
to someone you like?

671
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,532
-Not once.
-Really? Why?

672
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,934
-They might not like it.
-No way, Do-yeon.

673
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:32,837
You are a beautiful comedian.

674
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,474
Not a man in the world could stay calm
if you said you liked him.

675
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,143
-You're too kind.
-Not one.

676
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:39,210
I'm serious!

677
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,546
You wowed me again today.

678
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,414
-Do you mean that?
-You're so pretty.

679
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,650
After what you said to me in the morning,

680
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:48,720
I went to take a shower,
looked into the mirror, and went…

681
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,991
"Wait a minute."

682
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:55,460
"What is it about me
that Gabee finds pretty?"

683
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,129
MESMERIZED

684
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,264
Look at him!

685
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,832
I made him shudder.

686
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:04,002
-We've known each other for years.
-You really are beautiful.

687
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,404
-What are you talking about?
-I felt it again today.

688
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,173
HER ACTION NOT MATCHING HER WORDS

689
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,875
You just shot a cosmetics commercial.

690
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,178
My stomach hurts.

691
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:14,779
You never told your feelings to anyone?

692
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:17,615
Well, in my twenties,
I couldn't even hide my feelings.

693
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:21,119
My face and ears would blush so badly.

694
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:23,488
But have you ever told them outright?

695
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,323
-No, never.
-Are you serious?

696
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,592
OKAY, I SEE

697
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,028
Do you always confess your feelings?

698
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:32,197
Not always.

699
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:34,432
But now, it just feels natural to me.

700
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,668
I think being honest
is the best way to go.

701
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,269
I'll tell you my thought process.

702
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,371
It's actually more of an excuse,

703
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:43,908
but at first, I think,
"If I say it, it might just get awkward."

704
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:47,745
Then I make excuses like,
"It's not like I like him that much."

705
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:50,014
Later on, I tell myself,

706
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:52,851
"I'm a grown-up.
It'd come with too much responsibility."

707
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:54,652
I keep making these excuses.

708
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,789
For me, as I get older,

709
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,592
those feelings don't come around as often.

710
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:01,492
That's true.

711
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:04,429
When I fall for someone,
I end up feeling grateful to them

712
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:07,232
for letting me feel
that kind of emotion at all.

713
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:09,100
I'm so thankful for that.

714
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,702
It's gotten to that point.

715
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:12,670
Why, you ask?

716
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:14,839
Because these feelings are rare now.

717
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:16,507
Yeah, it's not easy to like someone.

718
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:18,843
It's not easy to feel
that pure affection anymore.

719
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:22,213
So I once said, "I like you,"
without expecting anything else.

720
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,283
"It's not that I want you
to return my feelings."

721
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,886
"I'm just grateful
that I could even feel this way."

722
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,188
"That's why I wanted to tell you this."

723
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:32,123
"I'm not expecting anything from you."

724
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,524
"I really like you."

725
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:34,525
That's so romantic.

726
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:36,794
It felt quite liberating, actually.

727
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:40,698
And that confession has become
a pleasant memory for me.

728
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:44,002
-A memorable experience.
-That's classy.

729
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,236
It felt good.

730
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:48,373
It's one of those things
that I never regret doing.

731
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:49,707
So impressive.

732
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:52,777
HOW ABOUT YOU?

733
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,913
I'm gonna go confess right now.

734
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:01,953
GOT MORE BEER INSTEAD
RAIN CHECK ON THAT CONFESSION

735
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:05,256
What counts as "dating" for you?

736
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:06,791
Dating?

737
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,928
Crazy question.

738
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:12,864
What counts as dating?

739
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:16,634
What dating means for me.

740
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:19,003
I like to put it into words.

741
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,339
-That you're dating?
-"Let's make it official."

742
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:23,141
-Make it clear?
-Yes.

743
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:25,410
That's a big deal to me.

744
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,313
I find it really frustrating, too,

745
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:31,182
because it's clear
the relationship has shifted,

746
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:34,585
but asking outright to confirm it
feels kind of lame.

747
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:35,653
Yeah!

748
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,790
-But it's not lame!
-Of course not.

749
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:40,191
You act all nonchalant.

750
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,193
"That's what you think?
I'm cool with that."

751
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,028
"Except I'm not, you *******!"

752
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:47,598
"I'm in love with you, idiot!"

753
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,868
-Exactly!
-But I can't really say that.

754
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:54,872
You can't say what's on your mind
because you might come off as clingy.

755
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:56,374
Yeah, but that's nothing.

756
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:58,509
When you look back, it's really nothing.

757
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:00,378
Have you thought about marriage?

758
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:01,779
I want to get married.

759
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:05,283
I want to get married
because I want to have a baby.

760
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,218
I say this all the time.

761
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:10,121
I love babies, so I'd like to have one.

762
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:12,156
I'm ready for it. I'd be a cool mom.

763
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:17,729
It'd be so fun.

764
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,197
I bet you'll have a fun kid.

765
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:20,698
I know. It'd be a lot of fun.

766
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:23,835
Could be the total opposite of me.
Kids never turn out the way you want.

767
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,403
That is to be expected.

768
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:28,940
I think it'd also be fun
to have an introvert child.

769
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:32,010
Now that my life
is starting to settle down,

770
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:36,114
I think I'm starting to want to build
a family of my own.

771
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,182
That's what's driving me forward too.

772
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:39,917
I think a lot of daughters will agree

773
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:42,086
when I say I want to make my mom happy.

774
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:45,790
That's why I always tell her
what I've done and achieved.

775
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,225
It makes her so happy.

776
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:49,527
My mom is a natural cheerleader, you know.

777
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:52,663
When I told her I'd gone on Salon Drip 2,
she was all like…

778
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,968
"Only superstars go on that show."

779
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,203
-Really?
-She's that kind of person.

780
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,738
That's so supportive.

781
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:03,341
"I really enjoyed it. I'm so happy now."

782
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:06,411
She says that all the time.
"This is the happiest time of my life."

783
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:11,783
Those words really help me out
and give me a lot of strength.

784
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:16,087
I thought about what I'd be living for
once my mother is gone.

785
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:18,656
I'm not someone
who puts myself before everything else.

786
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,291
-Are you an only child?
-Yes, I am.

787
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:22,627
That's the biggest fear for an only child.

788
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:23,728
I'm an only child too.

789
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:25,129
You are?

790
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:26,197
TWO KINDRED SPIRITS

791
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:27,198
Really?

792
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:30,234
-Are you scared of being left alone?
-I am scared.

793
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,003
Anyway,

794
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,272
thinking ahead, I thought,

795
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,074
"I want a family of my own."

796
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:39,043
That thought keeps getting stronger.

797
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:42,480
I mean, I fear it at the same time.

798
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:44,015
Realistically speaking,

799
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:48,086
it is challenging to be a mother
and raise a child.

800
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:50,154
But still, I really want it.

801
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:54,559
Maybe the next chapter of my life
is to become a mommy.

802
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,361
-What about you?
-Me?

803
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:03,868
I've never thought of marriage
as a huge milestone in life.

804
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:08,072
I just figured I'd go with it naturally
when the time came.

805
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:10,641
But having a child seemed
like such a big deal.

806
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:14,745
I still sometimes feel like I'm immature,

807
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:18,950
like I've got a long way to go,
and I'm too childish.

808
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:23,020
I'm scared I don't have what it takes
to be responsible for a child.

809
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:26,057
That's why, right now,

810
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:29,627
I just wish I had a good partner.

811
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:31,395
-That's so important.
-By my side.

812
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:32,997
Not a husband,

813
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:34,832
but a lover.

814
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:37,401
Because being in a relationship
is good for you.

815
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,671
Then, when I get older, I'm gonna be

816
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:43,040
the nursing home queen.

817
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:44,575
Babes!

818
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,111
-Be ready for me.
-It's me.

819
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:49,013
I moved in.

820
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,819
Do you get up easily in the morning?

821
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:55,887
Sure.

822
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:57,421
To be honest, no.

823
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:01,092
What time do you usually get up?

824
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,894
I can sleep in all day.

825
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,062
But it depends on my daily schedule.

826
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:06,931
I wake up when I have to.

827
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:07,999
Do you?

828
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:09,300
It might be a bit tough,

829
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:13,738
but this hotel's got a private hot spring,
and I hear it's amazing.

830
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:15,339
-I'm all for it.
-Really?

831
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:16,874
-Yes.
-You have to get up early.

832
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:18,809
-That's okay. How early?
-In that case…

833
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:21,479
Go to your room now
and sleep for 20 minutes.

834
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,651
Is that okay with you?
Tomorrow, we'll be up for 26 hours.

835
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:28,052
Not okay.

836
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,889
What do you say we meet at 6:30 a.m.?

837
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:32,890
Sounds good.

838
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:36,594
That's the prime time
for the freshest spring water.

839
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:39,897
If you kick off your day
with a dip in the hot spring at 6:30,

840
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,199
nothing is impossible.

841
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:44,669
LOCKED IN FOR 6:30

842
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,137
I'll be there. Don't worry.

843
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,672
I never fail to get up.

844
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:49,307
Can you get up right now?

845
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,211
Why?

846
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:56,147
That was my inner voice!

847
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:01,185
Why? I like it here!

848
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:04,021
Get it filtered through the brain first.

849
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,658
I want this night to last forever.

850
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:08,859
We're having a blast.

851
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:12,597
"I want this night to last forever."

852
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:16,267
"Spending time with Gabee
can never be dull."

853
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:18,002
"She doesn't wear me out at all."

854
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:23,574
"Would you like to sleep
on my bed tonight?"

855
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,912
Yes! I would love to.

856
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,013
Right here.

857
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,881
Wait a minute. It's my inner voice.

858
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:32,216
"Just beat it!"

859
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,555
It's here again.
"Beat it. I can't stand the sight of you!"

860
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,158
"That's not true. I'm sorry, Gabee."

861
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:44,729
"I can't believe I said something weird

862
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:46,464
with a guest here."

863
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:47,932
"I'm sorry."

864
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:51,068
"Let me make the bed for you."

865
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:53,004
"You sleep on the left side."

866
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:55,339
"I'll sleep on the right."

867
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,077
DO-YEON-BOT OVERLOADED

868
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:01,812
That was hilarious.

869
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:02,747
Aw, my stomach.

870
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:05,449
Your robot acting
is the best I've ever seen.

871
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:07,585
I guess this is the end.

872
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:08,986
Come on, don't say that.

873
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:10,921
Ms. Shin Gabee, please leave.

874
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:12,290
YOU SAID THIS WAS THE END

875
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:15,660
You want me to stop babbling
and leave at once?

876
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:17,728
KIDDING

877
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,196
Aw, my stomach!

878
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:22,366
You sat back down?

879
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:26,604
-Come on, our last drink!
-You can sit down.

880
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:28,139
-Last sip.
-Of course.

881
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:29,674
-We have to.
-Last sip.

882
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,941
A HARD-EARNED SIP

883
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:32,109
This is perfect.

884
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:36,013
I'm feeling tipsy. We had a good laugh.
Now I can sleep tight.

885
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,648
-This is perfect.
-Yeah.

886
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:40,117
-I'm buzzed.
-Good thing I already showered.

887
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:41,986
GIRLS' NIGHT COMES TO A TIMELY END

888
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,788
Aw, my stomach.

889
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:47,091
I'll get going, then.

890
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,493
Who's going to take the Kavalan?

891
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,629
-Do-yeon should take it.
-No.

892
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:52,763
It's yours.

893
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,565
-I have an idea.
-What?

894
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:56,600
-Take the whiskey and…
-Drink it with you?

895
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,236
Leejung and I
will come over to your place.

896
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:01,472
No, you can have it.

897
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:07,712
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY BE SERIOUS, GIRL

898
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:09,213
"Gabee with a kind heart."

899
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:11,115
DO-YEON-BOT BACK IN ACTION

900
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,016
"Thank you."

901
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:17,088
"You and Leejung are always
welcome in my home."

902
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:20,925
"Come into the living room.
Sit on the couch."

903
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:22,727
"My bed belongs to you two."

904
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:25,996
"Hooray. I'm so excited."

905
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:28,165
If we go to your place,

906
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:32,269
I swear we won't be leaving
until three o'clock the next day.

907
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:35,473
And I mean three in the afternoon.

908
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:37,675
SCRATCH

909
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:39,977
I get itchy every time I talk to you.

910
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:44,949
-Thanks. I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
-I'll visit you.

911
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:46,550
-It's better that way.
-No.

912
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:48,486
I'm going to put this in your car.

913
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,955
Or I'll drop it in your doorway.

914
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:52,223
Whatever. You take it.

915
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:54,225
I'm going to drink it at your place.

916
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:56,761
-Good night.
-Then I'll pour it in your direction.

917
00:39:57,962 --> 00:40:00,131
-It'll be as if you drank it.
-No! Just take it.

918
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:01,465
THE NEVER-ENDING BATTLE

919
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:02,600
Bye, Gabee.

920
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,203
Don't forget 6:30. I won't be there.

921
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:09,407
You'll be on the last flight tonight!

922
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:10,808
No, first flight tomorrow.

923
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:15,212
-Bye, Do-yeon.
-Thanks.

924
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:36,434
Never let her come to my room again.

925
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:41,338
I don't like her.

926
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:42,907
Just kidding.

927
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:46,343
A BOISTEROUS GIRLS' NIGHT
THE END

928
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,945
MORNING STARTS WITH A KNOCK

929
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:49,914
THE LONG-AWAITED HOT SPRING DATE

930
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:53,451
A PRIVATE HOT SPRING FOR THE TWO BUDDIES!

931
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:54,685
OOTD BEFITTING THE QUEEN

932
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:57,121
TRAVEL FATIGUE MELTS AWAY

933
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:59,190
WAIT A MINUTE, IS THAT…

934
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:01,025
A SURPRISE GUEST SHOWS UP

935
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:03,127
I'M SOLOBARI
YOUNG-SOOK, THE UNANIMOUS GIRL

936
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:04,595
SOMEONE'S INTERESTED IN HER

937
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:07,865
A HEATED SELF-INTRODUCTION IN A HOT SPRING

938
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:12,069
WILL THEY BE ABLE TO HEAD HOME
AS THE FINAL COUPLE?!

939
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,605
A PERFECT MATCH
GABEE♡DO-YEON

940
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:16,440
BEAUTIFULLY DOLLED UP!

941
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:18,676
THIS IS TOO PRETTY!

942
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:20,578
MAKING THE MOST
OF THEIR LAST DAY IN TAIWAN!

943
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:21,479
What a view.

944
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:22,947
-Oh my God.
-Bravo.

945
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:25,649
LOCAL DELIGHTS SERVED
PERFECT TO THE VERY END

946
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:28,285
GENUINELY IMPRESSED

947
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:30,688
-Number one.
-You have to come. Just come.

948
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:32,323
THE TIME HAS COME

949
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:34,458
TO SAY GOODBYE TO PRECIOUS MEMORIES

950
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:35,759
Lastly…

951
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,895
Gabee, you're making me sad.

952
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:39,330
GABEE BREAKS INTO TEARS

953
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:41,932
Why are you crying? Are you serious?

954
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,468
LAST TEARFUL EPISODE IN TAIWAN
SEE YOU NEXT WEEK
