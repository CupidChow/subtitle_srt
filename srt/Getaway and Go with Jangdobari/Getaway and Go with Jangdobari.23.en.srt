1
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:05,839
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

2
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:07,374
I'm sure you're all familiar
with this place.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,676
This is the capital city of Korea, Seoul!

4
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,378
YEEEEEEAH!

5
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:13,179
It's time to meet my travel buddy
for today in Seoul.

6
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:14,214
Do-yeon!

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,148
Se-chan!

8
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:16,116
COMEDY PARTNER, YANG SE-CHAN

9
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,584
THE THEME OF TODAY'S TRIP
WITH SE-CHAN

10
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,753
What I'd love to do with you
is go down memory lane.

11
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:20,854
We'll be goofing around, right?

12
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,755
-That's right.
-Good.

13
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:23,156
-Let's go!
-Go!

14
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:24,190
-Our rule…
-Yes?

15
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:25,859
…is not to fall for each other.

16
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:27,060
DON'T FALL FOR ONE ANOTHER

17
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,195
Just know, I'll keep on trying.

18
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:30,530
Hold on.

19
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:31,998
WIPING

20
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:33,433
Please close your eyes.

21
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,235
Jangdobari and I are going to smooch.

22
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:36,803
Can you please close your eyes?

23
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,605
-There's a second course.
-Are we getting coffee?

24
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:40,306
There's something you should know
about this place.

25
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:41,975
It's run by Um Tae-goo's friend.

26
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,910
Really? I'd love to meet him.

27
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:45,445
He's so charming.

28
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:46,679
Let's call him later.

29
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:48,081
Do you perhaps know his number?

30
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:49,482
My heart's racing.

31
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,850
I have a feeling…

32
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:52,385
-He'll pick up.
-…he won't pick up.

33
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:53,653
Don't think that. "Hello."

34
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,954
Is this rude?

35
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:56,322
WILL THEY GET HIM ON THE PHONE?

36
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,357
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

37
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:58,625
He won't pick up.

38
00:00:58,691 --> 00:00:59,826
Don't think that. "Hello."

39
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,127
Do you think this is…

40
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,396
-Rude?
-Won't this be rude?

41
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,732
Were you with him only for a few hours?

42
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,867
-We spent a night in Gangneung.
-See?

43
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:10,703
If calling someone after spending
two days together is seen as rude,

44
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,605
then something's off.

45
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,107
-Can I really call him?
-Of course.

46
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:15,208
I'm nervous.

47
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:18,845
Just so you know,
I've heard that introverts

48
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,815
often get each other's
phone numbers like this.

49
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:23,116
-Do-yeon.
-Huh?

50
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:24,684
What now?

51
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,619
You need to get

52
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:27,987
this cracked phone screen replaced.

53
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:29,756
I'm not kidding.

54
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:32,325
I bet you didn't put
a protective film on it.

55
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:33,593
Which YouTuber told you that?
There's one on it.

56
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,628
This isn't from a video.
I'm talking about its energy.

57
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:37,297
If you don't let go of what's cracked,

58
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:38,698
your own life will keep cracking.

59
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,699
Really?

60
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,767
Why would you say that?

61
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,802
It's true, but at least you know it now.

62
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:43,837
Get this replaced.

63
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:46,039
If you don't plan to buy a new phone,

64
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,073
just replace the screen.

65
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,042
I have to get a new phone.
Do you know why?

66
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,444
Get ready to be surprised.

67
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,246
-Is the back cracked?
-It's totally shattered.

68
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:54,781
Why haven't you gotten a new one?

69
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:56,349
I can't be bothered.

70
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,719
You're carrying a demon around.

71
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:00,787
A demon?

72
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,256
-That has a demonic spirit.
-Is it a demon?

73
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,325
Once we finish our coffee,

74
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,727
let's get that screen replaced.

75
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,095
That's not even the issue.

76
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,363
For now, at least.

77
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,431
Brace yourself.

78
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,002
LIKE SHE SAID,
THE BACK IS TOTALLY TATTERED

79
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,470
Bits are coming off.

80
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:20,039
You're right. They do.

81
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:22,509
I almost scraped my face with this phone.

82
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:25,178
Do you have any office tape?

83
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:26,613
-Also…
-I mean, box tape.

84
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:27,914
-…this doesn't work.
-I'll handle it.

85
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,116
Something was dangling from the phone,

86
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,218
so I pulled it off,
not knowing what it was.

87
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,687
-It turned out to be the flash.
-The flash?

88
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,422
I'll just say it as I see it.

89
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,558
This is something that shapes your image.

90
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,959
Does this make me less charming?

91
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:41,394
Not exactly,

92
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:44,264
but it seems like you don't care
about being neat.

93
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,399
-That's not true!
-I know that, but…

94
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:49,235
Try imagining this.
What if someone pulled out their phone

95
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,904
and it was filthy?

96
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,539
-Mine's not filthy.
-That's just an example.

97
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:56,075
What if you notice his phone
is falling apart?

98
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:58,511
Wouldn't you assume he doesn't care

99
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,280
about how he presents himself?

100
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,016
It's just my phone.
Everything else is neat and tidy.

101
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:05,385
I'll make sure
it doesn't fall apart anymore.

102
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:07,554
-That's negative energy.
-I need to replace this phone.

103
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,788
Someone gave me one.

104
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,424
A new phone has been sitting at home
for months now.

105
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,193
-Why haven't you replaced it?
-Well,

106
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,563
-it's a Samsung, not an iPhone.
-What about it?

107
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:19,098
I've heard the phones
aren't fully compatible.

108
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:22,969
Not really. Just ask for a number
and move the files yourself.

109
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,704
Do so on your computer.

110
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,172
-I don't have one at home.
-What?

111
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,640
I don't have a computer at home.

112
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,243
I SEE… YOU DON'T HAVE
A COMPUTER…

113
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,011
-Don't you have a laptop?
-That I have.

114
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,313
That's a computer!

115
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,517
HOW EMBARRASSING IS THAT?

116
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:38,818
I can't believe you.

117
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:40,954
Jangdobari.

118
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:43,790
Get a grip on yourself.

119
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,092
Then answer this.

120
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,794
What's a laptop then?

121
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:49,529
SHE'S CLEARLY GOT MIXED UP

122
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,164
Aren't laptops computers?

123
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,365
That's not it!

124
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:53,733
Move the files using your laptop.

125
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,934
I was mistaken.

126
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,836
Can a beginner like me do it as well?

127
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,071
You can find instructions on YouTube.

128
00:03:58,471 --> 00:03:59,539
YOUTUBE AGAIN…

129
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,241
You can find videos

130
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,543
showing how to transfer files
from your iPhone to your Samsung.

131
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,011
You'll receive

132
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,479
step-by-step instructions.

133
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,082
The cream is absolutely delicious.

134
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,485
Anything that has cream here is amazing.

135
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,754
-I like that the chocolate isn't bitter.
-Really?

136
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:15,922
Can't you help me with this? Never mind.

137
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,523
It's paste jelly but…

138
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,492
Couldn't you see
I was having trouble with that?

139
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,094
I completely butchered it.

140
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,697
I'm fascinated by how chocolate
and paste jelly go so well together.

141
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:26,532
It's so good.

142
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,734
It's delicious.

143
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,901
Isn't it soft?

144
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:32,538
I'd like the cream to be on this one.

145
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,474
-Right?
-Try some with it.

146
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,375
It's good.

147
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:36,776
OFFICE TAPE DELIVERY

148
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:37,677
Thank you.

149
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,012
Can you take the cover off for me?

150
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:40,613
You're good at that.

151
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,415
As if. You just don't want glass

152
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:43,683
getting on you.

153
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,784
How did you know that?

154
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:45,852
SHE'S PERCEPTIVE, HE'S BLUNT

155
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,555
Anyone can take off this case.

156
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,091
Because I'm good at it?

157
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:53,726
How stupid do you think I am?

158
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,595
Well, I'm not.
I'm pretty good with my hands.

159
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,196
-I mean…
-Isn't it a wreck?

160
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:58,898
It's more than just a wreck.
These fragments

161
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,134
-will get in your ears.
-Tell me about it.

162
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,703
Do you sleep with your phone on your bed?

163
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,937
-On my nightstand.
-Next to you,

164
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:06,105
but not on your bed?

165
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:07,840
-I don't keep it on my bed.
-That's a relief.

166
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,776
These things…

167
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:10,810
I should replace it.

168
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:11,778
Look at these bits falling off.

169
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:14,013
It worries me to hear you call it evil.

170
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,349
Seeing anything cracked
gives off bad energy.

171
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:19,252
You're right.
What good would cleaning it do?

172
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,586
What? Oh, exactly.

173
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,221
I left it even though I knew
I should handle it.

174
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:24,490
Look. Can you see all these shards?

175
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:28,294
If you inhale these,
they'll build up inside you.

176
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:31,631
TAPING THE PHONE AFTER
REMOVING THE SHARDS

177
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,599
How meticulous of you, Se-chan.

178
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,901
I should do this for you.

179
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,203
Besides, I kind of like doing
this sort of thing.

180
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,038
Here's the problem area.

181
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,640
Do you take a lot of photos on your phone?

182
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,508
Yes. Why?
Are you going to cover the camera?

183
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:45,078
That's the best option, but…

184
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:47,280
The camera is totally shattered, you see.

185
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,247
I know.

186
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,850
-Careful.
-I'm good for now.

187
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,453
You look like a cool phone shop employee.

188
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,554
-Right?
-Yes.

189
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,889
Do-yeon, this kind of energy…

190
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:58,091
You sure like energy.

191
00:05:58,157 --> 00:05:59,092
It should be blocked.

192
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:01,227
I mean it.

193
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,929
-It's bad to have anything that's cracked.
-True.

194
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,698
How clean is that? Take a look.

195
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,667
-The shards won't scatter everywhere.
-Thanks.

196
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,068
You helped it last another year.

197
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,670
Replace it.

198
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:11,871
You need a new one.

199
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,507
Shards won't scatter
all over the place now.

200
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:15,975
Thanks for looking out for me.

201
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,410
Don't mention it.

202
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:18,845
Smooth, isn't it?

203
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:19,746
I should replace it

204
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,447
-since you say it brings bad luck.
-That's right.

205
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:22,682
It carries negative energy.

206
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:23,783
You should now call Tae-goo.

207
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,785
I bet his voice will be loud and clear.

208
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,920
"Hello? It's good to hear from you!"

209
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,222
"This is Um Tae-goo!"

210
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:30,323
Normally, he's soft-spoken,

211
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,391
but he'll sound louder.

212
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,692
"Yes, hello!"

213
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:34,894
"Did you get your phone fixed?"

214
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,229
YOU'RE KILLING ME…

215
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,464
VOICE IMPRESSIONS ARE
ALL ABOUT EXAGGERATION

216
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:39,966
Enough of that already.

217
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:41,067
Just call him.

218
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,269
I'll give him a call.

219
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,572
CALLING TAE-GOO
WITH A RACING HEART

220
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,544
What if he ignores calls
from unknown numbers?

221
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,513
He might be busy.

222
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,614
Of course.

223
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,351
He could call you back later.

224
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,354
Sure. He could be
in the middle of something.

225
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,890
I'm dying to know what he eats
when he comes here alone

226
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:04,924
and why.

227
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,659
HE HAS SO MANY QUESTIONS
FOR TAE-GOO…

228
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,428
-Hey!
-What?

229
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:10,029
I heard your show was incredible.

230
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,597
That's only half right.

231
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:14,300
Half share your opinion,
saying it was cool,

232
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:17,103
but the other half said
we put on a freak show.

233
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:18,738
They were like,

234
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,106
"I heard it was a freak show."

235
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,073
This is what I heard.

236
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,810
You kept cracking jokes during the show

237
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,912
while Se-hyung wouldn't stop singing.

238
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:26,879
SE-HYUNG SANG NONSTOP

239
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,348
That's what I heard.

240
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:33,786
THE YANG SE-BRO SHOW
ENDED SUCCESSFULLY LAST AUGUST

241
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,755
ITS MUSICAL QUALITY,

242
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:40,660
RIVALING A K-POP IDOL'S CONCERT,
TURNED HEADS

243
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:42,895
Do-yeon!

244
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,364
(DO-YEON APPEARED BRIEFLY
ON SCREEN)

245
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:46,699
Se-chan!

246
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,938
DO-YEON & SE-CHAN'S
ON-SCREEN SKIT WAS WELL RECEIVED

247
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,940
My gosh, Se-chan.

248
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:56,976
This is the first time
I'm talking about the show.

249
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,110
Spill it already.

250
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:00,079
We were the only ones performing,

251
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,848
so a sketch or segment would last

252
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,383
about 10 to 15 minutes at most.

253
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,118
After I was done, Se-hyung took over,

254
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:07,987
and he could only perform
for that same amount of time.

255
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,388
Then, it was my turn again.

256
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,257
That being said,

257
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,060
the breaks in between weren't long enough,

258
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:15,828
so we decided we each had
to do back-to-back acts.

259
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,498
That's what we settled on at first.

260
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:21,167
Here's how the opening went.
After singing one song,

261
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:24,036
it felt too soon to head backstage,

262
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,405
so I sang another.

263
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,975
At that, people wondered
why someone was singing twice.

264
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,277
That's one thing
the audience found awkward.

265
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,746
After singing, I needed to get
my makeup done and put on a wig.

266
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,648
There wasn't enough time,

267
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,049
but that's what I had to do.

268
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,252
Once I finished my skit,
Se-hyung came on stage and danced.

269
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:40,786
That's the one input I gave.

270
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:44,223
I told him everyone loved
watching him dance,

271
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,626
but I wouldn't be ready to go on

272
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,861
if that was all he did.

273
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,463
I suggested he perform another dance,

274
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,265
and people started wondering

275
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:53,699
why he was dancing again.

276
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,668
That left people on the fence.

277
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:56,903
I didn't mind his dancing.

278
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,338
I didn't mind,

279
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:01,340
but people were wondering
why he was just dancing.

280
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:04,110
-That's because you're his brother.
-I think this was why.

281
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:05,845
There weren't any twists.

282
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,281
The audience must have been waiting

283
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:10,383
-for a good laugh.
-Putting on a show

284
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:14,253
that only made people laugh
from start to finish

285
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,188
didn't feel right to us.

286
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,258
-We wanted to present…
-Of course.

287
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,160
…a range of performances.

288
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,362
That's why we prepared so much,

289
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:26,599
and I find it amusing
that people actually saw it as a problem.

290
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,900
All in all, it was fun.

291
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,402
How many songs did Se-hyung dance to?

292
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:30,870
He danced to two,

293
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,371
and toward the end,

294
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,106
we sang three songs together.

295
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:39,078
The audience was sitting there wondering
why they had paid money

296
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,613
to hear the two of us sing.

297
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,582
However, I think the show

298
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,684
was pretty good overall.

299
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,319
Wasn't it touching?

300
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:47,853
Of course it was.

301
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,023
The Blue Square auditorium was packed
with people who came just to see you two.

302
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,659
There's one thing we could've done better.

303
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,128
It turns out that people only came

304
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:57,530
to have a good laugh.

305
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,498
-Just a laugh.
-Just to laugh?

306
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:03,035
It felt like they were expecting a show
made up only

307
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,071
of comedy sketches and jokes.

308
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:06,372
Like a stand-up show?

309
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,942
They expected us to joke around
with the audience like we used to.

310
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:13,379
"Hey, guys. What brings you here?
Are you two a couple?"

311
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,348
I could tell a lot of people

312
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:18,484
were looking forward
to that kind of banter,

313
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,120
but we couldn't improvise
since we had a rehearsed show to put on.

314
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:23,422
-You can remember that for next time.
-Sure.

315
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:24,624
You'll want to do another.

316
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,027
Now I know what our show should be like.
Just pure comedy

317
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,062
with no serious performances.

318
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,964
Don't you think there will be a next time?

319
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,265
Another show sounds great,

320
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,167
but it should include more people.

321
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,605
I remember you suggesting
we do a show together.

322
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,440
Remember three years ago

323
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:44,043
when I went to see you
with a bottle of expensive liquor?

324
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,846
I was there to persuade
you, Na-rae, and Se-hyung.

325
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,447
-We got together for drinks…
-I remember that.

326
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:49,949
…and I brought a bottle
of expensive liquor

327
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,884
and talked about our time on Radio Star

328
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,986
and all the fun things we did.

329
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,855
I brought up the memories we share

330
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,523
-and the chemistry between us.
-Really?

331
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,059
Jang Do-yeon and Yang Se-chan.

332
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,628
Park Na-rae and Yang Se-chan.
Park Na-rae and Yang Se-hyung.

333
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,597
Me and Se-hyung, you and Na-rae.

334
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,232
Every duo has their own chemistry.

335
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,200
-I remember.
-"Sweet, isn't it?"

336
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:09,535
"All four of us? We'd be unstoppable."

337
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,038
-That's right.
-Then I poured you a shot of that liquor

338
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,973
and suggested we put on a show together.

339
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,574
You were all against it.

340
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:17,643
I asked why,

341
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,012
and you said it'd never work.

342
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,214
"Be serious. How could that ever work?"

343
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:23,249
That was Se-hyung.

344
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:24,617
You weren't excited about it,

345
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,419
so after hearing all that,

346
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,654
-I left the place sulking.
-Really?

347
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:31,424
-On my way home in the car…
-That's hilarious.

348
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,559
…I swore I'd never work
with you guys again.

349
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,530
-I felt so betrayed.
-What? I didn't know.

350
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:38,597
"I get it. Okay."

351
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,566
"You're saying
you're too famous for me now."

352
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,269
"Okay, fine. I'll match your level."

353
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:46,439
"I'll reach your level
and try again someday."

354
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:48,340
Here's what happened.
Se-h yung was like this.

355
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,376
-"No way."
-This was him.

356
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,343
Na-rae also…

357
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:54,080
-"That's a bit…"
-"That sounds tough."

358
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:55,681
"It'd be more work for less return."

359
00:11:56,682 --> 00:12:00,619
-That was me.
-I remember it ending with us

360
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:02,955
just enjoying that expensive liquor.
When was it?

361
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:03,956
It was before Covid.

362
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,624
-That's right.
-Before Covid happened.

363
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:08,027
I'd dreamed of putting on a concert
for that long.

364
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,162
When I heard you were doing it,

365
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,698
I really admired
that you followed through.

366
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:16,202
Here's something
I've been thinking lately.

367
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:17,636
If you do nothing…

368
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,205
-Nothing gets done.
-Well…

369
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:20,239
That's not it.

370
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:21,941
Opportunities do come my way.

371
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,076
I have other projects
I've been working on,

372
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,078
and you could say I'm in demand.

373
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:28,948
-They all want you.
-Producers and writers think

374
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:31,617
I'm worth having on their shows,

375
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,419
so I have enough work to do.

376
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:36,155
However, I've always felt

377
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:39,525
that being satisfied with where I am now
could make me lose my footing.

378
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,527
That's why trying something new

379
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,229
always excites me

380
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,264
and keeps me on my toes in life.

381
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:48,000
I felt that having
all these mixed emotions

382
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:51,670
would be key to staying relevant
in this field.

383
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:54,173
-Was a concert one of them?
-It was.

384
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,877
It was, and I want to do
something similar next year as well.

385
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,712
I'll try to get the four of us together.

386
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,381
You'll bring
another expensive bottle of liquor.

387
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,216
-No, instead of that--
-Will you make it happen?

388
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,285
If you agree to it,

389
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:07,453
the other two will follow.

390
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,455
-Why? Really?
-I have a master plan.

391
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,991
When I first tried this,
I didn't think you'd say no,

392
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:13,159
so I didn't have a plan B or C.

393
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:14,059
I was stunned.

394
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,628
Is that why you left sulking?

395
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:17,797
I left, saying that fame had gotten
to your heads.

396
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,965
But now, my plan A is this.

397
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:25,004
Let's say you agree
with what I'm suggesting to some degree.

398
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,072
If Na-rae and Se-hyung
are still against it,

399
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,841
I'll move on to plan B.

400
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,576
"Guys, don't take this the wrong way,
but hear me out."

401
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,545
"There are others who want to get in
on the action."

402
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,547
Are you trying to make them want it?

403
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,081
"So I need an answer now,

404
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,617
since I'll have to look
for other options."

405
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,986
Se-hyung will be like, "Stop right there."

406
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:42,788
"Let's go another round and talk more."

407
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:43,923
FEELING ANXIOUS

408
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:44,990
Na-rae will also ask

409
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,625
who I have in mind.

410
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,260
I'll say I have people lined up.

411
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,528
"Really?" she says.

412
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,397
Once you tell someone

413
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:53,332
they're not your only option…

414
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,300
They'll want it.

415
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:55,701
Of course.

416
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,203
Anyway, that's plan B.

417
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,271
WE HOPE HIS PLAN B WORKS!

418
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,239
That's plan B.

419
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:02,474
CHUCKLING

420
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:03,609
That's hilarious.

421
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,178
Other than that,
I spend most of my time watching TV.

422
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,913
-And watching YouTube.
-Right.

423
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,716
Watching YouTube videos
made you much smarter.

424
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,786
HAHA

425
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,789
People who make ice cream don't eat it.

426
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,959
A SHALLOW, WALKING ENCYCLOPEDIA

427
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,527
I learned a lot from you today.

428
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,196
-I learned a lot.
-That's so funny.

429
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:26,332
Recently,

430
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,134
was it Stray Kids?

431
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,703
-I know them.
-Two members

432
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,405
of Stray Kids appeared on Salon Drip.

433
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,307
It's the same for most K-pop idol groups,

434
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,576
but their members
are much younger than us.

435
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,044
I think the two members

436
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:40,779
were in their early to mid-20s
or something.

437
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,114
CHANGBIN, FELIX

438
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:45,885
Anyway, the conversation naturally led

439
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:48,020
to me talking about my old age

440
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,222
and how time flew by for me.

441
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,957
-Felix, one of the members--
-I know him.

442
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,360
-Who was the other one?
-Changbin.

443
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:55,728
Changbin? I know him too.

444
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,229
-I even have his number.
-Really?

445
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,230
-Yes.
-Call him.

446
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,365
-Changbin?
-Yes.

447
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,567
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME?

448
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,202
-Are you serious?
-Yes, I am.

449
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,404
He even gave me a shout-out recently.

450
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,438
On a show--

451
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:09,108
I thought you said Sharon Stone.

452
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,010
OH MY…

453
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,811
Why would he…

454
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,413
Why would he

455
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,248
do this in front of me?

456
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,317
Sharon Stone was from way back when.

457
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:22,454
Anyway, he gave me a shout-out,
saying he loves the kind of comedy we do.

458
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,757
Really? Of course!
He told me the same thing.

459
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,226
Changbin said that on a show.

460
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,661
How cool is that?

461
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:29,862
This is my first time calling him.

462
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,697
I'm not usually like this.

463
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,632
-He's really not like this.
-I never do this.

464
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:36,368
-We both feel this is crossing the line.
-Hello?

465
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,569
Changbin.

466
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,238
-Hi, Se-chan.
-Hey.

467
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,940
Were you ever on Salon Drip,

468
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:42,408
the show hosted by Do-yeon?

469
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:43,876
Yes, I was.

470
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,312
Really? Well, she wouldn't believe

471
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:47,446
that I knew you.

472
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,182
-Who?
-Do-yeon and the rest of the staff.

473
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,383
-I see.
-That's why

474
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,419
I mentioned you giving us a shout-out

475
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,988
and called you to prove it.
We're in the middle of filming.

476
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,190
Really? Hi, there.

477
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,692
Do-yeon's right next to me.

478
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:01,560
-Hi, Do-yeon.
-Do you remember me, Changbin?

479
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,828
-Of course.
-Really?

480
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,930
Se-chan said he had your number.

481
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:06,065
She wouldn't believe me!

482
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,101
We swapped numbers
after filming a show together.

483
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,236
-That's right. It was their idea…
-Really?

484
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,339
…to exchange numbers. How sweet is that?

485
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:14,606
What about me?

486
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,809
You never asked for it.

487
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,678
-I'm sorry.
-She's quite the introvert, you see.

488
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:20,879
I wanted to swap numbers.

489
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,581
-See? He's really cool.
-I'm sorry.

490
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,217
I mentioned having a great time
with you all on the show,

491
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,987
-and that led to this call. So sorry.
-That's all right.

492
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:30,322
Didn't we catch you at a busy time?

493
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,857
I'm on my way to a signing event.

494
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,460
That's so cool.

495
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,795
Are you ready to rock it?

496
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,364
Of course.

497
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:40,532
I should do a good job.

498
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,901
Let's grab a meal sometime soon.

499
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:45,104
Sure. It'll be my treat.

500
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,438
-I mean that.
-Thanks.

501
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,273
Thanks for picking up.
Let's get together soon.

502
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,975
-Thank you.
-No problem.

503
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,544
Changbin, have a good one and take care.

504
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,346
-Sure.
-Bye.

505
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:57,649
Look at you, Mr. I-Know-Changbin.

506
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,418
Did you hear how awkward I was just now?

507
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:00,686
The tone was way off.

508
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,622
SUDDENLY, HE SPOKE
IN AN AWKWARD TONE

509
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,591
What's wrong with me? Why did I do that?

510
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,693
I never talk in a tone like that.

511
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,894
THE EMBARRASSMENT HITS HIM HARD

512
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,929
After this, if you still feel guilty,

513
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:12,831
you'll text him later to apologize.

514
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,266
"I had no other choice."

515
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,068
-That's so funny.
-I laughed so hard.

516
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,036
Wasn't that sweet of him?

517
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,004
-And at this moment--
-Is it Tae-goo?

518
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,806
I missed a call from Tae-goo.

519
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,174
Did we miss his call?

520
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,642
-Call him back.
-Do you know why he called?

521
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,678
"Hi, Tae-goo.
This is comedian Jang Do-yeon."

522
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:30,449
"I'm at Cheongpa Chaekgado café,
filming Getaway and Go with Jangdobari."

523
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:34,353
"Despite knowing it was rude, I called
after asking the owner for your number."

524
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,221
"Sorry I asked for your number
without asking you first."

525
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:38,524
"You seem busy,
so don't worry about calling me back."

526
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,126
-That's so funny.
-You know why.

527
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:42,594
-You felt awkward.
-It was awkward for me.

528
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:43,996
Anyway, I'll call him.

529
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,597
THE SECOND ATTEMPT TO CALL HIM

530
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,634
-Gosh, he should be busy.
-Is it on speaker?

531
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,535
Of course.

532
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,837
What if he doesn't pick up again?

533
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,505
Why did I have it on mute?

534
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,641
What do I do?

535
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,409
Do-yeon, hi.

536
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:00,679
I'm sorry I didn't pick up.

537
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,481
Please don't apologize.
I'm the one who's sorry.

538
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,483
I wasn't busy, just tired,

539
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,518
and I happened to be asleep
when you called.

540
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,419
Really?

541
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:10,289
-How cool is his voice?
-I've been busy this week.

542
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:12,191
I see you slept well into the day.

543
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:13,792
LAUGHING

544
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,160
I was worried, that's all.

545
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:18,063
I was sleeping like a log.

546
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:18,964
Really?

547
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,265
Anyway, Se-chan…

548
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:21,600
ME?

549
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,302
He kept insisting I called you.

550
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:24,436
Does he know who I am?

551
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:25,571
Gosh, thanks.

552
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,139
Do you know who Yang Se-chan is?

553
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:29,875
I don't. Just kidding.

554
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,577
HAHA

555
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:33,679
THE SLY TAE-GOO MESSES
WITH SE-CHAN

556
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:36,682
Tae-goo, you've gotten
pretty funny lately.

557
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,418
It's a pleasure to finally talk to you,

558
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,653
even if it's over the phone.

559
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,654
It's an honor.

560
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:43,555
The honor is mine.

561
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:47,192
Do-yeon kept saying how cool

562
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,061
and funny you are,

563
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,864
and I practically begged her
to let me talk to you.

564
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,966
Really? Thank you so much.

565
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,267
There's no reason to thank me.

566
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,303
I heard that your favorite drink here
is the vanilla latte.

567
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:02,307
At that friend's café,

568
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:05,210
I like the croffle the most.

569
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:06,145
The croffle?

570
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:08,080
Wait. We didn't order that.

571
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,681
-It's no longer available.
-Really?

572
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:11,183
It's no longer on the menu.

573
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,618
Yes, I know.

574
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:14,086
But they used to have it.

575
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:20,125
Anyway, Do-yeon said
you always have the vanilla latte here.

576
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,927
-I see.
-Right.

577
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:24,997
I always had the croffle there.

578
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:28,066
She says you come here alone
from time to time.

579
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:31,503
Well, the café is owned

580
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,905
by my friend.

581
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:36,675
I go there to chat with him.

582
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:37,876
Do you live around here?

583
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,912
No, I live in Goyang.

584
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:41,413
In Goyang?

585
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:43,849
I go there often.

586
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,419
I'll swing by sometime
to grab coffee with you.

587
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,054
That's wishful thinking.

588
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,455
Well, that's…

589
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,291
It's good to meet you.

590
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:54,993
AN EXPERT AT CHANGING
THE SUBJECT

591
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,596
We already said hi,
and now you're saying it again.

592
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:00,832
You're so funny.

593
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:02,201
It's fascinating to be talking to you.

594
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,635
Really? The feeling's mutual.

595
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,970
I'm a huge fan.

596
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,506
I've been enjoying your work as well.

597
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,107
You're too kind.

598
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:10,576
He must be tired, so let him rest.

599
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:13,412
Thanks. By the way,
what are you up to now that you're up?

600
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,280
CHUCKLING

601
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,084
We won't ask you to join us,
so don't worry.

602
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,119
Don't worry!

603
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:22,554
We're not as rude as you think.

604
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:23,589
-We won't ask that.
-We won't.

605
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,123
I was just asking.

606
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,260
Wouldn't it be kind of cold to hang up
without talking a bit more?

607
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:29,995
I'd love to hear what you're up to.

608
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,597
-Well…
-Yes?

609
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,165
I was about to take some probiotics.

610
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:36,268
After taking probiotics,

611
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:37,903
you'll get ready for dinner.

612
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,204
-I guess…
-This is so funny.

613
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,340
-Yes?
-…I'll get ready for dinner.

614
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,275
Got it, Tae-goo.

615
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:46,945
Thank you for stopping by the café.

616
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,080
As if you need to thank us.

617
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:50,082
You and Do-yeon got to know each other,

618
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:51,516
and she insisted that we come here.

619
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,218
Everything we had here was amazing.

620
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,220
I'm happy to hear that.

621
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,990
We should meet up sometime, Tae-goo.

622
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:00,058
I'll make sure to greet you properly.

623
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:03,395
Sounds good. I'd love to greet you then.

624
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:04,663
Thanks, Tae-goo.

625
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,265
You should say goodbye to Do-yeon.

626
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:07,566
Thank you so much

627
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,401
for talking to us today.

628
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:11,937
It's not right to put you out like this,
and I'm sorry.

629
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,905
I'm the one who's grateful, Do-yeon.

630
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:16,842
I won't save your number, so don't worry.

631
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,778
But I already saved yours.

632
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,381
Then I'll save your number too!

633
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,316
Tae-goo?

634
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,818
What name did you save her number under?

635
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,755
"Jang Do-yeon."

636
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:33,325
HOW… STRAIGHTFORWARD OF YOU…

637
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:37,763
I'll save your number
under "Um Tae-goo," then.

638
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:39,264
-Thank you.
-The pleasure was ours.

639
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:40,432
We'll leave you be now.

640
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,000
Have a great time.

641
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,169
-Thanks, Tae-goo.
-Bye.

642
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,103
Bye.

643
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,805
What an angel.

644
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:48,373
Tell me about it.

645
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,242
He could've just pretended to be busy.

646
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,110
-We called him out of the blue.
-He's a genius.

647
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:53,445
-No way.
-Check out the joke he made.

648
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:54,646
"Yang Se-chan? I don't know him."

649
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,181
-"Just kidding."
-Tell me about it.

650
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,850
HE EVEN PUT SE-CHAN ON EDGE

651
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,552
How funny was that?

652
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,054
He's a genius.

653
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,388
I'd love to meet him in person.

654
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:04,456
-Really?
-Yes.

655
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:05,757
I'm even more curious about him now.
He's hilarious.

656
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,092
I don't think I'll be able to though.

657
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,060
Why not?

658
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:10,829
How could I, when our fields or interests
don't overlap at all?

659
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:11,897
There's nothing.

660
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:13,699
-Something that overlaps?
-There's none.

661
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:15,367
Absolutely nothing.

662
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:16,335
So what will we do next?

663
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:17,235
-Us?
-Yes.

664
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:19,371
Next, we're off to a photo studio.

665
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,940
-A photo studio?
-Yes, we'll be taking photos.

666
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:25,344
Remember the drawing of us
on Comedy Big League,

667
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,278
minus my face?

668
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,379
When I portrayed the loser?

669
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:29,314
Yes. We'll be reminiscing on the past.

670
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,049
Will you reenact that drawing?

671
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:33,185
One with my face, and one without.

672
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,221
One with your face, one without,

673
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,723
and one with me missing something.

674
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:38,990
What will you be missing?

675
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:40,258
My face.

676
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:41,393
-Your face?
-Yes.

677
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,461
But I'm taller.

678
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:45,097
Hold on. How can we do it?

679
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:46,331
Won't there be a way?

680
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:47,899
-Sure, we'll make it happen.
-Right.

681
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:50,602
All we're left with are photos,
so let's go take some.

682
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:52,304
-Great, let's do it.
-Let's go.

683
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,205
Off we go.

684
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,741
-We enjoyed everything.
-Thank you.

685
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,042
OFF TO A PHOTO STUDIO
TO REMINISCE

686
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:58,477
A 35-MINUTE DRIVE
TO THE PHOTO STUDIO

687
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,644
I remember

688
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,947
-why I brought up Stray Kids earlier.
-Why?

689
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:04,082
I said something about being old,

690
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,517
and Felix asked,

691
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,452
-"Are you really 41?"
-Your age?

692
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:10,422
To that, Changbin said,

693
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:12,624
"It's even ruder to point that out."

694
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,092
Isn't that hilarious?

695
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,360
No way.

696
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:18,597
Thinking back,
when I was in my early to mid-20s,

697
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:22,300
-forty seemed so old.
-Same here.

698
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:25,270
But here I am at 41.
In three months, I'll turn 42.

699
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,873
-I can't believe it.
-Time flies.

700
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:29,441
I'll soon be 41 as well.

701
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:31,910
41 years old.

702
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:34,513
Hosujib?

703
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,414
What?

704
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,015
That sounds like a delicious restaurant.

705
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,350
-Where is it?
-Hosujib.

706
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,584
They serve chicken skewers.

707
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:40,852
That makes sense.

708
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,089
It totally makes sense.

709
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,992
WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT? HAHA

710
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:49,294
I've been finding "makes sense"
so funny lately.

711
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:51,930
You know how Jae-jun
comes up with weird jokes.

712
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:54,933
-True.
-He'll see the word "hosu" and go,

713
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,169
"That's Sanjeonghosu Lake."

714
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:59,371
"Sanjeonghosu Lake
because 'hosu' means lake?"

715
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,239
"Hey, that makes sense!"

716
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:04,976
He went from hosu to Sanjeonghosu Lake?

717
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:07,212
Yes, he connects words like that.

718
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,346
That's hilarious.

719
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:09,748
It's become his go-to joke.

720
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:11,550
I still can't believe Jae-jun

721
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,818
is a dad now.

722
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:14,453
-Tell me about it. Same for Eun-hyung.
-And Eun-hyung.

723
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,954
They're both great at parenting.

724
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:17,656
They're really good.

725
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:19,391
I haven't seen many parents firsthand,

726
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,059
but they're some of the best.

727
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,761
-They're so good.
-They must adore that baby.

728
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:23,728
He's adorable.

729
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,363
Do you like babies?

730
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,666
-Absolutely.
-I guess everyone loves them.

731
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:28,834
Do you also

732
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,837
want to get married and have kids
as soon as possible?

733
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:34,940
-Of course, yes.
-Do you want a family of your own?

734
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:35,841
I do.

735
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,509
This is something I heard.

736
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:40,512
I think Se-hyung once said
he wouldn't get married until he was 50.

737
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,280
-He once said that.
-Right.

738
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:43,882
More than getting married,

739
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:47,219
we wanted to have successful careers.

740
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:50,422
I feel like I should get married,

741
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,091
but the idea of it…

742
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:55,227
I don't know.

743
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,329
Is getting married something you want?

744
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:58,830
Of course. I'm going to get married.

745
00:24:58,897 --> 00:24:59,965
-Really?
-Yes.

746
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:02,067
-I want to get married.
-It doesn't seem that way.

747
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,537
You look like you're not interested
in marriage.

748
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:06,438
That's not true.

749
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,673
-For someone who wants to get married…
-Sure.

750
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:11,076
…I'm not really doing much about it.

751
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:13,078
But I feel like I'd enjoy being married.

752
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:15,680
You know how elders always say,

753
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:17,482
"Just wait till you get older."

754
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:19,684
"You'll see that we're right."

755
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:23,188
Of all the things they said
we'd realize with age,

756
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,958
marriage being better sooner
is one of them.

757
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,860
-I heard that too.
-I didn't quite get it,

758
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,363
but now I'm at this age,

759
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,332
I regret not getting married sooner.

760
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,301
-For me--
-I should've married when I was clueless.

761
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,303
We're already set up

762
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,839
with everything we need
to live by ourselves.

763
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:42,974
-I have my own routine.
-We all do.

764
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,376
I know.

765
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:46,444
Picture someone disrupting
that routine and space.

766
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:48,113
We'd be invading each other's space.

767
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:50,081
-Then…
-That's just as bad.

768
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:52,817
I'd probably marry someone
if I liked him enough

769
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,286
to adjust my routine.

770
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:55,654
This is what they say.

771
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,256
To avoid doing something
the other person dislikes,

772
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:00,191
you have to change your own ways.

773
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:01,493
You should be the one to change,

774
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,861
-not the other person.
-Exactly.

775
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:05,664
People say that's the key
to a healthy marriage.

776
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,099
Marriage is about constantly
putting your partner first.

777
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:10,569
But I'm so used to living on my own now.

778
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:11,536
That's true.

779
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,271
-Nothing's better.
-It's too comfortable.

780
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:16,107
-Does your family mention it?
-Mention what?

781
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:18,710
Has your mom asked
when you're getting married?

782
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:21,880
She never once asked when I was under 40.

783
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:23,114
But now that I'm 41,

784
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:24,516
I think she's getting anxious.

785
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,852
She's worried I might drift through life
without much thought.

786
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,622
She goes,
"Are you really not seeing anyone?"

787
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,458
She asked
if I was seeing anyone seriously.

788
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,961
Have you ever introduced your mom

789
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:38,096
to the guy you were dating?

790
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:41,766
Ages ago, I told her I was seeing someone,

791
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,435
but she never said

792
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:44,970
she wanted to meet him.

793
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:46,504
She just acknowledged
that you were dating.

794
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:49,074
So you've never brought
your boyfriend home to meet your parents.

795
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,041
Never.

796
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,177
-That's possible.
-I showed my mom photos

797
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,746
and bragged about how good-looking he was.

798
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,550
That must be how
mothers with daughters are.

799
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,819
-Neither of us brought girlfriends home.
-Never?

800
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:01,920
Never.

801
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:04,255
We never even told her

802
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:05,724
-if we were dating or not.
-Really?

803
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,525
Didn't your mom show any interest?

804
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:09,160
She never showed any interest,

805
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:11,296
but she's been saying
what your mother also said.

806
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:12,297
Which is?

807
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:14,666
"Have you not thought
about getting married?"

808
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:17,135
-She's been asking that.
-What do you say?

809
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,336
Something like this.

810
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:19,971
"Mom, there's a time for everything."

811
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:25,010
-No wonder your mom doesn't ask.
-"Mom, there's a time for everything."

812
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:26,845
"You can't have it all."
"What do you mean?"

813
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:29,180
"Mom, look at Se-hyung and me."

814
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:32,517
"We've been working hard at our jobs

815
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:33,885
and are loved for it."

816
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,554
"Even this has been a challenge."

817
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:39,391
She goes, "I guess it doesn't make sense
that you'd find success in marriage too."

818
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:40,992
That's true. I once said that as well.

819
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:42,661
Shouldn't we be grateful

820
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:43,995
-for what I've achieved?
-Exactly.

821
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:45,830
How can I start a family too?

822
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:46,931
You're right.

823
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:48,833
At 50, I wonder

824
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,136
what we'll be talking about.

825
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:53,371
At 50, we might still
be wondering about marriage.

826
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:56,041
That's…

827
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:57,275
I'll say, "Maybe someday."

828
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,277
"Maybe someday, I'll get married."

829
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,348
SANGAM INTERSECTION

830
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:04,749
I see we made it all the way here.

831
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:06,918
-It's Sangam.
-We're in Sangam.

832
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:11,256
Everything that was here is gone now.

833
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:12,424
I know.

834
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,927
I never imagined our usual café
would shut down for good.

835
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:17,996
Is the hangover soup place still around?
I guess not.

836
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:19,798
-Is it gone?
-It's gone.

837
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,000
-I don't see it. It was down there.
-That's where

838
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:24,169
we always ended the night after going out.

839
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:25,270
Is it there or not?

840
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,238
-It's gone!
-Really?

841
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:29,140
-It's now a rice cake place.
-A rice cake place.

842
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,243
-It's gone.
-Every place we used to eat and drink at

843
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,511
is gone.

844
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,181
SIGH

845
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:37,949
I don't recognize this neighborhood now.

846
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,050
It's all changed.

847
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:40,885
We used to eat at this soup place a lot,

848
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:42,120
but now it has a different name.

849
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,089
We used to eat here often as well.

850
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:45,190
Their food was delicious.

851
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:49,060
-But it's not the same.
-We had so many team dinners here.

852
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:50,228
It's changed so much.

853
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,163
It's been a while

854
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,833
since I roamed around Sangam-dong.

855
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,802
Back then, we always grabbed a bite to eat
after meetings.

856
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,304
Of course.

857
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:01,306
"We should grab a drink."

858
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:02,807
"Does anyone have plans tomorrow? As if."

859
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:04,309
-As if.
-I know, as if.

860
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:05,944
Comedy Big League was all we had.

861
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,146
Remember the place we went to
this one time?

862
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:12,817
We went for drinks
after an awards ceremony

863
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:14,285
-of some sort.
-The tvN Awards?

864
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:15,453
It was for tvN.

865
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,088
Yes, of course!

866
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:18,423
Wasn't it the tvN10 Awards?

867
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,624
-It was.
-Right?

868
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,860
-It was to celebrate its 10th anniversary.
-I remember now.

869
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,394
We prepared a lot for it.

870
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:25,463
-We even put on a show.
-That we did.

871
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,798
The performance went well.

872
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:29,701
You did a Park Bo-gum impression
even though you look nothing like him.

873
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,337
I met him some time later,
after I had done that performance.

874
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:34,272
Turns out he was aware of it.

875
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:36,574
Of course, he was.
We went all out for that performance.

876
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:37,876
On Park Bo-gum's Cantabile,

877
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,310
I did another impression of him.

878
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:40,478
How stupid was that?

879
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,580
It's not like
I did a solid impression of him.

880
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:43,581
I just dressed the part.

881
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:44,949
"Deok-sun."

882
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,285
-It wasn't even funny.
-You were just a loser.

883
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:48,720
My impression was just as bad.

884
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,288
-"I'm Kim Hye-soo."
-Yes, Kim Hye-soo.

885
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:53,424
I kept saying I was Kim Hye-soo
even though I sounded nothing like her.

886
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:55,693
She actually texted me the next day.

887
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,595
-Saying what?
-She enjoyed the show.

888
00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:59,731
Hye-soo's response to your impressions
was great.

889
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,466
I know. Tell me about it.

890
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,868
She's so cool. I love her even more.

891
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:07,605
Anyway, the performance we did
was a lot of fun.

892
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:11,943
Also, the members who performed
at that awards ceremony

893
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,379
were all in top form at the time.

894
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:15,847
Na-rae was killing it with her makeup.

895
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:17,382
Yes, exactly, her makeup.

896
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:21,019
-You're right.
-We all had a segment

897
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:23,087
-where we played beloved characters.
-Exactly.

898
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,623
-Shall we?
-Sure.

899
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,724
THEY ARRIVE AT THE STUDIO

900
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:28,660
Let's go.

901
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:30,028
HAHA

902
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:31,229
Jeez.

903
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:33,798
We'll be taking photos here.

904
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:36,034
-Sure. Sounds good.
-Let's go.

905
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,736
Back then, we took that photo
in the green room

906
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:40,071
during Comedy Big League.

907
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,540
-Today, we're in a studio.
-You're right.

908
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:43,675
Exactly.

909
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:45,977
-What's this?
-Hello.

910
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:47,145
It's the photo studio.

911
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:48,446
THE PHOTO STUDIO
FOR A MEMORY OF TODAY

912
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,747
This makes sense.

913
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,517
It's a photo studio.

914
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,652
We were on Comedy Big League together,

915
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:56,788
so it's not a stretch for us
to take wedding photos.

916
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,289
Are we taking wedding photos today?

917
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,525
Yes, we'll be reenacting that scene
from our time…

918
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:02,293
-Really?
-…on the show.

919
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,928
All you have to do is wear a jacket.

920
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:05,463
We're not taking it
in the clothes we're wearing.

921
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,965
We'll keep it simple though.

922
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,233
Doesn't that make sense?

923
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:09,968
This totally makes sense.

924
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,970
HAHA

925
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,975
I SEE…

926
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,309
It makes sense.

927
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,378
That being there…

928
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:21,880
-actually makes sense.
-This is hilarious.

929
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:23,748
THE SUSPICIOUS FOXTAIL
FOLLOWS THEM EVERYWHERE

930
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:26,017
-I haven't taken an ID photo in ages.
-Same here.

931
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:29,087
Did you know people just
take photos on their phones

932
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:30,521
and print them as ID photos?

933
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:31,623
Is that allowed?

934
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:32,724
Don't many do that?

935
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,125
Yes, that's common these days.

936
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:35,693
The world has changed that much.

937
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,028
I saw it on YouTube.

938
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:38,329
SCOFFING

939
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,698
-How about a test shot?
-Cut back on YouTube, will you?

940
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,767
-Can you join me?
-Sure.

941
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,168
If it's like this…

942
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,370
-Hey.
-We should step closer.

943
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:46,271
This is cool.

944
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:47,338
Weren't you over here…

945
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,073
-Yes.
-…while I was like this?

946
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,775
My face was in the frame and yours wasn't.

947
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:52,076
I remember spreading my legs.

948
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:52,977
-That's right.
-Right?

949
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:54,612
It was taken up close.

950
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,514
For your face to show while mine doesn't…

951
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,949
FOR ONLY DO-YEON'S FACE TO SHOW

952
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,217
Let's check the angle.

953
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:01,286
Should I be like this?

954
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:03,454
Hold on. I should bend down some more.

955
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:04,756
TRYING HARD TO FIND
THE RIGHT ANGLE

956
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:06,224
Wait a second. Here you go.

957
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:07,425
How's the angle now?

958
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:08,326
Take a seat.

959
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:09,527
GETTING A CHAIR
FOR DO-YEON TO SIT ON

960
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,930
I'll kneel down like so.

961
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:13,831
Check it out.

962
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:16,034
This is it.

963
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,468
-Is it?
-Yes.

964
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:19,971
-Look at me!
-Hold on.

965
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,806
-I look like Choi Hong-man.
-Stay posed.

966
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:23,408
-Am I this huge?
-Yes.

967
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:25,543
-You look tiny in the photo.
-I know.

968
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:27,912
This is it. Here we go.

969
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,948
-Is this it?
-Yes.

970
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:30,949
What the heck?

971
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:32,784
You don't even need to wear a jacket.

972
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:33,885
My clothes won't show.

973
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:36,387
Hold still. I'll go get a veil.

974
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,489
-This is my spot exactly.
-Right.

975
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:40,024
-Stay like that.
-Sure.

976
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:42,660
Where's the veil? Is this it?

977
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,497
How do you put this on?

978
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,067
Is this right?

979
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:51,769
Hold on.

980
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:54,505
DO-YEON ENTERS WEARING A VEIL

981
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:59,644
THE MOOD SHIFTED DRASTICALLY

982
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,114
Don't seem nervous

983
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:05,249
like you suddenly have a crush.

984
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:08,219
-I'll sit like this.
-This will be my bouquet.

985
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:10,288
That makes sense.

986
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:11,189
Come on!

987
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,325
Hold on. Let me check the angle.

988
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:15,360
Sure.

989
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:16,928
I should go lower.

990
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,262
It's funnier when your eyes are showing.

991
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,230
-Like this?
-Yes.

992
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,432
Look at my eyes, Do-yeon.

993
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:23,901
-I'll take the photo like this.
-Got it.

994
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,370
Sure, okay.

995
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,605
You should get into your pose now.

996
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,506
I'll look at the camera.

997
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:30,174
Hold it. Here we go.

998
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:32,477
I'll keep taking the shots.

999
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:33,378
SE-CHAN LEADS THE PHOTO SHOOT

1000
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:34,479
Two, three.

1001
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:36,914
Two, three.

1002
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:39,384
Two, three.

1003
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:45,023
-Are we done?
-Yes.

1004
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:47,091
-This looks good.
-Hey, I like that.

1005
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:48,159
-We look cute.
-I know.

1006
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:49,060
Isn't this a good one?

1007
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,396
-I love it. Yes!
-Right.

1008
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:52,563
RETAKING WEDDING PHOTOS
IN 8 YEARS

1009
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,032
-Are we good?
-Should we switch angles?

1010
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:54,932
Reenact the original version.

1011
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:56,034
-The original version?
-The original version?

1012
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:58,703
Should we keep it as is or show your chin?

1013
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,105
-Where should I cut it?
-Cut me off right here.

1014
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:02,306
Up there? Got it.

1015
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,374
NOTED

1016
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:04,509
-Is that where you're standing?
-Yes.

1017
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:06,077
-I'll go up on my toes on three.
-And I'll…

1018
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:07,979
Let's see how it comes out.

1019
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:10,448
Okay, we're good.

1020
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:11,349
SATISFIED ONCE AGAIN

1021
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:13,017
-This is hilarious.
-We're good.

1022
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:14,719
Sure.

1023
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:16,521
(WIDE)

1024
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,490
The shoulders aren't right.

1025
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,292
-Hey, wear the jacket.
-Oh, right.

1026
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,760
RUSH

1027
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:25,997
I won't ask you to draw the beard.

1028
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:27,165
I wouldn't mind.

1029
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,399
-Really?
-But it mind ruin the shot.

1030
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:29,834
WORRIED THE VIBE
WOULDN'T BE RIGHT

1031
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,970
HE LOOKS MORE LIKE A LOSER NOW

1032
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:34,205
This is absolutely hilarious.

1033
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:37,108
Don't we seem like a couple

1034
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,710
who actually lived together
as a married couple?

1035
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:42,046
I mean, we're like a couple

1036
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:44,549
who wants to reenact old photos.

1037
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:46,851
Let's do what we did on tvN.

1038
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,052
Okay, here's a test shot.

1039
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:49,420
Wait.

1040
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:51,155
We're good.

1041
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:52,790
Here we go.

1042
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:56,160
JUST LIKE OLD TIMES

1043
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,831
HIS PINKISH SMILE
IS STILL THE SAME

1044
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,704
-I think we're good.
-Really?

1045
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:07,939
Okay, then.

1046
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:09,407
That was so much fun.

1047
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:11,709
That was a blast.

1048
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,344
This totally makes sense.

1049
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:14,445
I know. It makes sense.

1050
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:15,379
THIS MAKES SENSE

1051
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,048
This makes sense.

1052
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,052
That turned out to have
a lot of foreshadowing.

1053
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,521
What if you hadn't brought me that?

1054
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,490
Tell me about it.
Things just click sometimes.

1055
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:27,959
-Things just happen to click.
-I know.

1056
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:29,727
You might've wondered
why I brought her that,

1057
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,362
but it makes sense now.

1058
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:32,430
You were blessed.

1059
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:35,500
If you get married someday,
please shoot a wedding photo like that.

1060
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:37,101
WELL…

1061
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:38,236
That makes sense.

1062
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:40,838
I guess

1063
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:43,374
taking a shot like that makes sense.

1064
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:44,909
I doubt I'll do it though.

1065
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:45,877
Do what?

1066
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:49,313
Taking photos looking like the characters
I used to play.

1067
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,548
-You get it, right?
-I do.

1068
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:52,049
It's cringey.

1069
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:53,885
What if five years later

1070
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:55,520
I'm drawing a beard on my husband?

1071
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:56,521
DRAWING SE-CHAN'S LOSER BEARD

1072
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:57,788
WITH HER FUTURE HUSBAND

1073
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:01,359
Have you ever gone around
taking photos like this?

1074
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:02,360
The two of us?

1075
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:04,695
I suddenly had an idea for a show.

1076
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,030
That question gave me an idea.

1077
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:09,267
It's as if we're a divorced couple

1078
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,769
back on a show and getting back together.

1079
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,471
"How is it now compared to before?"

1080
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:16,107
It was like being asked a question
on one of those shows.

1081
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,777
"How do you feel about getting
back together after the divorce?"

1082
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:20,678
We're back together--

1083
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:22,013
-Are we back together?
-Yes.

1084
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,681
"How does it feel to be back together?"

1085
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,816
"What's it like reliving the past?"

1086
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:27,118
That's what it felt like.

1087
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,953
How have you been after the divorce?

1088
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,623
-After the divorce, I--
-Did you date other women?

1089
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,492
Of course. I got married again,
but it didn't work out.

1090
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,360
-You got married again?
-Absolutely.

1091
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:38,563
I'm back to being single.

1092
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:40,831
-You did your best with your life.
-Of course.

1093
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:43,234
There's no woman like Jang Do-yeon.

1094
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:44,235
Oh, please.

1095
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:45,803
THE HUSBAND'S BRAVE WORDS
BRING SPRING BACK TO THEM

1096
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,038
What's with you?

1097
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:50,308
I didn't have much going for me,

1098
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,910
but because there was no one like you,

1099
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:55,046
-I came back.
-Looking back,

1100
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:57,181
our chemistry was the best
in the early days.

1101
00:36:58,316 --> 00:36:59,650
In the end, nothing else mattered.

1102
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:01,719
That's so funny.

1103
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:05,056
REMARRIAGE REBOOT CAMP

1104
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:07,758
There's that feeling.

1105
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:11,095
When you hear a song from back in the day,

1106
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:13,497
-the memories come back.
-The memories?

1107
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,766
When you see a scene from a movie,

1108
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:19,237
it brings you back to who you were

1109
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:21,639
and how you felt back then.

1110
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:22,974
It's not the case for comedy.

1111
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,677
That's why I get emotional
when people say they enjoyed my work.

1112
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,846
I'm grateful they remember.

1113
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,314
If you look at our projects
from back then,

1114
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:32,583
you'll see we were both really good.

1115
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,285
I mean that.

1116
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:36,921
To be honest, I didn't really
check on my work afterward.

1117
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:40,124
I was uncomfortable
watching myself perform,

1118
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:42,159
and watching it again felt meaningless.

1119
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:44,662
What matters
is that the audience enjoyed it then.

1120
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:46,597
-They ranked our performances, remember?
-Sure.

1121
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:49,667
I didn't bother to watch it again,
especially when I had won first place.

1122
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:52,336
Now, it's not about mustering up
the courage to watch it.

1123
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:54,272
I watch my old performances
because I want to.

1124
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:55,206
When I do,

1125
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,675
I see a side of myself
I didn't realize back then,

1126
00:37:57,742 --> 00:38:00,478
one I can only see as a viewer.

1127
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:02,313
The content we put together,

1128
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,682
the acting, you, and our chemistry.

1129
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:05,983
We were so good.

1130
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:07,952
We did great.

1131
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,487
I was left amazed by our work.

1132
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:11,188
You were so good.

1133
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:12,723
A lot of it was ad-libbing,

1134
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,359
but you really brought
that character to life.

1135
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:19,096
There was one reason
we were able to improvise like that.

1136
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:20,431
Producer Park Seong-jae

1137
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:22,433
acknowledged that we didn't need any input

1138
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,168
and told us to do as we wanted.

1139
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:25,069
True.

1140
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:28,372
Letting us do whatever we wanted
is what made us so good.

1141
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:30,041
You're right. We improved a great deal.

1142
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:32,777
-Also, it's not like we practiced a lot.
-I know.

1143
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:36,180
It was more like,
"I'll do this, so you do that."

1144
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:38,382
-"I guess we can just do this."
-Yes, exactly.

1145
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:39,884
That can be tied to how I'm wired.

1146
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:43,387
There's that first feeling,
and it shifts over time.

1147
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:45,089
Let's say we kept practicing our skit.

1148
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:48,092
The line was "This flower is pretty."

1149
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,161
If I keep practicing the tone
I delivered the line in,

1150
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:54,031
I can't get it to sound like the original.

1151
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:56,167
For you, being on the receiving end,

1152
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:57,501
if we practice too much

1153
00:38:58,035 --> 00:38:59,370
-it won't be as fun…
-Right.

1154
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:00,938
…when we perform it.

1155
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:04,975
That's why
we barely had any practice sessions.

1156
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:06,644
"I'll eat some naengmyeon next

1157
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:08,212
and hit you hard in this scene."

1158
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:09,313
We'd then perform

1159
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,315
-after agreeing to that.
-Still,

1160
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:14,251
-we really had our lines down.
-Absolutely. Then…

1161
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:16,954
We were able to operate like that

1162
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,190
-because we trusted one another.
-Of course.

1163
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:21,659
If we didn't have that level of trust,

1164
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:23,227
we'd be constantly checking
with each other

1165
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:24,195
to know what was coming.

1166
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:28,299
We were able to create
a lot of funny scenes and memes.

1167
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,334
One of them was the one
with the naengmyeon.

1168
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:32,403
We were having naengmyeon…

1169
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,738
-And I ate the egg.
-…and you ate the egg.

1170
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:36,340
You should've hit me on the head
when I had the egg earlier.

1171
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:37,375
To be honest,

1172
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:38,876
I saw an opportunity.

1173
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:42,146
However, I didn't want to create a scene

1174
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,814
that would be my downfall.

1175
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,149
People don't think that's funny anymore.

1176
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,651
-But it's obviously a comedy sketch.
-I know.

1177
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:50,321
I still remember how I was at the time.

1178
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,856
I said I'd hit you hard,

1179
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:53,591
and you told me to.

1180
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:55,826
In response to that,
I hit you with a lot of force.

1181
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,728
But after getting hit by me

1182
00:39:57,795 --> 00:39:59,430
with that much force,

1183
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:01,298
you reacted in a way that seemed real.

1184
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:02,900
-It was funny.
-Right?

1185
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:04,668
-There was also the jjajangmyeon.
-The jjajangmyeon!

1186
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:05,836
That was hilarious too.

1187
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:06,837
You didn't…

1188
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:09,106
just dunk my head into the bowl.

1189
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:10,941
You rubbed my face in the sauce.

1190
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,743
I did it with some force

1191
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,311
but hear me out on this.

1192
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:15,212
I couldn't believe it.

1193
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,415
Imagine if we had practiced it.

1194
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:20,284
It would've been awkward
because you would've fought me.

1195
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,086
We didn't bother practicing it,

1196
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:24,054
which led to a genuine reaction from you.

1197
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:25,189
It was funny.

1198
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:26,824
I know.

1199
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:28,626
Sometimes,

1200
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:30,594
you get a rush of dopamine like that.

1201
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:31,495
Totally.

1202
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:33,330
Things would be rocky during the meeting,

1203
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:34,632
but they'd work out well in the show.

1204
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:37,334
Sometimes, I'd just improvise
the heck out of it,

1205
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:40,905
and people would enjoy it
thanks to your reaction.

1206
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,240
I feel like a god at that point.

1207
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:45,709
Of course.

1208
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:48,279
-It was fun.
-It really was.

1209
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:49,814
-Tell me about it.
-Back then,

1210
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:52,683
it wasn't just our segments
that were funny.

1211
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,419
-Yong-jin's, Sang-jun's…
-They were hilarious too.

1212
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:57,288
-…Je-seong's, and Na-rae's.
-They were all funny.

1213
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:59,523
-It was the golden age.
-Seriously.

1214
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,358
We were all in the zone.
I had so much fun.

1215
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:02,726
It was incredible.

1216
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:04,628
-Are those our photos?
-Hey.

1217
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:06,530
Thank you.

1218
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:07,631
Do-yeon, these look great.

1219
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:08,566
Hold on.

1220
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,501
The frame covered my eyes.

1221
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:11,802
-Look at this.
-This is adorable.

1222
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:14,104
This is to make them look
like they're framed.

1223
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:16,407
-It covered my eyes.
-They framed it for us.

1224
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:19,243
-Your eyes have been covered.
-You can see one eye.

1225
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,045
It's right here.

1226
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:21,946
THE FRAME COVERED HIS EYE

1227
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:23,581
This is funny. It makes sense.

1228
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:26,884
BOTH OF HIS EYES WERE INTACT
WHEN THEY TOOK THE PHOTO

1229
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,420
Do-yeon, I'm taking
some of this frame off.

1230
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,588
-Me too.
-Like this.

1231
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:32,223
It's cuter this way.

1232
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:33,757
Right?

1233
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:34,959
HE BARELY MANAGED
TO SALVAGE HIS EYE

1234
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:36,293
This makes sense.

1235
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,796
It's sad that we can't see your other eye.

1236
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:40,998
-Still.
-We can at least see one of them.

1237
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:42,299
We can connect them like so.

1238
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:43,934
LET'S CONNECT THEM LIKE SO, HAHA

1239
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,337
Do-yeon, connecting them like this
makes more sense.

1240
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:48,005
Check this out.

1241
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,440
-What the…
-It's eerie.

1242
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,708
I know it's a little eerie.

1243
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:52,977
Still, this makes sense.

1244
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:54,979
TOGETHER, THEY FORM AN EERIE
BUT LOVING SHOT

1245
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:57,448
I should display these like so at home.

1246
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,949
This makes total sense.

1247
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:00,818
It's kind of scary.

1248
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:03,320
I love it.

1249
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:05,122
I have to ask though.

1250
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,024
What are we even getting out of this?

1251
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:09,760
I hope this is good
for your show at least.

1252
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:10,928
Of course.

1253
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:12,796
-It's a trip down memory lane.
-Right, sure.

1254
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,565
Am I 2.8 m tall or something?

1255
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,102
"Hello, I'm Jang Do-yeon."

1256
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:21,539
"Hi, I'm Choi Hong-man."

1257
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:23,340
"Hi, I'm Jang Do-yeon, the bride."

1258
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:26,143
-I love these.
-These are great.

1259
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,579
-Thank you for making these for us.
-Thank you.

1260
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:30,548
-I'll keep them safe at home.
-Me too.

1261
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:31,949
These are all memories.

1262
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:33,484
When will we get to do this again?

1263
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,252
Imagine coming back to this in ten years.

1264
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:36,153
It'll be fun.

1265
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,122
-Even the foxtail was perfect.
-I love it.

1266
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:40,124
Now, let's go climbing.

1267
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,225
Climbing?

1268
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:43,060
We're going indoor climbing, right?

1269
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:44,562
-That makes sense.
-Hear this.

1270
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:47,965
We'll climb past life's hardships
one by one,

1271
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:49,567
-until we reach the top.
-I love it.

1272
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:51,035
Dinner will taste even better after that.

1273
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:52,102
Of course. Let's go.

1274
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:53,671
-Sure.
-It's in Sangam too.

1275
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:54,772
That's great.

1276
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:55,873
OFF TO CLIMB!

1277
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,341
-Shall we?
-Thank you.

1278
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,676
That was hilarious.

1279
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:00,611
This was fun.

1280
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:02,246
I know. I had a blast.

1281
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:06,517
TODAY'S TRIP, MAKES. SENSE.

1282
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,651
What's that smell?

1283
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:08,986
I smell the passion of comedy.

1284
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:09,887
Passion.

1285
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:12,156
Let's live our lives by that word.

1286
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:13,624
-Pas…
-Sion!

1287
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,961
THEY YELLED IT
AT THE TOP OF THEIR LUNGS BUT…

1288
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:19,797
I can't! This is terrifying!

1289
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:21,632
You're like a huge sloth.

1290
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:23,901
-I haven't gone climbing before.
-Really?

1291
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:26,203
THEIR GOAL IS TO REACH THE TOP
IN INDOOR CLIMBING

1292
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,371
I'll give it a try.

1293
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,372
Go for it!

1294
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:33,544
SE-CHAN CLIMBS UP
WITHOUT HESITATION

1295
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,779
HE REACHES THE TOP
ON THE FIRST TRY!

1296
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:37,615
THAT'S SO COOL…

1297
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:40,351
-This is super tough.
-I'll get you a one-year membership here.

1298
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:41,919
SHE'S HOLDING ON PRETTY WELL

1299
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:43,354
(OH NO…)

1300
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,155
WILL JANGDOBARI BE ABLE

1301
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:47,458
TO CLIMB TO THE TOP?

1302
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:48,726
AND…

1303
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,260
SE-CHAN'S HEARTFELT WORDS
TO DO-YEON

1304
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:54,164
You brought out and helped me relive
the emotions and memories

1305
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:57,401
I had forgotten about.

1306
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,636
I loved it.

1307
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:00,371
Se-chan, you.

1308
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:02,906
-This is for you.
-What's this?

1309
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,308
Hold on. Let me calm my nerves.

1310
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:07,111
This Gucci gift is for you.

1311
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:08,212
No way.

1312
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:10,347
WHAT'S THIS GIFT FROM DO-YEON

1313
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:12,483
THAT MAKES SENSE?

1314
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:15,386
-Until…
-That day comes!

1315
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:17,454
