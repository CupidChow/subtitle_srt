1
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:05,839
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

2
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:13,313
Hello. Bound for a breezy break
with bundles of stories in my bag.

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,714
I'm Jang Do-yeon
of Getaway and Go with Jangdobari.

4
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:16,549
I'm sure you're all familiar

5
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:18,351
with where I'm standing right now.

6
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,987
This is the capital city of Korea,

7
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:22,155
Seoul!

8
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:23,423
THE CAPITAL OF KOREA, SEOUL

9
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:25,959
THE HEART OF KOREA
WHERE TRADITION AND MODERNITY COEXIST

10
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,328
A VAST METROPOLIS
HOME TO 10 MILLION PEOPLE

11
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:30,363
TODAY'S DESTINATION, SEOUL

12
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,066
WHAT WILL WE ENJOY IN SEOUL TODAY?

13
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:35,602
Of all the districts,
we're in Yongsan-gu today.

14
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:37,704
And here in Yongsan, this is Ichon-dong.

15
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,572
It's the place I call home.

16
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:43,676
The sky suddenly cleared up here
in the park,

17
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:45,912
but it was pouring just a moment ago.

18
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,947
How can it pour like this?

19
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:49,716
This is bad.

20
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:50,984
20 MINUTES AGO, IT WAS POURING NONSTOP

21
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,053
You can't even see
the 63 Building from here.

22
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:54,854
THE 63 BUILDING HIDDEN IN THE FOG

23
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:57,624
We were blessed by the weather fairy,

24
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:00,126
who wished us good weather
for filming today.

25
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:03,863
It's time to meet my travel buddy
for today in Seoul.

26
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,066
I've gone on a blind date with him,

27
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:07,600
dated him,

28
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:09,869
and even married him.

29
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:12,072
However, we haven't been on many trips.

30
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,040
CACKLING

31
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:17,077
He's a friend
with the most charming pink gums.

32
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:18,078
Can you guess

33
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:20,046
who this person is?

34
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:25,885
TODAY'S TRAVEL BUDDY HAS ALL HIS CHARM
PACKED IN THE LOWER HALF OF HIS FACE

35
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,288
I'm sorry for picking these,

36
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:30,824
but won't this seem romantic?

37
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,392
PUTTING TOGETHER A ROMANTIC GIFT

38
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,762
The friend with bright pink gums

39
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:39,165
will join me on a trip down memory lane.

40
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:43,069
That being said, we'll be revisiting
a lot of our past today.

41
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,672
HE'S 20M AWAY

42
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:47,006
SHE SEES HIM

43
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,477
Wait. I should stay turned around.

44
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,213
I wonder what he'll be wearing.

45
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,782
As for me, I'm in my finest clothes.

46
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,951
Aren't my pants too short?

47
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:01,054
My travel buddy will probably think
they're disgustingly long.

48
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,455
What do I do?

49
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:05,291
Jang Do-yeon,

50
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,227
don't be nervous.

51
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,761
You've got this.

52
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,434
-My heart is about to burst--
-Do-yeon!

53
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,202
Do-yeon!

54
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,403
Se-chan!

55
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:19,272
Stay there. I'll come to you.

56
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,208
-But how?
-These puddles aren't enough to stop me.

57
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,611
HOPPING OVER

58
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,946
LEAPING TOWARD DO-YEON WITH A BRIGHT SMILE

59
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,314
What on earth is this?

60
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:29,749
I found them along the way.

61
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,384
It definitely looks like something
you found on the way here.

62
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,619
I plucked a whole bunch.

63
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:33,820
There you go.

64
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,054
Thanks, Se-chan.

65
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:35,955
GIGGLING

66
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:37,690
YANG SE-CHAN
COMEDIAN

67
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:40,627
A COMEDIAN WHO PARTNERED WITH DO-YEON
FOR MANY SKETCHES

68
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:42,495
-What do I do?
-Do-yeon!

69
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:46,633
PLAYING THE ROLE OF A BLIND DATE
WHO HAS NEVER HAD A GIRLFRIEND BEFORE

70
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:49,769
THEIR PERFECT CHEMISTRY FILLS THE ROOM
WITH LAUGHTER AND EXCITEMENT

71
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,872
We've done so many sketches together

72
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,007
that it's second nature to me.

73
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:55,008
You've lived life to the fullest.

74
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:57,343
I keep cherishing all those memories.

75
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:00,513
I'm the one who definitely knows

76
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,749
what you like and don't like.

77
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:04,684
-Right.
-I know your preferences.

78
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:09,622
A FRIENDSHIP BUILT ON DETERMINATION
AND LOVE FOR COMEDY

79
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:12,025
HER COMEDIAN PARTNER
WITH MIND-READING CHEMISTRY

80
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:14,761
-Goodness.
-Goodness, Do-yeon.

81
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:17,030
It's good to see you.

82
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,565
-Look at you.
-I'm finally here.

83
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,400
You're finally
on Getaway and Go with Jangdobari.

84
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:21,367
I heard this was the third season.

85
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,770
That's right.
You opened the doors to season three

86
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:26,506
-as wide as your gums.
-Like this.

87
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:29,409
-Anyway--
-Do you normally wear

88
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:30,610
this much makeup?

89
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,579
I wanted to look good for you, that's all.

90
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,047
(A BIG SMILE)

91
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:35,748
I asked for as much makeup as possible.

92
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:36,716
Nicely done.

93
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:38,985
I asked for heavy makeup at the salon.

94
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,054
You could probably scrape the foundation
right off my face.

95
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,189
-Scrape, scrape.
-What was that?

96
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,524
I'll scrape it off your face.

97
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,025
-Goodness.
-Anyway,

98
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:48,995
-our trip today follows a specific theme.
-Which is?

99
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,197
-A theme customized for the travel buddy.
-I see.

100
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,032
What do you think we came up with for you?

101
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,867
-For me?
-Yes.

102
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:58,204
What I'd love to do with you
is go down memory lane.

103
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:01,708
Wouldn't it be fun to revisit the places
where we made memories?

104
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,643
-That's correct.
-Is that it?

105
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,845
-Should I have gone with a twist?
-It's fine.

106
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,447
Could you give us another option?

107
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:08,514
-Another option?
-Yes.

108
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,617
Just so you know,

109
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,752
I didn't grow up with much.

110
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,387
So going on a luxury yacht…

111
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,055
-A yacht?
-Yes.

112
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:18,091
I wouldn't mind an energetic trip.

113
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:20,126
Fun and excitement are wonderful,

114
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,762
but in the end, we live for our memories.

115
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,398
We'll be revisiting the memories
we shared in Sangam-dong.

116
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,500
Are we walking around Sangam-dong today?

117
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:31,537
We'll be reminiscing about the past
while staying in the present,

118
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,539
so it won't put people off too much.

119
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:34,440
Sounds good.

120
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,175
We'll be goofing around, right?

121
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:37,076
-That's right.
-Good.

122
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,278
That's all there is to it.

123
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:39,612
We'll be having fun like that.

124
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:40,613
-So--
-Do-yeon,

125
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,148
do you go on trips often?

126
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:45,885
I bet it already feels weird.

127
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,288
Doesn't it feel strange
for it to sound so scripted?

128
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:49,856
You were mumbling near the end.

129
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:51,924
The only trip I went with you
was to Jeju Island.

130
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:54,994
We went there with Seong-min,
and one of the writers.

131
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,329
I'm good at going along on trips.

132
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:57,730
That's how I am too.

133
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,665
That's great.

134
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:01,000
Anyway, here's where we're going first.

135
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,336
-As you know, we're in Ichon-dong.
-Sure.

136
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,171
-So…
-Wait. Hold on.

137
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,239
Are we going to your place?

138
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,573
-Stop it.
-Okay.

139
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,608
Not with all these cameras.

140
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,610
Let's have some ramyeon again, Do-yeon.

141
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:12,845
Would you like to come in for ramyeon?

142
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:16,282
Now I've lost my appetite. Ew!

143
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,518
Today, we're hanging out
in your neighborhood.

144
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,019
I'm taking you
to a tasty local restaurant.

145
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:23,423
I get delivery from this place
all the time.

146
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,224
We're having tteokbokki.

147
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,827
-From where?
-Smile Ichon Tteokbokki.

148
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,429
I like tteokbokki…

149
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,496
Hey!

150
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,131
Isn't Smile Tteokbokki so delicious?

151
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,000
-Smile Tteokbokki?
-In Ichon-dong.

152
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,635
I've seen it but never tried it.

153
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,805
-Why haven't you tried it? You're nuts!
-Smile Tteokbokki?

154
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:42,041
How can you live in Ichon-dong
and not have tried Smile Tteokbokki?

155
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,276
It's Smile Ichon Tteokbokki.

156
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,844
Oh! I know where it is.

157
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:46,746
Isn't it the place DinDin loved as a kid?

158
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,314
It is. It was DinDin's favorite,

159
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,116
-but now it's mine.
-Really?

160
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,751
Is it your favorite place to eat?

161
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,087
Let's go!

162
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:56,456
You're killing me.

163
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:01,060
Rumor has it that you've become
quite the hipster these days.

164
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,829
-Says who?
-The show's staff.

165
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:05,198
The staff interviewed me before the show

166
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:07,533
and asked what I like
and what I've been up to lately.

167
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,436
I told them I was into wine
and things like that,

168
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:11,971
and they were impressed

169
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,673
by my classy hobby.

170
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,475
"What was that? Wine?"

171
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,509
"Wine?"

172
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,378
-"Wine?"
-They were also surprised to hear

173
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:19,545
I went to cafés too.

174
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,848
Café with good vibes. "With good vibes?"

175
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:25,051
I guess that's why
everyone keeps calling me a hipster.

176
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,920
-After we eat, we'll go down memory lane.
-Sounds good.

177
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,922
-I have it covered, so don't worry.
-I love it.

178
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,190
There are some aspiring athletes.

179
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:32,959
-Hi.
-Hi!

180
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,293
She's Jangdobari.

181
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,396
Be healthy.

182
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:37,964
I don't think they know me.

183
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,198
She's Jangdobari.

184
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:40,133
Stop it.

185
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,235
Want to see a show, little ones?

186
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,070
Jangdobari!

187
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,272
-That was embarrassing.
-Bye.

188
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,173
Don't think like that.

189
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,074
What if I see them again?

190
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,743
-That's how it is these days.
-Should I approach them?

191
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,745
-You need to approach them first.
-Okay.

192
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,514
You should throw that away.

193
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,450
How can I, when it was a gift from you?

194
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,386
I'll dry them and keep them at my place.

195
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:01,621
Make a bookmark.

196
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:04,524
I can't throw away
this precious foxtail grass.

197
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,993
I can't believe

198
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,828
-I'm out on a date with you.
-Jeez.

199
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:10,196
~ CHIVALRY ~

200
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:11,531
Hop in.

201
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,301
I won't see you off. Take care!

202
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,803
I'll be in touch.

203
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:19,038
She's wasted,
so please take her home safely.

204
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,073
Ichon-dong, please.

205
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,576
-Jeez.
-It's good to meet you.

206
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,445
-That's hilarious.
-We're off.

207
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:30,483
EPISODE 1
TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE

208
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,151
Isn't there something

209
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:35,021
-you always agree to do on each trip?
-That's right.

210
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,222
-We need a rule.
-Yes, a rule.

211
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,291
What would be good?

212
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,059
What's the usual rule?

213
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,429
When I first traveled with Byun Yo-han,

214
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:44,530
we agreed not to feel awkward.

215
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,566
Avoid making the other person
feel uncomfortable.

216
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,633
Had you just met?

217
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,002
We'd only done one show before this one.

218
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,971
Most people I meet here are new to me.

219
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,941
-Still, we make it work.
-Of course.

220
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,543
The show is fascinating in a way.

221
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,313
-Yet, we always part ways as good friends.
-Really?

222
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,815
I'd expect that
after spending the whole day together.

223
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,818
Then there was Um Tae-goo.

224
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,520
He was like, "I'm down with everything."

225
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,555
"I'm good with it all."

226
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:11,257
"It's all good."

227
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,026
It's hilarious because
you don't sound like him at all.

228
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:15,761
-So…
-I see.

229
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,363
Even with Tae-goo…

230
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,632
Most of the people I meet are new to me.

231
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,201
You made those kinds of rules

232
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:26,005
-with people you'd never met before.
-That's right.

233
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,607
So what should our rule be?

234
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,142
Ours? If you think about it,

235
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,311
we've known each other for a long time.

236
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:34,914
We've done many comedy sketches together,

237
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:39,051
and there's always something serious
between us as well.

238
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,953
-That being said, our rule…
-Yes?

239
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,089
…is not to fall for each other.

240
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:46,259
DON'T FALL FOR EACH OTHER

241
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:47,727
LAUGHING

242
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:49,962
Don't give them the look

243
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,632
of someone who's fallen for them,

244
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,967
and don't seem nervous

245
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,669
like you suddenly…

246
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:59,138
-I love it.
-…have a crush.

247
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,706
Don't let it show in your eyes.

248
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:01,974
-Like…
-"What?"

249
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,810
-Don't fall in love.
-Okay, got it.

250
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,112
-Just don't.
-Got it.

251
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,547
No googly eyes.

252
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:08,781
-That's right.
-Got it.

253
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,951
-Just know, I'll keep on trying.
-How so?

254
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:15,354
I'll keep showing you
that I'm a charming person.

255
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,790
-Remember how I got you flowers earlier?
-You'll be chivalrous?

256
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,125
You mean, the foxtail grass?

257
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:21,227
I also opened the door for you.
Sick, wasn't it?

258
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,229
He just called himself sick.

259
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,531
-I thought he meant something else.
-It was a sick move,

260
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:28,200
and I'll keep it going throughout the day.

261
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:29,735
-Subtly?
-That's right.

262
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:31,571
-Got it. Me too.
-I'll be chivalrous.

263
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:32,939
I like how you danced

264
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:34,073
in front of the kids earlier.

265
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,575
-Jangdobari!
-You liked that?

266
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,143
-That was charming.
-Got it.

267
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:38,811
You want me to show you my charms.

268
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,313
I don't mind you being charming,

269
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,914
-but--
-It's hot in here.

270
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:44,550
RESISTING GOOGLY EYES

271
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:46,118
COLLAPSING

272
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:47,687
Do-yeon, jeez.

273
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,422
That was unexpected.

274
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:50,590
That was out of the blue.

275
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,091
I loved it.

276
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,926
You were showing your neck
and your jawline.

277
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,662
Chapter One,
Show Your Neck and Your Jawline.

278
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,832
If I had long hair, I would've tied it up,

279
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,200
but mine's too short.

280
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,501
It's too short.

281
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,270
-Of course.
-It's too short.

282
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,172
Normally, you would've flipped
your hair back.

283
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:07,506
You're killing me.

284
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,175
A for effort.

285
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,443
I almost fell for it.

286
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,545
If you had long hair,

287
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,881
I might've asked the driver to pull over.

288
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,084
Luckily, you've got short hair.

289
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,685
That saved you.

290
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,721
That was close.
We're off to a close start.

291
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,888
Thank my short hair.

292
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:23,956
That was close.

293
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,358
I laughed so hard my stomach hurts.

294
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:26,626
THANK GOODNESS SHE HAS SHORT HAIR

295
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,427
-This feels odd.
-How so?

296
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:29,929
I'm filming in my own neighborhood.

297
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,131
-That makes sense.
-It's a strange feeling.

298
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,367
It's an old neighborhood,

299
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:35,735
so many of the residents are seniors.

300
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:36,902
That's why I love it here.

301
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,772
Itaewon definitely has a younger crowd.

302
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,709
You've gotten hipper
since moving to Itaewon.

303
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:46,278
-I've always been quick with trends.
-That's true.

304
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,881
-So true.
-I make sure to be careful though,

305
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,050
just in case I run into Park Na-rae.

306
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:52,785
I'M WORRIED…
I MIGHT RUN INTO PARK NA-RAE

307
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:55,121
My place is really close to Na-rae's,

308
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:57,356
but I've never run into her.

309
00:10:58,257 --> 00:10:59,659
I don't leave the house much.

310
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:00,626
What do you do at home?

311
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,896
I just chill on the couch
watching YouTube.

312
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,231
-Which videos?
-All of them.

313
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,366
What time do you wake up on your day off?

314
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,901
Around 7 a.m.

315
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,303
-That's early.
-I get up around 7 to 8 a.m.

316
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,605
You get up early.

317
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,674
Right away, I turn on the TV.

318
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,343
I watch YouTube videos nonstop.

319
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,911
Let's say I saw a clip of some show.

320
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:22,648
I then watch other clips
related to that show.

321
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,751
After deciding what to eat,
I order my lunch.

322
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,753
I keep watching YouTube videos.

323
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,355
I let videos take me to other videos.

324
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,524
Then, I order some coffee.

325
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,059
-Do you drink coffee?
-Yes.

326
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,161
After ordering my coffee and dessert,

327
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:36,529
I enjoy them

328
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:38,531
after finding a fun video
to watch on YouTube.

329
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:40,099
-Sure.
-Then, it's time for dinner.

330
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:43,069
-I order something to eat.
-You order in again

331
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:44,470
-and then watch YouTube.
-Yes.

332
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,605
I usually spend about ten hours on it.

333
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:48,841
That's all I watch.

334
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:51,310
Then you must be up to date on the trends.

335
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,845
-Not really.
-Or maybe not.

336
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,647
Do you only watch recommended videos?

337
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,614
I watch clips from past shows.

338
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:56,849
As in what?

339
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,217
Radio Star,

340
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,553
Infinite Challenge, 2 Days & 1 Night,

341
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,388
Running Man, and even Comedy Big League.

342
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,123
I watch everything and anything.

343
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,928
-That place serves great food too.
-Really?

344
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:10,629
The market has lots of great food stalls.

345
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:11,997
You have no idea.

346
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,099
Thank you.

347
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:15,234
THEY ARRIVE
AT DO-YEON'S FAVORITE TTEOKBOKKI PLACE

348
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:17,570
We're at…

349
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,071
It feels weird to do this

350
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,573
-in my own neighborhood.
-It's okay.

351
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,475
-Let me do the work.
-I'm good.

352
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,477
-Hello, there.
-No, don't.

353
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:27,179
Here's Jangdobari, your friendly neighbor.

354
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,781
I was here before as well.

355
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:30,750
Hello.

356
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:31,717
It's an honor.

357
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:32,952
-Gosh, no.
-You're too kind.

358
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,887
I've ordered from this place a lot.

359
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,689
We'll show you how well we can eat.

360
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,190
-It's an honor.
-You're too kind.

361
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,493
It feels weird being here with makeup on.

362
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,061
Wait.

363
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:43,729
Se-chan!

364
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:44,997
Wait. Stand up for a second.

365
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,200
-I'll sit the way a lady would.
-Sure.

366
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,169
There you go.

367
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:51,637
(HE FINALLY SEES IT)

368
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,241
It freaked me out
to see this already on our table.

369
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,376
This is scary!

370
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,844
This foxtail grass

371
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,746
-is one of us today.
-Really?

372
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,148
Someone told me this place

373
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,116
-has the DinDin combo.
-What's that?

374
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,085
There's something he always has.

375
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,887
-Isn't it the ugly dumpling?
-That's the one.

376
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,355
The ugly dumpling.

377
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:11,590
-We'll have two boiled eggs.
-Of course.

378
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,692
-And gimmari.
-Gimmari, for sure.

379
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,161
Yaki dumplings are delicious too.

380
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:16,929
-With all that--
-Don't forget squid fritters.

381
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,497
Yes, of course,

382
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:19,965
but sweet potato fritters are to die for.

383
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:21,267
Shrimp fritters too.

384
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,401
The fish cake here is also good.

385
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,636
Let's have two of those.

386
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:24,703
Aren't you ordering sundae?

387
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,272
-With steamed offal?
-Love it.

388
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,373
That's 12 items.

389
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:28,574
It's fine. What else?

390
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:32,511
I won't order this
since we're focusing on the tteokbokki,

391
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,513
-but do you know what's good here?
-What is it?

392
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,615
-The vegetable gimbap.
-Gimbap? Got it.

393
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,017
-We won't have that today.
-Why not?

394
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,151
Can you eat it all?

395
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,854
-Do they have ramyeon? I want that too.
-You want one?

396
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,056
My combo doesn't include ramyeon.

397
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:44,957
What?

398
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,692
But…

399
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,495
-I come for tteokbokki and fritters.
-I enjoyed the ramyeon,

400
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,096
and said I'd come back for it.

401
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,264
Let's have some, then.

402
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,465
I haven't had that here before.

403
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:54,934
-Really?
-Which one?

404
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,268
The original.

405
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,369
Order a roll of gimbap too.

406
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:58,437
Vegetable gimbap is the best here.

407
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,672
I'll order all 14 items.

408
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:00,606
Drinks?

409
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,609
Are you sure you can eat all of this?

410
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,611
I'll show you how well I can eat.

411
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,179
This will be the Heebab combo.

412
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,148
-Do-yeon, I have this.
-What's that?

413
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,282
A credit card in my name.

414
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:13,052
-I see.
-So don't think about paying for anything.

415
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:13,953
Come on.

416
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,155
Please don't let Do-yeon
pay for anything today.

417
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,356
I'll be treating her.

418
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,091
LAUGHING

419
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,626
-Then please have a lot.
-Sorry?

420
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,194
We'll eat a reasonable amount.

421
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:23,195
LAUGHING

422
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,097
I'll have a Welch's.

423
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,799
Nice. Can you finish a whole can?

424
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,400
I can't stand people
not finishing their drinks.

425
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,102
-Can you drink it all?
-I can.

426
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,337
-Really?
-Yes.

427
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:32,705
Of course, I can finish a whole can.

428
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:34,773
-It's quite large.
-Who cares?

429
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,741
-Really?
-Yes.

430
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,943
-I'll stick to just water for now.
-Sure.

431
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,612
I'm not being cheap.

432
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,213
It's just in case
you can't finish your soda.

433
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,748
-Se-chan, come on.
-That's not it.

434
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:43,983
You know me, don't you?

435
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,417
-I'll order all 15 items.
-Sure.

436
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:46,619
Done.

437
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,354
-I thought I had to pay.
-Not yet.

438
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,457
I'll show you what I'm made of.

439
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,159
Leave me to buy you coffee as well.

440
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,327
Really?

441
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:56,996
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

442
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,932
Do you want the fritters
mixed into the sauce like last time?

443
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,034
Let's ask Do-yeon,
since that's how DinDin likes them.

444
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,969
-I don't like them mixed.
-Sure thing.

445
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:05,571
Thank you.

446
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,506
I didn't get this when I came with DinDin.

447
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,241
Their fish cake is amazing.

448
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:10,542
I'll give it a try.

449
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,447
YUMMY

450
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:16,749
(GOOD, RIGHT?)

451
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:18,684
What was that?

452
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,919
-It's good.
-Right?

453
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:21,320
What did I tell you?

454
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:22,488
These are thicker

455
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:23,923
than the usual square fish cakes.

456
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,557
I don't like mushy fish cakes, you know.

457
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,559
Really? These aren't mushy at all.

458
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,529
I'll try some without soy sauce first.

459
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,298
Gosh, have you tried the broth?

460
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:33,365
-Did you drink last night?
-It's really good.

461
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,400
I didn't.

462
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,801
Actually, I did.

463
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,171
Just knowing I'd see you today

464
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:40,339
-put me in a good mood…
-Good for you.

465
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,541
-…so I had a can of beer.
-Thank you.

466
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,576
DinDin didn't order this
even though it's so good.

467
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,078
-Unbelievable.
-He must not like fish cakes.

468
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,146
Really?

469
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:48,380
The owner knows.

470
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,017
It's really good.

471
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,253
-It's good.
-It really is.

472
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,188
Try the gimbap. It's incredible.

473
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,158
-It smells great.
-I know.

474
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,192
The seaweed tastes really good.

475
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,027
I think they use high-quality seaweed.

476
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:04,730
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

477
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:05,998
These shouldn't come mixed in the sauce.

478
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,034
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

479
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:12,771
CHEWY FLOUR-BASED RICE CAKES
WITH THICK SAUCE

480
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,407
2 BOILED EGGS THEY ALSO ORDERED

481
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,214
He sliced these for us.

482
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,315
Shouldn't they be sliced?

483
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,351
I'm grateful he sliced them for us.

484
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:26,251
Hold on.

485
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:27,586
GENTLY

486
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:30,255
There.

487
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,124
A MAGIC POCKET THAT HOLDS ANYTHING

488
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,525
RUBBING

489
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,030
What's wrong?

490
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,264
Did you bite your tongue?

491
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,900
-What happened?
-That didn't work.

492
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:43,869
Do you eat here,
or do you just get delivery?

493
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:48,173
Before I lived here, I stopped by
a couple of times to get some to go.

494
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,908
I don't usually order tteokbokki at home.

495
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,010
Don't you like it?

496
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:52,244
I do,

497
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:53,712
but I rarely have it delivered.

498
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:54,847
I only have it on shows.

499
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,248
What do you usually order in?

500
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:57,349
Kebab,

501
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,817
-taco--
-Living in Itaewon

502
00:16:58,884 --> 00:16:59,852
got you hooked on exotic food.

503
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:02,221
I eat them more often
than Turkish people do.

504
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,123
I'm not kidding.

505
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,557
It's true.

506
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,226
You have no idea how often I eat them.

507
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,861
Do you know what surprised me?

508
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:11,430
The food was actually delivered
by a Turkish person.

509
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,298
It's the truth.

510
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,566
The food tasted--

511
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:15,834
-When you ordered from the app?
-Yes!

512
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:16,802
That's what happened.

513
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,537
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

514
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:19,438
THE RAMYEON SE-CHAN WANTED

515
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:20,939
This is the kimchi my mother made.

516
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,374
Did your mother make this?

517
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,710
-Thank you.
-Please enjoy.

518
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:25,844
That kebab I had…

519
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:27,446
-Was it delicious?
-Yes.

520
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:30,883
The food impressed me so much
that I order kebab whenever I can.

521
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,484
Are there any good restaurants?

522
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,786
There's a ton, Do-yeon.

523
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,154
Kebab and burritos.

524
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:38,390
-The same place would deliver to my place.
-Of course.

525
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:39,858
Give me the name of one later.

526
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:40,926
Got it.

527
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:41,994
This is for you.

528
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,698
-Don't say the rest is yours.
-Come on.

529
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,500
I would've if this were a skit.

530
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,902
-Thanks.
-Look at my good manners.

531
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:50,936
How sweet of you.

532
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:51,937
I gave you a lot.

533
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,072
You're not usually--

534
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:54,073
I wouldn't do this.

535
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,508
Nicely said.

536
00:17:58,811 --> 00:17:59,645
I'm never like this.

537
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:01,280
The ramyeon here is good.

538
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:04,817
BOWING TO ONE ANOTHER
WHILE SLURPING NOODLES

539
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:06,351
Hey, it's good.

540
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,687
-Isn't it good?
-It's really good.

541
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,789
TRYING THE KIMCHI MADE
BY THE OWNER'S MOTHER

542
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,059
-The kimchi's incredible.
-Is it good?

543
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:15,928
This reminded me of my mom.

544
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:17,963
My mom's kimchi isn't as good as this.

545
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:19,598
Seriously.

546
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:22,234
Still, this reminded me of my mom.

547
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:23,802
It's very refreshing.

548
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:25,537
No way.

549
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,705
I'm glad we ordered this.

550
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:27,673
-Right?
-Yes.

551
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:30,342
Do you eat anything
right after you wake up?

552
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,477
On my days off,

553
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:32,911
after I wake up,

554
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:34,580
I walk along the Han River.

555
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,882
-On an empty stomach?
-Yes.

556
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,450
After a cardio session at home.

557
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:39,985
-Sure.
-I ride an indoor bike.

558
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,153
-And?
-Then I walk along the river.

559
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,055
On my way back from the walk,

560
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,256
I stop by a truck that sells corn.

561
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:45,624
-A truck selling corn?
-Yes.

562
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,459
I buy some and eat that at home.

563
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:48,460
I see.

564
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:50,462
Back in the day,

565
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:51,797
that's what my grandma used to do.

566
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,032
After waking up with a groan,

567
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,401
she went for a walk outside.

568
00:18:56,468 --> 00:19:00,405
On her way back,
she bought corn or other vegetables.

569
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,008
She'd eat them,
and you reminded me of that.

570
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:05,077
That's great. You're staying healthy.

571
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,578
Se-chan, please.

572
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:08,313
Stay in touch, will you?

573
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,648
Sorry about that.

574
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,283
Do you know what's funny about you?

575
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,951
Why are you always late to answer texts?

576
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:14,386
You must not check your phone often.

577
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:15,454
I don't.

578
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,356
Then what do you do with your phone?

579
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:18,690
Do you go online?

580
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,225
Not really.

581
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,360
I don't go online often.

582
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:22,728
I use my phone

583
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,997
to call my parents,

584
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,065
and to read the script
my manager sends me.

585
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:29,067
This is how it is when I reach out to you.

586
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:30,235
I'd text you to ask how you're doing,

587
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:31,937
and about three or four hours later…

588
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,305
I don't get to it often.
It's always on vibrate.

589
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:34,473
She replies, "I'm good."

590
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,874
I'd text, "I'll sort it out as so."

591
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,342
It'll then take her ages to reply.

592
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,278
I was frustrated a lot of the time.

593
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,345
-Really?
-Yes.

594
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:41,747
We didn't text often, but still.

595
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,782
I see I frustrated you a bit.

596
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,918
I'm the type to look at my phone all day.

597
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:49,421
Whatever I do, I like to see it finished.

598
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,924
Let's say I texted you
and asked how you were.

599
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,358
That'd be my main focus.

600
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,561
I need to wrap up the conversation
to be able

601
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:56,895
to put my phone down.

602
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:58,897
-Sorry about that.
-It's fine.

603
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,399
This is how we get
to know each other more.

604
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,968
-Sure.
-I thought you were ghosting me.

605
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:03,969
No way.

606
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,004
You should tell people that.

607
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,439
-They might get the wrong idea.
-Doesn't this look like my tongue?

608
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:09,308
Tease-ya.

609
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,309
What's this?

610
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,410
Are you asking for a kiss?

611
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:14,279
Kissing in the middle of the day?

612
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:15,747
That's been a while.

613
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:18,850
Please close your eyes.

614
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,386
Right here, right now,

615
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,922
Jangdobari and I are going to smooch.

616
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:25,724
TURNING AWAY

617
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,160
Can you please close your eyes?
Sorry about this.

618
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,495
You're killing me!

619
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,768
I'm so glad to have you here.

620
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,370
Do-yeon,

621
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,072
do you know why we're lucky?

622
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:42,641
Because of all the comedy sketches
we've done,

623
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,344
people love watching whatever we do.

624
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:47,179
What's wrong?

625
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,747
-I thought there was a strand of hair.
-There isn't.

626
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:49,881
-Do-yeon--
-Can you check?

627
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,250
GIGGLING

628
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:52,251
Hold on.

629
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,219
You should get a necklace today.

630
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:55,487
YOU SHOULD GET A NECKLACE TODAY

631
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:56,688
That's what you're missing.

632
00:20:58,223 --> 00:20:59,124
Come here.

633
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,093
LAUGHING

634
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,064
Sir, please close your eyes.

635
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:08,433
I'm gifting her this grass necklace.

636
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,337
Hold on a second.

637
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:13,705
Wait, it snapped.

638
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,774
My heart is racing.

639
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,510
He's putting a necklace around my neck.

640
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:19,878
Can you lower your chin?

641
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:23,915
I'm almost done.

642
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:27,019
Just a second.

643
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:29,187
Done.

644
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:32,758
You look so stylish.

645
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,461
I love the grass necklace.

646
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,066
My stomach hurts.

647
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,001
This is choking me.

648
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,436
HE GAVE HER A GRASS NECKLACE

649
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:47,072
Isn't this the first meal
we're having today?

650
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,574
-Will we also grab some desserts?
-Of course.

651
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,776
Do you like desserts?

652
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,778
-I love desserts.
-I'd die for it.

653
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:57,516
I mean it.

654
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:58,617
What's your favorite?

655
00:21:58,684 --> 00:21:59,785
I love a good tiramisu.

656
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:04,356
Remember the loser character
I used to play?

657
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,191
On top of that, I don't drink coffee.

658
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:07,492
How long has it been?

659
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,261
-Coffee keeps you awake…
-Exactly.

660
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,495
…so I decided to quit it.

661
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:11,563
When everyone had coffee,

662
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,666
I said I quit caffeinated drinks
because they kept me awake at night.

663
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,069
Then, I dug into a bowl of tiramisu.

664
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:18,036
I had a lot.

665
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:18,937
You idiot!

666
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,138
I couldn't sleep.

667
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:23,141
I was shocked that I had
to quit eating cakes as well.

668
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:24,876
You idiot.

669
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:27,846
Then I got to see how tiramisu was made.

670
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,247
The sheet is dunked in espresso!

671
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:32,517
I finally figured out
what kept me up at night.

672
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:35,854
There's a reason
I chose to portray a dumb loser.

673
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:38,123
-You're killing me.
-I still eat tiramisu though.

674
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,359
-Really?
-Not often, just sometimes.

675
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:41,793
I always choose decaf.

676
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,062
Really? I heard decaf
is actually worse for you.

677
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,997
I spend a lot of time on YouTube, so--

678
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:48,266
Haven't you been picking up
false news and stuff?

679
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,768
Come on, Do-yeon.

680
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:51,770
The guy talks while looking decent
in a proper suit.

681
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:52,804
A suit?

682
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,674
Just because he wears a suit?

683
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,576
-Why wouldn't I believe him…
-You moron.

684
00:22:57,642 --> 00:22:59,311
…when he's wearing a suit?

685
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,314
When coffee beans are roasted,
they release cancer-causing agents

686
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,915
and other bad things.

687
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:06,218
But we take those roasted beans,
grind them,

688
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:07,786
and brew hot espresso from them.

689
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:08,854
To make coffee decaf,

690
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,790
something is added
before the beans are roasted.

691
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,158
What do I do, then?

692
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,227
It's better to have a lighter Americano.

693
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:17,329
Have just half a shot of espresso.

694
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,398
Did you just shove a whole egg in?

695
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:21,833
-That--
-It's more delicious this way.

696
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,568
Really? I cut it up first.

697
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:25,470
I cut it up.

698
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,672
I love boiled eggs.

699
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,842
I agree, but I don't boil these at home.
Do you?

700
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,043
I go to my mom's

701
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,845
at least once a week.

702
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,280
-My mom…
-You're a sweet daughter.

703
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,215
…boils 12 to 14 eggs at a time for me.

704
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:38,850
Is that your dinner?

705
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,118
No, it's my snack.

706
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:41,586
You snack on 12 boiled eggs?

707
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:43,388
Of course not. I have two a day.

708
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:44,423
Two a day?

709
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:45,724
-Two a day?
-Yes.

710
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,292
-Two a day is fine.
-That's okay.

711
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,627
The doctor said so too.

712
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:50,028
-Does he also wear a suit?
-Yes.

713
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,297
He wears a white robe over his suit.

714
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:55,367
He said that eating

715
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,203
too many fried eggs a day
is actually bad for your health.

716
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:00,839
-Boiled eggs are fine.
-Yes, they're fine.

717
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:01,740
But not fried eggs.

718
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:04,476
I see. Maybe it's because
they're cooked in oil.

719
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,445
But you can cook them in olive oil.

720
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:09,781
Did you know a spoonful of olive oil a day
on an empty stomach is healthy?

721
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:11,950
Yes, but that depends on the olive oil.

722
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:13,985
-Stop watching YouTube videos.
-That's not it.

723
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:16,922
It depends on the olive oil.

724
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:19,491
-Should it be good?
-It can't be just any kind.

725
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,259
There's a percentage you must check.

726
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:22,828
Don't you think you watch
too much YouTube?

727
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:24,262
As someone in this line of work,

728
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:26,198
-this feels like studying to me.
-We should know this.

729
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:27,666
I monitor my shows, movies, and…

730
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:29,000
Of course.

731
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:31,036
You need to know stuff
to join in on conversations.

732
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:32,370
I eventually told myself

733
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:33,705
it's okay to watch them,

734
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,407
so that's what I do.

735
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,075
The nice thing about our job is that

736
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,944
we can call
watching variety shows studying.

737
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:39,845
It applies to everything.

738
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:41,446
-Truly.
-We need to know these things.

739
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:42,781
Yes, exactly.

740
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:44,082
It's the best job ever.

741
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,650
I drank it all.

742
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:47,185
I told you I could.

743
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:50,121
I've never seen a woman
empty a can this big before.

744
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:51,990
You're amazing.

745
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:53,792
This is charming.

746
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,927
Nice.

747
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,128
They normally can't drink it all.

748
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,331
How charming of you.

749
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:00,398
Would you like another?

750
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:01,399
No, get one for yourself.

751
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:02,501
-I'm good.
-How so?

752
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:04,169
-I don't want a soda.
-Why not?

753
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,271
Did the guy in the suit tell you
not to drink soda?

754
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,074
Soda is the worst thing you can drink.

755
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,709
Soda and carbonated water.

756
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:12,777
-Even that's bad for you.
-Really? How so?

757
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,813
-It's not sweet.
-When you burp

758
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,415
after drinking soda,

759
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:19,384
your body only makes you feel relieved.

760
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:23,088
You're just releasing gas,
not actually feeling relieved.

761
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:26,157
The doctors said
people are wrong about that.

762
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:27,859
You're a health nut.

763
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,361
We should be one at this age.

764
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:30,762
-Do you get checkups?
-Of course.

765
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:31,696
Every year.

766
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:33,064
Once a year?

767
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:34,833
I even got a CT scan of my brain recently.

768
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,669
-It's not bad to get one done at our age.
-You think?

769
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:39,738
Still, don't go overboard.

770
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:41,339
Don't get treated when you're not sick.

771
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:44,376
Those tests expose you to radiation…

772
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:46,912
-Radiation?
-…even if it's a tiny amount.

773
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:49,180
We get lung scans, right?

774
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:50,415
That also exposes us
to a little radiation.

775
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:51,650
Aren't you watching too much YouTube?

776
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,752
We get dental X-rays, right?

777
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:54,719
That too.

778
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,722
However, it can't be enough to kill you.

779
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:03,228
That tiny amount of radiation
can't kill anyone.

780
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:04,396
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF RADIATION EXPOSURE
FROM TESTS?

781
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:05,630
So I heard.

782
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:06,932
I shouldn't be scared.

783
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:08,266
But it's fun.

784
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,801
-Do you mean checkups?
-Yes, they're fun.

785
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,503
I'm scared they might find something.

786
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,471
It's fun to see what they'll catch.

787
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:16,207
-We should think that way.
-"I caught you early, you jerk."

788
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:17,242
That's way better.

789
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:18,209
It's better

790
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:21,346
to catch the illness early
than to let it get worse.

791
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:25,483
I never thought the two of us
would end up talking about our health.

792
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:28,687
-We can't help it.
-It just comes naturally.

793
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:34,292
EATING NONSTOP AT HER FAVORITE RESTAURANT

794
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:37,629
Do you want the sweet potatoes?

795
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,064
-No, go ahead.
-Thanks.

796
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,467
Did you eat this much
when you went out with other guests?

797
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,769
I'm just asking.

798
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:46,605
-Why?
-I'm just asking.

799
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:49,374
Did they just sit there? How were they?

800
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,443
-We talked.
-Really?

801
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,912
I know you're a big eater,
so go ahead and dig in.

802
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:56,314
I prefer to eat a little here
and have more somewhere else.

803
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:57,549
Sure.

804
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,784
-Do you have late-night snacks?
-Not really.

805
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:01,319
What time do you stop eating?

806
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:04,022
If I have work the next day,

807
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:06,124
-I stop eating around 9 p.m.
-Around 9 p.m.?

808
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:07,258
That's still too late.

809
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:08,693
Cut back.

810
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,497
But it's usually past 8 p.m.
by the time I get home and wash up.

811
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:13,798
You only have a small window.

812
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:15,500
There's nothing you can do, then.

813
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:16,935
What time do you stop eating?

814
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,269
If I don't have to work,

815
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:19,371
I only eat until 6 p.m.

816
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,474
I didn't expect people to be in awe.

817
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,742
You take really good care of yourself.

818
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,443
I don't eat anything late at night.

819
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,544
Really?

820
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:28,947
Let's say we have to work late

821
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:30,148
and end up having drinks.

822
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,717
-I just go along with it.
-Of course.

823
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:34,953
However, when I'm at home and not working,

824
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,621
I stop eating at six.

825
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:38,256
I eat a lot when I'm home.

826
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,358
I rarely eat.

827
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,527
I don't eat much when I'm out.

828
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:43,995
Well…

829
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:46,564
I'm familiar with this side of you,
so it's all good.

830
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:47,966
Dig in.

831
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:51,236
I don't usually eat much when I go out,
but I'm being weird today.

832
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:55,140
These days, when I'm drunk,
I often go get ice cream on sale.

833
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:56,708
-A whole lot costs under 10,000 won.
-Do-yeon.

834
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:59,310
Ice cream is the worst kind of sugar
you can have.

835
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:00,311
I'm serious.

836
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:01,546
I mean it.

837
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:02,647
Will I die soon?

838
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:04,849
-Am I going to die soon?
-It's true.

839
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:06,551
Ice cream?

840
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:09,487
Even the people
who create new flavors at Baskin Robbins

841
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:10,655
don't eat ice cream.

842
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:12,557
FEELING WRONGED

843
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:14,426
Can you check the facts on that?

844
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:15,493
Please do so.

845
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,828
-Even they--
-It'd be funny if you were wrong.

846
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,296
I think I got at least half of it right.

847
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,900
Anyway, even the flavor developers
don't eat ice cream.

848
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:23,735
-Really?
-They don't eat it.

849
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,804
You won't be able to
if you see how it's made.

850
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:27,839
I eat ice cream too,

851
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,075
but I don't eat a tub of ice cream
like you do every day.

852
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:31,543
I don't eat a whole tub.

853
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,178
Either way,
don't do things like that anymore.

854
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:35,947
Don't make a habit
of eating ice cream after drinking.

855
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:37,949
It's bad for you.

856
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,351
Don't you burp a little too often
for a health nut?

857
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:41,920
The gas inside should be released.

858
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,222
If you hold the gas in,

859
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:45,490
your stomach will burst.

860
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,758
Don't hold in your farts.

861
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:48,426
Aren't I right? See?

862
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:51,296
Is it Baskin Robbins or Häagen-Dazs?

863
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,231
-Really?
-Baskin Robbins, right? Sure.

864
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:55,066
-See?
-But it's tasty.

865
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,202
Even YouTube videos are worth watching.

866
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,871
Of course. A lot of them
offer useful information.

867
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,973
Why shouldn't we believe guys in suits?

868
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,509
What kind of videos
are recommended for you?

869
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,511
-Health-related videos?
-Yes, that.

870
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,746
A lot of them are by doctors.

871
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:12,283
Old comedy shows are recommended as well

872
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,885
like Humor No. 1.

873
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,186
They're a lot of fun.

874
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,354
Of course they are.

875
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:19,724
When Mr. Bae Sam-ryong passed away,

876
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:22,894
comedians from all over Korea
came to his funeral.

877
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:24,295
I still remember that.

878
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:25,630
I was really young then,

879
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:28,666
and there wasn't even room for us
to sit in the funeral home.

880
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:32,604
Rookie comedians like us,
who were in our early 20s,

881
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,372
had to stand outside like this

882
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,307
and greet our seniors as they went in.

883
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:38,176
-They didn't even know who we were.
-Exactly.

884
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:41,946
The comedians I grew up watching on TV
went in one by one

885
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:43,782
to pay their respects.

886
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:45,884
Don't get me started
on their level of pranks and jokes.

887
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,318
-My gosh.
-I know.

888
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:48,553
They weren't messing around.

889
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,821
How funny is it

890
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:53,391
to see my senior get smacked in the head
by his senior?

891
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,393
That's hilarious.

892
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,895
Even at their age,

893
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,030
-they're still pranksters.
-Absolutely.

894
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,266
I love it.

895
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:04,636
A lot of fun things happened at funerals.

896
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:07,238
When my dad passed away ten years ago,

897
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:10,074
many people came by
to offer their condolences.

898
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,776
-Of course.
-I was so grateful.

899
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:14,179
Either you told me this
or your brother did.

900
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:15,947
Wait, who was it again?

901
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:17,415
It was a senior comedian at MBC.

902
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,817
-Was it Wan-gi?
-Yes, Wan-gi.

903
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:20,685
The story I heard about Wan-gi was

904
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:22,620
the funniest funeral anecdote
I'd ever heard.

905
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:24,522
Wan-gi was like this.

906
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:29,160
Let's say the flower offering area
was here at the funeral home.

907
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:30,295
My stomach hurts from laughing.

908
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:32,230
Wan-gi came in.

909
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:35,033
The flowers are laid out
next to where you put them,

910
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:37,902
-and the flooring was linoleum.
-That's right.

911
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,571
Wan-gi knelt,

912
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:41,239
slid forward to the flower area,

913
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:44,342
and offered his flower to my father.

914
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:45,877
Se-hyung and I

915
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:47,445
couldn't believe what we saw.

916
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,514
-He was this close to the photo.
-Like this.

917
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:53,151
How was he even able
to slide all the way there?

918
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:54,819
I remember it clearly.

919
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:57,455
I bet this is what Wan-gi
probably had in mind.

920
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:00,625
HIS PLAN WAS TO BOW
AFTER EXPRESSING HIS CONDOLENCES

921
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,160
-He was then going to bow.
-Of course.

922
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:03,928
He must've tripped on his own feet.

923
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:04,829
After greeting us…

924
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:07,799
PAYING HIS RESPECTS A LITTLE TOO CLOSE

925
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,868
I'll never forget that.

926
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:11,803
That was the funniest funeral story
I ever heard.

927
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,304
You had to see it yourself.

928
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:15,373
I can't forget that slide.

929
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,277
Here's what I'm grateful for
about our fellow comedians,

930
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,980
and what makes me proud.

931
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,248
If your head's down

932
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:25,049
and someone just asks if you're all right,

933
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:26,451
it only makes the grief worse.

934
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:29,020
Isn't it great to have someone

935
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:30,255
who can take your mind off it?

936
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:31,656
Here's something we did.

937
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,992
We took turns showcasing our talents.

938
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,394
Hold on. I think we did that
at my dad's funeral.

939
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,263
I remember everyone sitting in a circle

940
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:40,131
and having to show a talent.

941
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:41,699
I said I didn't have anything to show.

942
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:43,368
-You did the crab!
-That's right!

943
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:45,470
That was at my dad's funeral.
Se-hyung told you

944
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:48,506
our father loved blue crabs

945
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,309
and asked you to do a performance,
which you did.

946
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:53,411
I think Na-rae danced like a snake
or something.

947
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:54,779
That's how we comfort each other.

948
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:55,813
Exactly.

949
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,715
-Jeez.
-I laughed so hard.

950
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:58,716
I'll go home now.

951
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:00,952
Come on. You can't.

952
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:03,388
-There's a second course.
-Are we getting coffee?

953
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:04,522
-Yes.
-I'd love that.

954
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,758
-There's something you should know.
-What is it?

955
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:08,826
It's run by Um Tae-goo's friend.

956
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:09,794
Really?

957
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:12,630
I know a really good place, although
what they do is slightly different.

958
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:15,233
He recommended five places in total.

959
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,334
Cheongpa Chaekgado.

960
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:18,836
Cheongpa-dong? I go there often.

961
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:19,971
That place…

962
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:22,307
-You said they have good croffles.
-It's run by my friend.

963
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,575
PROMOTING A FRIEND'S CAFÉ

964
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:25,810
A good friend of mine.

965
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:26,778
Is the coffee good?

966
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:29,814
-If so, that's okay.
-They do insanely good croffles.

967
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:31,215
"The coffee and desserts are incredible."

968
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,785
That's not it.
This is what he sounds like.

969
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:34,786
"It's really good."

970
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:36,187
IT'S REALLY GOOD

971
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:38,856
"Do-yeon."

972
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,259
"Well, it's really delicious."

973
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:44,362
I kept mimicking him on our trip

974
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:47,398
and asked if I'd offended him in any way.

975
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,767
He said, "You don't sound the same,
so it's fine."

976
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:53,404
That's why I keep doing it.

977
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:54,672
I'd love to meet him.

978
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:56,341
He's so charming

979
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:57,375
and cute.

980
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:58,910
I adore guys like him.

981
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,745
Let's call him later.
Do you have his number?

982
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:02,747
You don't?

983
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:05,883
-Tae-goo--
-His friend's the café owner.

984
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,285
-Of course!
-We'll get him to call.

985
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:08,953
Nice. Let's just get his number.

986
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,854
Sure.

987
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:11,255
We'll call him.

988
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,857
I've been wanting to.

989
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,692
Let's keep doing impressions of him.

990
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,027
Hello.

991
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:17,729
I'm Um Tae-goo.

992
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,431
Was I making fun of him just now?

993
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,100
-I'm sorry, Tae-goo.
-Stop it.

994
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,134
He has a temper too.

995
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:24,202
We want people to laugh.

996
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:26,804
When we do voice impressions,

997
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:29,841
it's funnier if we poke fun
at the person a bit.

998
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:31,743
And everything should be exaggerated.

999
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:33,811
Shall we stop eating now?

1000
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:36,447
I don't eat a lot when I'm out.

1001
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,715
You'll stop eating now,

1002
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:40,251
and have coffee and desserts at the café.

1003
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:42,153
I enjoyed everything. Let's go.

1004
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,554
-Don't forget your camera.
-Of course.

1005
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:45,023
Let's leave this here.

1006
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:46,290
Sounds good.

1007
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,526
My friend, thanks for the hard work.

1008
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:50,028
You did great.

1009
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:51,429
Sir, I'll get the check, please.

1010
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,298
Se-chan, is this your treat?

1011
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,300
Jangdobari, I've got it covered today.

1012
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,336
LAUGHING

1013
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:00,104
Thank you.

1014
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:01,973
THANKS FOR THE GREAT MEAL!

1015
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:03,574
No way.

1016
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:05,376
Check out the beautiful sky.

1017
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:08,713
We're off to Tokyo.
Do you know a good place to eat?

1018
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,915
-Who are you going with? Yi Ok-seon?
-No.

1019
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:12,650
-Actually, it's Ok-seop…
-Is it?

1020
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:13,618
…and we already went on our trip.

1021
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,920
-I'll be traveling with Lee Jun-young.
-Jun-young?

1022
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:17,522
-Do you know him?
-Wait. On this show?

1023
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,758
We've met twice.

1024
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:21,793
Still.

1025
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:24,028
-He's good at dancing…
-Really?

1026
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:26,130
-…singing, and acting.
-That's amazing.

1027
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:27,665
What do you do in Tokyo?

1028
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:28,699
I go shopping.

1029
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:29,600
For clothes?

1030
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,169
-Yes, I buy a lot of them.
-Where?

1031
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,737
I just go to every shop I can.

1032
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:34,806
I go to vintage clothing shops too,

1033
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:36,607
but mainly to look, not buy.

1034
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:37,909
Why do you go there, then?

1035
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:39,010
To get the vibe.

1036
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,211
THE VIBE

1037
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:42,947
I only look at the clothes.

1038
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:44,282
What kind of vibe?

1039
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:45,583
If I try on a necklace,

1040
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,251
it might possess me with an evil spirit.

1041
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:49,420
THAT'S ABSURD

1042
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:50,555
-You get it, right?
-You have trust issues.

1043
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:53,157
Right. Here's how I am with wallets.

1044
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:55,526
When a wallet feels lucky
and helps me get more work and money,

1045
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:56,928
I keep it for about three years.

1046
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:59,230
If I feel like it's losing its juice,

1047
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:01,766
I throw it away and buy a new one.

1048
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,634
I try to get energy from it instead.

1049
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:06,304
How do you feel about your current wallet?

1050
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:09,040
I've had it for less than a year,

1051
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,241
and money's been draining away.

1052
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:12,944
This is one I'll be throwing out
at the end of the year.

1053
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,078
-Really?
-Yes.

1054
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:15,813
The last one I had was the best.

1055
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,714
Why did you throw it out?

1056
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,649
One of the things I live by

1057
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:19,784
is "Don't be complacent."

1058
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:22,553
I want to keep making changes in my life.

1059
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,789
-Even if it brings you luck?
-Even if it's good,

1060
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:28,359
what I get next could be even better.

1061
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:30,862
That's why I keep things moving
in my life.

1062
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:31,996
But this time, I drew the short straw.

1063
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:34,765
All the weddings and kids' birthdays.

1064
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:35,666
It's been no joke.

1065
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:36,868
MONEY'S BEEN POURING OUT OF THIS WALLET

1066
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:40,071
It was supposed to be a year
of spending money,

1067
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,539
but I've been blaming my wallet.

1068
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:44,509
"You're the reason
I haven't been making money."

1069
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:46,944
More accurately, I've been bleeding money.

1070
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:48,246
I've been spending a lot lately.

1071
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,915
Swapping out items is like hitting
the refresh button.

1072
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,683
-Exactly.
-It gives you a fresh mindset.

1073
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:53,818
I can relate.

1074
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,453
Thank you.

1075
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,587
Thank you.

1076
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:58,956
CHEONGPA CHAEKGADO

1077
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:00,191
-Chaekgado?
-Yes.

1078
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:04,328
The owner lent this space
for an independent

1079
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:05,730
film shoot.

1080
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:07,765
Really? What a pretty door. Hello.

1081
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:08,900
Hello.

1082
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:10,701
I see it's a quiet place.

1083
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:11,903
A TRANQUIL WOOD-TONED SPACE
WITH KOREAN AESTHETIC ELEMENTS

1084
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:16,040
GREEN LIGHT STREAMS THROUGH THE WINDOW

1085
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,409
Is this where Um Tae-goo comes often?

1086
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:19,744
Yes, he comes by now and then.

1087
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,879
-I see. Are you Tae-goo's friend?
-No.

1088
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:24,048
He's friends with my husband.

1089
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,550
THE OWNER'S HUSBAND
IS UM TAE-GOO'S FRIEND

1090
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:26,584
Where do we order?

1091
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:28,119
-In our seats or here?
-Please take a seat.

1092
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,554
-I see.
-I'll come to you.

1093
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:30,788
No way.

1094
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:33,257
Do-yeon.

1095
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:34,992
A FAMILIAR FRIEND IS ALREADY HERE

1096
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:38,462
This scares me.

1097
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,397
It kind of is scary.

1098
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:40,531
This will haunt me in my sleep.

1099
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,934
Let us serve you some welcome tea first.

1100
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,169
Do we get welcome tea
even though we haven't ordered?

1101
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,804
That's cool.

1102
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:47,772
That's so nice.

1103
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:49,373
This is cold-brewed oolong tea.

1104
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,675
Wow.

1105
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:52,076
What a pretty cup.

1106
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:53,110
Here's the menu.

1107
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:54,745
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1108
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:56,781
Here's our seasonal blend coffee.

1109
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:59,917
I roast and blend the beans myself.

1110
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:01,919
The latte options are listed
at the bottom.

1111
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,821
I'm ordering the Um Tae-goo latte.

1112
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:04,822
What's the Tae-goo latte?

1113
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,224
Here, the homemade vanilla bean latte.

1114
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,592
Vanilla bean latte? That sounds great.

1115
00:37:07,658 --> 00:37:09,060
There are nine options to choose from.

1116
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:10,428
There's a lot.

1117
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:12,964
I see you serve paste jelly.

1118
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:15,199
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1119
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,535
The café has such a nice vibe.

1120
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:18,769
There's something healthy
about this place.

1121
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:19,670
SIPPING THE WELCOME TEA FIRST

1122
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,205
-This place is amazing.
-Whoa!

1123
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:23,007
WELCOME TEA WITH LIGHT, CLEAN FLAVORS

1124
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,575
-It's nice.
-This is light.

1125
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:26,544
-What are you having?
-Me?

1126
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:28,412
I'll have the vanilla bean latte.

1127
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:30,681
I'll try the black sesame cream latte.

1128
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,550
Pick the paste jelly you want.
Do you like paste jelly?

1129
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:33,551
-I love it.
-Really?

1130
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:35,786
That's great to hear.
I'm crazy about paste jelly.

1131
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:37,555
-Really?
-How about whole red beans?

1132
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:38,456
That sounds good.

1133
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:40,758
-Whole chestnut red bean paste jelly.
-Okay, that.

1134
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:42,560
Yuzu-hallabong sounds good.

1135
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:44,595
One whole chestnut, one yuzu, and…

1136
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:45,930
I want the mugwort latte one.

1137
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:46,897
-Mugwort?
-Yes.

1138
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:48,299
I'll also have…

1139
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:49,433
What else do people like?

1140
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:51,168
Black sesame is quite popular.

1141
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:52,603
We'll have that too.

1142
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,238
That's four, right?

1143
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:55,273
We'll have those.

1144
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:58,276
Could you go easy on the syrup
for the vanilla bean latte?

1145
00:37:58,342 --> 00:37:59,577
-Less syrup?
-How many pumps do you add?

1146
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:01,445
Ours isn't overly sweet.

1147
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:04,682
Then I'll have it the way
Um Tae-goo likes it.

1148
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:06,050
He'll have it the Um Tae-goo way.

1149
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,218
DESSERTS AND DRINKS ORDERED

1150
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,287
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1151
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:11,188
-This is cool.
-What a charming place.

1152
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:14,025
I've been in love
with green tones like this.

1153
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:14,925
I see.

1154
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:16,227
I hear that happens with age.

1155
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,129
-I kind of agree.
-I wasn't aware of it,

1156
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:19,997
but you grow to like flowers,

1157
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:22,300
-and anything that's green.
-Yes, the color green.

1158
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:23,868
It's become my favorite color.

1159
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:25,202
Do you run?

1160
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:29,340
Though not often,
I sometimes run at Mount Nam.

1161
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:32,209
I run about 3 km there,
then lift weights at home.

1162
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:33,811
Weight training has been working for me.

1163
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,079
Weight training?

1164
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,048
-Like working the muscles?
-Yes, with dumbbells.

1165
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:39,183
-Do you work out with dumbbells?
-Of course.

1166
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:41,686
-Are your arms huge?
-Not really.

1167
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:43,754
If you touch them,
you'll notice they're firm.

1168
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,623
OH? OH!

1169
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,024
LET ME SEE

1170
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:49,860
Right?

1171
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:51,429
Although they feel firm,

1172
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,931
-you'd probably laugh if you saw them.
-How so?

1173
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,466
They're not toned

1174
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:56,467
or defined.

1175
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:57,935
I just have a little muscle there.

1176
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,303
Don't you also work out?

1177
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,538
This is what I do.

1178
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:02,273
-Cycling?
-Yes.

1179
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,641
Don't you lift weights?

1180
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,643
-I should probably start lifting.
-I bet you can't do any push-ups.

1181
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:06,944
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

1182
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,446
Show me from plank position.

1183
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:11,148
I bet you can't do any.

1184
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:12,850
-What if I can?
-How about a wager?

1185
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:14,652
-How many?
-If you're able

1186
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,987
to do three or more push-ups,

1187
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:18,356
I'll give you a million won.

1188
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:19,256
-That's too much.
-If you can't,

1189
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:21,258
give me 10,000 won.

1190
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:22,626
That doesn't seem right.

1191
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:23,928
I just feel like you can't do any.

1192
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:27,131
-Do-yeon, look here.
-I'll play for 50,000 won.

1193
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,899
This doesn't count.

1194
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:30,901
Let's say you started off like this.

1195
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:32,570
GROANING

1196
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:33,871
This doesn't count.

1197
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:35,373
Do-yeon, look.

1198
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,841
-Start me off.
-Go.

1199
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:39,176
One.

1200
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:40,444
Two.

1201
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:41,912
Do three like that,
and I'll give you a million won.

1202
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:43,547
If you can't, you'll give me 10,000 won.

1203
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:44,749
Give me 50,000 won if I succeed.

1204
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:45,750
I feel like I can do this.

1205
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:47,918
Did you say 50,000 won?
I'll wire it to you on the spot.

1206
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:50,388
Since it's 50,000 won,
I only get 5,000 won if I win.

1207
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:51,288
Sure.

1208
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:53,290
-Get into plank position.
-I can do push-ups.

1209
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:54,225
Get into plank position.

1210
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:57,094
You keep underestimating me.

1211
00:39:58,429 --> 00:39:59,530
Go.

1212
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,799
CRUMBLING INSTANTLY

1213
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:03,134
Give it another try.

1214
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,502
See? I told you.

1215
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:05,936
Push-ups aren't easy.

1216
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:07,605
-Unbelievable.
-And go.

1217
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:08,773
One.

1218
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:10,074
FLAT ON THE FLOOR

1219
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:12,109
HUMILIATED

1220
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,412
-You haven't done these before, have you?
-These aren't easy.

1221
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:15,946
I bet you're good at sit-ups though.

1222
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:17,248
I'm good at those.

1223
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:19,817
-Do you want me to hold you?
-Yes.

1224
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:21,552
I'm really good at this.

1225
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:22,586
SUDDENLY LYING DOWN AT A CAFÉ

1226
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:25,122
All right. Wait, should we be
doing this at a café?

1227
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:26,457
It's fine.

1228
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:28,325
-This is Tae-goo's friend's place.
-Of course. Go ahead.

1229
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:29,226
And go.

1230
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:31,662
One. You're good at this.

1231
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:34,165
Two. I doubt you can do ten.

1232
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:37,435
10? SHE'S KNOCKED OUT AFTER 2.5

1233
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:39,537
-Do-yeon.
-This is bad.

1234
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:40,838
You need to work out more.

1235
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:42,973
-I bet you can't do pull-ups either.
-Oh, no.

1236
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,041
I can't for the life of me.

1237
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,476
Sit-ups really shocked me just now.

1238
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:46,811
I was good at those as a kid.

1239
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:48,546
That's because

1240
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,182
all you do is move your legs
sitting like this.

1241
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:53,884
You're just putting strain on your knees.

1242
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:55,186
-Your joints--
-My knees?

1243
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:57,421
You're straining your joints

1244
00:40:57,488 --> 00:41:00,291
and wearing them out
because that's the only area you work.

1245
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:02,092
IS THAT SO?

1246
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,794
LAUGHING

1247
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:06,664
You confidently asked for 50,000 won
if you won,

1248
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,099
and for a second, I thought

1249
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:10,568
I was going to lose.

1250
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:11,969
I should do strength training.

1251
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:14,104
-You should.
-I really should.

1252
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:15,639
Our drinks are here.

1253
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:16,974
-Wow.
-No way.

1254
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:18,843
Look how pretty they are.

1255
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:21,512
-That must be black sesame latte.
-These are pretty.

1256
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,581
-Look how pretty that is.
-No way.

1257
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:26,050
Have the cream first, then mix it
all together for the best taste.

1258
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,751
Should she have the bottom first?

1259
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:28,652
No, the cream.

1260
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:30,020
-Here.
-Oh, from the top.

1261
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:32,089
I almost had it the other way around.

1262
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,791
I thought you should have
the bottom layer first.

1263
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:35,259
How do I drink this? Any way I want?

1264
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,560
Yes, have it any way you want.

1265
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:38,429
THE OWNER HAS A DRY WIT

1266
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,864
Thank you.

1267
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,265
I wonder what this is for.

1268
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,399
You should probably stir with that.

1269
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:43,567
What about this?

1270
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:44,902
-You shouldn't eat that.
-Is this cinnamon?

1271
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:46,203
That's a cinnamon stick,

1272
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,472
and it'll add more aroma
the longer you keep it in.

1273
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:49,373
CINNAMON STICK THAT ADDS AROMA

1274
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,908
Goodness.

1275
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:52,176
-That's gold.
-How pretty is that?

1276
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:53,410
Is that gold?

1277
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:54,945
REAL GOLD FLAKES

1278
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:57,114
This must be the jelly spoon.

1279
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,583
-No, that's…
-Is it a muddler?

1280
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:01,685
How do we eat these, then?

1281
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,020
-With this?
-With this.

1282
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:04,088
They're stunning.

1283
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:05,990
These paste jellies are beautiful.

1284
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:07,725
No wonder Tae-goo was proud of this place.

1285
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:09,360
He hasn't tried the jelly.

1286
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:12,796
OH… I SEE

1287
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,031
Things are rocky today.

1288
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:15,165
I know.

1289
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:16,133
I love it.

1290
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,301
Look how cute this is.

1291
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,969
This must be the yuzu flavored one.

1292
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:19,904
This is yuzu,

1293
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,239
this is the original red bean,
this is the black sesame,

1294
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:24,475
-and this is hallabong.
-No, the mugwort.

1295
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:25,743
No way.

1296
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:27,278
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1297
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:28,612
They all have gold flakes on them.

1298
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,648
YUZU-HALLABONG PASTE JELLY

1299
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:34,585
WHOLE CHESTNUT RED BEAN PASTE JELLY

1300
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:38,656
MUGWORT LATTE PASTE JELLY

1301
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:43,260
BLACK SESAME PASTE JELLY

1302
00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:48,032
BLACK SESAME CREAM LATTE

1303
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:56,740
HOMEMADE VANILLA BEAN LATTE

1304
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:59,977
This is Tae-goo's favorite.

1305
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:04,348
-I see. It's good.
-Is it good?

1306
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,816
Tae-goo must enjoy sweet beverages.

1307
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:07,184
-Is it sweet?
-It is.

1308
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:09,753
WHAT ABOUT THE BLACK SESAME CREAM LATTE?

1309
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,622
-My gosh!
-Is it that good?

1310
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:13,223
No way!

1311
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:15,893
-Did you know this?
-Hey. Know what?

1312
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,561
You overreact to small things.

1313
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:19,496
I'm like that.

1314
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:21,265
So what?

1315
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:23,334
I doubt it's really that good.

1316
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,535
Not worthy of a scream.

1317
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,502
I bet it's just nice.

1318
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:27,271
-It's awesome. Would you like a sip?
-Is it the best?

1319
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:28,672
It's porridge, not cream.

1320
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:29,673
Rich and thick.

1321
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:30,774
It's like porridge.

1322
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:32,009
JUST HOW GOOD IS IT…

1323
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:33,777
SCOWLING

1324
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,312
Bitter, isn't it?

1325
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:36,213
What…

1326
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,715
What's wrong?

1327
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,316
GUESS IT'S NOT TO SE-CHAN'S TASTE

1328
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:41,785
-It's topped with cream.
-What's wrong?

1329
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,587
It's very thick.

1330
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:44,555
It's super thick.

1331
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,090
-It's like rice porridge.
-I know.

1332
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:47,725
-You're not kidding.
-Right?

1333
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,893
It's really good, and I love black sesame.

1334
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,062
-Really?
-Why does this taste salty?

1335
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,230
There's salt.

1336
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,264
Is there salt?

1337
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,735
-What else besides salt can taste salty?
-Right.

1338
00:43:58,602 --> 00:43:59,937
It'd be weird if it were sugar.

1339
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:02,773
A BITE OF THE CHESTNUT RED BEAN JELLY
HE'D BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO

1340
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,642
-No way.
-Is it good?

1341
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:06,744
I like how it's not too sweet.

1342
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,779
WHAT DOES THE PASTE JELLY LOVER THINK?

1343
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:10,180
The chestnut tastes incredible.

1344
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:11,248
It's really good.

1345
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,250
I just love chestnuts.

1346
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,852
Eating too many chestnuts is bad for you.

1347
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,021
Okay, here's why.

1348
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:19,890
Chestnuts can cause constipation.

1349
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:21,692
-Really?
-Yes.

1350
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:23,927
There's a limit
to how much you should eat.

1351
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,062
How many are we allowed to have?

1352
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:26,096
I don't know.

1353
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,799
-What?
-I don't know. Please look it up.

1354
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:30,601
Your knowledge is as short
as short videos.

1355
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,337
I've only learned
what the doctors have told me.

1356
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:34,738
As in the experts?

1357
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:37,074
-Those in robes?
-A doctor in a suit said

1358
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:38,375
too many chestnuts are bad for you.

1359
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,412
You shouldn't eat a lot of almonds either.

1360
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:42,312
Do they also make you constipated?

1361
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:45,049
You'll end up having too much

1362
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:46,817
of what's inside.

1363
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:49,987
That's why we shouldn't eat
too many of the peanuts

1364
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:51,355
they serve as free snacks.

1365
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:53,290
Just have what they give you at first.

1366
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:56,226
This is delicious.

1367
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:57,828
-The black sesame.
-Really?

1368
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:00,130
What was this again?

1369
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,298
That's mugwort latte.

1370
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,966
I can smell the mugwort toward the end.

1371
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,168
Oh, no.

1372
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:05,669
-What is it?
-My taste buds are like a granny's.

1373
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:07,404
These are the flavors I enjoy.

1374
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:09,373
It's so good.

1375
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,041
Hold on.

1376
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:12,409
-No way.
-Doesn't it smell incredible?

1377
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:13,577
The scent is strong.

1378
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:17,247
I prefer the original.

1379
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:18,148
This one?

1380
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:21,952
-There are chunks of yuzu.
-Right.

1381
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:24,421
Do you think Tae-goo comes here alone?

1382
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:25,856
This is when we should call him.

1383
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:27,558
We should ask if he comes here alone.

1384
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:29,860
Ma'am, does Tae-goo come here alone?

1385
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:31,161
Yes.

1386
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,696
Does he live nearby?

1387
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:34,164
I don't know where he lives.

1388
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,065
I see.

1389
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:38,736
Do you perhaps know his number?

1390
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:40,771
Yes, I do.

1391
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:41,839
Do you?

1392
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:44,041
Please

1393
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:45,876
don't get the wrong idea, but we're close.

1394
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:47,377
We just don't have his number.

1395
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:48,612
Even though we're close.

1396
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:50,280
We're not trying to mess with you.

1397
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:51,849
We're not exactly close.

1398
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:54,485
SHE HAS HIS NUMBER
EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT CLOSE

1399
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:55,619
Wait, we didn't order that.

1400
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,955
PASTE JELLY ON THE HOUSE

1401
00:45:58,021 --> 00:45:59,656
There's no reason for us to say no.

1402
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:02,826
Isn't this the chocolate jelly?

1403
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:04,061
Oh, that.

1404
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:05,262
I wanted to try this.

1405
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:08,165
PAVÉ GANACHE CHOCOLATE PASTE JELLY

1406
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:11,235
Could we perhaps talk to him on the phone?

1407
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:12,302
Could you give us his number?

1408
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:14,104
-Do you just need his number?
-Yes.

1409
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:15,706
Call him on your phone.

1410
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,808
My heart's racing.

1411
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:22,179
-What?
-I almost spit out my drink.

1412
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,481
HERE'S HIS NUMBER…

1413
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:26,383
I have a feeling

1414
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:27,918
he won't pick up.

1415
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:28,986
Don't think that. "Hello."

1416
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:30,053
Is this rude?

1417
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:31,522
He'll pick up.

1418
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:32,623
I'll call him.

1419
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:34,057
FINALLY, THEY CALL TAE-GOO ON THE PHONE

1420
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,093
HEARING HIS VOICE AGAIN AFTER A LONG TIME…

1421
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,795
Do-yeon, hi.

1422
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:39,229
MAKING THEM LAUGH WITH JUST A HELLO

1423
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,064
Do you know who Yang Se-chan is?

1424
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,666
I don't. Just kidding.

1425
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:44,301
I DON'T… JUST KIDDING

1426
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:45,936
What name did you save her number under?

1427
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:48,472
It's…

1428
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:50,474
WHAT NAME
DID HE SAVE HER NUMBER UNDER?

1429
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:53,377
A member of Stray Kids
appeared on Salon Drip.

1430
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:54,778
I know. I even have his number.

1431
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:56,513
Really? Call him.

1432
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:58,315
-Hi, Se-chan.
-Hey.

1433
00:46:58,382 --> 00:46:59,850
AN UNEXPECTED PHONE CALL
THAT FELT LIKE A GIFT

1434
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:01,185
SE-CHAN'S GOAL FOR NEXT YEAR?

1435
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:02,586
Jang Do-yeon and Yang Se-chan.

1436
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,655
Jang Do-yeon and Yang Se-hyung.
Park Na-rae and me. Na-Rae and Se-hyung.

1437
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:05,989
I'll try to get the four of us together.

1438
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:08,425
That's hilarious.

1439
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,393
A REUNION OF THE LEGENDARY GROUP?

1440
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:11,094
-Should I do this?
-Hold on.

1441
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,596
I should go lower.

1442
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:13,497
Here.

1443
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:14,832
WHY ARE THEY SUDDENLY BUSY?

1444
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:15,732
This is it.

1445
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:16,700
Is it?

1446
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:17,601
Hold on.

1447
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:19,102
-Freeze.
-Just look at me!

1448
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,871
We were on Comedy Big League together,

1449
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:22,472
so it's not a stretch for us
to take wedding photos.

1450
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,107
This totally makes sense.

1451
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,008
Here we go.

1452
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,177
SE-CHAN AND HIS SIGNATURE PINK GUMS

1453
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:29,046
DO-YEON IS SLIGHTLY TALLER

1454
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:30,948
A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN

1455
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,050
There's no woman like Jang Do-yeon.

1456
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:34,551
Oh, please.

1457
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:36,854
What's with you?

1458
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,822
Our chemistry was the best
in the early days.

1459
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:40,123
DO-YEON AND SE-CHAN'S SECOND TRIP DOWN
MEMORY LANE THAT ACTUALLY "MAKES SENSE"

1460
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,692
In the end, nothing else mattered.

1461
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:42,759
