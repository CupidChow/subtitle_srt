1
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,839
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,676
Is this real? I can't believe it.

3
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:12,846
It's such a wonderful day. Look behind me.

4
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:17,217
CLEAR SKIES AND A SEA OF BLUE SPREAD OUT

5
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:19,786
I'm heading into the shoot now.

6
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:21,654
Ready and action.

7
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,091
TODAY'S DESTINATION

8
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:26,593
WANDO, JEOLLANAM-DO

9
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:31,331
WHAT KIND OF JOURNEY AWAITS
ON THE HEALING ISLAND OF WANDO?

10
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:35,635
LET'S FIND OUT NOW

11
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,839
EPISODE 4: A WORLD STAR'S PAST
MY STAGE, HERE I COME

12
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,641
Hello.

13
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,110
Bound for a break
with bundles of stories in my bag.

14
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:46,112
I'm Jang Do-yeon
of Getaway and Go with Jangdobari.

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,782
Let me show you where I am.

16
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:49,849
Take a look.

17
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:56,189
I've never had the sky fill up
three-quarters of my view before.

18
00:00:58,124 --> 00:00:59,592
It's like a painting, isn't it?

19
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,028
Can you guess where I am?

20
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,063
It's Wando.

21
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:04,464
THE HEALING ISLAND IN JEOLLANAM-DO

22
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,733
Now, why did I come all the way here?

23
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,536
It's because my travel buddy for today…

24
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:11,471
HOOOOOOOOT

25
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,808
Thanks for wishing me smooth sailing!

26
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:15,875
AWESOME TIMING

27
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:21,047
My travel buddy for today
hails from right here in Wando.

28
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:25,285
Beyond being a star in Korea,
he's now enjoying truly global fame.

29
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,153
A SUPERSTAR IN THE GLOBAL SPOTLIGHT

30
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,721
It's Wi Ha-jun!

31
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:29,622
Hello.

32
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,558
THE SEXY GUY FROM &lt;SQUID GAME&gt;

33
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:32,959
-Hi.
-Thank you for coming.

34
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:34,194
-Hello.
-Hi.

35
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,130
How did someone as busy as you
end up on our show?

36
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:38,531
I'm actually quite free.

37
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:41,768
WI HA-JUN
HE'S ACTUALLY QUITE FREE

38
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,604
CROWNED WORLD'S SEXY GUY
THANKS TO &lt;SQUID GAME&gt;

39
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:45,905
Let me see your face.

40
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,808
LOOKS AND ACTING, HE'S GOT IT ALL

41
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,712
WI HA-JUN, PROUDLY FROM WANDO

42
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,115
You're free? Are you on a hiatus?

43
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:56,649
I'm on a break from work.

44
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,251
You're on a break.

45
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:02,188
Well, if this were your typical talk show,

46
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:05,458
you might've joined us just for fun
or to promote something,

47
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,293
but this is a travel show.

48
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,964
I've been a fan of yours
and always wanted to meet you.

49
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,733
So when the offer came in,
I couldn't say no.

50
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,336
I'd always wanted to come
to my hometown and shoot something.

51
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:18,138
FUN FACT: HE IS FROM SOANDO ISLAND

52
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:21,374
So thanks for giving me the excuse
to turn it into a trip too.

53
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,777
Have you been to the Wando Tower as well?

54
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:27,013
This is my first time, thanks to you.

55
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,214
-Really?
-Yes.

56
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,550
Aren't you the promo ambassador for Wando?

57
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:31,618
That's true.

58
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:33,019
AMBASSADOR APPOINTMENT CEREMONY

59
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,355
This place was built
when I was in 11th grade,

60
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:37,824
and I moved to Seoul in my senior year.

61
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:41,361
And I'm from an island called Soando,
so even if I do come here…

62
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:42,328
You head straight home?

63
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:44,697
I haven't had a chance
to travel around Wando myself.

64
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,299
Shall we head inside, then?

65
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,567
-Sure.
-All right.

66
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,470
The sun's really strong.

67
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,405
Yes, I was worried because of the rain.

68
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:53,673
HEAVY RAIN UNTIL THE DAY BEFORE

69
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,574
Luckily--

70
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,709
-Can we enter through the entrance?
-Yes.

71
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,713
-Hello.
-Hello.

72
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,849
The elevator is this way.

73
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,785
Sorry? You can go ahead.

74
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,387
What? Who's this guy?

75
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:08,588
Who's who? Me?

76
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,657
-I'm from Soando.
-Come on, girls.

77
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:12,625
You can feel just how popular he is.

78
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:13,526
(DON'T CARE)

79
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:18,164
That was a passionate fan we just met.

80
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,233
I nearly did a triple spin.

81
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,136
Like a music box. "Who's this guy?"

82
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,873
-"Sorry?"
-Hoping she would recognize you.

83
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,474
You're very fan-friendly.

84
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,013
Wow, this tower has 17 floors.

85
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,417
17TH-FLOOR OBSERVATORY
WITH A PANORAMIC VIEW

86
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,085
This is amazing!

87
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,087
-Magnificent.
-It's insane.

88
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,957
WANDO IN FULL VIEW

89
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,559
-Those are cage culture farms.
-Where?

90
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:47,961
-Those things?
-On the water.

91
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,762
They are abalone cage farms.

92
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:53,066
-Is abalone common around here?
-Yes, Wando is famous for abalone.

93
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:56,302
-Laver, sea mustard, and kelp too.
-Because of the mild climate?

94
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,905
-Are those all islands?
-Yeah.

95
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,975
Wando-gun is made up of 265 islands.

96
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:05,044
-Really?
-Yes, including the uninhabited ones.

97
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,180
That's a lot of islands.

98
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,084
Let's move on. This observatory is huge.

99
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,486
-I heard Wando is close to Jeju.
-Here's Soando.

100
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:14,887
Here it is.

101
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:17,457
It was a center of resistance
during the Japanese colonial era.

102
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:20,059
That's why it has a memorial hall
and a monument.

103
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:21,194
I wonder where it is.

104
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,596
It must be that island over there.

105
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:24,664
AN HOUR AWAY BY BOAT

106
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,399
-On the horizon?
-Yes, that one.

107
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,835
-The view here is amazing.
-I know.

108
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:31,704
I'm glad the weather turned out nice.
I was worried.

109
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,241
-You're the promotional ambassador.
-Yes.

110
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,976
How about a quiz on Wando?

111
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:37,877
CAUGHT OFF GUARD

112
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,412
I sense disaster.

113
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:40,313
Go ahead.

114
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,381
UP TO THE CHALLENGE

115
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,915
-Cool. First question.
-Shoot.

116
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:46,286
Name five Wando islands.

117
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,622
Nohwa, Bogil, Soan, Cheongsan, Saengil.

118
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:51,324
WAIT, HE GOT IT RIGHT?

119
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:52,959
Did you memorize them just now?

120
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,193
-No way.
-You knew them?

121
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,695
Yeah, there's Geumdang too.

122
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:58,331
Onto the second question.

123
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,600
What flower represents Cheongsando?

124
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:01,601
Canola flower.

125
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:03,503
You know!

126
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,438
Cheongsando is famous for canola flowers.

127
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:06,506
-It is?
-Yes.

128
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,342
He knows his stuff.

129
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,410
Next question.

130
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,613
Which of the following
was not filmed in Wando?

131
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,814
This one's multiple choice.

132
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,582
-A.
-There's plenty.

133
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,217
-"Sopyonje."
-Okay.

134
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:20,019
B. "The Admiral."

135
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,954
C. "Spring Waltz."

136
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:23,556
D. "Emperor of the Sea."

137
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,158
Is it one of these?

138
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:26,259
The Admiral!

139
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:28,895
-The Admiral?
-The others were filmed here.

140
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:29,796
CONFIDENT

141
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:32,165
And The Admiral wasn't?
Have you seen the film?

142
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:33,066
I did.

143
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,969
I mean, everyone knows
that Sopyonje, Spring Waltz,

144
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,505
and Emperor of the Sea were shot here.

145
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:40,873
-Those are famous.
-Yeah.

146
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,743
-Actually, there was option E.
-What was it?

147
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,678
It was Squid Game.

148
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,981
SQUID GAME WAS FILMED ON SEONGAPDO ISLAND,
ONGJIN-GUN, INCHEON

149
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,717
So The Admiral was shot here.

150
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,654
-I'm so sorry.
-Some ambassador you are.

151
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,457
-It was shot here?
-I don't think you should promote Wando.

152
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,658
CREDIBILITY CRASHING FAST

153
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,694
Where in Wando did you shoot Squid Game?

154
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,162
Where was the set?

155
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:04,831
There was option E.

156
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:06,632
The answer was E, Squid Game.

157
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,901
This is what happens
when you are too hasty.

158
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,638
Would it be fair to say
you only half-watched The Admiral?

159
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,006
FIDGETING

160
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,342
-I wouldn't…
-You seem really nervous.

161
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:19,078
Anyway, The Admiral…

162
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,280
-The Admiral was shot here.
-That's right.

163
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,249
We have Mr. Seo Ha-jun here…

164
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:24,317
No, Mr. Wi…

165
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,919
Oh God, I must be mad.

166
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,588
-Please just kill me.
-Seo Ha-jun?

167
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:29,856
WHAT DID YOU JUST CALL ME?

168
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:31,691
CLENCH

169
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,426
-Wi Ha-jun!
-That's my surname.

170
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:34,594
I got it from my father.

171
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,662
I'm truly sorry.

172
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,664
Call me Namgoong Do-yeon.

173
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,901
-I'll call you Jung Do-yeon.
-My brain took a little break.

174
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:42,802
It's fine.

175
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:46,139
Whether you got the quiz right
doesn't really matter.

176
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:49,075
It was just a quick icebreaker.

177
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,209
Now,

178
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,744
let's go get some food.

179
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,781
So, how's the trip been so far?

180
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:57,917
-It feels a bit all over the map.
-You're right.

181
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,052
-And I love it.
-You do?

182
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,587
-Then shall we?
-Let's go eat.

183
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:03,256
-Great.
-Thank you.

184
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:06,592
TO THE RESTAURANT FOR LUNCH

185
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,395
-Your MBTI is ISFJ.
-It is.

186
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,964
I used to be an ISFJ.

187
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,032
EX-ISFJ
THE PROTECTOR

188
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,768
-I switched over to T a few years ago.
-Why?

189
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:18,304
-Are you affected by your work?
-I think so.

190
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,406
Has it been rough lately?

191
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:21,307
Yes.

192
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,542
DIDN'T EVEN HESITATE

193
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,776
Nah, but it's fun.

194
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:26,879
They say ISFJs are the extroverts
among the introverts.

195
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,347
-That's true.
-I'm like that.

196
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:29,882
QUASI-EXTROVERTS TRYING TO BE CHEERFUL

197
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,452
-Once you get to know them…
-Yes, they are the best.

198
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,987
That was awesome.

199
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,493
We are going to be spending
two days together, aren't we?

200
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,394
Right.

201
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,262
Anything you'd like me to keep in mind?

202
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:44,964
My last name, for starters.

203
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,032
Come on!

204
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:47,099
JUST KIDDING

205
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,001
I can't believe I did that.

206
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,103
What kind of ground rules should we set?

207
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,040
For example,
when Byun Yo-han was on the show,

208
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,943
we spoke informally
to get comfortable with each other.

209
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:01,180
But that rule worked so well,
and we actually got really close.

210
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,382
Close enough
to go to a bathhouse together.

211
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,418
That close?

212
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:10,456
How are you with younger guys
or junior coworkers?

213
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:11,791
Do you get along quickly?

214
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,760
I think it depends on the person for me.

215
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,762
Okay. Whatever's comfortable for you.

216
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,732
-You can call me Ha-jun.
-Can I really?

217
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,134
Yeah, sure. I'll call you noona.

218
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,804
If noona is too cringe,
you can call me noonim.

219
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,072
As for me,

220
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,375
even when I'm comfy with someone,
I keep using honorifics.

221
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:32,144
-I like that.
-But my tone's friendly.

222
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,813
Like, "Had lunch yet?"

223
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,815
"Hey, noona!"

224
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,416
I get it. That sounds good.

225
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:38,885
You can talk down to me.

226
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,989
-And I'll call you Ha-jun.
-Yes, please.

227
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:44,457
I really don't mind at all.

228
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,527
-I'm cool with that.
-Let's hop out. Thanks for driving us.

229
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:49,228
TWO BUDDIES ARRIVING AT THE SPOT

230
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:54,867
Here's the entrance.

231
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:58,004
GRILLED/BRAISED CUTLASSFISH
EEL DURUCHIGI, SET MEALS

232
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,072
-Hello.
-Hi.

233
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:03,943
-What would you like to eat?
-Me? Well…

234
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,445
Since we are in Wando, I want some fish.

235
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,648
-Do you like cutlassfish?
-Yes.

236
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,149
-Braised cutlassfish?
-Braised.

237
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,551
-Braised cutlassfish?
-Yes.

238
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,452
-Thank you!
-Thanks.

239
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,187
They have pomfret too?

240
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,923
-There's all kinds of fish.
-Yeah.

241
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:18,658
In Wando, it's called bengchi.

242
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,093
-Pomfret is called bengchi?
-It's a dialect word.

243
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,962
"You done ate some bengchi?"

244
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,597
Hey, you don't have an accent.

245
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,866
I'm holding it back on purpose.

246
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:27,934
Can you use it?

247
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,769
"Now that's some good eatin'!"

248
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:31,804
Do people say that?

249
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:32,805
"Good eatin'"?

250
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:34,574
You barely hear the dialect anymore.

251
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,576
-Nowadays--
-You don't say that?

252
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:39,378
"Dude, where are you?"
It's more about the accent now.

253
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:40,613
Just a little?

254
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,747
It's an exaggeration.

255
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:46,218
Yeah, I guess people used to play up
their dialect a bit for show.

256
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,387
"Dang! I'm tellin' ya! What in the…"

257
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:49,922
That's long gone now.

258
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,123
"Man, what gives?"

259
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,026
-"Sheesh! I might drop dead!"
-That one!

260
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,228
-Never.
-Good to have ya.

261
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:59,365
-Hello.
-I think I just heard a dialect!

262
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:02,101
We've been talking about dialect.

263
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,570
-Jeolla dialect is nice, you know.
-You betcha.

264
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,205
-It's friendly.
-So nice.

265
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,273
Good to have ya!

266
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,808
He's from Wando.

267
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,876
Did ya… Did ya know it, huh?

268
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,347
-That was a mess.
-I'm not sure I know him.

269
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:15,681
I'm Wando's promo ambassador.

270
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:18,451
-He's the ambassador, I tell ya.
-Are ya now?

271
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:19,352
I'm from Soando.

272
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:20,252
SNEAKY SELF-PLUG

273
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:23,456
What a boss.
He just did his thing and took his leave.

274
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,725
-All good.
-Ha-jun, go get 'em!

275
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,460
Sure. Thank you!

276
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,429
-You are famous.
-I guess.

277
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:33,499
-What kind of food do you like?
-My favorite?

278
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,434
Korean, Japanese, Chinese…

279
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:37,770
Korean, hands down.

280
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:38,838
You like Korean food.

281
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,974
This is what I'm talking about.
A proper meal with side dishes galore.

282
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,175
-I love it.
-Same.

283
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:45,144
-This is Wando-style, I tell ya.
-You betcha.

284
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,545
-We're generous.
-Yeah.

285
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,081
There are so many side dishes.

286
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,483
Twelve altogether.

287
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:54,286
-It's a 12-dish meal.
-Amazing.

288
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,288
-We haven't set the rules yet.
-Right.

289
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:57,957
It's quite tricky, isn't it?

290
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,526
It really is.
What kind of rules can we set for a trip?

291
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:01,894
You never know what will happen.

292
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,463
-Trips always come with surprises.
-Of course.

293
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,032
I'm open to any rules, but…

294
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:07,967
-I have just one request.
-Okay.

295
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:12,004
We've already planned out the whole trip.

296
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,707
-So please don't ditch us.
-All right.

297
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:18,344
You can take off your mic
and say you're feeling uncomfortable

298
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,612
or that you need a break.

299
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,913
-That's fine.
-That's fine?

300
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,549
Calling your manager to complain is okay.

301
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,285
"Why did you put me on this show?"
That's fine too.

302
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,620
-Okay.
-Just don't leave.

303
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,754
TRAVEL RULES:
NO RUNNING OFF

304
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,823
But you never know what will happen.

305
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,425
Keeping your options open?

306
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:33,726
You're scaring me.

307
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:34,627
JUST KIDDING

308
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,528
Just don't leave.

309
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:37,129
You can zone out. Just don't go.

310
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,364
-No matter what.
-Okay.

311
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:41,267
That's all I'm asking.
The rest is up to you.

312
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,235
-What is your rule?
-My rule?

313
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,538
THINKING

314
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:48,974
There's going to be a lot of talking
on this trip.

315
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,343
Is there anything
you'd rather not bring up?

316
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,212
Any questions I shouldn't ask?

317
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,648
I don't have much of a private life
to talk about.

318
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:56,849
Nothing's off the table?

319
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,784
Can I ask when your last kiss was?

320
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,186
Oh, that stuff?

321
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,955
-A sensitive topic, isn't it?
-A bit.

322
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,624
I thought so. I'll stay away from it.

323
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:08,961
Please don't ask me
about my beautiful memories.

324
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,597
-No rom-com talks.
-I'd appreciate that.

325
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,165
-Anything else?
-The past is off-limits.

326
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,600
The past? Okay.

327
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,203
Talk only about the present
and the bright future.

328
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:18,404
-Cool.
-All right.

329
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:19,505
DRAMATIC RULE AGREEMENT

330
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,240
-Last kiss…
-Was that too strong?

331
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:22,541
That caught me off guard.

332
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,044
-It's here.
-Thank you, sir.

333
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,646
We made the kimchi this morning.

334
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,181
-Really?
-It looks so good.

335
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,649
-No wonder it looks--
-Enjoy.

336
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,852
-Okay. Thank you.
-Thank you.

337
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,788
It's quite brothy for a braised dish.
It's like a stew.

338
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,123
-It really is.
-Yeah.

339
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,425
I haven't had this in a while.

340
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:40,960
-Go on, help yourself.
-Okay.

341
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:45,331
-That's kind of you.
-Not at all.

342
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,333
I'm sure people ask you this a lot.

343
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,234
What is it?

344
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,302
Is Wi Ha-jun your real name?

345
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:51,871
-It's my stage name.
-It is?

346
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:52,905
What's your real name?

347
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,273
My last name is Wi.

348
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,785
My father's name is Wi Seung-hwan.

349
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,186
GUILTY SILENCE

350
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:14,794
-I see.
-Let me.

351
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,800
So your real name is…

352
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:23,903
My real name? It's Wi Hyeon-i.

353
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,638
-Hyeon?
-Hyeon-i.

354
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,606
That's two syllables.

355
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:28,974
-Wi Hyeon-i?
-Yes.

356
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:29,975
That's a nice name.

357
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,043
-Right?
-Yeah.

358
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,245
I really like my name.

359
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,982
This might sound a bit strange,
but it sounds like a trendy name.

360
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,851
-It's gender-neutral.
-Yes.

361
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,586
Names like that have a certain charm.

362
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,755
Everyone just called me "Hyeon."

363
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:45,724
"Hyeon, where are you?"
My friends say that.

364
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,526
-Even now?
-Yes, just Hyeon.

365
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:51,063
So who came up with your stage name?

366
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,598
-Your agency?
-Yes.

367
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,268
It's because
people kept mishearing my name.

368
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,404
"I'm Wi Hyeon-i."

369
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,672
"What's your last name?"

370
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,574
"My last name is Wi."

371
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,342
"So it's Wi Hyeon?"

372
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:06,779
"No, it's Hyeon-i with two syllables."

373
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,481
-Happens every time.
-I get it.

374
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,684
You had to explain your name all the time.

375
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,753
Exactly. Wi Ha-jun is easy to pronounce.

376
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,957
-Is Do-yeon your real name?
-It's my real name.

377
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,826
When I was a kid, people always said

378
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:22,895
my name sounded like a boy's name.

379
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,530
-Do-yeon?
-I was like you.

380
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,999
I tell people my name.
"My name is Jang Do-yeon."

381
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,167
"Do-hyeon?"

382
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:29,268
"No, it's Do-yeon."

383
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:32,004
"Oh, you're a guy?"
"No, it's Do-yeon. I'm a girl."

384
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,672
That became a routine.

385
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,775
-Do-yeon? Is that a boy's name?
-Do-yeon.

386
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,410
I used to get that a lot.

387
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:39,845
YUM

388
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:41,313
SLURP

389
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,049
Hey, it's got a real kick to it.

390
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,452
Are you good with spicy food?

391
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,257
Are you good with it?

392
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,059
-You're not?
-I'm terrible.

393
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:55,127
-Really?
-You?

394
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:56,896
-I'm good.
-But I can handle this.

395
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:57,863
You can handle it?

396
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,332
-I like how spicy it is.
-It's delicious.

397
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,001
-It makes you sweat.
-Yeah.

398
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,869
BRAISED CUTLASSFISH, BOLD AND SPICY

399
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:07,273
How spicy can you go?
What is your spice limit?

400
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,241
My spice limit is Shin Ramyun.

401
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:10,743
Shin Ramyun? Not bad.

402
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,645
I can handle a bit of spice.

403
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,380
So you eat ramyeon.

404
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:15,814
I can't live without it.

405
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:17,950
Do you just cut it out
when you're on a diet?

406
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:19,084
I resist.

407
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:21,987
-It makes my face swell up.
-How do you deal with it?

408
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,389
That's my biggest worry.

409
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,691
It stresses me out every morning.

410
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,160
A de-puffing pill would become
an instant bestseller.

411
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,296
-Do you get puffy too?
-Big time!

412
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:33,198
But I've never seen you
like that on screen.

413
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,134
-There's another issue.
-Okay.

414
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,736
I puff up like crazy,
then suddenly deflate.

415
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:39,338
And your face caves in?

416
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:43,208
Yeah, so I've been really stressed
about my eye hollows.

417
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,811
A lot of people are stressed about that.

418
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:50,215
A lifting treatment could fix that,
but I don't think I should do it.

419
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,251
-Don't do it.
-It might be too noticeable.

420
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:53,719
You're best the way you are.

421
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,654
You are a beautiful woman.

422
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,289
-What was that?
-Huh?

423
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:58,958
What did you say I was?

424
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:00,225
A beautiful woman.

425
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:02,061
I'm beautiful?

426
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:07,900
I'm dying.

427
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,935
Are you keeping the short hair for good?

428
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,037
Did you ever have long hair?
Around your debut?

429
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,940
When I debuted, my hair was this long.

430
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,276
-Right, when you were on Gag Concert.
-Yeah.

431
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:20,946
Having short hair
was just so easy and convenient.

432
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,482
But when I tried to grow it out again,

433
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,617
it felt kind of awkward.

434
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,219
The short hair really suits you.

435
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,687
It's so easy to manage.

436
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:32,524
I styled my hair like yours today.

437
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:33,759
I told my stylist,

438
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,961
"I'm going for a Jang Do-yeon look."

439
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:37,396
Pretty close.

440
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:38,330
DECALCOMANIA

441
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:39,398
It's convenient.

442
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,668
I'm fine. Help yourself.

443
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:45,938
Hear me out. There's no pressure.

444
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,707
We said no diving into the past,

445
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,976
but beautiful memories

446
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,313
are meant to be savored, aren't they?

447
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:56,882
I heard you were in a dance crew.

448
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:01,820
-Spicy.
-Yeah, it's spicy.

449
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,789
I also heard you were the founder.

450
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,258
-Yes, that's right.
-Was this in high school?

451
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,659
Yes, and middle school.

452
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:11,030
-Did you do it with your friends?
-With my friends.

453
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:14,299
When I was in middle school,
TVXQ! was at its absolute peak.

454
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,136
What was the song around that time? "Hug"?

455
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,004
-"Rising sun."
-"Rising sun"?

456
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:22,207
I thought I'd give the dance a try
with my friends,

457
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,243
so I started learning the moves.

458
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,045
I picked it up faster than I expected.

459
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:27,212
That's how it was.

460
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,281
I'd show my friends the steps.

461
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:30,983
We'd rehearse over and over,

462
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,653
and when we finally hit that perfect sync,
there was this rush of joy.

463
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,656
We ended up performing on stage,

464
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,925
and people actually liked it.

465
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,661
That's when I started dreaming
about becoming an entertainer.

466
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,564
So in the beginning,
you wanted to be a singer?

467
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:50,035
At first, I wanted to be
in a performance-based team.

468
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,171
Something like that.

469
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:55,941
Back then, I was really into acrobatics
and that kind of stuff.

470
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,476
You taught yourself everything?

471
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:58,877
I taught myself.

472
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,746
So yeah, my joints are ruined now.

473
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,614
They are wrecked.

474
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:03,949
It was fun.

475
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,885
Then I went to high school,
and they had no dance crew.

476
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:08,353
So we put together a crew

477
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:11,123
and performed at festivals.

478
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,125
What was the name of your crew?

479
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:14,326
It was Double M.

480
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,261
Double M? What does it mean?

481
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:18,397
Move Master.

482
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,869
It's surprisingly not cringey
for something made at that age.

483
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,437
-Not bad, huh?
-Move Master.

484
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:26,438
-Double M.
-Double M.

485
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:27,906
Is it still active?

486
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:28,941
Apparently, yes.

487
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:32,177
-I found out not long ago.
-How long has it been going?

488
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:35,447
We started it in 2007,
my freshman year in high school.

489
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:38,350
So, 18 years? Almost 20 years.

490
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:42,754
Wait, so the crew's still going
at that school?

491
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:43,822
That's what I heard.

492
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:45,224
You built a legacy.

493
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,893
-Double M.
-Hearing about it made me feel good.

494
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,428
I'm so proud.

495
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,797
Do you still crave dancing?

496
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,732
No, not at all.

497
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,067
Why not?

498
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:59,004
I went on a fan meeting tour last year.

499
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,639
I may not be perfect,

500
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:03,142
but fans just enjoy
seeing me sing and dance.

501
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,344
-Absolutely.
-It's an opportunity for them.

502
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,746
I used to pick up moves in no time

503
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,048
when I was young,

504
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:13,318
so I figured I could just do it on my own,

505
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:14,286
and I really struggled.

506
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:15,754
What did you perform?

507
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,356
It wasn't just one song.

508
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:19,291
It was a medley of multiple songs.

509
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:20,192
What songs?

510
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,093
CURIOUS

511
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,361
"Hype Boy."

512
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,297
A couple from Street Woman Fighter.

513
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,698
"Hey Mama"?

514
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,834
Yes, that and "Smoke."

515
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,302
Jung Kook's "Standing Next to You."

516
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,270
Oh wow!

517
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,772
I mashed up the choruses from those songs,

518
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,908
then danced to it, and…

519
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:38,744
I really regretted it.
I wasn't even fit enough for it.

520
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,079
When you watched the footage later,
what did you think?

521
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:42,214
"Hey, I've still got it"?

522
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,115
Nope.

523
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,950
-"Pathetic."
-I wanna watch it.

524
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,018
Can I look it up?

525
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,653
You won't find it.

526
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,021
-Why?
-It doesn't show up.

527
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:50,289
-Did you scrap it?
-Yes.

528
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,823
I'm dying to see it.

529
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,159
I managed to find these instead.

530
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:57,963
It's all here!

531
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:58,997
What is?

532
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:00,966
Your dance performance compilations.

533
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,101
Where did you find them?

534
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,570
They are here. Let me see.

535
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:07,172
-But how--
-Wait, there are four videos.

536
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,674
-Four?
-Four of them.

537
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,809
There is one from your fan meetings.

538
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,344
BLINKING IN SHOCK

539
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:15,414
"TWICE cover dance
in the streets of Gangnam."

540
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,615
THIS CAN'T BE TRUE…

541
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,584
Is this how you spend your spare time?

542
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,118
TWICE cover dance in Gangnam?

543
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:21,019
NAUSEOUS…

544
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,087
Next video.

545
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:23,889
"Dancing on Donor Hyeong."

546
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,191
Then there's "He can wave. Only wave."

547
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,493
There are heaps.
Which one should I watch first?

548
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,495
-Hold on.
-The funniest one would be…

549
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:33,765
I didn't know
there were compilations going around.

550
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,235
I have to watch
the TWICE cover in Gangnam.

551
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:37,836
-Do-yeon, please!
-Where is this?

552
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,738
-Where in Gangnam did you dance?
-I'm serious!

553
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,708
-Was it the main street in Gangnam?
-Please don't.

554
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:45,110
-Let me see how good you are.
-Please.

555
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:48,313
-That's from ten years ago. I was 26.
-Yeah?

556
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:50,515
What's happening here?

557
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,750
DANCING TO:
TWICE - CHEER UP

558
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:52,751
Oh my!

559
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:54,553
BUBBLY

560
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,754
Oh my God!

561
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,222
I'm gonna go home.

562
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,657
No, stay!

563
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,260
SMOOTH TRANSITION

564
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:02,427
Oh my!

565
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:04,796
-It's all blurry.
-You're the best dancer here!

566
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,665
DANCING LIKE A TRUE MOVE MASTER

567
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:09,468
-That was ten years ago.
-You're good.

568
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,772
I'm not an expert, but you're a natural.

569
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,776
That hip movement is on another level.

570
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:20,812
Your hips are going side to side like…
Are they dislocated?

571
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:22,881
You dance with so much sass!

572
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,385
Are you making a cute face?

573
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:30,722
-Let's eat.
-You do this stuff at the end.

574
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:32,257
Who does?

575
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:33,925
IT'S Y.O.U

576
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:35,394
I must've overdone it.

577
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,329
When was this?

578
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:41,300
I was part of a project
that brought together rookie celebrities.

579
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,169
And that was a charity event.

580
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:46,471
Donating the proceeds,
holding a little bazaar…

581
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:47,372
LOCKED IN

582
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,741
-Do-yeon, you should eat.
-Look at this.

583
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,777
This must be one of your overseas fans.

584
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:59,451
"Ha-jun is the only guy enjoying himself!"

585
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,594
"Wi Ha-jun is so good and so adorable.
It's almost annoying."

586
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,330
"He's the best dancer out of them."

587
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:12,864
-Let's eat.
-The comments are on fire.

588
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:15,534
Apparently,
you're the tenth member of TWICE.

589
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,135
HEAD SPINNING

590
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:18,170
This is wild.

591
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:21,239
People are coming here
after watching Squid Game.

592
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:30,949
-Oh my God.
-Do-yeon, you should eat.

593
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,551
No, I'm feeding on this.

594
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,287
This is fresher than any cutlassfish.

595
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:38,023
It's alive and kicking!

596
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:40,525
-Flipping and flapping?
-Look.

597
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,461
I've never read those comments.

598
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,863
-You haven't?
-I would never watch that clip.

599
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,466
-But why?
-I can't even watch any of my own work.

600
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,868
Lots of people are here to see you.

601
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,871
-Anyway, let's keep eating.
-What should I watch next?

602
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,840
The fan meeting dance, it is.

603
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:57,309
Which one are you talking about?

604
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,977
-This is from 2024.
-What is it?

605
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,279
Please, no.

606
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:02,514
I mean it.

607
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:04,383
Please. Do-yeon!

608
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:06,151
Hey, you're feeling the rhythm.

609
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,686
-Do-yeon!
-"Come on in."

610
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,020
"I'm on fire."

611
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:11,456
I'm gonna try and dance with you.

612
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:12,357
It's "Hey Mama."

613
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,601
You're seriously good.

614
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,406
Stop now! Stop it!

615
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:29,007
Why are you doing this to me?

616
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,008
TOO HOT TO GO ON

617
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,376
I'm going home.

618
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,546
I'm done. That was delicious.

619
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,682
That was a full 12-dish meal.

620
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,285
-Did it make you happy?
-Very much. It gave me chills.

621
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:41,253
That's what matters.

622
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,655
What a spicy little clip that was.

623
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,724
You really are an amazing dancer.

624
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,794
Dancers just move differently, you know.

625
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,228
I'm exhausted.

626
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:53,131
This isn't even embarrassing. It's cute.

627
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:54,966
I'm just a bit shy.

628
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:59,004
-You are good too.
-I was just copying you.

629
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,605
-Still, it shows.
-No way.

630
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:01,907
"Come on!"

631
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:03,708
BANG BANG BANG!

632
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,143
Come on, and I'll shoot you!

633
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,412
Wait, that was a hint at Squid Game!

634
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,185
-So that's why I was cast.
-Fate guided you.

635
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:15,520
No wonder I felt like doing this that day.

636
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:19,524
-Is there anything you want to do?
-What I want to do?

637
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:21,426
I want to have some iced Americano.

638
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:24,095
After this,

639
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:27,432
let's go grab a fat piece of cake.

640
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:33,205
Golly, I thought you were someone else.

641
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:35,040
"Get me a slice, will ya?"

642
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:36,508
-Let's go.
-Desserts are my thing.

643
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:38,443
What's your favorite dessert, then?

644
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,011
-Well, let's see.
-Your favorite.

645
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:41,947
Strawberry cake with fresh cream.

646
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:43,682
I love red bean buns too.

647
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,951
-Anything with red beans.
-I'm obsessed with red beans.

648
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,385
Oh, you do?

649
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:48,553
I love red bean jelly.

650
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,988
Red bean jelly is good.

651
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:51,923
Red bean, chapssal-tteok…

652
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,158
They are to die for.

653
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:56,862
Let's go have something sweet
with red bean or cream, with some coffee.

654
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:59,130
-A fat glass of coffee.
-Yeah, knock it back.

655
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,867
-Thank you, sir. Take care.
-Thanks!

656
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:04,236
NOW FOR SOME DESSERT
AND A FAT GLASS OF COFFEE

657
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:06,137
Time to wake the beast.

658
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:08,473
Coffee! Sweets!

659
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,642
Hello.

660
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:14,012
-What?
-Why is it in English?

661
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:14,913
BRAIN FREEZE

662
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,882
-There's Korean too.
-There is?

663
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:19,417
We live in a global era, after all.

664
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:22,654
I thought it switched to English
because a world star is with us!

665
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:23,922
Silly machine.

666
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,791
ORDER PLACED LIKE A GLOBAL CITIZEN

667
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,060
What do you usually do on your day off?

668
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:31,062
You know, watch some YouTube

669
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:33,431
and head to the gym to work out.

670
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:35,767
Do you go every day
or take a day or two off?

671
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:37,969
-About six days a week?
-Six?

672
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,271
What do you watch on YouTube?

673
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:40,539
MMA fights.

674
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:42,507
You must be really into MMA.

675
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:44,142
Yeah. It's fun.

676
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,111
Does fighting help you blow off steam?

677
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:48,246
Once you start reading the punches,

678
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,348
you can start landing counters.

679
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:51,449
That's the fun of it.

680
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:53,485
How many years? Your punches look solid.

681
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,854
I did it briefly as a kid.

682
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:57,622
Was it just for the workout?

683
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:59,224
-Not for acting?
-Yeah.

684
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:02,460
-There was no big reason back then.
-You just felt like it?

685
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:04,195
I was drawn to it.

686
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:07,432
Action and MMA were a big part of my life.

687
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:10,068
You're not thinking of
competing someday, are you?

688
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:11,202
No, never.

689
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:14,072
-I intend to keep it casual.
-Just as a workout?

690
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,207
-Are you interested?
-What?

691
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:17,275
IN MMA FIGHTING?

692
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:18,810
I'd be too scared.

693
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:21,279
-But they have cool poses.
-They do.

694
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:23,615
I think you'd do well.
Are you quick on your feet?

695
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:24,749
(SUDDENLY INTERESTED)

696
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:25,917
I'm quite slow.

697
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:27,185
But my arms are long.

698
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,454
Yeah, your reach is incredibly long.

699
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:30,555
I think you've got it.

700
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:32,757
-Are you right-handed?
-Yes.

701
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:34,426
Stretch out your left arm.

702
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:36,328
Now, switch over.

703
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:37,596
A SURPRISE FIGHT SCHOOL

704
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:38,997
-You'll do great.
-Yeah?

705
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:39,898
Thanks.

706
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,066
DRINK &amp; DESSERT IN YOUR FACE

707
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:42,167
Looks tasty.

708
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,636
Let's talk more about your memories.

709
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:45,837
RECALLING BEAUTIFUL MEMORIES

710
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:48,406
What kind of student were you?

711
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:51,810
-You don't give off troublemaker vibes.
-I wasn't like that.

712
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:53,745
But you weren't exactly…

713
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:55,880
I wasn't exactly quiet either.

714
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,016
I lived in a dorm.

715
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:02,687
I was always the last one to come back
and the first one to leave.

716
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,823
I studied at school until 11 p.m.

717
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:06,291
STUDYING HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE

718
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:08,093
And you studied again at the dorm?

719
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,696
Yes, then I woke up early
and went for a run on the field.

720
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:15,500
That's why Double M
was the only escape I had.

721
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:16,935
You mean dancing?

722
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,069
THE ONLY JOYS IN LIFE

723
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,704
That and throwing punches.

724
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:22,641
All the while, I had the dream
of becoming an entertainer.

725
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,944
In my senior year,
after holding back for so long,

726
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:29,180
I wrote a letter to my parents,
asking them to let me go to Seoul.

727
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:30,382
What did you write?

728
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:33,351
I remember writing a long, long letter.

729
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:35,353
"I want to go as soon as possible,

730
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,689
make it big, and lift up my family."

731
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:39,257
A HEARTFELT LETTER OF YEARNING

732
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,859
It was this long, drawn-out letter.

733
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:42,794
And how did your parents react?

734
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:45,463
I guess they felt how sincere I was.

735
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,198
So they called me and…

736
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:49,834
-What did they say?
-"We read your letter."

737
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:50,835
"Are you serious?"

738
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:55,874
I hurried to transfer schools

739
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,409
and get a place in Seoul.

740
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:59,144
That's when the struggles began.

741
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,812
So when did you move to Seoul?

742
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:02,347
In the middle of my senior year.

743
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,983
-That's unheard of.
-I know!

744
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,820
People usually settle down
by their second year

745
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:11,656
and spend their senior year
just focusing on college entrance.

746
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:12,557
That's right.

747
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:15,060
So you were attending high school in Seoul

748
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:16,728
while getting ready to debut?

749
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:19,731
Since I was finally in Seoul,
it was time to chase my dream.

750
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,499
So I started going to auditions.

751
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:26,204
Then I joined an acting academy
to prepare for college,

752
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:27,405
which led me here.

753
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:28,940
SO BEGAN THE LIFE OF AN ACTOR

754
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:32,677
So that's when you made up your mind
to pursue acting?

755
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:34,145
Yes, it was only natural.

756
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:37,782
I admired action stars,
so I guess I was already dreaming

757
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:40,452
of becoming an actor
without even realizing it.

758
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:42,253
You are very bold.

759
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,956
Yes. I think I was really passionate.

760
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:47,692
-And your parents believed in you.
-Yeah.

761
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,260
That's also admirable.

762
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:52,530
Did your old school ever invite you
to give a speech

763
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:54,733
on your success?

764
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,001
-Not yet.
-That's quite common.

765
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,136
Wanna go there?

766
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,706
-Is that okay?
-I'd love to go.

767
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:04,042
I've been meaning to go there sometime.

768
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:07,045
When was the last time
you visited your school?

769
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:10,982
In my mid-twenties,
I just looked around from the outside.

770
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,250
You didn't go inside?

771
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:14,452
I couldn't bring myself to do that.

772
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,121
So you just gave it a glance?

773
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:19,090
The outside had changed a lot.

774
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,961
Some current members of Double M
will be joining us.

775
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:24,229
WANDO HIGH'S DANCE CREW

776
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:25,363
-Really?
-Yeah.

777
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,632
I didn't tell them it was a travel show

778
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:31,369
and that we would simply be visiting
your old school.

779
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,505
Instead, we told them it's a documentary.

780
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:35,774
We said it's a Wi Ha-jun documentary.

781
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:41,446
A documentary about my life?

782
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,415
-That kind of documentary?
-Please make it happen.

783
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:48,787
Yes, it would be cool to make one
about your childhood and all.

784
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:51,589
The students must be so nervous right now.

785
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:53,725
MEANWHILE, IN WANDO HIGH…

786
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:56,461
HARD AT PRACTICE

787
00:29:56,528 --> 00:30:00,431
THINKING THEY ARE ON &lt;WHO IS WI HA-JUN&gt;,
A NETFLIX DOCUMENTARY

788
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,600
Let's give it our all.

789
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,904
You are visiting your old school
after a long time.

790
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,772
-You can't go empty-handed.
-Yeah.

791
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:10,175
It wouldn't look good.

792
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:12,377
Yes, totally. I should take something.

793
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:14,212
Something the kids might like.

794
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,614
-Pizza?
-Pizza's nice.

795
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:19,484
You'll be like a proud alum
returning in glory.

796
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:20,819
Yes, that's it.

797
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:22,987
-Thanks for the food.
-Thank you.

798
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:24,422
OFF TO WANDO HIGH WITH ANTICIPATION

799
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:26,591
Hey! How have you been?

800
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,792
-That's your daughter?
-Yeah.

801
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:28,793
WHAT'S GOING ON?

802
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,595
She looks just like you.

803
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,931
-What is her name?
-Heo Yun-seo.

804
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,365
Write, "I'm rooting for you."

805
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:36,034
What a surprise.

806
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,435
-She's my friend.
-Friend?

807
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,703
Friends since when?

808
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,738
-Since high school.
-We were in the same class.

809
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:41,739
RUNS INTO A FRIEND

810
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:44,609
-We were best friends.
-Class president, vice president.

811
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:48,713
Then you must have seen him
dancing in his crew.

812
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,648
Great dancer. He also got good grades.

813
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:52,617
-Good grades?
-Awesome at English.

814
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,452
Yes, I like what I'm hearing.

815
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,353
What else?

816
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,188
That's when he started

817
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:59,123
acting like he was a star.

818
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:01,426
-He acted like a star?
-I did not!

819
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:02,527
He was that passionate.

820
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:05,230
He behaved like a star
before even becoming one.

821
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:07,565
-He was very determined.
-That's right.

822
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:10,034
-I bet he was super popular.
-Sure was.

823
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:11,636
Did he get asked out a lot?

824
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,837
It was wild.

825
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:17,141
But like I said,
he thought he was a star already.

826
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,610
He kept his relationships clean.

827
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:19,711
SCANDAL-FREE

828
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:22,113
-Did he now?
-He was like, "I'm gonna be a star."

829
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,716
I thought he would make it,
and he really did.

830
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:25,817
Do you live here?

831
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,720
I'm an instructor
at a local swimming pool.

832
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:33,491
Can I ask you to leave in freestyle form?

833
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:34,859
Backstroke.

834
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:38,196
(WIT ON POINT)

835
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:39,797
-Thanks for coming.
-What a charmer.

836
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:41,032
-Enjoy your stay.
-Thanks.

837
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,100
-Thank you.
-Bye.

838
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,735
PLEASES THE CROWD, MAKES HER EXIT

839
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:45,837
-Call me.
-Don't mind if I do.

840
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:48,139
People here are so friendly.

841
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:51,009
Your friend looks really young.

842
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,778
-Right?
-Yes. She hasn't changed a bit.

843
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:55,980
How do you feel
about visiting your old school?

844
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:57,315
My heart's beating fast.

845
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:58,850
I'm excited.

846
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:01,586
I wonder how much it's changed.

847
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,388
If I were you, I'd be nervous.

848
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:06,324
Any words of advice
you'd like to share with the students?

849
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:07,392
If you have a dream,

850
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,128
just go for it, no matter what.

851
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:11,996
What if they run away from home?

852
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:13,264
That won't do.

853
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,266
Nonsense!

854
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,169
-Gotta do what you gotta do.
-That's important.

855
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:20,271
-Never skip the basics.
-True.

856
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:23,474
-But that's the hard part, actually.
-I agree.

857
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:25,743
Man, it's changed so much.

858
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,679
-I can't recognize it.
-Did we arrive?

859
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:28,680
Yes.

860
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:32,283
It's a brand-new building.

861
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,152
I know. Here, let me.

862
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:35,887
It's okay. Then I'll carry this.

863
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,755
FRESH PIZZA DELIVERY FOR THE MEMBERS

864
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:38,690
Wait.

865
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,960
-I can barely recognize anything.
-Really?

866
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:43,928
Is there anything that you remember?

867
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,664
I don't think there is. This is…

868
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:48,766
What's this building?

869
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:50,101
Is that the cafeteria?

870
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:52,704
Then this must be the main building.

871
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,372
It looks different now.

872
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:58,376
-They must have rebuilt the whole place.
-Yes, it's completely changed.

873
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:00,845
-It's huge though.
-I can't remember any of this.

874
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,182
-Let me. It's heavy.
-I'm fine.

875
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:05,650
-Should I carry this instead?
-No!

876
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,385
-This isn't heavy.
-It's okay.

877
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:08,586
-Give it.
-Are you sure?

878
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,888
-Then can I piggyback on you?
-Yeah, sure.

879
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:12,957
-Hop on.
-No!

880
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:15,059
-I don't mind.
-That was a crazy thing to say.

881
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:16,594
Forget it. I'm sorry.

882
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,063
This is an enormous school.

883
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,598
The buildings are endless.

884
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,799
They say

885
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:25,336
schools named after a place
tend to be academically strong.

886
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:28,072
Your swimmer friend said earlier that…

887
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:31,075
-You got good grades and were popular.
-She definitely was.

888
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:33,778
-I'm talking about you.
-Me? I wasn't like that.

889
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:36,080
-You are way too humble.
-No, really.

890
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:38,349
She only said that for the cameras.

891
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:39,784
Big fat lies.

892
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,552
How many times were you asked out?

893
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:42,820
-How many times?
-Yeah.

894
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:45,089
-I know you were asked out.
-Almost never.

895
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,958
Just tell the truth.

896
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,893
The truth. I wasn't popular.

897
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,029
Come on!
What's your definition of "popular"?

898
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:52,830
Were you a shy boy?

899
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:55,800
Yes, I only really talked with my friends.

900
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,435
A QUIET STUDENT BACK IN THE DAY

901
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:59,170
I was pretty shy around others.

902
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:02,507
The funny thing is,
working in show business,

903
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:05,209
I've met a lot of celebrities
who are introverted.

904
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:06,544
That's true.

905
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:09,047
-Only the gym hasn't changed.
-This building?

906
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,150
I definitely remember the gym being here.

907
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,684
Did you hang out there a lot?

908
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,521
-Because you liked sports?
-I went there to dance.

909
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:20,024
So you are approaching your old stage.

910
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:23,227
-Wi Ha-jun's stage.
-My stage, here I come.

911
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:24,896
THE STAGE THAT WAS ONCE MY WORLD

912
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:28,166
"I'm Wi Ha-jun.
A dancer's blood still runs in me."

913
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,036
Double M members must be here.

914
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:33,104
JUST ONE DOOR AWAY

915
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,173
Oh boy, this is a return in glory.

916
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:44,415
THE RETURN OF THE MOVE MASTER
TO BE CONTINUED…

917
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:46,350
-Hi there!
-Hello.

918
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,618
Oh my God!

919
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:48,920
THE OG IS HERE!

920
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:51,089
I'm here to shoot a documentary about me.

921
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:52,657
ARE WE ACTUALLY SHOOTING A DOCUMENTARY?

922
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:55,560
What is this?
You can't expect me to do this!

923
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:57,662
Teach me. I'll try to follow along.

924
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:59,430
Do you still crave dancing?

925
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:00,431
No, not at all.

926
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,033
CRAVING… SATISFIED!

927
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,434
That's so cool!

928
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:05,470
He's been nailing it from the start.

929
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,972
DO THEY HAVE WHAT IT TAKES
TO BE MOVE MASTERS?

930
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,474
The ship is huge!

931
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,209
This place feels different.

932
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,210
PLUMP PALS SAY HI

933
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,377
What is this?

934
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,413
I came all the way from Seoul for this.

935
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,347
Do this.

936
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:17,315
HOW TO EAT ABALONE

937
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:18,883
CRAZY DELICIOUS!

938
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,852
-It makes you gasp.
-Yes!

939
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:24,422
-It's so good.
-I'm the only one in Asia.

940
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:25,523
HA-JUN DROPS A BOMB

941
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:27,925
DEEPLY MOVED

942
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:28,860
Adorable!

943
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:30,862
A NIGHT FILLED WITH NEW MEMORIES

944
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:32,029
What is he doing?

945
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:33,965
-Can I speak freely for a bit?
-Sure.

946
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:36,033
BEAUTIFUL MEMORIES COMING UP
