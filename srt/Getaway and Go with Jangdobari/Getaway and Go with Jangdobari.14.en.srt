1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:05,839
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

2
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:21,821
Hello. Bound for a breezy break
with bundles of stories in my bag.

3
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:23,656
I'm Jang Do-yeon
of Getaway and Go with Jangdobari.

4
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:26,159
Can you guess where I am today?

5
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:28,361
Can you hear the ocean?

6
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,634
We're here in Gangneung!

7
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:38,071
TODAY'S DESTINATION
GANGNEUNG, GANGWON STATE

8
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:41,608
JEONGDONGJIN, FAMOUS AS THE
FILMING LOCATION OF SANDGLASS

9
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:45,512
WHERE THE DEEP BLUE SEA
OF GANGNEUNG STRETCHES OUT

10
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:50,483
WHAT MAGICAL TRIP ARE WE IN FOR?

11
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,087
AND…

12
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,525
HERE'S A MAN, EXTREMELY NERVOUS

13
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,795
TODAY'S TRAVEL BUDDY

14
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:06,499
There's a reason why I chose Gangneung
for this journey together.

15
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,169
He's a huge coffee lover,

16
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,571
and Gangneung is known
as the coffee capital of Korea.

17
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,307
THE CENTRAL HUB OF COFFEE
IN KOREA

18
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:16,342
GANGNEUNG

19
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:20,180
TODAY'S TRAVEL THEME
SEARCHING FOR THE BEST LATTE…

20
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,950
Let me share a hint
about today's travel buddy.

21
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:27,954
I heard we managed to confirm
his appearance on the show quickly,

22
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:30,290
but I feel like today
will be a hit or miss.

23
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:33,126
A HIT OR MISS
CHUCKLING

24
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:37,430
It seems like we'll get along,
but he also scares me a little.

25
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,833
I'm still excited and a little giddy
at the same time.

26
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,802
IS IT ME SHE'S TALKING ABOUT?

27
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,140
Either way, I'm just grateful
to have him as my travel buddy.

28
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:49,642
I'll do my best to stay upbeat

29
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:53,480
so he can feel comfortable
and find this trip worthwhile.

30
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:54,814
She's super tall.

31
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:57,484
It's nice to meet you.

32
00:01:58,017 --> 00:01:59,018
Hello.

33
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:01,521
UM TAE-GOO
ACTOR

34
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:05,492
HE PLAYED A RUTHLESS GANGSTER
IN NIGHT IN PARADISE

35
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,228
UM TAE-GOO LEAVES AUDIENCES
WITH LASTING IMPRESSIONS

36
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,564
Tae-goo. Why are you walking behind us?

37
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,899
You should be walking ahead.

38
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,202
Because he's shy and embarrassed
to answer questions,

39
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,671
we make him sit in the center
and talk about him while surrounding him.

40
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,240
HE'S SHY, EVEN ON CAMERA

41
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,741
SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION: TAE-GOO

42
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,310
He stays silent, while we chat about
how he is and how he should be.

43
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,412
THE SILENT, INTROVERTED TYPE

44
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,348
When Seolhyun and I worked
on The Great Battle,

45
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:29,782
we exchanged fewer than five words.

46
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,351
-Yes, fewer.
-That's how I am.

47
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:33,686
I made him put on white sunscreen
all over his face…

48
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:35,455
GETS PLAYFUL
WHEN HE GETS FRIENDLY

49
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,157
He said he still couldn't wash
the sunscreen off his face.

50
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:38,591
HE ENJOYS TEASING OTHERS

51
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,760
I can't say I'm that badass.

52
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:43,663
WHAT SIDE OF HIM
WILL HE SHOW US TODAY?

53
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,365
Hello.

54
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:46,966
THEY MET BEFORE ON TAROT VIEW
AND SALON DRIP 2

55
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,503
Thank you so much for making it out here.

56
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,472
The pleasure is mine.

57
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,908
While standing…

58
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:56,843
Sorry? Sorry?

59
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,878
It's been a while
since we've met while standing.

60
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,181
Why don't we sit in an imaginary chair?

61
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,248
Well…

62
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,417
HUNCHED

63
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,086
(AWKWARD)

64
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:08,488
What was that?

65
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,823
You've appeared
on many variety shows lately.

66
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,159
Are you still shy about being on them?

67
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:15,495
-I've gotten much better.
-Than before?

68
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,331
From what I saw, you took the lead

69
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,134
like a renowned national show host in one.

70
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,403
What's up with this?

71
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,806
AN INTROVERT WHO HAS THE MOST
FUN TEASING OTHER INTROVERTS

72
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,676
What was going through your mind
on your way here?

73
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:30,777
Well…

74
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:37,350
I didn't think too much on it
and got some sleep.

75
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,751
You took a nap. Got it.

76
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:39,852
Still,

77
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,555
I thought about a few things.

78
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:43,856
-Is that so?
-Yes.

79
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:45,692
Would you rather go home…

80
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:48,828
-Gosh, no.
-…or do you regret coming here already?

81
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,296
Isn't it beautiful out here today?

82
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,365
I can't believe you just said that.

83
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:53,566
That was slick.

84
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,338
-We heard you are an avid coffee lover.
-Ah, yes.

85
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,174
That's why we picked Gangneung
for our trip.

86
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,875
Since you love coffee so much,

87
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:07,046
we asked you to wear something
that matched its color.

88
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,716
-Is it this shirt?
-Yes.

89
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:10,783
That's right.

90
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,286
-Why am I only dressed in coffee color?
-Oh, me?

91
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:14,621
That'd be mean of me.

92
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:15,688
See this?

93
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:17,323
THE COLOR MATCHES, BUT…

94
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,691
Right there.

95
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:19,892
Jinx!

96
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,227
LAUGHING

97
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,865
You should've jinxed me back.

98
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,400
That word is a bit…

99
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:30,570
Get your mind out of the gutter!

100
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,273
I'll jinx you first, then.

101
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:34,340
Sure.

102
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:35,441
Jinx.

103
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:36,576
Jinx you back.

104
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,244
EMBARRASSED

105
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,180
He's hilarious.

106
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:42,348
Are you good?

107
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,517
I'll make sure you're fine,
so don't worry.

108
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,052
-Got it?
-Thanks for that.

109
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:51,224
Next, we're headed to a coffee place
you recommended.

110
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,894
That's right. I recommended a few.

111
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,796
This is one of them,
and I've only been there once.

112
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:57,864
Only once?

113
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,565
If the coffee's good,

114
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,367
I usually have a second cup.

115
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:02,468
I got two from that place.

116
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:07,640
Then teleport go to the coffee shop
where you had two cups of coffee.

117
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:10,109
So when we teleport,
you have to say "poof."

118
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:11,844
I see.

119
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,713
Since you have a good voice,

120
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,416
I expect you to sound deep. Got it?

121
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,718
One, two, three. Poof!

122
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:20,920
Why didn't you make the sound?

123
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:23,890
-It's actually embarrassing.
-Is it corny?

124
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,425
I can't force you to do it though.

125
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,026
I'll try to mimic what you do.

126
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:28,094
-Got it.
-Okay.

127
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,562
One, two, three.

128
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,064
Poof. What?

129
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,965
CHUCKLING

130
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,971
You do that old-man clap a lot, don't you?

131
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,306
-You didn't make the sound.
-What?

132
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,442
-You didn't do it.
-It's funnier that way.

133
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,077
I'll do it for real this time.

134
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:45,511
One, two, three.

135
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:46,579
Poof.

136
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,184
EPISODE 1 - IT WAS AWKWARD THEN,
AND IT'S STILL AWKWARD NOW

137
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,986
-I won't be teasing you anymore today.
-It's fine. I'm good with it all.

138
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:55,054
-Really?
-Yes.

139
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,123
I hope you don't find this exhausting.

140
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,125
-Not at all.
-Really?

141
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,259
-Every week--
-So--

142
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,862
-What was that?
-I shoot a variety show every week…

143
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,230
PROUD

144
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,298
…so I've gotten used to it.

145
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:09,669
Which is easier for you,
hosting a show or being a guest?

146
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:12,338
Since I don't actually lead the guests
as a host,

147
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:13,573
both feel the same to me.

148
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,807
You're selling yourself short.

149
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,745
At first, I thought the guests
had to ask you questions,

150
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:21,647
but it just seemed like you were having
a natural conversation.

151
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:22,715
-That's right.
-You seemed at ease.

152
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:26,519
We just get together to talk,
so there's nothing special I need to do.

153
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,089
As for me, the crew and I…

154
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,924
Hold on. Would you like to try that?

155
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,159
THEY COME ACROSS
A BALLOON-POPPING GAME

156
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,027
-I actually love games like this.
-Do you?

157
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,629
-I haven't tried it much, but…
-Hello.

158
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,498
How many balloons get you a prize?

159
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,932
Even popping one balloon gets you a prize.

160
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,734
I see. How many shots is in one round?

161
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,436
-Ten.
-Ten?

162
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,338
How many do I need to pop
to win that monkey?

163
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,240
-You'll need to play two rounds.
-Two?

164
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:49,442
-I'll decide after the first round.
-Sure.

165
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,411
-After you. Yes.
-Me?

166
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,179
Which one would you like?
Is there an animal you like?

167
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,782
-I was going to win one for you.
-Really?

168
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:58,384
Could you win me that monkey?

169
00:06:58,951 --> 00:06:59,952
Sure.

170
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:02,355
Fire.

171
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,523
What…

172
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,891
You're serious about this.

173
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,093
You seem quite eager.

174
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,494
I want to get you that monkey.

175
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,830
DO-YEON'S UP NEXT

176
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:12,965
SHE EASILY POPS ONE

177
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,201
TAKE THAT!

178
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,336
HE TRIED HIS BEST
AND POPPED ANOTHER ONE

179
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,807
-Let's just throw them.
-I think we can.

180
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,342
-You're quite good at this.
-No way.

181
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,114
SHE WAS ON A ROLL BUT THEN
THE DARTS HIT THE FRAME

182
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:30,750
HER CONSTANT MISTAKES
MADE THE ROUND END FAST

183
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,819
-We'll go another round.
-For the monkey, right?

184
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:33,886
I'm hooked.

185
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,621
Go ahead.

186
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:39,892
-This is fun.
-You're good.

187
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,461
THROWING DARTS NONSTOP
AFTER TELLING HIM TO PLAY

188
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:47,900
DISCOVERING A NEW TALENT
ON THIS TRIP

189
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,036
-There are a lot over there.
-What do you mean?

190
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,737
-Oh, I get it.
-Aim at the bunch over there.

191
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,374
Can I play one more round, sir?

192
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,343
I'll play with my own money, guys.

193
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,444
-It's fun.
-You can throw them all.

194
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,980
Really? This is such a stress buster.

195
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:04,484
S-T-R-E-S-S

196
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:07,453
Let me know if you want to play.

197
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,388
Go ahead.

198
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:10,590
Throw the remaining two.

199
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,292
-Thank you.
-It's on the house.

200
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,527
That was fun.

201
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,829
This is such a stress reliever, sir.

202
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,499
MISS
HE MISSED ONE OF THE FREE DARTS

203
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:22,201
This is much harder than it looks.

204
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,269
More than it seems.

205
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,872
HE NAILED THE LAST 3

206
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,006
What do we win with that?

207
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:29,308
You can either take the monkey,

208
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,477
-or one of these.
-You won it yourself.

209
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:32,712
Is there one you'd like?

210
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:35,214
-I'd like to give you the monkey.
-Really?

211
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,250
I think it'll go well with you.

212
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:38,551
You think it'll go well with me?

213
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:42,188
-Something about it screams you.
-Thank you.

214
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,823
-It's an orangutan.
-An orangutan?

215
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,091
Thank you so much!

216
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,994
SHE WON THE ORANGUTAN(?)
SHE WANTED

217
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:49,762
It's so cute.

218
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,731
I love monkeys, you see.

219
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:53,799
I love it. Sweet!

220
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,967
THE MONKEY FAN IS FEELING BETTER

221
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,602
Congratulations.

222
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,372
That turned out to be more fun
than I thought.

223
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:02,775
Which episodes of the show have
you watched, and who was on them?

224
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:05,378
I saw the first three episodes
featuring Yo-han.

225
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:10,483
I hadn't laughed that hard in ages,
clapping along like that.

226
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:14,487
Can I ask which moment
made you laugh hysterically?

227
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,489
There were a few key moments.

228
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,224
One was, "You're butt naked right now."

229
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,260
There's no actors' facade for you to shed.

230
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:22,328
I've shed it already.

231
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,930
You're butt naked right now.

232
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:26,933
You're running around naked
with everything out in the open.

233
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,702
Then, in a later episode,
he said, "The bastard didn't leave."

234
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:32,171
Yes, I remember that.

235
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,940
Hold on. The bastard didn't leave.

236
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,578
He's still here.

237
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:39,645
Come on out!

238
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,247
COME ON OUT!!!

239
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,682
He's hilarious.

240
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,751
Has he always been that funny?

241
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:49,555
I haven't actually talked to him a lot.

242
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:53,259
I assumed you two were close
because you're with the same agency.

243
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,661
I feel a sense of closeness to him,

244
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,464
-but I haven't…
-You haven't hung out.

245
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,967
No, not yet.

246
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,836
But we crossed paths
during times in our careers

247
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,471
when we worked on independent films.

248
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,807
I feel like I know him,
despite never having gotten to know him.

249
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:10,176
You feel an inner closeness to him.

250
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:13,613
He gave me a good laugh, and that got me
to Episode 3 of Season 1.

251
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,348
I guess I was touched, maybe.

252
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:18,317
Something about that episode
stirred emotions in me.

253
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:19,885
Your closing conversation

254
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,787
felt deeply heartfelt,

255
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:24,023
-especially the part about the diaries.
-Of course.

256
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:27,560
Sure, each travel buddy
will have their charm,

257
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,763
but I'll probably see you
in all their shadows, like a grim reaper.

258
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,366
You said you'd keep thinking of him.

259
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,201
Maybe he's right here.

260
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:37,703
Yo-han, are you doing well?

261
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:40,306
You two had great chemistry.

262
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,441
I'll be creating a new bond today.

263
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:43,509
Well, I…

264
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,177
I don't know if I can reach that level.

265
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:47,980
Don't say that. You've got this.

266
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,684
Just be yourself and don't force anything.

267
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,320
You'll probably know this
from watching our show,

268
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,055
but the guests always set the rules.

269
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:59,759
Is there anything we must do,
or anything you'd rather not do?

270
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,927
MUMBLING… MUMBLING…

271
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,596
I can handle anything you throw my way.

272
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,097
-You're fine with anything?
-Yes.

273
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,465
-Really?
-Yes.

274
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:11,504
After dinner, to help with digestion,
we'll go swimming at Gyeongpo Beach.

275
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,072
Sure, I'm in.

276
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:17,610
Really? You seem
especially eager today. I see.

277
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,179
Is there anything
I need to be sensitive to?

278
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,048
What you should watch out for?

279
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,151
WHAT CAN THERE BE…

280
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:29,155
Is it okay if I blurt out that you're cute
and pinch your cheek?

281
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:31,190
I'm fine with that.

282
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:32,324
I'm good with anything.

283
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:33,392
Oh, no.

284
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:34,960
Sorry I said that.

285
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,064
Is there something I shouldn't do today?

286
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,131
What you shouldn't do?

287
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,199
Wait.

288
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:42,935
I sounded like I was
on Simple Labor just now.

289
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:44,070
THE PROUD SOLE HOST
OF SIMPLE LABOR

290
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,138
WHAT'S WITH THIS GUY?

291
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:48,307
I actually asked you a question.

292
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,910
THE NEWBIE SHOW HOST FEELS PROUD
FOR ASKING A QUESTION

293
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:52,478
Geez.

294
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,246
What should be our rule today?

295
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,215
Here.

296
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:59,118
For at least one thing today,

297
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:02,488
you'll do as I ask, no matter what it is.

298
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,656
How about that?

299
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,225
DO ANYTHING SHE ASKS…?

300
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,528
Didn't you just say
you were open to doing anything?

301
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,230
Ask me to do anything today.

302
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,599
I'm fine with that.
I'm good with anything.

303
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,334
Sure, okay.

304
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:19,305
While filming,
you can request a break at any moment.

305
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:20,973
Do you go to cafés often?

306
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,112
Yes, I usually go to a café
with others after eating together.

307
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,014
Why do you like the coffee
at the place we're going to?

308
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,416
When I first drank it,

309
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,618
it tasted different,

310
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,654
but then it reminded me
of the coffee I used to enjoy.

311
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:38,557
It made me wonder about that place.

312
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,292
You must be a foodie.

313
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:41,460
SMIRKING

314
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:42,995
GLANCING

315
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:45,998
I bet you laugh when things get awkward.

316
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,633
Something came to mind.

317
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,768
Do tell.

318
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:53,205
I feel like Yo-han's here with us.

319
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:56,842
Right here.

320
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,244
LOOKS LIKE A SERIOUS CASE
OF YO-HAN ADDICTION

321
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,345
Leave already.

322
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:00,780
Yo-han, come on.

323
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:01,847
You're killing me.

324
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:04,350
Okay, he's gone.

325
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,417
Bye!

326
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:06,585
BYE, YO-HAN

327
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,821
Yo-han's gone now. It's just us two.

328
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,323
I'll bring Yo-han back
if it gets awkward later.

329
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,759
Here's the rule I set for you today.

330
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,394
Summon Byun Yo-han when it gets awkward.

331
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,595
TRAVEL RULE

332
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,464
Call him by his name,

333
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:22,835
and I'll make it work the best that I can.

334
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,506
Sure. Sure.

335
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,141
Got it.

336
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,410
LAUGHING

337
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,445
So, on Simple Labor--

338
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:34,580
Yo-han.

339
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:39,051
AS PER HIS RULE,
HE QUICKLY SUMMONS YO-HAN BACK

340
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:40,886
SATISFIED

341
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,589
From this moment on,
this will be Byun Yo-han.

342
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:47,526
"Tae-goo, relax and be yourself."

343
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:48,594
Hold on.

344
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,967
You should pat him on the back.

345
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:56,035
PATTING

346
00:13:56,869 --> 00:14:00,739
From this moment on,
we'll call him Monkey Yo-han.

347
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:01,807
It's not a monkey anymore.

348
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,310
There's something I'd like to ask him.

349
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:05,578
To Yo-han?

350
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,012
"What's up, Tae-goo?"

351
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,180
Is that bastard gone?

352
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:11,483
"Come on, Tae-goo.
Why would I bring him to Gangneung?"

353
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,085
"That's insane."

354
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,320
"Just a second."

355
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,655
MONKEY YO-HAN IS HAVING
A ROUGH TIME TODAY

356
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:20,059
"The bastard didn't leave
and followed us to Gangneung!"

357
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,462
Yo-han, you're butt naked right now.

358
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:26,899
He really is naked.

359
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,468
I feel guilty all of a sudden.

360
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,736
THE NAKED MONKEY YO-HAN

361
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,204
Oh, dear.

362
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:34,707
I'm feeling self-conscious
about touching it now.

363
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:38,010
Who knew there would be
such a huge fan of this show?

364
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:39,511
I couldn't be happier.

365
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,214
I'm glad we have something to play off of.

366
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:43,616
IT'S A GOOD THING
THEY HAVE MONKEY YO-HAN

367
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,785
I heard you met my older brother.

368
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:47,920
-Yes, in Muju.
-Right.

369
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,288
Exactly.

370
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:50,456
You must travel a lot.

371
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:51,757
I must travel a lot?

372
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,159
It's so true.

373
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,763
I've been hanging out
with Director Yi Ok-seop a lot lately.

374
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:02,434
We suggested going to Muju
and actually drove there together.

375
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:06,939
A show was being held in a stadium,
almost like a concert,

376
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:11,210
so we got there early
and grabbed some food.

377
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,545
While we were walking around,
someone came up to me and said hi.

378
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:14,914
It was Director Um Tae-hwa.

379
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,981
TAE-GOO'S OLDER BROTHER

380
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,951
He asked if we were there to see
INGtoogi: The Battle of Internet Trolls,

381
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,519
and I said no.

382
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,787
"All the tickets are sold out."

383
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,791
I wanted to be there,
but I was busy filming.

384
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,160
Can I…

385
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,663
What is it? Are you feeling hot?

386
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,165
-Are you sweating?
-It's not that.

387
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,534
-A word just came to mind.
-What is it?

388
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,070
I don't think it'll come across as funny,

389
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,939
-and the timing's already off.
-It's fine.

390
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:42,374
-Still, I thought I might as well say it.
-Go ahead.

391
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,244
-You mentioned how you traveled a lot.
-Sure.

392
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,379
I doubt it'll be funny now.

393
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,716
I don't have any expectations,
so go for it.

394
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,854
There's zero expectation,
so it'll be funny no matter what.

395
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:58,757
Since you travel a lot,
you can be Jangdowanderbari.

396
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,728
YO-HAN, WHAT NOW?

397
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,463
Yo-han, what do we do?

398
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:07,766
(FEELING PRETTY PROUD)

399
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,969
THEY ARRIVE AT
TAE-GOO'S RECOMMENDED CAFÉ

400
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,036
Thank you.

401
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,173
Keep the monkey, it makes you look cute.

402
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:15,240
Sure thing.

403
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,343
Hold on.

404
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:20,346
You three are wearing similar colors.

405
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,114
Did I say "three"?

406
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,649
COFFEE

407
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,851
ONE, TWO, THREE

408
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:26,919
That's a good choice of shirt.

409
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,821
HE WAS WISE TO WEAR
THE COFFEE-COLORED SHIRT

410
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,024
HIS SHIRT IS SOAKED IN THE BACK
FROM BEING NERVOUS

411
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:33,892
They serve sparrow coffee. How adorable.

412
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,060
Goodness.

413
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,396
-After you.
-Oh, right. Thanks.

414
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,164
-Hello.
-Hello.

415
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:40,899
-Hello.
-Hi.

416
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:42,067
It's nice to meet you.

417
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:47,272
Since you brought us here,
I'll have what you recommend.

418
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,075
I've only tried their pepper coffee.

419
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,143
Pepper coffee?

420
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,845
They have three signature coffees.

421
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:54,213
I'd love to try them all.

422
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:57,282
Would you like to have
the pepper coffee and sparrow coffee?

423
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,618
I'll have the decaffeinated pepper coffee.

424
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,086
Sparrow coffee too, decaffeinated.

425
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,721
-Would you like both decaffeinated?
-Yes.

426
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,923
What size cups do they come in?

427
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,159
This is the cup the coffee is served in.

428
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,395
Then, we'll have an egg coffee as well.

429
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:10,963
-Thank you.
-Sure.

430
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,031
Thank you.

431
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,332
THEY EACH ORDER
ALL THREE SIGNATURE DRINKS

432
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,468
FIDGETING

433
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,203
LIKE THIS…

434
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:24,243
THE PRECIOUS MONKEY YO-HAN
SITS RIGHT BEHIND HIM

435
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:26,378
Geez.

436
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,113
THE INTROVERT IS FEELING
MORE AT EASE NOW

437
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,716
It's adorable.

438
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,485
Did you just happen to stumble
into this place?

439
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,654
-Or did you look it up?
-I found it online.

440
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:39,291
I looked up cafés in Gangneung

441
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:42,227
-and read the reviews.
-The reviews?

442
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:43,529
I also checked the exterior of the café.

443
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,097
Is that also important to you?

444
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,766
Cafés with delicious coffee
have a different vibe.

445
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,168
GOOD CAFÉS LOOK NICE
EVEN FROM THE OUTSIDE

446
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,570
The exterior of this café
must've played a part.

447
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,705
Yes, and I read the reviews.

448
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:57,476
I was also intrigued
by what pepper coffee might be.

449
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:00,579
I had a feeling it'd taste
the way I like my coffee.

450
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,981
So I tried it, and was blown away.

451
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:04,349
Here's the coffee you ordered.

452
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,951
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

453
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,120
I love this cookie.

454
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:11,390
-The egg tart is on the house.
-Really?

455
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:14,493
All three drinks can be enjoyed
without a straw.

456
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,729
The sparrow coffee is topped
with sesame oil and sesame seeds.

457
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:21,700
Before drinking it,
I suggest you smell it first.

458
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,203
The pepper coffee and egg coffee
can be enjoyed straw-free too.

459
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,371
-Oh, I see.
-Enjoy.

460
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,673
PEPPER COFFEE TOPPED
WITH KAMPOT PEPPER

461
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,409
No way. These are so original.

462
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,010
EGG COFFEE - TOPPED WITH
EGG CREAM AND CINNAMON

463
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:33,445
He said this was egg coffee.

464
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,881
-This is egg coffee.
-Egg coffee.

465
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:38,350
What will you try first?

466
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,085
-The pepper coffee.
-The pepper coffee?

467
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,520
-Go ahead.
-You should choose first.

468
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:43,755
I'll have the sparrow coffee.

469
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:45,124
He said we should smell it first.

470
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,625
THE AROMA OF SESAME OIL
IS CAPTIVATING

471
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,461
I smell sesame oil.

472
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,363
The aroma of the oil is strong.

473
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,365
It's incredibly unique.

474
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,067
HE TRIES THE PEPPER COFFEE AGAIN

475
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:56,869
We should've clinked glasses.

476
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:05,944
Wow!

477
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,450
NODDING

478
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,919
The first sip was completely different
from the second.

479
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,554
These are flavors I enjoy.

480
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,924
HIS FIRST TIME TRYING
THE SPARROW COFFEE

481
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,092
It's delicious.

482
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:24,263
CAREFULLY TAKING ANOTHER SIP

483
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,698
-Isn't it good?
-It is.

484
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,369
Can you describe the flavors
in an extravagant way?

485
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:32,037
It's not something I do well,

486
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,373
but variety shows see flavor descriptions
as crucial.

487
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,241
YO-HAN, HELP ME…

488
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,943
Don't turn to him.
How's the pepper coffee?

489
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,179
HE CAREFULLY TASTES
THE COFFEE AGAIN

490
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:41,980
It's lighter

491
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:46,285
than the perfect vanilla latte,

492
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:50,322
but the pepper adds something at the end.

493
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:54,226
The pepper elevates a vanilla latte,
making it taste even better.

494
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,294
It's slightly stronger and thicker.

495
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,828
Does the pepper add that finishing touch?

496
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,363
WE EXPECTED NOTHING LESS
FROM A VANILLA LATTE EXPERT

497
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,899
DOES IT REALLY TASTE
LIKE HE DESCRIBED?

498
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,169
Isn't it good?

499
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,440
This is amazing.

500
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:11,143
SO PROUD

501
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,045
I'm having another sip.

502
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,250
LASTLY, HE TRIES THE EGG COFFEE

503
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:24,790
What am I tasting?

504
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,993
It tastes like caramel.

505
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,361
What was its name again?

506
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,563
-That's egg coffee.
-Egg coffee.

507
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:35,667
I think it was topped
with foamed egg yolk.

508
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:37,603
Doesn't it taste like caramel?

509
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,471
I noticed a custard flavor as well.

510
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:40,639
Which do you like best?

511
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:42,307
I prefer the pepper coffee.

512
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,375
The pepper coffee?

513
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:45,877
"What about me?"

514
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,346
That was the egg coffee talking.

515
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,314
"What about me? Wasn't I delicious?"

516
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,083
CHUCKLING

517
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,388
(MUMBLING)

518
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,889
When things get awkward,

519
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:01,994
you seem to fumble around
looking for something to grab.

520
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:05,230
HIS GREATEST OBSTACLE YET

521
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,267
"What about me?"

522
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,003
"Tae-goo, I know you enjoyed me."

523
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,941
DRIPPING WITH SWEAT

524
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:21,146
WHAT NOW?

525
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,316
Remember the rule?
If I'm making you uncomfortable…

526
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,118
No, it's not that.

527
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:30,522
I know I should be giving you more,

528
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:33,191
so I can't help but think
you're role-playing

529
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:34,693
to make up for what I'm lacking.

530
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,561
What? Absolutely not.

531
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,865
You should know
what makes us laugh about you.

532
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:41,767
This may sound odd,

533
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,468
but you're like a puppy
needing to go potty.

534
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:45,604
GROANING

535
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,139
FIDGETING, FIDGETING

536
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:50,175
Why are you hiking up
your sleeves like that?

537
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,977
I'm sorry to say this,

538
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:54,012
but there's something funny
about how you react.

539
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,380
I'm glad to hear that.

540
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:56,782
You don't need to give us more.

541
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:59,217
You've already done enough
simply by being here.

542
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,652
-Then…
-It's more than enough.

543
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:01,787
Maybe I can burp.

544
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,290
WHO EXPECTED
BYUN LOONG-HAN TO SHOW UP?

545
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:07,025
I blame Byun Yo-han.

546
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:09,695
You learned all the nasty things
he did on this show.

547
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:12,064
I wasn't expecting that at all.

548
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:13,832
From what I heard,

549
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:18,303
around the time this show was finalized,

550
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,772
the crew discussed at length
which guests to have.

551
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,642
Weren't you one of the first people
we asked to be…

552
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,310
-That's right.
-…on the show?

553
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,579
The offer came in
before the offer for Simple Labor.

554
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:32,517
We asked you to be on the show
in the hope that you would say yes,

555
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:33,952
though we thought it was unlikely.

556
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,921
We figured the chances were 50-50.

557
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:38,924
So I've been wondering
why you took us up on the offer.

558
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,494
Since I haven't been
on many variety shows,

559
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,630
I ask as many people as I can about them.

560
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,133
I consulted the agency staff
and even my close friends.

561
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:51,403
The final choice is mine,

562
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,805
and I have my own ideas,
but I like to ask for advice

563
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,240
before saying what I think.

564
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:59,811
Everyone I asked was fond of the show,

565
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:01,747
and I also…

566
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,181
SUBTLY

567
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:07,886
The nation's top host…

568
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:13,058
THE COMPLIMENT MADE THEM BOTH
FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE

569
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,127
THE NEVER-DRYING SWEAT STAIN

570
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:17,262
You can use this
every time you're embarrassed.

571
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:19,831
We're lucky to have
some egg tarts with us,

572
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:22,734
so cover your eyes
when you're embarrassed.

573
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:24,836
You'll feel more at ease.

574
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:30,375
Anyway, this is our third time
being on a show together.

575
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:31,443
That's true.

576
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:33,879
I figured I'd have a blast.

577
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:36,615
I'm grateful you came.
The same goes for everyone else.

578
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:40,218
You wouldn't be here
if you really couldn't stand me.

579
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:41,753
-Do-yeon.
-Yes?

580
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,355
I can relate.

581
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:47,559
You would understand,
since you now host Simple Labor.

582
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,394
Yes, of course.

583
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,997
-That was meant as a joke.
-Hardly.

584
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:53,432
Who makes jokes like that?

585
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:57,736
-I'm in no position to say that.
-Nonsense.

586
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:59,538
-I was only half-joking.
-It didn't seem that way.

587
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,173
-I'm really grateful to the guests.
-Right?

588
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:02,707
Every single one of them.

589
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,277
They wouldn't come on the show
if they weren't fond of me.

590
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:07,179
-Exactly.
-That's why…

591
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,418
DOZE

592
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:17,889
Why am I sleepy after drinking coffee?

593
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,626
It must be because it was decaf.

594
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:24,996
I forgot what I was about to say.

595
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:26,198
Really?

596
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:28,333
-Let me know when you remember.
-Sure.

597
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:31,336
SINCE HE CAN'T REMEMBER,
HE BITES INTO THE TART

598
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,442
YUMMY~ NO WAY

599
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:38,910
There's a jam filling.

600
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:41,813
MMM~

601
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:43,515
What flavor is that?

602
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:45,383
Mine has dried fruit

603
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:47,118
and jam.

604
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:49,387
What's this?

605
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:50,689
HE CAREFULLY SAVORS THE TART,
HIS MOUTH FULL

606
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:52,190
Is this apricot or peach?

607
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:53,492
It's all wet.

608
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,495
-Is it wet?
-Yes. From sweating.

609
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:58,363
You can always take off the shirt.

610
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,931
-My shirt?
-We're out in the sun today.

611
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:00,999
MAYBE I SHOULD…

612
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,201
I sweat a lot, you see.

613
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:05,537
HIS NERVES MADE HIM SWEAT
AND SOAK HIS SHIRT

614
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,940
I heard your girlfriend once dozed off
at a café.

615
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,642
She wasn't my girlfriend,

616
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:12,244
but someone…

617
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:15,447
I had a crush on.

618
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:19,117
Didn't she realize
you had feelings for her?

619
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,353
She didn't like me that much.

620
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:22,888
Didn't it work out between you two?

621
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:24,389
It went absolutely nowhere.

622
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:28,226
What did you do to make her doze off?

623
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,295
I was younger back then

624
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:33,598
and had never been to a café before.

625
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:36,434
We went to one
because we had to go somewhere,

626
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:38,637
but you can imagine how nervous I was.

627
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,039
I didn't really know what I was ordering.

628
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:43,008
Yes, of course.
The setting wasn't familiar.

629
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:47,512
I've never been good at articulating,
but when I was younger,

630
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,481
I didn't think that about myself.

631
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,784
I believe I was confident in my ability
to communicate verbally.

632
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,619
I tried to act like I knew
what I was doing.

633
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:56,354
Anyway,

634
00:25:57,455 --> 00:26:01,059
we were sitting like this,
and my mind drew a blank.

635
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:02,928
I wanted to talk to her,

636
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:06,431
but nothing came to mind.
I still tried to look confident,

637
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:08,400
which only made me look weirder.

638
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:11,870
Seeing her uncomfortable
made me feel even worse,

639
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:14,205
so I couldn't say a word.

640
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:15,874
Did you really not say anything?

641
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:17,576
We probably exchanged a few words.

642
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:21,212
I'm sure I would've
answered her questions.

643
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,280
Then…

644
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,616
It's not like she actually dozed off.

645
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:26,585
Into the cushion she was holding,

646
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:28,553
she sighed.

647
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:31,623
It would've been better
if she had dozed off.

648
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:34,593
I didn't get to see her after that day.

649
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:38,330
I didn't get the chance
to take her out again.

650
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:43,268
Don't you usually show it
when you're attracted to someone?

651
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,270
You were in your 20s then,
but how about now?

652
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:47,606
-Then how--
-I can't say a single word.

653
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:49,941
Is your silence a sign
that you're attracted to someone?

654
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,409
You need to express your feelings somehow.

655
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:56,481
If someone I like
does something small for me,

656
00:26:57,048 --> 00:27:01,252
I show my affection by responding to it.

657
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,021
How about this?

658
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:05,023
Suppose someone expressed interest in you.

659
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,893
"We should get together sometime."

660
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,961
"Oh, sure!"

661
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:13,932
I think I'll also show interest
in a positive way.

662
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:17,168
You're not shy about responding, even if
you don't express your feelings first.

663
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:21,439
I just find it hard
to express my feelings first.

664
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:22,807
Why can't you?

665
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:27,278
I thought about it,
and I was quite young back then.

666
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:28,813
Of course, I…

667
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,949
Wait, this is getting too deep.

668
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,217
Hardly.

669
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,352
Stories like this are the most fun.

670
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,088
My personality probably was a factor,

671
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:40,325
but she didn't just reject me once.

672
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:41,660
She rejected me multiple times.

673
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:45,864
Multiple times?
Does that mean you kept pursuing her?

674
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:49,167
I asked her to go out with me
several years later.

675
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,336
-Really?
-I liked her for a long time.

676
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:52,837
That's true love.

677
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:54,339
No, not really.

678
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:57,175
-I see.
-Anyway, in my 30s,

679
00:27:57,242 --> 00:28:01,913
I even went as far as to think
that her rejection shaped me.

680
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,382
Am I reluctant to express my feelings
because I fear being rejected again?

681
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:07,118
Whatever it was,
I'm done trying to find meaning in it.

682
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,820
It's just who I am.

683
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:12,457
I hated the way I was,
so in my mid to late 20s,

684
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:16,628
I faked confidence
and went up to people to talk.

685
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,129
That's something I did.

686
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,165
Again, I was rejected.

687
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,233
-Oh, no.
-I believe

688
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:27,739
being open about my feelings
only made things awkward between us.

689
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:30,975
As time passes, I speak less,
and it just feels more awkward.

690
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,477
Maybe there's a right person for everyone.

691
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,546
That's right. Relationships are best
when they feel natural.

692
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:37,015
But being my true self…

693
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,552
led to me…

694
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:42,487
being alone.

695
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,189
DID IT MAKE ME NATURALLY
END UP ALONE?

696
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:48,426
Of course. Humans are meant to be alone.

697
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:02,173
What's with him?

698
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:05,777
I see you're skilled
in comedic timing now.

699
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,012
You were taught well.

700
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:10,148
Unbelievable.

701
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:12,884
That's why they say
to be careful in front of kids,

702
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:14,652
since they pick up on everything.

703
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,688
That goes for the burping and whatnot.

704
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:18,690
NICELY DONE, TAE-GOO

705
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,391
I'm only joking.

706
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:21,926
All right. We enjoyed…

707
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:23,928
One, two, three, four, five, six.

708
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:26,731
We shared six cups of coffee
and two egg tarts

709
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,366
between us.

710
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:32,036
Next, we'll go have a meal.

711
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,539
There's a lot of delicious food
in Gangneung.

712
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,742
We already booked a great spot for lunch,

713
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,578
so let's head there and enjoy our meal.

714
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:41,646
OFF THEY GO TO HAVE LUNCH

715
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,252
I shouldn't forget the monkey.

716
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:48,686
HE DOESN'T FORGET HIS LOVE,
MONKEY YO-HAN

717
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,322
We'll head to the restaurant,

718
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:54,659
expressing joy
with every fiber of our being.

719
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,961
I'll lead, you just follow.

720
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:59,631
I'll follow your lead.

721
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:01,299
Don't test the waters with me.

722
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,067
We'll do it together. It's no big deal.

723
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,536
We're off to the restaurant.

724
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:06,905
SINGING A TUNE

725
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:08,907
CHUCKLING…

726
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:10,909
(HESITANT)

727
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,578
SINGING… A TUNE…

728
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:15,446
CHUCKLING

729
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:17,549
You did your best.

730
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:18,817
THE FIRST FUN-FILLED
LATTE TOUR IS OVER

731
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:20,518
We enjoyed the coffee.

732
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:23,655
Those you traveled with in the past
decided what to call you.

733
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:24,789
What to call me?

734
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:26,024
As for Zhang Hao…

735
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,158
Yes, there was Hao.

736
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:28,426
Hao just called me "noona."

737
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,961
Will you be calling me noona?

738
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:31,396
I knew you'd like it, noona.

739
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:33,198
How was I with Ha-jun?

740
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:34,532
He was the Wando friend.

741
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,334
I'll call you my Wando friend.

742
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:39,237
Wando friend,
you really seem to love yourself a lot.

743
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:41,439
What a relief!

744
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,508
What would be comfortable for you?

745
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:46,211
-I'm good with anything.
-Anything?

746
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,413
What were some of your nicknames?

747
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:51,416
I already mentioned
my nickname in high school.

748
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:52,483
What is it?

749
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,551
Pelvis.

750
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:55,220
-Pelvis?
-Yes.

751
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:57,388
I have a wide pelvis, you see.

752
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:59,557
My nickname was Hatchet Shot.

753
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:02,427
Dodgeball King Tongki was popular
at the time.

754
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:03,494
Why Hatchet?

755
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:05,196
The Korean name is similar
to my actual name.

756
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:10,869
They could've stuck with Hatchet,
but kids called me Hatchet Shot instead.

757
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:13,438
That's a fun nickname.

758
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:15,540
-Is it to your liking?
-Hatchet Shot.

759
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,609
-I was a huge fan of that anime.
-Really?

760
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:19,444
Hatchet throws the most powerful shots.

761
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,578
Of course.

762
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:23,147
As he throws it, he shouts,
"Hatchet Shot!"

763
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:26,584
The ball flew through the air
like a hatchet.

764
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,553
What's up with the monkey?

765
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,924
Are you sure you're giving it love?

766
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:34,492
Our Yohan-utan.

767
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:37,295
It suddenly shifted position.

768
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:38,796
(I BET YOU CAN'T SEE YOHAN-UTAN)

769
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:40,331
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

770
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,766
WHILE CHATTING,
THEY ARRIVE AT THE RESTAURANT!

771
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,636
We have to make this scene feel like
an extension of the previous one.

772
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:47,338
SINGING A TUNE

773
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,142
CHUCKLING…

774
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:54,445
SPECIALIZING IN DRIED
POLLACK DISHES

775
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:55,947
I hope you sang the tune too.

776
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,049
(ALL HE CAN DO IS LAUGH)

777
00:31:58,116 --> 00:31:59,117
He didn't?

778
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:01,119
SCRATCHING

779
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:04,555
I'm sure he'll do it at least once
before we go back to Seoul.

780
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:06,824
-I should.
-It's okay.

781
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:09,994
I heard you like grilled deodeok.

782
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:13,398
-I get it often at a spot near my place.
-Really?

783
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:16,167
But the deodeok here in Gangneung
could be different.

784
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:17,235
Let's see.

785
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:20,138
It's known
for its dried pollack dishes too.

786
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:22,440
We'll be ordering grilled deodeok
no matter what.

787
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:24,075
-Hello.
-Hi.

788
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:26,077
We're definitely ordering grilled deodeok.

789
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:27,979
-Will grilled deodeok be served?
-Sure.

790
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,981
-Got it.
-Please enjoy.

791
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,382
Please cook it well for us.

792
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,818
Is there a grilled deodeok place
near where you live?

793
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:34,886
Yes.

794
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,154
Does it specialize in grilled deodeok?

795
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:37,822
And Korean thistle.

796
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,357
You like healthy food.

797
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:44,429
Since I can't cook healthy meals at home,
I make sure to eat healthy when I'm out.

798
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:45,596
You make it your goal.

799
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:47,432
You've reached an age
where health matters more.

800
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:49,767
CHUCKLING…

801
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:51,369
LAUGHING

802
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:53,538
HE'S BACK TO BEING AWKWARD
NOW THAT THEY'RE IN A NEW PLACE

803
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:56,207
Are you rocking side to side on purpose?

804
00:32:56,874 --> 00:32:58,042
Of course not.

805
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:02,113
SIDE DISHES COME
TO SAVE TAE-GOO'S DAY

806
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,817
DELICIOUS SIDE DISHES
HOME-COOKED STYLE

807
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:07,385
Out of these, which do you like best?

808
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:08,386
-Out of these?
-Yes.

809
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:09,954
TAE-GOO'S PICK
FISH CAKE

810
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:11,356
Which is your favorite?

811
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,692
I like this, but also this.

812
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:15,994
DO-YEON'S 2ND PICK
SEASONED VEGETABLES

813
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,228
This also looks good.

814
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,597
-This?
-That looks tasty.

815
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,732
It looks good.

816
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:23,001
SLIDING

817
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:26,170
Did you push that forward
because I like it?

818
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:27,472
That's not something I eat.

819
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:28,573
I won't eat it anyway.

820
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:32,010
…EMBARRASSED…

821
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:34,312
CHUCKLING

822
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:35,480
Good for me.

823
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,817
You could've placed it in front of me,

824
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:41,853
so I wondered
why you just nudged it forward.

825
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,955
I was embarrassed
to push it too far forward.

826
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,023
Oh, come on.

827
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,392
-No way.
-Thank you.

828
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,195
How are these two different?

829
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:53,131
This is grilled dried pollack.

830
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,600
This one has been deboned

831
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:57,435
and cooked in locally sourced perilla oil.

832
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:59,003
It's all natural omega-3 nutrition.

833
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:02,173
It tastes best with the mushroom,
deodeok, and dried pollack

834
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,975
all together at once.

835
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,778
Is this grilled deodeok?

836
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:09,614
Yes, we clean and prep
fresh deodeok every day.

837
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,681
GRILLED DEODEOK

838
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:12,650
The perilla oil smells incredible.

839
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:15,053
LET ME HAVE A SNIFF TOO

840
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,256
Hey, there's more.
That's glazed dried pollack.

841
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,792
This is glazed dried pollack.

842
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:22,660
-Glazed dried pollack?
-To enjoy this,

843
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:26,364
take about one-third of this,
dip it in locally sourced perilla oil

844
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,166
-and then some soy sauce.
-Looks good.

845
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,567
-Thank you.
-No problem.

846
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:32,870
This is soft tofu with dried pollack.

847
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:34,806
High in protein.

848
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:36,040
-We'll enjoy.
-Sure.

849
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:38,409
Thank you.

850
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,611
EVEN THE SIGHT OF IT IS ENOUGH
TO SATISFY YOU

851
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:41,679
It's time to eat.

852
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,714
Shall we dig in? I'll enjoy it too.

853
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:46,250
-Let me give you some of this.
-Sure, thanks.

854
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:48,820
THEY SCOOP SOME UP
FOR THE OTHER PERSON

855
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:58,996
-Please enjoy.
-Please enjoy.

856
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:00,064
HUMBLY BOWING

857
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:02,633
I'm dying to try the tofu.

858
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:05,603
Take one-third of it.

859
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,605
TAKING ONE-THIRD OF IT
AS RECOMMENDED

860
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:11,476
(WITH SOME SOY SAUCE)

861
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:22,053
It's so good.

862
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:24,155
I'll try the tofu too.

863
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:27,058
-Careful, it's hot.
-Okay.

864
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:31,429
(HAVE SOME SOY SAUCE WITH IT)

865
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:41,706
Isn't it good?

866
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,742
-My gosh.
-Perilla oil tastes savory and nutty.

867
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,646
Why don't we describe what we just ate?

868
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:50,014
-Should we describe it?
-Shall we?

869
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:52,116
They say

870
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:55,486
you can eat soft food without teeth
as long as you have a tongue.

871
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:58,856
This tofu is so soft
you hardly even need your tongue.

872
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:00,057
It's that soft.

873
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,860
I like the perilla oil it's cooked in,

874
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:05,363
which is savory and subtle.

875
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,032
That'll be all for me.

876
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,401
It's your turn.

877
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:12,336
I'll give it a try too.

878
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,249
…QUITE SERIOUS…

879
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:29,287
LAUGHING

880
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,755
I laughed because

881
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:33,925
I ate it so sincerely, even though
I can't really describe the flavors well.

882
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:36,928
That seemed funny.

883
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:38,262
Every time,

884
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,131
before you say anything,

885
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,667
you take another taste of what you had.

886
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:43,901
You were like that with the coffee.

887
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:45,970
Well, I want to make sure
I describe it correctly.

888
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:48,906
What did you think? Do tell.

889
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:52,944
The nuttiness that comes through

890
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:56,280
made it different
from other tofu I've had.

891
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:59,350
For sure, the tofu melted in my mouth.

892
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:02,086
It was delicious.

893
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:06,390
Why don't we try the grilled deodeok
and grilled dried pollack next?

894
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:07,792
Sure.

895
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:11,529
He told us to have it as a combo
with the mushroom.

896
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:12,697
This'll taste good too.

897
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:31,916
It was satisfying

898
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:33,951
to eat deodeok
and enoki mushroom together.

899
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:36,487
It's like a one-two punch combo.

900
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:39,757
The sauce on top brought out umami,

901
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:44,228
and I thought
the combination was wonderful.

902
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:46,264
THAT'S ALL FOR ME

903
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:52,303
The grilled deodeok alone is enough
for me to finish a bowl of rice.

904
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,640
-Would that be enough?
-It's that good.

905
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:58,276
PHEW…

906
00:37:58,342 --> 00:37:59,610
(DESCRIBING THE FOOD)
(THE END)

907
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:05,883
GLANCING HERE…

908
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,084
AND GLANCING THERE…

909
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:09,186
You don't have to describe
the food anymore.

910
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:11,055
I should at least do something.

911
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:12,290
NOPE

912
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:13,991
I should be more entertaining.

913
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:16,494
How entertaining do you want to be
while eating

914
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:18,863
that you keep trying to be funny?

915
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:21,299
We're not here to just eat.

916
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:23,834
HE TAKES HIS WORK SERIOUSLY

917
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:25,136
At least you know that.

918
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,607
I thought you weren't aware of it.

919
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:31,842
I'm kidding.

920
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:35,112
I came on the show full of confidence…

921
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:37,915
Please don't tell me you're crying.

922
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,483
Oh, no.

923
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,085
He came today brimming with confidence.

924
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,456
I have experience
hosting Simple Labor now.

925
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,259
Did that help you get prepared?

926
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,494
I feel like I didn't contribute today.

927
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:53,164
That's not true. The guests never do much.

928
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,834
They spent time with me comfortably
and had a good time.

929
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:58,569
Should I do something?

930
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,139
Have you done role-play
on a variety show before?

931
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:06,811
I did it a few times on Simple Labor.

932
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:08,346
More than once?

933
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:11,248
I was so bad at it that we had to stop.

934
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,652
TAE-GOO'S ROLE-PLAYING
BROUGHT PRODUCTION TO A HALT

935
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,354
Filming had to stop because of you?

936
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,289
SULLEN

937
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,025
Just give me the word,
and I'll play along.

938
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,093
Sure.

939
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:24,328
If that doesn't work,
I'll try something else.

940
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:26,030
-I'll keep…
-See how passionate he is.

941
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:27,965
You're full of passion today.

942
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,333
So what roles are we playing?

943
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,236
Pretend to be a divorced couple

944
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:35,406
sharing their last meal
outside Seoul District Court.

945
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:38,743
PRESENTED BY BARIBARI
LAST MEAL AFTER THE DIVORCE

946
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:41,379
It feels strange to end

947
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:45,182
our six years of marriage
with this final meal.

948
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:46,617
I'm grateful for everything.

949
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:48,319
You're grateful?

950
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:52,223
Then why did you make things up
in front of the judge?

951
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:53,791
-Me?
-Yes.

952
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:54,859
Like what?

953
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:57,995
You kept accusing me of things
that never happened.

954
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,164
I wasn't accusing you.
I was just stating the facts.

955
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,734
Thanks for putting up with me
for six years while you hated my guts.

956
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:05,736
Either way, I'm grateful--

957
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,339
THEY BURST OUT LAUGHING

958
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:11,175
Are you grateful now that we're divorced?

959
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,276
I'm sorry I laughed.

960
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,379
-But--
-You're having a field day.

961
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:17,381
This breaks my heart,

962
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:20,785
but it was the right decision
for both of us.

963
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:23,721
-I think it worked out for the best.
-Really? Is that why

964
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:26,757
you left the courthouse
hopping and singing?

965
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:28,692
I was copying you one last time.

966
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,028
You've always wanted us
to do that together.

967
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:36,867
Ending with just a meal
seems like a waste,

968
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,436
so let's sneak away for a kiss
and end things.

969
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:40,004
I'm good.

970
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:41,972
HE BLURTED HIS TRUE RESPONSE OUT
LIKE A SNEEZE

971
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,207
That was a punch to the gut.

972
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:46,410
I was acting too, you know!

973
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:50,214
That wraps up the first role-play.

974
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,916
THE FIRST ROLE-PLAY IS OVER!

975
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:55,519
Tae-goo, you passed the first role-play.

976
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,657
You kept me from taking it too far.

977
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:01,358
I give that performance ten points.

978
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,629
APPLAUDING, COMPLIMENTING

979
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:08,833
Do you remember what went on yesterday?

980
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,801
Yesterday?

981
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,404
I got drunk and totally blacked out.

982
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,638
Why?

983
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:15,973
Did something happen?

984
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,241
You said you had feelings for me.

985
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,309
-I said that?
-Yes.

986
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:20,678
You said you had liked me for a long time.

987
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:21,745
Did I?

988
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,981
Really?

989
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:25,082
You said you'd remember.

990
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,851
You told me to remind you today

991
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:28,519
if you didn't.

992
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:31,956
I see you don't remember.

993
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:34,191
I don't remember.

994
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,527
All right.

995
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:40,898
I only remember how soft your lips felt
when we kissed.

996
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:43,734
It's not me you kissed.

997
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:44,835
We didn't?

998
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:46,670
It wasn't you?

999
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:48,939
Sorry.

1000
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,208
I guess I must be a free-spirited person.

1001
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:53,010
That's quite disappointing.

1002
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:55,145
I'm kidding.

1003
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,680
I don't think you are.

1004
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:59,517
I lied because I knew
you'd be embarrassed.

1005
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,286
Gosh, let's stop.

1006
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,357
That wraps up the second role-play.

1007
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,726
That…

1008
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,261
got serious and I felt embarrassed.

1009
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:11,328
Really?

1010
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:15,799
This time, your acting fell somewhere
between playful and sincere.

1011
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,802
It let the audience focus
but also have a laugh now and then.

1012
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,338
Thanks to you, it came out quite nicely.

1013
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:22,473
That's why your score…

1014
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:25,075
…is ten points.

1015
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:26,610
CLAPPING

1016
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:28,479
Do you feel lighter
now that we've done something?

1017
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,650
-That was the longest thing I've done yet.
-Really?

1018
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:33,751
THE LONGEST HE HAS ROLE-PLAYED

1019
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:36,086
I've gotten used to it
after doing it a few times.

1020
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:37,454
Really?

1021
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:39,890
The meal will be on me today.

1022
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:41,959
No, I'll get it.

1023
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:43,594
No, let me. It's the least I should do.

1024
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:45,863
You paid for the cab, didn't you?

1025
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:49,033
By the way, when will you repay
the money you borrowed?

1026
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,401
Repay you? How much did I borrow?

1027
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:53,203
-5,000.
-5,000 won?

1028
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:56,273
No, 50 million won.
Seriously? What are you playing at?

1029
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,310
-I'm joking.
-Wire me 50 million won.

1030
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:03,147
I think the exact amount
was 51,23 million won.

1031
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:04,248
I deducted the rest,

1032
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:05,683
-considering you were broke.
-Don't bother.

1033
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:07,918
I'll wire it.

1034
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,922
Aw, he played along again.

1035
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,491
-I think I've adjusted now.
-Really?

1036
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:15,559
Glad to hear that.

1037
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:20,130
It's like the Marines' boot camp,
but for role-playing.

1038
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:21,999
I'm glad I was able to do that.

1039
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:26,604
It's fun to see you try.

1040
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:29,273
We're not just here to eat.

1041
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,407
Don't say that.

1042
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:32,876
LAUGHING

1043
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,845
You keep saying
we're not just here to eat.

1044
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,182
Anyway, to help digest this food,

1045
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:40,718
I figured we could go somewhere
that's befitting

1046
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:42,786
of your role as host of Simple Labor.

1047
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:44,421
Shall we head out?

1048
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:47,257
Living in modern times, we're always busy,

1049
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:48,892
so we'll jump to our next location

1050
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:51,428
to save some time.

1051
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:52,963
-Let's go.
-Sure.

1052
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:55,566
One, two, three.

1053
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,405
(HE GOT HIS REVENGE)

1054
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,640
You have another thing coming.

1055
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,109
Okay, here we go.

1056
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:06,377
One, two, three.

1057
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:10,381
(MIMICS HER CROUCHING)
(SWOOSH)

1058
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,250
I executed a fancy landing.

1059
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,819
Do you like making cute items like these?

1060
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:17,087
These are called pipe cleaner dolls.

1061
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,155
This is so cute!

1062
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:20,357
-Do you know what today is?
-What is it?

1063
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:22,292
It's the 6,941st day.

1064
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:23,761
Since I debuted?

1065
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:26,263
Here you go. This too.

1066
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,331
What's going on?

1067
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:29,733
Since when have you had a crush on me?

1068
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,702
From the moment I met you.

1069
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:33,637
SCREAMING INTERNALLY

1070
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:35,005
It's so nutty and savory.

1071
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:36,140
It's seriously good.

1072
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:38,208
I'll add this
since we won't be kissing today.

1073
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:39,510
Should I leave this out just in case?

1074
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:42,246
-Don't you remember?
-What? Not again!

1075
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:44,481
EVEN THE RESTAURANT OWNER
FELL FOR HIS UNIQUE CHARM

1076
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:47,418
Being here with you alone
makes my heart skip a beat.

1077
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:49,119
YOUR HEART… SKIPPED A BEAT…?

1078
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,221
I'm going jogging tomorrow morning.

1079
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:53,490
-I'd like to switch seats.
-Why?

1080
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:54,558
IS HE GOING…

1081
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,193
TO SIT NEXT TO DO-YEON…?

1082
00:44:57,294 --> 00:44:59,363
It felt like my heart was about to burst.

1083
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,231
I have something else planned for today.

1084
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:03,300
Have coffee with me!

1085
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:06,236
No one has ever been this forward before.

1086
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:07,738
