1
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:05,839
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

2
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:10,176
AFTER THEIR NIGHT IN TAIWAN

3
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:14,114
A PEACEFUL MORNING HAS BROKEN

4
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:16,182
HOT SPRINGS SCHEDULED FOR 6:30

5
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:22,255
I had the best sleep, everyone.

6
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:26,860
I slept so well.
I tend to sleep better after a beer.

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,129
Now, let's go to meet Do-yeon.

8
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,576
It's a little dark, isn't it?
I'll smile even brighter for you.

9
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:47,480
VENEER LIGHTS ON

10
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,449
KNOCK KNOCK

11
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:52,485
Do-yeon, let's go to the sauna.

12
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:56,456
BRIGHT SMILE TO START THE MORNING

13
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,893
You need to come.
We need to hit the sauna.

14
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:02,996
-Oh my, you're wearing red.
-Hello.

15
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,465
-How hot.
-It's my swimsuit.

16
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:07,033
It's pretty awesome.

17
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,802
-A swim…suit?
-Yes.

18
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:11,237
Yes, I'm wearing an awesome swimsuit.

19
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:13,239
Wait a minute. Hold on.

20
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,310
I remember seeing
two coffee cups somewhere.

21
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,446
LET ME SEE

22
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:21,981
-Come on out. You look great.
-It's all pointless.

23
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:25,018
-Did you sleep well?
-Did you?

24
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,954
-I slept so well.
-I slept really well too.

25
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:30,457
-Did you see the tubs in our rooms?
-Yes.

26
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:31,958
-Did you use it?
-No.

27
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:35,228
I wanted to fully enjoy the hot springs,

28
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:36,729
so I stopped myself.

29
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,998
If I'm honest, I was too tired.

30
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:44,771
I'm in love! Look up there.

31
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,106
-It's open.
-It is!

32
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,741
-This is awesome.
-I love this.

33
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:49,709
Goodness.

34
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,913
Is music playing that only you can hear?

35
00:01:56,583 --> 00:02:01,221
IT'S 06:40,
BUT OUR ENERGETIC DIVA KNOWS NO FATIGUE

36
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:02,956
WHIMPERING

37
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:04,657
Look at her, everyone.

38
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:09,129
YES, LOOK AT ME, EVERYONE

39
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,198
You're so hot!

40
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:15,268
It looks like the home
of a mountain spirit.

41
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:16,369
It does.

42
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:17,971
What a beautiful view.

43
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,941
I can't quite believe my eyes.

44
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:23,009
It's so beautiful.

45
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,978
-I'd love to bring my parents.
-Me too.

46
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:27,280
It's drizzling today too.

47
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,449
STRUGGLING

48
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:30,517
I think you push it.

49
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:32,085
OOPSIE

50
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,391
A PRIVATE AREA TO ENJOY THE HOT SPRINGS

51
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:41,261
AND WARM UP WHILE ENJOYING NATURE

52
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,529
This is fabulous.

53
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:47,567
EPISODE 11
MY NAME IS…

54
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:50,937
We get to enjoy the sauna with this view?

55
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:53,439
I have chills.

56
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:55,742
This is crazy.

57
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:57,010
It's squishy here.

58
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:58,578
This is wild. I'm in heaven.

59
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,313
No way.

60
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,383
I honestly have chills.

61
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,018
This is amazing!

62
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:08,821
This place is… I love this place!

63
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,524
I love it here!

64
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:18,131
The rain makes it even better.
It's a more magnificent view.

65
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,500
When else would you see this?

66
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,669
-Come to Taiwan when it's raining.
-I agree.

67
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,404
Please come when it's raining.

68
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,572
I'm so excited.

69
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:27,006
THE RAIN ADDS TO THE AMBIANCE

70
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,108
We could just stare out at the mountains.

71
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:30,310
I love this.

72
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,278
Thank you so much, Netflix.

73
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,881
Honestly, I'm over the moon right now.

74
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,952
Do you really have to thank Netflix
in that pose?

75
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:41,387
I love Netflix so much, you know.

76
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,323
Thank you so much, Netflix.

77
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,124
Thanks, Netflix!

78
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:51,164
-Shall we get in?
-Yes, I'd love to.

79
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,166
I'm going to dip a toe in first.

80
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,540
Isn't it perfect? It's not too hot.

81
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:01,774
It's spot on.

82
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,043
Is there going to be a big reveal?

83
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,044
Of course.

84
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:08,982
THE QUEEN'S SWIMSUIT REVEAL

85
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:10,750
SWOON

86
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:14,320
A SURPRISE FELINE GUEST

87
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,090
RAWR

88
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:20,994
PURR

89
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,264
Man, my stomach hurts.

90
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,633
I brought her just for you.

91
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,601
-You're so hot.
-All the way from Korea.

92
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:30,069
PURR

93
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,671
RAWRRR

94
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,206
GRRRR

95
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:35,008
Grrr-bee.

96
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:38,678
It's sprawled across your ribs, Gabee.
Right there.

97
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,213
You're so gorgeous.

98
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,249
Shall we get in, then?

99
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:45,285
I'll take this off too.

100
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,756
INTIMIDATED
BY THE QUEEN'S GLAMOROUS REVEAL

101
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,057
I feel so small.

102
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,093
What are you talking about?
You look great.

103
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,429
You're stunning.

104
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,398
Those colors look great on you.

105
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:23,923
If she's not a model, then who is?

106
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,759
You're awesome. Shall we get in?

107
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,561
The temperature's perfect.

108
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,235
How's the temperature for you?

109
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:37,270
It's perfect.

110
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,205
-Are you gonna cry?
-I'm in love.

111
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,843
(THIS IS IT)

112
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:48,848
It's toasty.

113
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,249
I should turn around too.

114
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:52,385
I love this.

115
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:55,788
This place,
what with the sound of the rain,

116
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:59,859
the mountains that look like
they're home to spirits…

117
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,362
The birds flying by, that waterfall,

118
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:04,497
the temperature, everything.

119
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:07,767
My eyes feel so at ease
taking in all the green.

120
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:08,901
Totally.

121
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:11,304
So this is why people vacation.

122
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,638
It must be.

123
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,007
-You don't need to get up to much.
-Exactly.

124
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,176
I want to take in everything.

125
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,112
-Isn't this lovely?
-Yeah.

126
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,581
When you're traveling,
how do you spend your mornings?

127
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,216
Do you tend to get moving early?

128
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:25,485
Or do you like slower mornings
to rest up and sleep?

129
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:29,389
I like to get rest and sleep in.
I'm always getting up early for work.

130
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:34,560
So when I'm not working, if I can help it,
I'd rather not wake up at a set time.

131
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:38,498
Unless there's somewhere important
that I really want to visit,

132
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,566
I like to rest up and sleep in.

133
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:42,835
So you don't really care for breakfast?

134
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,604
No, I have to eat breakfast.

135
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,341
Breakfast is a must.

136
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:52,311
And what's a must-have for breakfast?
Something you like to see on the menu.

137
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:56,048
I love breakfasts with scrambled eggs.

138
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,417
I always end up missing it.

139
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,352
I also love places with rice noodles.

140
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,087
Some warm, hearty broth?

141
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:04,290
A lot of places in Southeast Asia
serve rice noodles for breakfast.

142
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,192
I love that sort of thing.

143
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,995
-Rice noodles are delicious.
-I love a good broth.

144
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,530
With some soft noodles.

145
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:12,732
I'm getting hungry.

146
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:13,900
Me too.

147
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,437
Let's eat with our imaginations.

148
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:21,007
-Please float breakfast my way.
-I've seen these things on Instagram.

149
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,275
Great. Thank you.

150
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:23,309
Your scrambled eggs.

151
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:24,644
IMAGINARY BREAKFAST FLOAT

152
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,813
And your rice noodles.

153
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:27,914
Can I get a photo?

154
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,349
#HOT_SPRINGS_BREKKIE

155
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,051
She's here for the pics.

156
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,186
#Taiwan.

157
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:34,353
#Feast.

158
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,222
#CallMeHotGirlGabee.

159
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,993
I'm so hungry
that I thought that was dragon fruit.

160
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,362
HER SCRUNCHIE RESEMBLES DRAGON FRUIT

161
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:46,332
I saw it as… Oh? Another hashtag.

162
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:49,602
Don't skip your morning fruit!
#DragonFruit.

163
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,604
#Dragon. #MultifloraRose.

164
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:55,975
Friendship goals.

165
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,844
#Ichon-dong.

166
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,412
ENDLESS POSING FOR THE PERFECT PIC

167
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,984
-We got the pics. Let's go home now.
-Let's go.

168
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,589
The first thing I look for at a sauna

169
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,090
is a good rest area.

170
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,793
-It can be very exhausting.
-It can.

171
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,495
Going to the sauna is exhausting.

172
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,497
After you've been sweating,

173
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:21,634
there needs to be a place
where you can lie down after getting out.

174
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:22,702
Like this.

175
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,404
Is that why the mats are there?

176
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,039
It's the best.

177
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,076
So that's why they're squishy.

178
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:32,245
You can rest here for about ten minutes,

179
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,413
then go back in.

180
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,648
You're a bathing leopard.

181
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,384
RAWR

00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,386
ROARRR

183
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:41,888
GRRRR

184
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:45,291
FEISTY

185
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,393
I've cooled down now. This is nice.

186
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,095
Do-yeon, it's lovely here.

187
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,497
-It is?
-Try lying down for a bit. It's nice.

188
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:52,965
So we're drying off?

189
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,233
Not completely drying off.

190
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,168
Just resting up. Cooling down.

191
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:57,503
-Wow.
-Isn't it nice?

192
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,671
There's a cool breeze.

193
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,172
You just rest like this.

194
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,874
This is nice.

195
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,409
I'm loving this.

196
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:07,580
After a short break,
you'll want to get back in.

197
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,950
So you hop back in to warm up,
then come out to cool down.

198
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,885
Warm up, cool down, and repeat.

199
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,922
Like going back and forth
between hot springs and an ice bath?

200
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:19,892
But with an ice bath,
you instantly get cold.

201
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:23,362
That drains you of energy
which is why you need a spot to rest.

202
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:24,730
I see why it's important.

203
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,133
That's why I think
a sauna that knows its stuff

204
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:30,169
is one that has a beach bed or something.

205
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,138
That's my philosophy.

206
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:34,073
I'd like to build my own bathhouse.

207
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,676
-I've thought about building one.
-You have?

208
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:40,012
Trying something with an expert
is a whole different experience.

209
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,013
They know their stuff.

210
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,281
My sauna philosophy.

211
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,684
It's like hitting reset. I'm warm again.

212
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,986
Goodness me.

213
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:51,157
I love Taiwan so much. We're a good match.

214
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,893
That's good.
You kept saying that yesterday,

215
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,261
which made me so happy.

216
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,330
Honestly, I love it here.

217
00:09:57,396 --> 00:10:00,166
-And the people are so kind.
-I agree.

218
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,735
My face is warm too.

219
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,908
Boy, this is good.

220
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:10,910
My fingers are all wrinkly.

221
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,145
Mine too.

222
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,914
PRUNEY FINGERS

223
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,150
So nice and warm.

224
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,658
You guys look like
you're filming Single's Inferno.

225
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:29,095
Hello.

226
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:30,730
Can you introduce yourself?

227
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,866
Hold up. For Single's Inferno,
we need to wet our hair.

228
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,908
Could you please introduce yourself?

229
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,877
At this point,
they'd already know each other.

230
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,046
They would?
Can you tell I haven't seen it?

231
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,981
I'm more of an I'm Solo girl.

232
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:51,017
Hello.

233
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,251
You know when they enter…

234
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,122
CAREFULLY ENTERING SOLO WORLD

235
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,892
YEONG-SUK
ALWAYS CARRIES BUNDLES OF STORIES

236
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:00,960
SHE BRINGS ALL THE CHAT

237
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:03,095
Shall I take this down?

238
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:05,898
Wait, I'm Yeong-suk?

239
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:11,637
-Hello. I'm Yeong-suk.
-Yeong-suk?

240
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,205
She does feel like a Yeong-suk.

241
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:17,343
On Single's Inferno, in a hot tub,
they'd be asking questions more like…

242
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,347
"What are your dreams?"
That sort of thing.

243
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:24,216
Your goals and dreams. Or your hobbies.

244
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:26,252
I'm currently preparing
for my realtor test.

245
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,756
-She's totally the I'm Solo type.
-I told you.

246
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,692
Over here, in Single's Inferno…

247
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,595
I guess I'd say I'm someone
who creates culture.

248
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,532
I was born in 1987,

249
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:41,801
and I'm preparing for my realtor exam.

250
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,837
I'm not a great singer,
but I practiced a song for you all.

251
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,809
He's going to sing for us!

252
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,349
I'm sorry.

253
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,453
And, at the very end…

254
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,321
My name

255
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,457
is Jang Do-yeon.

256
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,727
YEONG-SUK HAS CHOSEN THE LEOPARD

257
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,130
A COUPLE IS BORN
THE LEOPARD AND YEONG-SUK

258
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,767
Do you have to do that with your lips?

259
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,403
-Dating shows are so much fun.
-Tell me about it.

260
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,071
This is lovely.

261
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,873
This feels so good.

262
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:24,143
Is today a full-glam kind of day?

263
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,111
Today?

264
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:28,347
I hear that friends these days
match each other's vibes.

265
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,216
Today's our second day.

266
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:32,985
So we want to be glamorous,
but not too excessive.

267
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,754
You mean subtle glam?

268
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,055
No, full glam.

269
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,560
-I only have two modes in life.
-I thought you said not excessive…

270
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,963
Full glam or zero glam.

271
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,498
I see. It's all or nothing?

272
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:46,866
This is no subtle glam.

273
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,034
-I'm zero glam right now.
-Zero glam?

274
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,370
Shall we do a "Get ready with me"?

275
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,676
-Do you think I could keep up?
-Of course.

276
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,546
Let's go with mild, full glam.

277
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,782
-Mild sounds good.
-Full glam but mild.

278
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:05,651
I think your eyes would look stuffy
with too much makeup.

279
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:08,087
-We'll just do some lashes.
-You're absolutely right.

280
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,188
GABEE KNOWS HER STUFF

281
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,023
Your brows have a great shape,

282
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,825
so we'll just fill them in.

283
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:13,726
Sounds good.

284
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,628
We'll go with full glam but mild.

285
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,130
SPLASH

286
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,733
We're being so raw right now.

287
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,934
SPLASH

288
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,469
As you would do at a sauna.

289
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,137
SLAP

290
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,739
SLAP

291
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,208
SLAPPING TOGETHER

292
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:31,977
Shall we go to our rooms?

293
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:33,078
Sounds good.

294
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:35,381
Let's go.

295
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,149
-I loved it here.
-Me too.

296
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,250
It was perfect.

297
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,019
Shall we freshen up, then meet?

298
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,620
-Sounds good.
-Good.

299
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:44,156
TIME TO FRESHEN UP,
THEN MEET FOR MILD, FULL GLAM

300
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,359
Why do you have so much stuff?

301
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,428
I'm going to think of myself

302
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,598
as a makeup artist
who's here on a business trip.

303
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,034
Jung Saem Mool is famous,
and saemmool means spring water,

304
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,068
so I'm Shin Pokpo.

305
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:59,438
SHIN POKPO
A.K.A MS. WATERFALL

306
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,941
I thought I'd go with a powerful name.

307
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,009
Do-yeon?

308
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,145
She's here again.

309
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,050
I'm here to do your makeup.

310
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:12,952
Hello.

311
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,854
-Oh my.
-Hello.

312
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,722
-You brought everything.
-Yes, I did.

313
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,924
-Did you get some good sleep?
-Yes.

314
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,960
Are you from Jung Saem Mool's salon?

315
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,729
No, I'm actually called Shin Pokpo.
You can call me Pokpo.

316
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,899
-Not spring water, but waterfall?
-Exactly.

317
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,968
-Welcome.
-Ms. Pokpo.

318
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,569
WELCOME, MS. POKPO

319
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,239
-You're already dressed?
-Yes, I am.

320
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:35,040
Okay, so what are we going for?

321
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,742
Hello.

322
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:37,843
I am…

323
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,878
You're possessed again.

324
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:45,084
I'm Shin Pokpo, a makeup artist
and I run a makeup salon in Cheongdam.

325
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,654
MAKEUP ARTIST SHIN POKPO,
CHEONGDAM'S DIVINE HANDS

326
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,789
I'm not Jung Saem Mool.

327
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:54,493
I'm Pokpo, and one of my biggest clients

328
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,694
is Jang Do-yeon.

329
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,529
Yes, hello.

330
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,331
ACTRESS JANG DO-YEON,
MS. POKPO'S MUSE

331
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,366
That's right.

332
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,336
Just to mention some of her greatest work…

333
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,938
I'm not sure if you'd remember.

334
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:09,141
She made me look like a fool
while I was on Gag Concert.

335
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,177
When we think of fools,
we tend to go for the classic snot smear,

336
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,512
but not Ms. Pokpo.

337
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,749
She likes to add her own artistic touch.

338
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:19,685
I remember adding glitter
to your snot smear.

339
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,288
So, depending on the angle,

340
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,757
the snot smear would glisten.

341
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,792
An unforgettable sight for our audiences.

342
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:31,297
I think those subtle details
are what really entertain the audience.

343
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,766
-You pull everything off so well.
-Oh, please.

344
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:36,769
She's truly one of my favorite clients
and actresses,

345
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:39,939
and today,
we're going to be getting ready together.

346
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,075
EXCLUSIVE LOOK AT MS. POKPO'S MAKEUP BOX

347
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,744
This here is my personal makeup box.

348
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,715
-Today's theme is "sun-kissed."
-Sun-kissed?

349
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,885
I thought we'd try sun-kissed makeup.

350
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,054
-Sounds good.
-Let's get started.

351
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,157
What exactly does
sun-kissed makeup look like?

352
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:00,159
In a nutshell,

353
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,594
you've been kissed by the sun.

354
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,698
THE SUN HAS… KISSED ME?

355
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:08,434
We want you to look
like you could be from Hawaii.

356
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,803
Or at least like you vacationed there
for a week.

357
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:12,338
A LIGHTLY TANNED GLOW

358
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:14,840
I'm just going in with some contour.

359
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,676
-You have gorgeous skin.
-Come on, stop it.

360
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:18,744
Absolutely gorgeous.

361
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:22,648
And your eyes don't need a lot of makeup.

362
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,216
I'm fascinated that you know that.

363
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,018
Blush is really important.

364
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,887
We want your skin to look lightly tanned.

365
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:30,456
BLUSH FOR A SUN-KISSED GLOW

366
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:34,360
I'm also going to apply it
to your forehead and even your chin.

367
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,429
And just a little under your eyes.

368
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,333
-So darn good!
-Gabee!

369
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,901
PLEASED WITH HOW IT'S GOING

370
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,739
Even with just a little color,
you look so much more lively.

371
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:49,508
CHEEKS AGLOW AFTER BEING KISSED BY THE SUN

372
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,944
-Let me do your lips now.
-I'm all for it.

373
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,213
Glossy lips are trendy these days.

374
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,914
We've moved on from matte lips.

375
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:57,616
Let's overline your lips.

376
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,385
I want to try. Make me like this.

377
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,622
Isn't that my chin?

378
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,592
That's exactly it.

379
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:09,895
The secret is to extend your lip line
down to your chin.

380
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:12,331
GENTLE SWIPES

381
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:15,000
-So you're just drawing on skin?
-Exactly.

382
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,436
POKPO'S TIP:
LINE UP TO YOUR NOSE AND DOWN TO YOUR CHIN

383
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:20,606
Do you like doing makeup for others?
Isn't it a hassle?

384
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,074
Not when it's you.

385
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,343
I wouldn't do it for anyone else.

386
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,248
-Are you sure it's not too much?
-I'm sure.

387
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,750
You'll end up eating it all anyway.

388
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:33,852
Think of it as a little snack.

389
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,721
It smells good too.

390
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:38,757
This one tingles a little
because it's a plumper.

391
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:41,260
-It really does tingle.
-Right?

392
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,395
Wait a minute. Oh dear, look at me.

393
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:49,435
MS. POKPO'S TECHNIQUES
WORKING THEIR MAGIC

394
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,637
We should do your aegyosal.

395
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:52,871
Sounds good!

396
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:54,339
Underneath your eyes.

397
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,209
Please make them plump.

398
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,845
I want them plumper!

399
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,548
-Plumper!
-I want plumper aegyosal.

400
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:05,150
Make them obese. I want obese aegyosal.

401
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,019
Can you smile for me?

402
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:10,422
This is good.

403
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,160
PLUMPER UNDER-EYES COMING RIGHT UP

404
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:16,095
The inner corners.

405
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:20,466
FINAL TOUCH
ACCENTUATING HER INNER CORNERS

406
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,268
(LET ME SEE…)

407
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:24,503
Do I look okay?

408
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:28,240
WITH A SIMPLE MAKEOVER

409
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,943
HER CONFIDENCE IS THROUGH THE ROOF

410
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,619
FEATURING GABEE'S NAIL TIPS

411
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,287
-Doesn't she look good?
-She does.

412
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:43,388
You look cute.

413
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,723
Take a look in the mirror.

414
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,859
FINALLY TIME FOR THE BIG REVEAL

415
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:47,960
What do you think?

416
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,462
-I look different.
-Do you think?

417
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,165
My lips are so plump.

418
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,667
I think plump lips suit you.

419
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:58,871
How long does this last?

420
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,806
-The tingly feeling.
-The tingles?

421
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,242
It should be gone
in about ten minutes or so.

422
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:04,643
Then in ten minutes,

423
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,979
will the magic fade
and turn me back into this?

424
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:07,913
(PETTY LIPS)

425
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,450
Don't worry. I'll be beside you all day,
reapplying your makeup.

426
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:15,087
-I should do my makeup now.
-Yeah.

427
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,122
-I'll do it quickly.
-Let me watch.

428
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,957
TIME FOR MS. POKPO TO DO HER OWN MAKEUP

429
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:22,194
How long does it take you
to do your makeup?

430
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:25,797
If I'm going on a date,
it can take me up to two hours.

431
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,267
Because I'd also need to do my hair.

432
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:33,906
But if we're going for something mild
like we are today,

433
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:36,108
I can get ready in 30 to 35 minutes.

434
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:38,177
When you're going on a date,

435
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:39,311
are you more detailed?

436
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,513
Super detailed.
But there's something more important.

437
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,482
I'll play some music and keep dancing.

438
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,652
I need to make sure I'm feeling myself.

439
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,490
-That's why it takes you so long?
-That's why.

440
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:54,193
Really, I could get ready in half an hour.

441
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:55,861
What level of glam is this?

442
00:19:55,928 --> 00:20:00,566
I'd say today is… level one.
I'm just doing the absolute basics.

443
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:02,901
And can you give us a hint
about your outfit?

444
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,536
-My outfit?
-Yes.

445
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,874
You're not wearing
that leopard again, are you?

446
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,742
It's a similar vibe, actually.

447
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:13,779
Not exactly like that.

448
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,215
It's not quite like that,
but it is savage.

449
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:17,115
Savage?

450
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:20,986
Your swimsuit looked great on you.
No one in Korea could rock it like you.

451
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,622
If I'd worn it,
I would have been a kitten.

452
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:26,458
But if Gabee wears it…

453
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:27,726
GRRRRR

454
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,063
AGGRESSIVE PURRING

455
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:34,132
I thought I was wearing 3D glasses.

456
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:35,901
The leopard was pouncing.

457
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,404
But if I wear it…

458
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,449
All done. I'll go and get dressed.

459
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,417
-Sounds good.
-I'm all done.

460
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:53,752
See you after you're dressed.

461
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,954
I love Taiwan so much.

462
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:59,491
I'm not too mad at the rain. I wonder why.

463
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,493
Maybe you're in a good mood.

464
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:05,197
Let's just think of it
as this trip being so delightful.

465
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:08,467
First, we'll ride
the Wulai Sightseeing Trolley.

466
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:11,937
Then we'll go to eat.

467
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,405
-Sounds good!
-For our last day.

468
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,340
It's so green.

469
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:17,876
YAWN

470
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,778
SPOTTED GABEE YAWNING

471
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:21,680
"It's so green."

472
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:27,486
I'm having a great time,
but I guess I can't deny that I'm tired.

473
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:30,155
Your words say one thing,
but your body says otherwise.

474
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:31,723
Yes, it does.

475
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:33,158
I think we're here.

476
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,230
There's this Taiwanese vibe.

477
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,299
-There is.
-A vibe that's unique to Taiwan.

478
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:42,100
A vibe you can only feel in Taiwan.

479
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,802
There are a lot of stairs.

480
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,908
-How cute.
-These are cute.

481
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:53,812
-They're so small.
-Can baby feet this size even walk?

482
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,547
I guess my feet were once that size.

483
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,083
-Who knew I'd get so tall?
-When I see baby feet…

484
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,085
I think, "You call those feet?"

485
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,587
"You cutie. Call these hands?"

486
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,889
They're so cute.

487
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:07,626
You know chubby baby feet
that haven't been shaped by gravity yet.

488
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:08,894
They're to die for.

489
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,596
And their heels are so soft.

490
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,900
Who would have thought
those feet would one day get calloused?

491
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:16,635
Time flies.

492
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,770
-It does.
-I resent time.

493
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,041
They're train tracks.

494
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:25,110
CLIMBED THE STAIRS TO FIND TRAIN TRACKS

495
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,378
Are we riding this?

496
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,347
Wait. It's called Wulai Station!

497
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:30,015
-This is adorable.
-So cute.

498
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,284
So this is the Wulai cart.

499
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:37,756
He speaks English.

500
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,726
-Pokpo?
-Maybe there's a waterfall.

501
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:43,729
-Aren't you Ms. Pokpo?
-Yes, that's me. Hello.

502
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:45,897
Thank you for recognizing me.

503
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:49,067
Hey, is that it?

504
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,670
-How kind of you.
-Thank you.

505
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:58,410
It may look like a cute log cart,
but we're totally exposed.

506
00:22:58,477 --> 00:22:59,811
It's a little scary.

507
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,581
I guess we can draw these
if it rains a lot.

508
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,149
If it pours.

509
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:06,785
PICKING UP SPEED AS THEY SET OFF

510
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:07,953
This is fun.

511
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,889
-It's actually pretty fast.
-It is.

512
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:13,225
It's getting faster.
We're so close to the wall.

513
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,093
Oppa, I'm scared!

514
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,362
Honey, go faster!

515
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:22,868
LOG CART THRILLS ITS PASSENGERS
AS IT WEAVES THROUGH BUILDINGS

516
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:24,202
Look at the view!

517
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,571
It says here that we should hold this.

518
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:29,007
Hold on tight.
Otherwise, you might fall off!

519
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,777
You might fall off against your will.

520
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:33,945
It's a little nerve-racking.

521
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:36,348
-Are you good with rides?
-I love them.

522
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,416
-You do?
-Yes.

523
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:38,750
How about you?

524
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:42,020
It's scary to think I could fall off
and it'd be my own fault.

525
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,725
A STUNNING VIEW BEYOND THE BUILDINGS

526
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:49,094
This is breathtaking. Just look at that.

527
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:51,463
It's like we're in the Amazon Rainforest.

528
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:58,069
-The breeze is nice.
-Yes.

529
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:02,240
It looked pretty cute,
but it packs a punch.

530
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:05,277
HOLDING ON FOR DEAR LIFE

531
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:08,213
Don't underestimate these…
It's showing my will to live.

532
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:10,315
Fake nails or not,

533
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:12,851
I'm too young to die!

534
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:26,298
-There's the waterfall!
-There is?

535
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:29,100
-Just there. That's crazy.
-Hey, I see it!

536
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:31,002
Look at that waterfall.

537
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:37,075
Wait, what is this? It's a cave!

538
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,376
SUDDEN CAVE EXPLORATION

539
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:45,217
LOG CART IS EVEN MORE THRILLING
THAN ANTICIPATED

540
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,823
-It felt like entering a mine.
-It was a tunnel.

541
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,825
That was scary.

542
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:55,327
Wow. That waterfall.

543
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:58,730
THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE CART TOUR,
THIS WATERFALL

544
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,298
Would you look at that?

545
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:02,100
The view is awesome.

546
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,636
Maybe you'd see celestial maidens
bathing up there.

547
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:05,971
A beautiful view to end on.

548
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:09,441
That's not a waterfall, you know.
It's a giant peeing!

549
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:11,943
Is that right?

550
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:14,546
(DISPIRITED)

551
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,214
I wonder how big the giant is!

552
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:17,716
(SPIRITS LIFTED)

553
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:19,417
How big's the giant?

554
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:21,019
-Thank you.
-That's a lot.

555
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,754
Actually, it's not a giant peeing.

556
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:24,689
It's a super giant's tears!

557
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:26,224
UM…

558
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,393
The giant must be really upset!

559
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:30,495
Thank you.

560
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:31,663
ULTIMATE SATISFACTION

561
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:35,467
-Thank you.
-The giant's really sad right now.

562
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,835
And so their tears are…

563
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:38,103
YOU CAN STOP NOW

564
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:39,304
You're too kind.

565
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:43,208
DO-YEON'S SELF-ESTEEM PROTECTOR

566
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,910
This is lovely.

567
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,346
-We're in nature.
-It's truly breathtaking.

568
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,348
-Do-yeon.
-Yeah?

569
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:51,550
I'm hungry.

570
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,085
Would you like some boar sausages?

571
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:56,288
-No, I want a real meal.
-Okay, then!

572
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:58,323
Let's go and have some good food.

573
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,159
-Continuing on from yesterday…
-I can't wait.

574
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,361
Our restaurant choices can never miss.

575
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:08,166
AND EVEN MORE STAIRS

576
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:11,436
Whenever I see stairs like these,
I think of the Joker.

577
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,672
-Joker? Do you like the stairs scene?
-Have you seen it?

578
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,106
Yes, I loved that movie.

579
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:16,441
Why don't you try…

580
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:20,979
SEIZING THE MOMENT

581
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:23,848
I'm not Joker. I'm Longer.

582
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:30,589
Like this. Do it like this.

583
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:34,092
Yes, that's it!

584
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,032
K-JOKERS LEAVING THEIR MARK IN TAIWAN

585
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:46,204
-You look cool.
-Something like this.

586
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:49,474
-You're good at everything.
-Don't make me blush.

587
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:50,375
The scene from Joker.

588
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:54,412
GREETED BY THIS MAGNIFICENT WATERFALL
AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS

589
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:56,915
The sun's come out.

590
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:58,550
What a view.

591
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,719
The restaurant's right here.

592
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,320
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE WATERFALL

593
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:05,590
I'm sure the food will taste delicious
if we eat with this view.

594
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:08,860
BEST SPOT TO TAKE IN THE WATERFALL

595
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:11,096
Hello.

596
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:13,932
-I think they're Indigenous.
-Looks like it.

597
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:17,902
THE TAYAL
TAIWAN'S THIRD-LARGEST INDIGENOUS GROUP

598
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:21,339
The view is wild.
You can see the waterfall.

599
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:26,645
FINALLY TIME FOR FOOD
WITH A VIEW OF THE WATERFALL

600
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,414
Wow, she's gorgeous.

601
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,119
I think this is bamboo rice.

602
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:36,121
RECOMMENDED BY THE LOCAL FIXER

603
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:39,157
-Shall we try ordering?
-Okay, let's try.

604
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:40,091
Thank you.

605
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:42,994
-Jie jie?
-Jie jie?

606
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:44,562
What would you like to eat?

607
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:46,464
Bamboo rice.

608
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:48,533
JUST ORDERING IN KOREAN

609
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:50,268
I did it! Your turn.

610
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,670
SURPRISINGLY, SHE UNDERSTOOD

611
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:53,438
Sweet and sour fish?

612
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:56,374
Sweet and sour…

613
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:57,575
-Sweet and sour…
-Yu?

614
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:03,415
ORDERING SWEET AND SOUR FISH
WENT SMOOTHLY TOO

615
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:04,916
Tofu…

616
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,152
Tofu…

617
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,557
MAGAO (PEPPERCORN) FRIED TOFU

618
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:15,060
Boar… Stir-fried boar…

619
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:16,227
REALLY PUSHING IT

620
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:18,329
-Stir-fried?
-Stir-fried boar!

621
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:19,764
WAIT, SHE UNDERSTOOD THAT?

622
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:22,467
DESPERATELY PLAYING CHARADES

623
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,203
ODDLY ENOUGH, SHE UNDERSTANDS

624
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,905
And… scallions.

625
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:28,506
SHAMELESSLY ORDERING IN KOREAN NOW

626
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:31,743
FINALLY HIT A WALL

627
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,078
Stir-fried scallions?

628
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:35,113
-Scallions.
-Stir-fried scallions.

629
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:36,614
Scallions…

630
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:39,017
WORLD-CLASS CHARADES

631
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:42,520
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR UNDERSTANDING

632
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:43,521
Delicious!

633
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,992
-What was the rice wine called again?
-Gongju.

634
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,928
SUCCESSFULLY ORDERED RICE WINE TOO

635
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:52,063
-We could live here.
-Tell me about it.

636
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,431
We're good at Mandarin.

637
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:55,567
My second language is now Mandarin.

638
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,537
FORTUNATELY, THEY ORDERED
THE CORRECT GONGJU MAKGEOLLI

639
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:00,972
You're pretty.

640
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,073
Thank you!

641
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,775
EXCHANGING COMPLIMENTS

642
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:05,009
You're so pretty.

643
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:09,414
Gongzhu.

644
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:12,083
So it's the same as in Korean?

645
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,918
I guess it's a drink for princesses.

646
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:15,954
We're princesses, so…

647
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:17,455
HARDCORE PRINCESSES

648
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,290
This is how you mix it up.

649
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,926
-We're ladies, so…
-We sure are.

650
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:23,294
I'm scared it'll explode.

651
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:24,796
-Do you think it will?
-This…

652
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:28,933
SKILLFUL PRINCESS GIVES IT A PROPER MIX

653
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,269
Here's the bamboo rice.

654
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:32,771
Looks good.

655
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,910
KINDLY DEMONSTRATING HOW TO EAT

656
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:41,412
-I'll open the bamboo rice.
-Please do.

657
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,784
-It's like rice cake.
-It is!

658
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,619
Very glutinous.

659
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:52,390
BAMBOO RICE: A TRADITIONAL DISH
HISTORICALLY EATEN BY INDIGENOUS HUNTERS

660
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,658
You can smell the bamboo.

661
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,861
-Smells good, huh?
-Yeah.

662
00:29:57,362 --> 00:30:00,031
-Would you like a glass?
-I'd love one.

663
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:03,168
The drink for princesses.
Gongju makgeolli.

664
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:04,669
Gongzhu.

665
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,171
Oh my, it's trickling out.

666
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:09,440
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

667
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:12,710
-Gongzhu.
-Gongzhu.

668
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:14,846
Thank you.

669
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,650
-Does it smell good?
-Yes.

670
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:20,185
I think this will be yummy.

671
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:23,788
Wow.

672
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:26,424
Delicious. How is this so good?

673
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:29,227
You can't taste the alcohol.
Just a slight kick at the end.

674
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:31,996
-What's this fruity scent?
-It's so fragrant.

675
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:35,633
So good.

676
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:39,370
-Even better than what we drank yesterday.
-Yes.

677
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:43,141
SECOND UP IS THE SWEET AND SOUR FISH

678
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,411
SWEET AND SOUR FISH
A WULAI SPECIALTY

679
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:49,347
DEEP-FRIED FRESHWATER FISH
SERVED WITH A SWEET AND SOUR SAUCE

680
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:52,684
I want to try the bamboo rice first.

681
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:56,921
I think there are nuts inside too.

682
00:30:56,988 --> 00:31:00,291
-It's the texture of rice cakes.
-Like savory glutinous rice.

683
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:07,332
NEXT UP IS THE MAGAO FRIED TOFU

684
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:09,367
Let me try some of this fish now.

685
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,070
The sweet and sour yu.

686
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:16,708
I can just think about the lip plumper
you put on me earlier.

687
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:19,510
-Sweet and sour yu.
-Sweet and sour yu.

688
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:22,947
It's very tart.

689
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:24,949
Yummy.

690
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:27,552
-I like it. Isn't it good?
-Yeah.

691
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:28,553
EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS

692
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,355
-Look at the fish.
-This is good.

693
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,557
It tastes like cod.

694
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,759
The chilis are pretty spicy too.

695
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:38,496
It's good as a side dish
to the bamboo rice.

696
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,766
STIR-FRIED SCALLIONS
THEY STRUGGLED TO ORDER

-Do-yeon.
-Yes?

699
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:51,509
Is it that good?

700
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,344
This is really fresh.

701
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:56,080
It tastes like egg. Is it really tofu?

702
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:01,586
Isn't this egg?

703
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:02,954
It's egg tofu.

704
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:04,489
Egg tofu?

705
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:05,823
Good, isn't it?

706
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,792
-This is so good.
-Isn't it?

707
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,894
It's nice and crispy.

708
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:10,795
MAGAO FRIED TOFU

709
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:15,033
EGGS AND SOY MILK FRIED TO A TOFU TEXTURE,
TOPPED WITH WULAI MAGAO PEPPERCORNS

710
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,801
And it's super crispy.

711
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:20,038
The steamed eggs are so soft,
almost like a pudding.

712
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,539
I thought it was silken tofu.

713
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:25,410
This sauce lightly drizzled on top
is delicious.

714
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,378
It's so good!

715
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,783
NEXT-LEVEL REACTIONS

716
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:33,151
This is so good.

717
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:34,585
Man, my throat's dry.

718
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,821
I don't think I can help it.

719
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:39,223
LAST DISH
STIR-FRIED BOAR

720
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,693
These scallions are perfect
for us Koreans.

721
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:44,028
You could mix these right up
with some rice.

722
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:50,401
This is so good. If I'm honest,
I've had some lousy food on vacations.

723
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:53,404
Because I don't really prioritize food.

724
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,673
I always just eat whatever's close.

725
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,409
-The food's unique and tasty.
-It's crazy.

726
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:02,480
What is this? This is so good.
I want to take it back to Korea with me.

727
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,248
How did they make this?

728
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,218
You don't even have time to chew.

729
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:09,587
-It's gone.
-It just melts, doesn't it?

730
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,390
This calls for a drink.

731
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,492
-Let me give you a refill.
-Thanks.

732
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,027
Pleasure. Gongju.

733
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:23,701
So yummy.

734
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:27,839
I just glanced outside
and saw the waterfall.

735
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,509
Keep the drinks coming.
This place is the best.

736
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,911
Please come here. You don't have a choice.

737
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:36,147
You just have to come here. Just come.

738
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:37,682
It's so delicious.

739
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,150
That's blackmail.

740
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:43,521
Starting with those boar sausages,
every meal we've had…

741
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:44,922
So good.

742
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,092
So, how has the trip been?

743
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:50,461
No.

744
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,364
If you're asking that,
it means we're going home soon.

745
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:54,265
WHINING

746
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,567
Jie jie.

747
00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:59,003
I'm the oldest, but still.

748
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,906
If I'm honest, I had the best time.

749
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:03,474
Hand on heart, the best.

750
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,611
Yesterday, you said this was the best trip
you've been on for a show.

751
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:09,147
That made me so proud.
I kept thinking about it last night.

752
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,148
But honestly,

753
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:13,651
I'm sorry to all the shows
that have taken me somewhere on a trip,

754
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,486
but this was the best trip.

755
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,954
Why don't you say hi to Kwaktube?

756
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:18,956
Look, I'm sorry.

757
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:23,061
But I think I had so much fun
because I like Do-yeon so much.

758
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:24,262
You're so sweet.

759
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:27,231
I had so, so much fun.

760
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:29,233
And everything we ate was delicious.

761
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,569
Thinking about it now,

762
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:35,306
I seem to like older female friends
who are fun, very responsive, and kind.

763
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,375
That's you in a nutshell.

764
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:38,376
Actually,

765
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:41,512
I was listening and wondering
if you were talking about yourself.

766
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,681
You're fun and very responsive.

767
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,851
It felt like I was on a trip
with a fellow comedian.

768
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,853
You were unfazed
no matter what I threw at you.

769
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:50,788
Totally unfazed.

770
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:53,057
I didn't even feel bad
if it was a lowball gag.

771
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:55,593
You can turn crappy gags into gold.

772
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:58,830
You made this trip so easy for me.

773
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:00,398
I really enjoyed myself.

774
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:03,734
The itinerary wasn't too hardcore,
but there was substance.

775
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:05,837
Every moment was meaningful and fun.

776
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:09,307
A one-night trip is short,
but it felt packed to the brim.

777
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:10,575
It was short,

778
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:13,711
but I still feel like
we got around to doing everything.

779
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,747
I think it's because we got to talk
last night.

780
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:19,016
That honest conversation over drinks.

781
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:22,320
Did that feel really meaningful to you?

782
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:23,588
So meaningful.

783
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:28,359
How was the trip for you?

784
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:30,328
Hosting this show

785
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:32,563
has been such a great opportunity,

786
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,199
but it's one-on-one,
so there's nowhere to hide.

787
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,834
I can imagine.

788
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:39,537
But when it's over,
I always feel relieved.

789
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:41,439
When I first meet my travel buddies,

790
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:44,909
I'm constantly worrying about how
I can make sure they have a good time.

791
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:47,011
But in every shoot,

792
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:50,148
there have been these magical moments.

793
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:54,085
I've felt relief after each shoot
thanks to these magical moments.

794
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,053
That moment came very early on with you.

795
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,954
-It did?
-Yes.

796
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:58,456
When was it?

797
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:00,892
At your place,
when I saw those pink shoes.

798
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:04,028
They're magical shoes.

799
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:06,264
-When I saw those magic shoes.
-They're magic.

800
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,933
That's good.
We had a magical moment before the trip.

801
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,934
Absolutely.

802
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:14,238
So I was able to enjoy myself
instead of feeling burdened.

803
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,742
I had so much fun.
Thank you for inviting me.

804
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:19,977
I always have so much fun
when I'm with you.

805
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:22,313
It's all thanks to our fab crew.

806
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:24,315
Sweet and sour yu.

807
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,884
As you can see,

808
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:29,253
Do-yeon is such a humble actress.

809
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:32,023
COMPLIMENTS MAKE ACTRESS DO-YEON SHY

810
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:37,995
When you get back to Korea,
will you go to the sauna together?

811
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:42,099
Come on.

812
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:44,702
I really do want to go
to the sauna with you.

813
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:45,603
Okay.

814
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,706
-I often go with Jung too.
-Who?

815
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:51,175
-Leejung.
-Oh, you go with Leejung?

816
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:53,544
We'd love for you to join us.

817
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,780
If you feel comfortable. Whenever.

818
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,081
SMOOTH BACKTRACKING

819
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:59,850
See? I'm giving you space.
I take two steps forward and…

820
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,486
CHOKING ON THE PRESSURE

821
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,487
I'd love to.

822
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:06,857
I'm the type to take two steps closer,
then one step back.

823
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:08,793
Sure, let's meet together.

824
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:10,795
You mean it, don't you?

825
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:13,231
You told me
you don't say things you don't mean.

826
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:14,232
"I really

827
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,269
love… Gabee and Leejung."

828
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:19,937
"Ha ha ha."

829
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:21,105
"Just thinking about it

830
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:23,708
makes me so happy."

831
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:25,443
You're so good at that.

832
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:27,411
You have a great sense of rhythm.

833
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:28,446
This robotic rhythm.

834
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:30,181
Too funny.

835
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,515
That was so delicious.

836
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:34,819
ENDING THEIR LAST MEAL WITH LAUGHTER

837
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:35,820
That was the best.

838
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:38,189
-Now, it's time.
-Yes.

839
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,591
Unfortunately, it's the end of our trip.

840
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:42,193
To end our show, we…

841
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:46,030
Come on, Gabee.
Seeing you tear up breaks my heart.

842
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:49,900
This is silly. I'm being so silly.
I'm so sorry.

843
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:52,303
Why are you crying? You're being so silly.

844
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,171
This is so stupid.

845
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:55,139
TEARY FAREWELL

846
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,575
I'm good. I've got it together.

847
00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:59,043
We're good. Thank you.

848
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:03,714
As we said earlier, memories fade quickly.

849
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,116
So we'll leave a record.

850
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:07,351
-A record?
-To conclude our trip.

851
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:10,121
-Everyone has left an entry?
-Yes.

852
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:12,256
It's like a guestbook.

853
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:13,758
Like a record of every trip.

854
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:16,994
Let's take some time to write.

855
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,029
Okay.

856
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:36,681
REFLECTING ON THE PAST TWO DAYS

857
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:40,818
THE PAIR IS BUSY WRITING THEIR HEARTS OUT

858
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:56,267
We finished writing at similar times.

859
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,003
Now, it's time to read it out loud.

860
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,472
-Oh, we read them out loud?
-We do.

861
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,341
Would you like to go first, or should I?

862
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:04,809
Please go first.

863
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:05,743
ELDERS FIRST

864
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:12,650
"Any worries I had ahead of this trip,
you vanquished away. Thank you."

865
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:16,454
"From now on, I'll call you
'Vanqui-Shin Gabee.' Aren't I hilarious?"

866
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:19,323
You're funny.

867
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,062
"We talked a lot about how nice
our neighborhood is."

868
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:29,300
"It made me wonder if your positive energy
has rubbed off on me."

869
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,869
"You exude such a positive vibe."

870
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:35,306
"And Taiwan, all the food, views,
and people we met together…"

871
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,576
"Even the conversations we shared
were exceptional."

872
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:40,878
"Thank you for making this trip perfect."

873
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:41,946
"See you in Ichon-dong!"

874
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:44,014
"From your neighbor, Do-yeon."
And that's it.

875
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:47,752
I HOPE TO SEE YOU MORE AROUND ICHON-DONG

876
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:50,755
Please read your note out loud.

877
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:55,259
"This trip reminded me
what traveling's truly about."

878
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:57,228
"Despite the rain and humidity,

879
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,497
I was so happy simply to be with you."

880
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:03,434
"I've always wanted to be your friend,
and so the chance to bond with you

881
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:06,036
has made me so happy."

882
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:09,940
"This trip was short and sweet,
packed full of good memories,

883
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:12,343
and I'll remember it forever and ever."

884
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,613
"I was so happy during every moment
of this trip with you,

885
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:18,549
the beautiful, kind, cool,
and witty Do-yeon."

886
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:21,752
"Thank you for inviting me,
and let's hang out more often."

887
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:25,589
"Casually in our sweats,
in our very own neighborhood."

888
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:36,467
You do know, don't you?

889
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,769
That from the flight back to Korea

890
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:41,872
to the drive back home,
we'll still be together.

891
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,841
Wait, that's part of the trip?

892
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:46,177
-We live in the same building.
-Right.

893
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:48,012
So we'll be together the whole time.

894
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:49,246
Even at the airport?

895
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:50,681
Of course. You know it.

896
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:52,950
At the souvenir shop, at the airport,

897
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:54,351
even in the car ride home.

898
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:57,121
When I see you, I can't help but smile.

899
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:58,456
TOUCHED

900
00:40:58,522 --> 00:40:59,490
It's strange.

901
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:01,826
Maybe we were lovers in a past life.

902
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:04,695
I loved you… No, wait.
You must have really loved me.

903
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:07,264
That must be why I'm so drawn to you
in this life.

904
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:09,834
-We must be bound by our past lives.
-You think?

905
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,670
-I had such a good time. Thank you.
-Thank you.

906
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:14,672
Is that a wrap?

907
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:16,974
A wrap.

908
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,442
Will you, Gabee,

909
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:21,979
in your chill and cool manner,
do a hand slate for us?

910
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:23,013
I'll do it here.

911
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,615
That's a wrap, everyone.

912
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:29,720
Three, two, one!

913
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:33,691
GREAT WORK, EVERYONE

914
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:39,530
GABEE

915
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:47,171
DO-YEON

916
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:55,346
GABEE AND DO-YEON

917
00:41:57,915 --> 00:41:58,816
HERE I AM!

918
00:41:58,883 --> 00:41:59,884
BUSTING THE DOOR IN

919
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,352
TO OUR FIFTH DESTINATION

920
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:03,120
We're in Yeongam, in South Jeolla.

921
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:06,023
The travel buddy
I'll be exploring Yeongam with

922
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,558
is my favorite variety show idol.

923
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:09,994
ZHANG HAO
RISING STAR IN THE VARIETY SCENE

924
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,896
I came with a concept. And a gift.

925
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:13,764
-Anything you want to do?
-Are you the host?

926
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:16,467
BOLDLY EYEING DO-YEON'S GIG

927
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,636
WELCOME TO ZHANG HAO'S WORLD

928
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,337
THE FIRST RULE OF ZHANG HAO'S WORLD

929
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:21,772
BE AS CUTE AS HAO

930
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:24,909
A DIFFERENT KIND OF CUTE

931
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:27,044
LET'S LEARN FROM THE BEST

932
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:29,013
SECOND RULE: EAT WELL

933
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:31,115
ONE-BITE FIGS

934
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:34,184
CAN'T RESIST THAT KOREAN BEEF

935
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:36,987
A SYMPHONY OF YUMMY NOISES

936
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,455
THE BEST MUKBANGER

937
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:40,090
BUT THEIR LAST MEAL WON'T BE EASY

938
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:41,191
I just made eye contact.

939
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:45,563
WILL HAO BE CROWNED

940
00:42:45,629 --> 00:42:47,498
