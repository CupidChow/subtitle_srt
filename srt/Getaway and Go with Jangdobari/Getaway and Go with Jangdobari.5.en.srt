1
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,839
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

2
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:07,507
Everyone, I'm currently here

3
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:08,408
in Wando!

4
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:09,509
THE ONE AND ONLY WANDO!

5
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:11,511
WITH TRAVEL BUDDY HA-JUN,
A TRUE WANDO LOCAL

6
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:13,480
-You're the promotional ambassador.
-Yes.

7
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:15,181
Name five Wando islands.

8
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:18,351
Nohwa, Bogil, Soan,
Cheongsan, and Saengil.

9
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:21,287
-What flower represents Cheongsando?
-Canola flower.

10
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,590
PASSED THE TEST
WHICH CALLED FOR A CELEBRATION

11
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:25,225
I also heard you were the founder.

12
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,527
It was Double M. "Move Master."

13
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,195
I dreamed of being a celeb from then.

14
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:30,864
Do you still crave dancing?

15
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:31,798
No, not at all.

16
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,700
Your dance performance compilations.

17
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,802
IN RESPONSE
TO DO-YEON'S MODEST DANCE MOVES

18
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,137
HE RELEASED HIS INNER DANCER

19
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,905
This is fresher than any cutlassfish.

20
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,206
It's alive and kicking!

21
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:41,141
Wanna go to school?

22
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,242
I'd love to go.

23
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:44,077
I've been meaning to go there sometime.

24
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:46,913
Some current members of Double M
will be joining us.

25
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,114
Really?

26
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,283
They think we're shooting
a Netflix documentary.

27
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,318
A documentary about my life?

28
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,219
A SURPRISE VISIT…!

29
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,090
WITH BUNDLES OF DANCE IN HAND,
WE'RE OFF TO HA-JUN'S SCHOOL

30
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,925
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

31
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,194
-Only the gym hasn't changed.
-This building?

32
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,464
I definitely remember the gym being here.

33
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:05,999
Did you hang out there a lot?

34
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,835
-Because you liked sports?
-I went there to dance.

35
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:12,238
So you are approaching your old stage.

36
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,076
-Wi Ha-jun's stage.
-My stage, here I come.

37
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:20,480
"I'm Wi Ha-jun.
A dancer's blood still runs in me."

38
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:23,483
To meet your successors.

39
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,118
EPISODE 5: I'M A SEXY GUY…
SWEET LIKE DALGONA

40
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,793
I've seen this dance in challenges.

41
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,761
Wow.

42
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,466
FEELING THE BEAT

43
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:41,334
VIBING

44
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,269
HAHA

45
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,375
-Wow.
-Hello.

46
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,677
MEETING HIS DOUBLE M SUCCESSORS

47
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:51,778
-Wow.
-What the…

48
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:52,679
Is this a dream?

49
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:54,514
COMMOTION

50
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:57,450
Hello, we're here to shoot
Who is Wi Ha-jun?, a Netflix documentary.

51
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,552
I'm Wi Ha-jun,
the star of this documentary.

52
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:03,022
Everyone, he's not an AI.
It's actually him in the flesh!

53
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:04,657
-Hello.
-Hello, sir!

54
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,160
Thank you for the show.

55
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,061
SHY

56
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,929
Why are you guys running away?

57
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,431
Please come closer.

58
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,299
He won't bite. Go ahead, poke him!

59
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:14,667
It's him in the flesh.

60
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:15,935
IF YOU INSIST, POKE

61
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,206
-Do you have a team greeting?
-Wait, do you?

62
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:23,176
-One, two, three.
-Hello, we're Double M.

63
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,444
I'm so happy to meet you.

64
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:25,712
TRYING THEIR SIGNATURE POSE

65
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:26,779
How adorable.

66
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:30,216
What is this? Is this your greeting pose?

67
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:32,085
-It's an upside-down "M."
-"W."

68
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,455
I see. You do know
that he's the founder, don't you?

69
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,390
-Yes.
-This is so surreal.

70
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,325
Let's sit. We don't need to be standing.

71
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,461
You must be exhausted from dancing.

72
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,496
Wow, this is so surreal.

73
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:44,831
What dances do you do?

74
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,934
We copy dances from popular dance shows.

75
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,502
-So mainly choreo?
-Yes.

76
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,072
You know your stuff.

77
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,542
-I just tried acting tough.
-Wow, choreo?

78
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:59,612
Do you normally look at these mirrors
and practice here in this gym?

79
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,315
We have a practice room
in the school building over there.

80
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,484
-You have a practice room?
-A small one, yes.

81
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:05,685
Why? Did you not…

82
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:08,488
We just danced in the back of classrooms
and in corridors.

83
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,857
We only used the gym toward the end.

84
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,726
The club you founded back then
is still alive and well today.

85
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:16,329
-What a remarkable legacy.
-I'm amazed.

86
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,932
What is the club's reputation like
at school?

87
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,733
-It's popular.
-The most popular.

88
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,569
-Is that right?
-Of course it is.

89
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:23,970
Your club's done well.

90
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,638
How about some pizza, then?

91
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,507
-That would be great.
-It would?

92
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,709
Ha-jun bought you some pizza.

93
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:32,278
-Thank you.
-Come on, it's nothing.

94
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,682
-Isn't that your place?
-It is.

95
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,951
How did you know to buy it from here?

96
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,485
It's my mother's shop.

97
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,753
-What, really?
-Yes.

98
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,721
The pizza shop is…

99
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,089
-Really?
-His mother's.

100
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,190
It's my mom's shop.

101
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:45,825
Wow, what a pleasant surprise.

102
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,160
What's your name?

103
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,761
My name's Kim Hyeon.

104
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:50,496
I'm Hyeon too.

105
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,898
-Wait, what?
-What?

106
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,033
-His real name.
-I'm Hyeon-i.

107
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,235
-Hyeon-i?
-Hyeon-i.

108
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,837
-"Hyeon," as in kind?
-No, the character for "appear."

109
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,038
I use the same one.

110
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,808
Most people use "hyeon," meaning "kind."

111
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:03,576
Wait, hold up.

112
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,178
Maybe you'll also become an actor.

113
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,147
You're giggling!

114
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,917
If you want to eat with your hands,
eat these wet wipes.

115
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,253
-Wet wipes.
-Eat these wet wipes.

116
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,457
-"Eat these wet wipes"?
-Shall we eat them?

117
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,592
-Eat the wet wipes…
-What's going on?

118
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:22,462
-What did I do?
-You said eat the wet wipes.

119
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,064
HOW EMBARRASSING

120
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:28,034
You can be on TV
even if you spew nonsense.

121
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,271
Let me dig in first.

122
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:33,273
Thank you for the food, Hyeon's mom.

123
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,142
Although Ha-jun paid for it.

124
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,077
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you.

125
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:39,979
Now that we all have a slice,

126
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,281
could Ha-jun make a toast?

127
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:42,181
OUT OF THE BLUE

128
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:43,349
-Sounds great.
-Sure does.

129
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:47,253
Well, it's so great to meet all of my…

130
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,187
My successors…

131
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:49,255
PLEASE SAVE ME

132
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,391
It's very surreal,
and I'm happy to meet you all.

133
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:56,296
And thank you for doing an awesome job
of keeping the club alive.

134
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:59,465
I hope you all enjoy dancing together,
study hard, and take care of yourselves.

135
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:00,366
Thank you all.

136
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,267
Thank you.

137
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:02,635
Stay healthy, everyone.

138
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:03,770
GLAD TO MEET YOU ALL

139
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,838
Thank you for the food, Mother.

140
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:10,176
It's so weird seeing you here.
I always see you in Shorts.

141
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:11,477
Isn't it surreal?

142
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,079
-I even saw you yesterday.
-Saw what?

143
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,214
You killing time at an awards ceremony.

144
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:16,983
I love that clip.

145
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,418
-Me too. I watch it often.
-You do?

146
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,319
TOUCHED

147
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:21,587
The two of us saw Salon Drip yesterday.

148
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,922
You did?

149
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,424
I'm so grateful.

150
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,591
YOU'RE THE BEST

151
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,227
SO ARE YOU
NO, YOU ARE

152
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,363
Can I ask you what your dream is?

153
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,365
Or is that cringe?
How about what you want to do?

154
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,967
(WHISPERING)

155
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,036
What is it?

156
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,905
To appear on Salon Drip…

157
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:40,573
Salon Drip?

158
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,641
YOU'RE ADORABLE

159
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:44,143
You're so cute.
Did you tell her to say that?

160
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,112
-She's a huge fan of yours.
-You are?

161
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,414
-You never know what might happen.
-Right.

162
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,450
-You might meet her down the line.
-Exactly.

163
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:54,587
I'll do everything I can
to stick around in the industry.

164
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:57,090
You never know when we might meet again.

165
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:59,092
-You might meet in the future.
-Yeah.

166
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,295
Have you guys ever seen
clips of him dancing?

167
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,430
-Dancing?
-We couldn't find any.

168
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,432
There aren't any.
I've had them all removed.

169
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:10,036
Could you perhaps show us right here?
Maybe freestyle something.

170
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,637
You guys are so forward!

171
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,207
Or just any choreography that you know.

172
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:15,842
A dance you've had your eye on.

173
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,777
-I know nothing.
-Just a simple dance.

174
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,879
When you were dancing "like JENNIE,"

175
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:24,016
he was holding the pizza boxes
but couldn't keep his arms and legs still.

176
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,318
So I thought, "Wow,

177
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,819
he can't resist a beat."

178
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:27,787
I don't know the dance.

179
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:30,323
-Then we could…
-We can teach you.

180
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,324
We could teach you.

181
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,992
-The one you just did?
-Yes.

182
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,461
You were grooving to the beat, though.

183
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,897
Then teach me. I can try to copy you guys.

184
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,299
If you also teach Do-yeon…

185
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,236
That sounds great. All of us together.

186
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:44,737
We might be here all night.

187
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:45,638
That's fine.

188
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,807
-You'd pull an all-nighter?
-Why not?

189
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:48,975
-Let's go.
-All right.

190
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,243
Let's clear this up, then.

191
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:51,444
TIME TO LEARN SOME CHOREO

192
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,946
You should come to the front,
closer to the mirrors.

193
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:58,317
Please remember that you have
one ace student and one log.

194
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:01,754
Today, we'll be learning
one of the trendiest songs at the moment.

195
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,757
"like JENNIE," which played at Coachella.

196
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,325
-Okay.
-Okay, JENNIE.

197
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:10,029
Sir, I have no basics, so could you
teach me a beginner's version?

198
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,931
-Sure.
-Please go easy on me.

199
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:12,832
Here we go.

200
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,201
Now, when the song starts,

201
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,637
you show off your biceps like this.

202
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,672
It's this pose, but you start here.

203
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,240
Grab… Do we start here?

204
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,809
Yes, bring it in from here.

205
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:23,709
-Like this?
-Yes.

206
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:24,811
What about this hand?

207
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:27,980
-This hand is all about the vibe.
-Right, this thing?

208
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,816
-You need swag.
-Right, swag.

209
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:31,584
MOVE MASTER'S REVVING UP

210
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:32,618
Is this right?

211
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:33,886
Three, four…

212
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,788
And jump ever so slightly.

213
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,557
Wait, this is Heo Kyeong-hwan's…

214
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,158
STRANGELY FAMILIAR MOVES

215
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,293
It is very similar.

216
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,395
-I'm good at that.
-You're right.

217
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:43,930
Then we raise our hands.

218
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:45,998
-Raise our hands.
-Lean back on one side.

219
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:49,135
And say, "Teacher, I'm here!"

220
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,436
SO CUTE

221
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:51,771
What if my hip hurts?

222
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,806
-Just do it slightly.
-"Teacher, I'm here"?

223
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,475
Teacher, I'm here!

224
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,943
-I'm here!
-I'm here!

225
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:00,880
And bring this arm down
as you thump the ground lightly.

226
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,381
GETTING INTO THE THICK OF IT

227
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,852
Just kick the ground lightly
and turn around.

228
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,387
And turn back.

229
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:10,456
One, two…

230
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,558
THE DANCE IS GETTING COMPLICATED

231
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,459
Three, four.

232
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:16,629
Step one foot forward
and pull forward like so.

233
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:17,630
-Forward?
-Yes.

234
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,632
MOVE MASTER'S OLD GROOVE IS AWAKENING

235
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,667
Isn't there a move like this?

236
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,202
It's a little harder, so…

237
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,539
-Your teacher, no, Ha-jun, can handle it.
-You can teach me.

238
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:29,942
-We might as well go all out.
-Okay, I'll teach it to you.

239
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,478
One, two, three, four.

240
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:33,546
SERIOUS ABOUT DANCE

241
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:35,014
And go in.

242
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,215
HIS BODY KNOWS WHAT TO DO

243
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,684
Wow, you're awesome.

244
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:41,420
TOSS

245
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:42,755
-Is that good?
-Yes!

246
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,358
-You're amazing.
-He's really good.

247
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,093
That was so cool.

248
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,728
I saw them earlier.

249
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:51,130
-You're great.
-Well, I saw you guys earlier.

250
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,066
Now that I think about it,
we all have "nie."

251
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,134
JENNIE of Coachella.

252
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,204
Wando High's star Hyeonie.

253
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,939
-And Do-yeonie.
-Oh, Yeonie?

254
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,841
We have Korea's three hottest "nie"s.

255
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:03,876
How nice of you to say so.

256
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,611
Shall we try it with the track?

257
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,716
UNFORTUNATELY,
IT'S A DIFFERENT TRACK DUE TO COPYRIGHT

258
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,649
RIPPED THE STAGE TO SHREDS!

259
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,785
Man, I don't know.

260
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,587
You both did a great job.

261
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:48,688
Not at all.

262
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,689
Thanks for teaching us.

263
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,057
Thank you for teaching us.

264
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,659
I think I'll head home now.

265
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:56,729
I'll take it on three.

266
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,731
One, two, three!

267
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,233
MOVE MASTER LIVES ON

268
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,002
Wow, thank you, everyone!

269
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:04,937
-Thank you.
-Thanks, guys.

270
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:08,240
A HEARTWARMING TIME WITH THE STUDENTS
THANKS TO THEIR WARM WELCOME

271
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:09,976
Let me open the door for you.

272
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,177
TIME TO HEAD TO CHEONGSANDO

273
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,678
-Thank you.
-Goodbye, then.

274
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:13,579
-Sorry?
-Goodbye.

275
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,214
No, come on.

276
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,849
-Take care…
-I know you'd do this.

277
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,751
Young man, please don't do this to me.

278
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,987
Please don't. You promised not to go home.

279
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:23,356
-I'll get in on that side.
-You won't leave me, will you?

280
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:24,857
Careful now.

281
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:27,059
ANXIOUS

282
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:30,997
I was scared for a second there.

283
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,734
LUCKILY, HE DIDN'T RUN AWAY

284
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,902
I bet the club's group chat is going wild.

285
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,674
This will be such
a precious memory for them.

286
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:45,811
With people who hope to break into
the entertainment industry,

287
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:48,147
you never know
when your paths will cross again.

288
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,048
Exactly.

289
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,617
I never imagined meeting you.

290
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,887
I loved Gag Concert.
I've been watching you since then.

291
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,422
The same goes for me.

292
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,457
I'd watch Netflix
and think, "Wow, Wi Ha-jun."

293
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,127
"Ha-jun's coming on our show."

294
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:02,361
"Sorry, what did you say?"

295
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,398
ARRIVED AFTER SOME WHOLESOME CHAT

296
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:06,932
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

297
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,168
-Hello.
-Hello.

298
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,237
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

299
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,773
-Hello.
-Well, who do we have here?

300
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,174
-Wow, it's you!
-Hello.

301
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,976
WELCOMED THE WANDO WAY

302
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:20,613
Hey, the boat's huge.
Are they all this massive?

303
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,848
Yes, they're about this big.

304
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,884
-Wow, it's huge.
-It is.

305
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:28,888
-You've never been to Cheongsando?
-I haven't.

306
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,290
WANDO FERRY TERMINAL

307
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,191
50 MINUTES BY BOAT

308
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,260
CHEONGSANDO CHEONGSAN PORT

309
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:37,530
-Any tips for eating abalone?
-Abalone?

310
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:40,499
Abalone is best eaten as hoe.

311
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,568
If they're fresh, eat them raw.

312
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:44,937
Or you can grill them with meat.

313
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:46,272
With pork belly.

314
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:47,973
-In the pig fat?
-Yes.

315
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,842
-That sounds delicious.
-It sure is.

316
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,812
And we normally eat ramyeon
after barbecue, right?

317
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,780
A way to make the abalone more tender

318
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:57,750
is to blanch raw abalone in ramyeon broth
like shabu-shabu.

319
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:58,884
Slightly blanch them.

320
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,520
Blanch the raw abalone.

321
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:02,855
To cook them slightly?

322
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,423
Then they're much more tender.

323
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:06,892
-Sounds good.
-It's not a crunch.

324
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,494
More like a scrinch-scronch.

325
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,995
Like a crumpling sound?

326
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:11,697
What does that even mean?

327
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,632
But I think I get the gist.

328
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,000
-It just melts.
-It does?

329
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,937
That sounds delicious. And what ramyeon?

330
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:19,438
Squid Champong.

331
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:23,909
-Because you were in Squid Game?
-I swear that's not why.

332
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,044
UNDENIABLE LOVE FOR SQUID

333
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:28,380
-I've loved it since I was a kid.
-You have?

334
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,618
Ladies and gentlemen,

335
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:36,122
our boat will be arriving
at Cheongsando Port shortly.

336
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:37,623
The view is awesome.

337
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,759
Would you look at that?

338
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,962
Looks like the home of a mountain spirit.

339
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:47,166
Can you ever get used to such a view?
Maybe it's nothing exciting for you.

340
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:50,035
-It does look pretty cool today.
-Right?

341
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,937
You don't get to see this often.

342
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:53,973
Wow, this is awesome.

343
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,243
Wow, what's that?
Yeah, a view like that can never be…

344
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:58,811
-What a view.
-I rarely see that.

345
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,012
It looks like a painting.

346
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,015
FINALLY ARRIVED AT CHEONGSANDO

347
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,016
We're in Cheongsando.

348
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,653
So I've finally arrived in Cheongsando.

349
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,422
This place feels quite different.

350
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:11,724
Shall we go to eat hoe?

351
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,858
I'd love to.

352
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,494
This is great. They have a hoe market.

353
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,062
So they have a seafood market.

354
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,497
-Hello.
-Hello.

355
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:19,799
-Welcome.
-Hello.

356
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:21,433
-Hello.
-Welcome.

357
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,103
What is this?

358
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,404
-It's cuttlefish.
-It is?

359
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,407
Aren't cuttlefish very rare?

360
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,809
We get a lot of them these days.

361
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,710
-Are they in season?
-Yes.

362
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:32,745
-They're scallops.
-Right.

363
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:33,946
They're huge.

364
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:35,948
They're big this time of year.

365
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,751
What's in season at the moment?

366
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:42,188
-Cuttlefish, abalones, and sea snails.
-Okay.

367
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:43,289
For two people…

368
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,257
If it's just the two of you…

369
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,893
-I'll give you the biggest abalones.
-Yes, thank you.

370
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,894
Thank you.

371
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:51,530
One cuttlefish.

372
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,499
-I'll give you a smaller one.
-Sure.

373
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,769
-This is fascinating.
-I've never seen cuttlefish like this.

374
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,003
Four-horned sea snails.

375
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:01,273
Aren't horned sea snails also a delicacy?

376
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,909
-They're picked by haenyeo.
-Wow, they look cool.

377
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,144
Can I try touching this?

378
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,445
-Go ahead.
-Do they bite?

379
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,280
They don't bite, but they shoot ink.

380
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,184
Wow.

381
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:15,354
What do you think, Mr. Squid Game?

382
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,256
Cuttlefish game?

383
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:19,892
It feels so strange.

384
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,328
-Thank you for letting me touch it.
-Pleasure.

385
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,163
That was like a clip from Hometown Report.

386
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:28,133
-Try holding a sea cucumber.
-Sea cucumber? May I?

387
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:30,236
Can I really?

388
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:31,203
Red sea cucumbers.

389
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,607
-You might as well give her a big one.
-Can I really touch it?

390
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:35,541
They don't bite.

391
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,745
-Just grab it.
-Go right in with your hand.

392
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,719
I come all the way from Seoul
to get me some o' this!

393
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,289
It feels really weird.

394
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,758
Shouldn't we also get some hoe?

395
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,727
-Some flounder hoe.
-Whatever you recommend.

396
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:55,928
Flounder is in season.

397
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,096
-Okay, then.
-Flounder?

398
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:58,831
-Then one flounder too.
-Yes.

399
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,466
-Make it delicious, please.
-Please.

400
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:03,235
ABALONE, RED SEA CUCUMBER,
HORNED SEA SNAILS

401
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:05,471
CHEWY FLOUNDER HOE

402
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:07,706
SLICING THE CUTTLEFISH
INTO BITE-SIZED PIECES

403
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:09,341
HEARTY

404
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,611
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you so much.

405
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,514
There's a lot.

406
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,483
I've never eaten like this
in Wando before.

407
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,686
It's nice that they have this market here.

408
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,088
We don't have hoe markets
like this back home.

409
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,592
-Bring your parents sometime.
-I think I might.

410
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,327
-It's a hefty portion too.
-Yes.

411
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,462
I've never seen sea cucumbers this big.

412
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,531
-You're having a feast.
-Yes, we are!

413
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,939
So we can eat outside.

414
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:43,475
-Oh my God.
-With a view of the ocean.

415
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:46,445
This is great.

416
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:49,214
DINING AREA OVERLOOKING THE SEA

417
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,282
This is great.

418
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,889
This seems to be the perfect time of day.
Nice and breezy.

419
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,024
-Would you like some beer?
-Yes, please.

420
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:02,261
-You like beer, don't you?
-I do.

421
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:03,228
We don't have to…

422
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:04,897
Thank you.

423
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,033
-I'm thirsty, so…
-Sure.

424
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,803
-Glad to meet you.
-Glad to meet you.

425
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:14,306
FIRST GULP OF COLD BEER

426
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:16,375
SAVORING THE TASTE

427
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:21,080
NOD OF APPROVAL

428
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,915
Shall we go home now?

429
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,386
That's not a bad shout.

430
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,357
But there are no more boats
that head out today.

431
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:32,291
Oh, right.

432
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,493
-Either way, you're stuck here.
-Yes.

433
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,295
-Have some abalone.
-Okay.

434
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,497
-Please enjoy.
-Yes, enjoy.

435
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:39,999
I'll try some sea cucumber.

436
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:42,267
NOM

437
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:49,541
It's delicious.

438
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:52,678
They're bigger, so there's more bite.

439
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,380
They normally just melt away.

440
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,148
I'll try some sea snail.

441
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:58,250
CRUNCH

442
00:16:58,317 --> 00:16:59,618
It's really good.

443
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,787
They're similar to abalone.

444
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:02,988
Right?

445
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,557
Now, let's reflect as we eat.

446
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:08,027
-We were travel buddies today.
-Yes.

447
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:10,229
Did I meet up to your expectations?

448
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,064
Any different from what you imagined?

449
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,799
I felt more comfortable than I'd expected.

450
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:14,800
You did?

451
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:18,003
Then what were you most worried about
before coming on this trip?

452
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,139
-I'm the only guest.
-Yes.

453
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,607
I worried I may not be entertaining.

454
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:23,475
When did that worry go away?

455
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,578
-Or is it ongoing?
-I may still be worrying tomorrow.

456
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:28,847
Until the very end?

457
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,050
But, throughout the shoot,

458
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,819
didn't you think, "Oh, this isn't so bad"?

459
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,155
I changed my way of thinking mid-shoot.

460
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,256
How exactly?

461
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:39,425
I just figured
I'd talk to you like a friend.

462
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,894
Then we might capture some funny moments.

463
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,163
That's a great way to think about it.

464
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,398
Not try to force anything.

465
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:50,269
Then is there a moment
that you thought was really funny?

466
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,072
I guess when we were watching
my cringe moments together.

467
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:54,706
I thought that was…

468
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:57,843
You're talking about the moment
of our trip when I was most excited.

469
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,044
As long as you're happy.

470
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:02,214
Braised cutlassfish
with a side of memories?

471
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:03,215
But you know, right?

472
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,651
I wouldn't make fun of something
that's really cringeworthy.

473
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:08,087
We'd both be embarrassed,
so I would've glossed over it.

474
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:10,122
But you were so adorable.

475
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,190
…NOD

476
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,091
Right.

477
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,864
There aren't many shows
where people travel as a pair, are there?

478
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,265
It rarely happens.

479
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:22,134
You're right. We're trying something new.

480
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,769
I've never seen a show like this.

481
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,305
You must feel a lot of pressure.

482
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,774
But I think that's why,

483
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:32,144
when something's funny,
I feel an even bigger thrill.

484
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:34,213
Because I'm so worried,

485
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,883
if something is somewhat entertaining,
I feel over the moon.

486
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:39,418
It's all an adventure.

487
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:44,523
I agreed to come on the show
without much hesitation or thought.

488
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:49,194
Then it dawned on me
that I'd be alone with you, Do-yeon,

489
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,863
on an overnight trip.

490
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:53,265
Plus, I'm not the talkative type.

491
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,967
So I was worried too.

492
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,937
So, whenever you said you felt at home,
it made me ecstatic.

493
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,339
Honestly, I've felt so at ease.

494
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,543
-I'll believe you then.
-Of course, I only speak truths.

495
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,712
SUSPICIOUS GAZE…

496
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:08,180
You don't trust easily, do you?

497
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,348
I'm just worried.

498
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:10,782
Please don't worry.

499
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:14,653
I think I got off on the wrong foot
by urging you to feel at home.

500
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,023
No matter how much you urge,
you can't fake comfort.

501
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,625
-Is that right?
-Yes.

502
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:22,728
We prepared some ramyeon to keep you warm.

503
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,097
-Squid Cham?
-Squid Cham.

504
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,565
Wait, really?

505
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:29,501
-Wow, that's awesome.
-Okay, some noodles won't hurt.

506
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:32,237
BOILING THE WATER

507
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,706
Any tips for cooking ramyeon?

508
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:37,075
Nothing special, really.

509
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:38,744
I add the spices and veggies first.

510
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:41,413
And are you meticulous about the water?

511
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,448
No, when I used to eat a lot of ramyeon,

512
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,417
I'd just eyeball it.

513
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:48,854
When you're alone, do you eat one packet?

514
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,657
Yes, though when I was younger,

515
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:52,925
I'd eat four or five.

516
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,026
-At once?
-Yes.

517
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,628
How many packs of Chapagetti do you eat?

518
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,730
One Chapagetti is never enough.

519
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,832
-You need to cook two.
-Two.

520
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,335
The best way to eat Chapagetti
is in big mouthfuls.

521
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,704
-Savor the floury noodles.
-Yes, with an egg.

522
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,407
Jjajangmyeon or jjamppong?

523
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:09,308
Jjajangmyeon.

524
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,342
TOUCHÉ

525
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:11,777
Stir-fried or regular jjajangmyeon?

526
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:13,011
-Regular for me.
-Me too.

527
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:13,946
Original jjajangmyeon.

528
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,782
We have a lot in common.

529
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:17,683
We do.

530
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:21,286
When we were talking about MBTI,
I felt a sense of camaraderie.

531
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:25,090
Then are there any countries
or places you want to visit?

532
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,226
I've never been to Bali.

533
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:28,794
-Bali?
-Hawaii and Bali.

534
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,562
So you like resorts?

535
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,030
I've never been to a resort.

536
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,601
So I'd like to go.

537
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,569
-Where do you like to go?
-Me?

538
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,204
Maybe Europe? Have you traveled a lot?

539
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,806
No, not really.

540
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:43,475
-I recently went for the first time.
-Where to?

541
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:44,643
Rome.

542
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,045
-I was in Rome recently.
-Really?

543
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:48,413
-When?
-In March.

544
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,448
-Oh, March?
-Yes.

545
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:50,582
I went two weeks ago.

546
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,151
-Really?
-It was my first time ever.

547
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:54,686
It was my first time too.

548
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,154
-Wait, first time in Europe?
-Yes.

549
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:59,825
Strangely enough, I'd been to Italy
a couple of times for work,

550
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:01,560
but I'd never gotten to travel.

551
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,862
-You'd just fly back after work?
-Exactly.

552
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,998
And this time, I felt it was such a shame.

553
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:08,433
I wasn't in the middle
of filming anything,

554
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,501
so I went on a trip.

555
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:10,769
What did you get up to?

556
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,337
I saw everything to be seen there.

557
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,106
-Did you see the Colosseum?
-Come on!

558
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,541
-Did you go there?
-I shadowboxed there.

559
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,844
You shadowboxed in front of the Colosseum?

560
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,545
It was a dream of mine.

561
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:24,950
One of your dreams was to shadowbox
at the Colosseum? Why?

562
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,385
It's just badass.

563
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:29,288
Did you want to feel
how they felt back then?

564
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:30,889
-How the gladiators…
-Yes.

565
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,292
-How they must have felt?
-Feel their hearts and spirits.

566
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:35,294
We don't have a ladle.

567
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:37,996
It was my first time, but I loved it.

568
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:40,399
-I want to go again.
-So you've been to Rome.

569
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,935
MEANWHILE, THE RAMYEON IS READY

570
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:45,237
YOU FIRST

571
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:47,673
SLURP

572
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:54,513
SLURP

573
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:55,681
You're a great cook.

574
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:56,615
-Is it okay?
-Yeah!

575
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,216
You should try the abalone.

576
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:02,821
ADDING IN THE ABALONE

577
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,122
The noodles are so good.

578
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:05,023
LOCKED IN

579
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,358
Like shabu-shabu?

580
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,427
ABALONE SLIGHTLY COOKED
IN THE RAMYEON SOUP

581
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:10,028
MOUTHFUL

582
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:11,930
-Whoa… Hey!
-Right?

583
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:13,965
It's a scrinch-scronch, right?

584
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,368
SLIGHTLY COOKED TENDER ABALONE

585
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:17,436
They're delicious.

586
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,172
Wowee.

587
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:21,840
It's an entirely different dish.

588
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,942
-I'll have some abalone.
-Please.

589
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:25,877
Aren't they really tender?

590
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,312
-They're so good.
-Right?

591
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:28,880
It's a completely different dish.

592
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:31,783
People typically cook abalone
with the noodles.

593
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,452
But this way, they're more tender.

594
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,554
You took them out
when they had the perfect texture.

595
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,422
I think I should finish with this.

596
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:38,357
Me too.

597
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:42,527
SQUID CHAMPONG AND ABALONE
A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN

598
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:45,397
Are there any behind-the-scenes anecdotes
from Squid Game?

599
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,699
-Did you meet up after filming?
-No.

600
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,901
-After Season 1, everyone was busy.
-I see.

601
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:51,837
After Season 1 dropped,
there was the pandemic.

602
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,638
Which was a shame.

603
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:57,676
If it hadn't been for the pandemic,
we would have toured the world.

604
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:58,744
It was such a shame.

605
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,346
And I'm the only one
who never got to go to the US.

606
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:02,347
Why?

607
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:03,415
At the time,

608
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:06,418
just after the release,
I was filming back-to-back.

609
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:10,355
And when you got back from somewhere far
like the US, you had to quarantine.

610
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,124
Of course.

611
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,359
So I just didn't have the time.

612
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,328
Then what about after Season 2?

613
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,364
Before its release,
we went to Italy for promo.

614
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,434
Jung-jae, myself, and the director.

615
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:24,870
It was before Season 2's release,

616
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:27,305
so we went as actors from Season 1.

617
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:28,707
It was a great experience.

618
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:32,210
Traveling to Italy
to promote a Korean production…

619
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,379
And it was such a spectacle.

620
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,581
It all felt like a dream.

621
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:39,718
-Is this real?
-Like something you'd never get used to.

622
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:44,523
It amazes me how all those people
from different cultures connected with it.

623
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,424
Absolutely.

624
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,326
I think there was a lot
that audiences could relate to.

625
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:50,162
The director and crew made it so.

626
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:54,633
It must be a thrill
to promote a successful show.

627
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:58,837
Or were you even more anxious
for Season 3 to be just as successful?

628
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:01,206
At the end of last year,
during our promos,

629
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,341
I struggled to enjoy the whole process.

630
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:05,277
If anything, I hated it.

631
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:06,178
How come?

632
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,346
I don't know.
I think I was just being silly.

633
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:09,748
Doing the promos?

634
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:12,317
Well, the show was such a smash success.

635
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:15,387
-Everyone kept calling me a "world star."
-Right.

636
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,824
I'd snap at my friends, like,
"Don't say that. It stresses me out."

637
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:19,825
Why?

638
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:23,795
I think I struggle most
with disappointment.

639
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:26,731
So I never get my hopes up.

640
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:31,837
But, looking back, don't you regret
not enjoying the moment?

641
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:34,506
-Doesn't it feel like such a shame?
-You're right.

642
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:37,809
So this time around, I tried to loosen up
and enjoy the process.

643
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:40,512
Since my debut,
I've never enjoyed a presser more.

644
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:42,814
Is that right? That's good.

645
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:46,184
So that day, for me, is a day
that I really liked myself.

646
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:48,453
I went out like this.

647
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,688
As you should!

648
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:51,389
I went out like this.

649
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,891
"Yeah, I'm the guy."

650
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,826
Saying, "Yeah, it's me!"

651
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:57,929
"In whatever way,
I'm in this project once more."

652
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:03,368
And I went to each and every cast member
and told them I enjoyed the show.

653
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:07,239
I've never felt better
about the way I composed myself.

654
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:09,941
Good for you! It would've been a shame
if you hadn't enjoyed it.

655
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,076
Exactly.

656
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:13,478
Do you tend to beat yourself up a bit?

657
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:14,646
Yes, excessively so.

658
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,249
Do you try not to get too excited?

659
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:19,518
-And hold yourself back?
-You're right.

660
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:22,487
In some ways,
it's because I take everything to heart.

661
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:25,056
The world changes so fast,

662
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:28,326
and things like popularity and fame
are so fleeting.

663
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:30,829
-Everything's so fast.
-Right.

664
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:33,431
-In a month or two, it's gone.
-At a frightening pace.

665
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:35,901
I don't want to be disappointed.

666
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:39,771
I guess I'm being defensive
and telling myself from the start,

667
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:43,608
"No, you're not popular.
You don't have any fans. No nothing."

668
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,545
I'm constantly telling myself
these things.

669
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:48,480
-"Nothing's changed."
-Don't do that.

670
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:52,984
That way, I can feel grateful
whenever one or two people recognize me.

671
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,120
I thought like that in the past, at least.

672
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:56,888
-I'm not like that as much now.
-Good.

673
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:59,324
I go out and boast. Earlier too.

674
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,127
-I said, "I'm Wando's ambassador."
-Yes, do that.

675
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:03,595
If they don't know me, fine.

676
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:05,297
-Exactly.
-"But I'm Wando's ambassador."

677
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:06,731
"I'm so-and-so."

678
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:07,999
"I'll be on Jangdobari."

679
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,068
I'm dead serious.

680
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:11,503
That's a step too far.

681
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:14,272
That's a bit of a stretch.

682
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,141
Please don't go that far.

683
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,410
-You freaked me out.
-"I'm close with Do-yeon!"

684
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,178
I feel completely sober now.

685
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,613
But honestly, it's such a shame.

686
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,683
This might not be the best comparison,

687
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:28,520
but if you have gold and never wear it,
you'll regret it when it tarnishes.

688
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,555
"Dang, I should have worn it then!"

689
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:32,357
That sort of thing.

690
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,925
Like saving your favorite food,

691
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:36,528
only to spoil your appetite
on something else.

692
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,829
It would go to waste.

693
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:38,863
If you think about it,

694
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,299
popularity, joy, and happiness
all have an expiry date.

695
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:43,201
-There's a time to enjoy them.
-Yes.

696
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,970
I've learned that too.

697
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:47,572
You'll regret it later.
It's good you've changed.

698
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:50,442
I now try to be grateful
and enjoy things while I can.

699
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:51,710
Please do enjoy.

700
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,345
You should go home like this.

701
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:55,413
Just like that.

702
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:57,949
Blowing kisses to nobody.

703
00:26:58,016 --> 00:26:59,718
I think that's a good attitude.

704
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:03,021
There's one other thing
that you should be enjoying.

705
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:04,222
What might this be?

706
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,158
People Magazine in the US

707
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,895
selected you
as one of the "25 Sexiest Men on TV."

708
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:13,264
That was during Season 1.

709
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:14,766
But the reason was,

710
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:17,068
"He's gorgeous and sweet like dalgona."

711
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:20,939
Is that why you wore this dalgona color?

712
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:22,707
It was all planned!

713
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:26,678
He made dalgona just now.

714
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,546
Shall we try making some dalgona?

715
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:29,848
Then, back then…

716
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:32,183
I absolutely hated it at the time.

717
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,219
Nonsense! At times like that,

718
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:37,055
you should go to the bathroom
and do this sort of thing.

719
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:39,257
BANG… BANG…

720
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,392
You should do this.

721
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:43,995
You should have done that.

722
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:46,264
-So many awesome achievements.
-No, please.

723
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:50,101
At the time,
Squid Game was such a huge success.

724
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,971
Back then,
I wasn't able to relish any of it,

725
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:56,408
but after I made that list,
I started enjoying it more.

726
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:58,910
I believe I was the only Asian man.

727
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:02,580
And so I tried to adopt
the exact opposite perspective.

728
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:07,052
"I'm the only Asian.
I'm number one in Asia."

729
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:09,187
-Yeah!
-"I'm actually a sexy guy."

730
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:13,391
I was almost brainwashing myself.

731
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,994
But it did help in the way I see things.

732
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:18,096
-"Me?"
-"I'm a sexy guy."

733
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:19,497
"I'm Asia's…"

734
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:20,865
"I'm a sexy guy."

735
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,802
I brainwash myself like that.

736
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:26,971
"What's special about me?"

737
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,540
"What's my vantage point?"

738
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:30,108
"Man, there's nothing."

739
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,042
-"Hold on."
-But…

740
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:33,478
-"I'm a sexy guy."
-"Hang on."

741
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,879
"I'm a sexy guy!"

742
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:37,716
Shaving like this.

743
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,818
Do this sort of thing, you know?

744
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:40,819
Yes, dalgona?

745
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:46,558
Is there anything you're proud of
that sets you apart?

746
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:50,428
I think, as an actor,
my face carries a certain duality.

747
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:54,799
Ever since I was young,
I've looked very different when I smile.

748
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:56,267
Like a different person, almost.

749
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:57,335
You do.

750
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,739
I think, as long as my acting
lives up to it…

751
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:02,674
It's a huge advantage.

752
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:06,478
In the realm of film and television,

753
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:08,913
there aren't many actors
who've played both.

754
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:13,051
Villains or darker roles
and also younger love interests.

755
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:16,888
So I think that's one of my strengths.
If I can live up to the roles.

756
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:17,989
I have to agree.

757
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:20,658
There's so much in me
I haven't had the chance to show yet.

758
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:22,794
I was speaking in a dialect just earlier.

759
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:26,831
-Right, a different you.
-I could take on innocent roles too.

760
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:29,434
But people don't seek me out
for those roles just yet.

761
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:30,401
Right.

762
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:33,838
I thought you'd already shown us a lot,
but to think there's even more.

763
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,406
You are a sexy guy, after all.

764
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:39,377
Then, reflecting on our day today,

765
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:43,515
was there a moment that stood out,
that you enjoyed or made you happy?

766
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:44,516
Anything goes.

767
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:46,584
-It can be with me or without.
-Right.

768
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:49,020
I'd have to say the chat we had just now.

769
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:49,921
Right now?

770
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,557
-Me too.
-Really? Right.

771
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,325
It felt really special.

772
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:57,962
As if I were opening up to

773
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,198
a very old friend.

774
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:02,834
We covered a lot of ground too.

775
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,135
Some more serious topics.

776
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:08,039
I felt the same.
I thought it was a huge relief.

777
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:11,609
That you were willing to open up to me,
and that I also enjoyed this chat.

778
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:14,813
I totally forgot I even asked
if you were comfortable.

779
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:17,549
We were just having a conversation,
which was nice.

780
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:20,018
You made it so easy for me
that the words kept flowing.

781
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:22,320
-That's good.
-Honestly.

782
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:23,388
All right, then.

783
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:24,722
Asia's sexy guy.

784
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:27,325
-Shall we look forward to tomorrow…
-I'm one of 25 worldwide.

785
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:28,560
-Right, one of 25.
-Yes.

786
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,263
I think, my Wando friend,

787
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,998
you have plenty of self-love.

788
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,000
It's good to see.

789
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:38,403
This has been nice.

790
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:50,114
I hope you get a good night's rest.

791
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,717
Yes. I'm pretty sure I will.

792
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:54,052
I'll just watch some MMA.

793
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,554
So you really love MMA.

794
00:30:57,455 --> 00:31:00,024
How about learning some MMA tomorrow?

795
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:02,126
I'd be happy to teach you.

796
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,094
You would?

797
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:04,462
We'd use your long arms.

798
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,831
Teach you how to land a hit
while slipping back.

799
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:10,068
If I end up having fun,
I'll sign up for boxing classes.

800
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:12,237
Like Million Dollar Baby.

801
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:13,705
Million Dollar Baby?

802
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:15,206
ARRIVED WITH DREAMS OF BEING A BOXER

803
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,774
Wow, what's this?

804
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:18,042
This place is great.

805
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:19,143
COZY LODGING TO REST UP IN

806
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:21,446
What's this?

807
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:23,281
It's well decorated.

808
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:25,049
Tomorrow will be day two.

809
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,352
We're here in Cheongsando,

810
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:29,621
but we only got to experience it at night.

811
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:33,892
So we'll see Cheongsando's day
and go to visit a green barley field.

812
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,694
There are alleyways
where they filmed Sopyonje.

813
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:38,096
I've wanted to go there.

814
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:42,033
Have a good night's rest,
and tomorrow we wake at 7:30 a.m.

815
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:44,369
Yes, ma'am.

816
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:46,971
Get ready, and by 7:30 a.m. tomorrow,

817
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:48,907
we'll meet right here.

818
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:50,308
-Understood. Yes.
-Am I clear?

819
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:51,209
Yes, ma'am!

820
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,144
-Yes, ma'am!
-Sweet…

821
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:54,379
-Sweet dreams.
-Sweet dreams.

822
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:55,713
Now.

823
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,521
You finally get to call it a night.

824
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:07,091
Tell me how you found today.

825
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:08,826
I had fun.

826
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:10,328
-You had fun?
-Yes.

827
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:12,697
-Tomorrow will be even more fun.
-Yes, ma'am.

828
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:14,666
Sweet dreams.

829
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,134
Sweet dreams.

830
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:18,803
Look at the doggy!

831
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:19,704
It's so cute.

832
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:21,572
Sweet dreams.

833
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:22,840
You're so cute. Sweet dreams.

834
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:23,741
SWEET DREAMS, KIDS

835
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,843
-Where are our rooms?
-There are two rooms.

836
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,245
PICK YOUR OWN ROOMS

837
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:28,179
Right, our rooms.

838
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:31,049
Which one do you fancy?
They're called Dohyang and Sanhyang.

839
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,251
You should take the Dohyang room.

840
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:34,652
-Because I'm Do-yeon?
-Yes.

841
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:37,255
Okay, good night.
You should get a good night's sleep.

842
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:38,323
(SWEET DREAMS)

843
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:39,357
-Sweet dreams.
-Yes.

844
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:41,592
-Sweet dreams.
-Rest up.

845
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:43,027
-See you tomorrow.
-Rest up.

846
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:44,963
Good night, then.

847
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:47,532
Sweet dreams. See you tomorrow.

848
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:48,599
The room's lovely.

849
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,268
-Is it really?
-It's great. Wanna switch?

850
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:52,470
-I haven't seen my room yet.
-You haven't?

851
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:55,039
If you're unhappy with it,
I'd be willing to switch.

852
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:56,374
Go on and take a peek.

853
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,343
PEEK

854
00:32:58,409 --> 00:32:59,243
Wow.

855
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,712
-It's good.
-Then shall we switch?

856
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:01,746
-Sorry?
-Sorry?

857
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:04,782
-I'm happy with it.
-Yeah, so shall we switch?

858
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:05,717
I'm just joking.

859
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:08,086
Go on in. Good night!

860
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,587
-Good night.
-You too.

861
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:10,822
It's toasty in here.

862
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,329
SWEET DREAMS, EVERYONE!

863
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:20,231
Why? What's he up to?

864
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:22,400
Oh, really? How sweet of him.

865
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,003
WORLD SEXY GUY'S HEART

866
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:26,938
Seriously, what's he doing?

867
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:28,306
Hearts?

868
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:30,108
How sweet.

869
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,044
LOITERING, NOT QUITE READY
TO CALL IT A NIGHT

870
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:34,445
Hey, he scared me.

871
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:36,948
He was looking out.

872
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:42,120
SWEET DREAMS, EVERYONE!

873
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:45,623
A PEACEFUL MORNING IN WANDO

874
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,691
…AND A RUDE AWAKENING…?!

875
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,159
-You're late.
-Sorry?

876
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:49,727
What time did we say we'd meet?

877
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:50,895
I'm sorry! One second.

878
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:52,797
Teacher, is this where
you'll teach me to spar?

879
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,232
-If I'm bad…
-You dive in!

880
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:55,199
-Jab.
-Jab.

881
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:56,200
UNEXPECTED TALENT

882
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:57,702
LEAVES HIM SPEECHLESS?!

883
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,304
JANGDOBARI'S MMA DEBUT…!

884
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,106
SHE EVEN LEAVES HA-JUN FLOORED?

885
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:03,307
A CHEONGSANDO-STYLE BRUNCH?

886
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,109
The abalones here are so meaty.

887
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:07,879
FACE CRINKLED WITH DELIGHT

888
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:10,148
I won't marry an island boy!

889
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,282
Just go over there and box!

890
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:12,383
LONELY LIFE OF A BOXER?

891
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:13,384
One, two!

892
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:14,685
I almost got indigestion.

893
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:15,720
FEELING SO MUCH LIGHTER

894
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:16,954
AND SOME SUBTLE

895
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:18,523
FORESHADOWING…?

896
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:20,191
I think it'll all feel like a dream.

897
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:23,361
This is so relaxing.

898
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:24,362
This is lovely.

899
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,830
WAS IT ALL… A DREAM?

900
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,231
CAN THESE GUYS

901
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:29,834
EVER WAKE UP FROM THE DREAM?

902
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:33,371
HA-JUN, HOW ABOUT A SPARRING MATCH
WHEN YOU WAKE UP…?
