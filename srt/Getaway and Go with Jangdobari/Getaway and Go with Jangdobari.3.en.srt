1
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:05,872
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

2
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:07,774
A breezy break with bundles of stories!

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:08,975
JANGDOBARI'S FIRST TRIP

4
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:09,909
We're in Harbin!

5
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:10,810
IN HARBIN

6
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:12,712
WITH FORMER HARBIN EXCHANGE STUDENT
BYUN YO-HAN

7
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,280
I studied here.

8
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,649
I had plans to come here
after getting married.

9
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:17,917
Should we book a venue, then?

10
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:19,452
(CON) DREAMS COME TRUE (GRATS)

11
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,654
THANKS TO HIS WEALTHY(?) WIFE

12
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:23,890
I was too broke to come here as a student.

13
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:25,959
Is there anywhere you've wanted to go?

14
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,427
HARBIN'S HOTSPOT, CENTRAL STREET

15
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:29,462
I went to the Air Jordan store.

16
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,830
MEMORIES CAME FLOODING BACK

17
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:32,332
It's surreal, walking this street.

18
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,466
What would you like to do?

19
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,235
I really want to visit my old school.

20
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:36,136
TALK OF SCHOOL

21
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,004
MORE TALK OF SCHOOL

22
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,105
WHY ALL THIS SCHOOL TALK?

23
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:42,275
One of my old friends sent me some pics,
saying the place has changed.

24
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:43,943
It really has changed a lot.

25
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,378
I want to check out my school.

26
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,747
WE'RE HEADED TO SCHOOL
TO MEET 20-YEAR-OLD YO-HAN

27
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:49,115
-You cool with that?
-Of course.

28
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:50,884
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

29
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:56,056
EPISODE 2: ARE WE ON A BREAK?
LET'S LEAVE NO REGRETS

30
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:57,223
It's been 20 years.

31
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,560
You're about to meet
the Yo-han from 20 years back.

32
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,229
-Going back to school takes you back.
-Right.

33
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:05,031
I'm really curious how much it's changed.

34
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:09,069
-Are you still in touch with your friends?
-Yeah, of course.

35
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:11,137
I still talk to everyone I studied with.

36
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:14,174
I bet they think it's awesome
you became an actor.

37
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,675
They're my greatest supporters.

38
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:19,012
I always dreamed of being an actor,
even when I was here.

39
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,014
-So they knew?
-Yes, they did.

40
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,615
Whenever I'm in something new,

41
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:25,118
they spread the word to everyone.

42
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:26,319
FRIENDS WHO ROOT FOR YO-HAN

43
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:27,620
I'm a little nervous.

44
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,191
-I wonder how you'll feel.
-Me too.

45
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:36,729
I think we're there
once we cross this bridge.

46
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:40,300
Hold up. I think I remember this road.

47
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:41,935
-Yeah? Is this the way?
-Yes.

48
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,538
Let's get drenched in nostalgia.

49
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,607
Wow.

50
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,676
This is the main event.

51
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:52,245
I'm honestly touched.

52
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:56,149
TWIDDLING THUMBS

53
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,351
-Hello?
-Hello?

54
00:01:58,852 --> 00:01:59,686
Yes?

55
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:01,888
I'm headed to HIT right now.

56
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,457
Why's your face so red?

57
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:05,658
I had too many drinks.

58
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,260
Did you drink baijiu?

59
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,129
I had baijiu, yes, and pijiu.

60
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,297
-You did?
-Yeah.

61
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,666
The cameras are on, so keep it clean.

62
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:15,869
Who is it?

63
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:17,470
-He was with me…
-He studied with you?

64
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:20,306
Yes, we were roommates
and hung out together.

65
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:21,808
Everything's so different.

66
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,278
Yeah, pretty much everything
has changed except campus.

67
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,914
You said it all looked different
when you came recently.

68
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:30,650
-I can see it now.
-Everything's different now.

69
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:35,021
Yeah, even Mao Mao, our go-to spot,
is gone now.

70
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,055
Exactly.

71
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,825
Okay.

72
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,260
How's the shoot going?

73
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,128
I think I'm doing okay.

74
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,464
You're on your best behavior today.

75
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,066
You said there are cameras, so…

76
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,869
-He's sweet.
-You're doing better than I am.

77
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:50,770
How nice of him.

78
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,405
This feels so surreal.

79
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,107
It does, doesn't it?

80
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,477
You came after having kids,
and I'm back after 20 years.

81
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:00,046
-Feels surreal, right?
-Why are you tearing up?

82
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:01,614
Why are you crying?

83
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,883
My eyes are normally dewy.

84
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,219
Okay, all right. Thank you.

85
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,654
I'll call you again. Love you.

86
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,322
All right, speak soon.

87
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:11,124
END OF A DEWY PHONE CALL

88
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,193
You said get drenched,
so I figured I'd call him.

89
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:15,428
No, that was great.

90
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:16,696
But he's a little misty.

91
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,432
-Is he the one who…
-Yes.

92
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:22,569
-With his kid?
-Yes, he visited a while ago with his kid.

93
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:27,207
His kid's in grade school now,
so he's old enough to get it.

94
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,676
-That their dad studied here?
-Where Daddy lived.

95
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,812
We've known each other for 20 years now.

96
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,218
IN SEARCH OF MEMORIES FROM 20 YEARS AGO

97
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,453
We're here.

98
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,387
Is this it?

99
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,324
Yes, that's it.

100
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,825
This is the place.

101
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,827
"Harbin Institute of Technology."

102
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,630
It's the largest, fanciest building
we've seen.

103
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,565
This is the front gate.

104
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,335
Wow, this is it.

105
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,837
I've never been here,
but even I feel a little emotional.

106
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,672
-Does it feel like you studied here?
-Yes.

107
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,041
Just hearing your stories
has made me emotional.

108
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,445
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

109
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,382
ARRIVED AT HARBIN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY
AFTER 20 YEARS

110
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:12,318
We're here.

111
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:15,288
Are my eyes getting misty?

112
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,189
Yours?

113
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,559
They're so watery,

114
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:21,661
it looks like you'll burst into tears
any minute.

115
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:22,562
That's not true.

116
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,267
I think everything's changed.

117
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,968
Well, it has been 20 years.

118
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,670
That's two whole decades.

119
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,674
I walked this street all the time.

120
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,209
-As a student?
-Yes.

121
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:37,644
I remember

122
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,947
jogging down this street a lot.

123
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:45,318
What about the buildings around here?
Do you recognize any of them?

124
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,753
Or have they all changed?

125
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:49,756
As he said on the call,
it seems like everything's gone.

126
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:52,091
-Did he say Mao Mao?
-Yes.

127
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,060
What was that place?

128
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,229
They sold lamb skewers.
It was a skewer joint.

129
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:58,831
They were seriously good.

130
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:01,067
-Something's come to mind.
-What?

131
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:05,705
My mother would send me
a lot of Korean food.

132
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:06,806
Right.

133
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:09,008
Unpacking those always made me so happy.

134
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,410
What would she send you?

135
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,311
Just the regular.

136
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:15,882
Stuff like kimchi and fish jerky.
She really went all out with the packing.

137
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:17,817
Back then, I just tore into them,

138
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,653
but thinking back,
that must have been hard work.

139
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,090
She probably wrapped everything
super tight so nothing would spill.

140
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:24,991
For her son.

141
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,359
Those memories are rushing back.

142
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,728
She must've just wanted everything
to get to you safely.

143
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,799
I think this hasn't changed.

144
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:33,733
What's that?

145
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,903
They sell electronics like cell phones.

146
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:39,172
-Like the Yongsan Electronics Market?
-Exactly.

147
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,674
That used to be there. I remember.

148
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,544
-I first bought a Nokia there.
-I know Nokia.

149
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,446
Here we are.

150
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,616
Wow, it's like we've stepped into
another universe.

151
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,152
This is crazy. I can't believe I'm here.

152
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,955
Oh my God.

153
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:57,724
Oh my God.

154
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,027
HARBIN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY

155
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,529
ONE OF CHINA'S MOST PRESTIGIOUS
ENGINEERING UNIVERSITIES

156
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:04,931
WHICH BOASTS A 100-YEAR HISTORY

157
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,067
-Is this the same?
-This hasn't changed.

158
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:10,303
It's the same. So is that gate.

159
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:11,938
Wow.

160
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:16,976
This is really…

161
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,045
-Wow.
-What's that?

162
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,413
-Is this view the same?
-Yes.

163
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,748
Exactly as I remember it.

164
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:26,753
And these two roads still look the same.
It's an endless walk.

165
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,189
I don't think we'll be able to enter.

166
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,358
Yes, I heard
we're not allowed to film inside.

167
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,259
Instead,

168
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,561
shall we grab a quick photo here

169
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,097
for the show's success
and maybe a future visit?

170
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:40,767
Sounds great.

171
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:44,504
People take photos here
hoping they'll get in one day.

172
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,938
Right, so it has special meaning.

173
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,240
-Here's to returning.
-Right.

174
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,443
-We don't have much time left.
-Hey, don't say that.

175
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,911
-Let's link arms.
-Sure.

176
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,045
Okay.

177
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:54,147
Three, two, one.

178
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:59,218
REVISITING MY ALMA MATER IN 20 YEARS
(WITH MY WIFE)

179
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,954
Even in a different country,
being on campus…

180
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:04,557
-This stuff's new, though.
-They didn't have this back then?

181
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,293
They're all so young.

182
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,294
Exactly.

183
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:10,096
What's the "100"?

184
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,531
Has it been 100 years?

185
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,399
-Was this here back then?
-No.

186
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,134
You're right. It's the 100th anniversary.

187
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,870
A century seems to be
the bare minimum here.

188
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:21,374
I can't believe I'm here with you.
This is unreal.

189
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:23,976
What is that thing?

190
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,113
Our show is called
"Getaway and Go with Jangdobari."

191
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,450
So, since we're visiting a place
that means so much to you,

192
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:33,319
I figured we shouldn't rush to move on
but should take a little break.

193
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:36,155
It would be a shame
to leave straight away,

194
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:37,056
so I brought a chair.

195
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:39,025
Oh…

196
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,062
You want us to form a band?

197
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,070
We're close to Russia, so…

198
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:56,008
PERFECTLY IN SYNC NEWLYWED BAND

199
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:58,010
We're close to Russia, so this is perfect.

200
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,713
-Please sit.
-Man, my stomach hurts.

201
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:02,849
All righty.

202
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:05,585
I've never studied here
or visited Harbin before,

203
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,654
but after hearing all of your stories,

204
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:11,257
it makes it feel as though I've…

205
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,425
Oh, hello, sir.

206
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,327
Hello.

207
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,062
RESPECT

208
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:17,864
Good morning.

209
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:19,298
This is great.

210
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,200
It's Harbin.

211
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,036
-It's Harbin.
-Harbin.

212
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,075
So cute.

213
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:29,976
This is lovely.

214
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,979
I was 20 when I came here.

215
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:34,881
I did travel back and forth to Korea,

216
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,649
but I really gave this place my all.

217
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,986
And it feels so surreal
to be back after 20 years.

218
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,888
Then, when you left this place,

219
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:45,424
did you have any idea when,
or if, you'd ever come back?

220
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:47,193
Honestly, I didn't want to return.

221
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,228
I wanted to be an actor,

222
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,831
and I felt like coming back
would mean I had failed.

223
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,067
So I figured I shouldn't come back.

224
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:57,603
Coming back would feel like
admitting you didn't make it…

225
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,838
I'd be drifting further away.

226
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:03,142
At the time, about 30 of my friends
who I'd studied with,

227
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:07,713
all of them foreigners,
saw me off in front of our dorms in tears.

228
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,382
Saying, "What if we miss you, Yo-han?"

229
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,551
"Will we ever meet again?"

230
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,186
That's how we all felt back then.

231
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:17,790
So we exchanged our email addresses,
Daum, Hanmail, all that.

232
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,559
We stayed in touch at first,

233
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,027
but we naturally grew apart.

234
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,397
From what I remember, we had so much fun.

235
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:26,632
It got lonely at times,
but it was still a blast.

236
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,869
We were clumsy and innocent,
as you'd expect at that age.

237
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:33,272
Then all the things you did
while living in a foreign place,

238
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:37,009
studying, meeting new friends,
and trying out new things,

239
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,780
must have helped shape your acting
in one way or another, right?

240
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,848
I really hoped you'd ask that question.

241
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:43,950
You did?

242
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,151
It's enriched me.

243
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:48,354
I've been acting for over ten years now,

244
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:52,558
and I think what kept me going
was the memory of this place.

245
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,328
I had so many formative experiences here.

246
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:57,630
When I was filming Misaeng,
I improvised a lot.

247
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:01,601
I played around with ad-libs
in Chinese, Russian, and English.

248
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,971
Especially in the rooftop scenes.
The director really liked it.

249
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:09,075
They were all very simple ad-libs,
but they were born from this experience.

250
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,210
Right, they were influenced
by your experiences here.

251
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,846
It's interesting
how everyone has their own path.

252
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,749
-Right.
-You eventually found your own path.

253
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,285
And you're putting it all to good use.

254
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:22,555
Everything you went through here.

255
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,490
You turned out pretty good.

256
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:25,625
As for you, Do-yeon,

257
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:27,994
by doing this show with me,

258
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:30,963
you're taking home
my memories from when I was 20.

259
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:32,598
All of my experiences.

260
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:33,899
You'll carry them with you now.

261
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,101
-In that bag of yours.
-Me?

262
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,336
I'm just getting a taste.

263
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,405
-Take it all with you.
-I'm just getting a whiff.

264
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,742
Take some of this good energy with you
to meet your next guest.

265
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,177
I hope that by sharing
my memories with you,

266
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,213
they also enrich you in some way.

267
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,582
And, above all else, I'm so grateful.

268
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,751
Not at all.
Thanks to you, we're off to a great start.

269
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,319
It's all good,

270
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,888
but part of me
still feels a little nervous and scared.

271
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,023
Don't you worry.

272
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,525
-You're here now. No reason to stress.
-I need to do well.

273
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:02,395
Just like Byun Yo-han did
when he was a teenager

274
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,496
in a foreign country.

275
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,931
-How he figured it all out.
-Yes.

276
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,200
-Exactly.
-I'll just have to power on.

277
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,136
I have to pave my own way.

278
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:11,103
Now,

279
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:12,872
time for "You Quiz"?

280
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:19,045
Harbin Institute of Technology
is a prestigious university.

281
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:21,047
-Yes.
-Here's your question.

282
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,317
Which one of these people
isn't at Harbin Institute of Technology?

283
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,053
-It's multiple-choice.
-Okay.

284
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:27,987
Number one.

285
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,256
-"Natasha."
-"Natasha."

286
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,458
Number two.

287
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,593
-"John Lee."
-"John Lee."

288
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:36,929
Number three.

289
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,298
-"Professor Choi."
-All right.

290
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,199
And number four.

291
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,703
-"Allassa Inmaikum."
-Okay.

292
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,938
-Now, Byun Yo-han--
-Hold up. Wait a second.

293
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,874
-Byun Yo-han, I need an answer--
-Number one, Natasha!

294
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,042
Number one, Natasha?

295
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,745
Byun Yo-han.

296
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,881
Will you stick with number one, Natasha?

297
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:57,283
Yes.

298
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,785
This is your last chance.
Sure you won't switch?

299
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,555
Yes. No take-backs. I'm locking it in.

300
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,557
The answer was

301
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,226
number one, Natasha!

302
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:08,728
GETTING READY

303
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,696
(CON) YOU'RE CORRECT (GRATS)

304
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,101
IT'S HARBIN

305
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:16,435
GOING IN CIRCLES

306
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,243
My stomach hurts.

307
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,579
Your prize was this awesome celebration.

308
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,180
Thank you so much.

309
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,115
Thank you.

310
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,416
Can I promote something?

311
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:31,584
Sure, go ahead.

312
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,287
I look forward to meeting you all
on Netflix, bundles of stories in hand,

313
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:36,422
on your TV screens.

314
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:37,757
Thank you!

315
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,859
We wish Byun Yo-han
the very best in his future!

316
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,560
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

317
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,031
You're great. As expected.

318
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:46,932
You're the best!

319
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,167
My stomach hurts.

320
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,737
FROM HARBIN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY
WITH BUNDLES OF NEW MEMORIES

321
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,039
MOVING TO THE NEXT LOCATION

322
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,775
Goodbye. Take care.

323
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:57,376
-See you again.
-Goodbye.

324
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,078
-In 20 years' time…
-Let's meet again.

325
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:00,012
He says he'll be back.

326
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,081
I'll come back sooner rather than later.

327
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:05,151
I should return
when I really start to miss this place.

328
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:06,285
Right, I get you.

329
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:09,455
I think it might be a good idea
to come back

330
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,392
when I need a pick-me-up of sorts.

331
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,727
Yes, and by then…

332
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,830
-Things might've changed by then.
-They could change again.

333
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,299
-I'd be different too. As would Harbin.
-Exactly.

334
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,836
As much as this place has changed,
so have you.

335
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,504
That's awesome. Really meaningful.

336
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,373
Thanks to you, I…

337
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:29,074
Not at all.

338
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:29,975
GRIN

339
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,678
I wasn't even done talking,
and you already said, "Not at all."

340
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,848
Just zip it.

341
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,149
I got what you meant.

342
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:40,286
It's Harbin Station.

343
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:41,320
Harbin Station!

344
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:43,923
-It's huge.
-This is Harbin Station.

345
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,324
This is where Ahn Jung-geun…

346
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,992
THE SITE OF AHN JUNG-GEUN'S PATRIOTIC ACT

347
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,228
-I heard there's a whole exhibition hall.
-There is.

348
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,263
-If you go inside.
-You're right.

349
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,767
Back in history class,
we all learned about Harbin Station

350
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,436
and Unit 731, which is stationed nearby.

351
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,704
You're absolutely right.

352
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,639
But seeing it in person,

353
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:03,142
the sheer size is overwhelming.

354
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:06,045
When I first got here to study,

355
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,480
I spent about a week or so

356
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,416
holed up in my room.

357
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:13,385
Once I finally started going out,

358
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,921
the first place I went to
was Harbin Station.

359
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,424
I'd learned about its history,

360
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,726
so I just had an urge to visit.

361
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:22,595
So I came here.

362
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:24,663
-Right, as any Korean would.
-Yes.

363
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,633
-It's in our blood to come here.
-Yes, it's not just any station.

364
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:30,436
I bet this place
would be beautiful at night.

365
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:33,205
-Yes, at night.
-Bet it sparkles with lights at night.

366
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,108
The building's absolutely breathtaking.

367
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,611
Everything you see on trips like this
just blows you away.

368
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,146
I think this is the best time
to see Harbin.

369
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:45,050
-The night lights are beautiful.
-So we came at the perfect time?

370
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,920
AS NIGHT DEEPENS, SO DOES HARBIN'S BEAUTY

371
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:51,056
Here it is. Whoa, that's awesome.

372
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,057
Wow.

373
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,261
This is gorgeous.

374
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,062
It's absolutely stunning.

375
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,597
-This is…
-This is unreal.

376
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:02,268
I didn't even need to look.
I could tell we'd arrived from the air.

377
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,404
Is that a person?
It's not a statue, is it?

378
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,507
-Are they moving?
-It's a doll.

379
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,808
It's a person!

380
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:10,843
Oh, you're right.

381
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,080
SAINT SOPHIA CATHEDRAL

382
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:16,815
RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH BUILT IN 1907

383
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:17,716
A SYMBOL OF HARBIN

384
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:20,119
KNOWN FOR ITS MAJESTIC BYZANTINE DOME
AND RED BRICKS

385
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:21,186
Do-yeon, stand here.

386
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,429
I don't think you can capture
its beauty on camera.

387
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:31,530
It's magnificent.

388
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,367
There's another princess there!

389
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,937
It's like they all live in this cathedral.

390
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:41,006
That's the spot!
Just how many princesses are there?

391
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,908
It's freezing cold, but they're still…

392
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,443
That's impressive.

393
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,812
Wow, look at all these princesses.

394
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,182
PRINCESSES OUT ON A STROLL
FROM THEIR CATHEDRAL

395
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,450
This place is fun.

396
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,185
Oh my God. Wow!

397
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,688
Now I'm here,
I'd like to be a princess too.

398
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:56,855
-You would?
-Could we?

399
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:58,791
Well, I guess so. Let's do it.

400
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,760
Thank you.
When else would we ever get to try this?

401
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,796
-You're right.
-Plus, it's the local culture.

402
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,132
Some shops seem to produce
more princesses than others.

403
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,368
I think that place churns out the most.

404
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,205
I don't think I've ever seen

405
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:18,010
this many people in wild outfits
since the Gag Concert dressing room.

406
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,246
They all look like professional models.

407
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,248
-Right?
-It's freezing, but they're still posing.

408
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:26,185
-Will you be okay?
-Of course I will.

409
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,988
Wow.

410
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:36,595
A MAGICAL PLACE WHERE ANYONE CAN BECOME
A PRINCE OR A PRINCESS

411
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:38,998
DECIDING ON THE THEME

412
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,833
Oh, I like this.

413
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,534
This one, please.

414
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,304
Can we check out the prince costumes too?

415
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:48,540
A FAIRYTALE WEDDING PHOTO

416
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:50,442
Looks good.

417
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,913
TRANSFORMING INTO A PRINCESS

418
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:58,817
A LAVISH DRESS,
A MUST-HAVE FOR EVERY PRINCESS

419
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,320
GOING ALL IN

420
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,924
A TOUCH OF COLOR TO HIGHLIGHT HER BEAUTY

421
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,827
CONTOURED TO THE GODS

422
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,999
JUST LOOKING AT HER
BRINGS A SMILE TO THIS PRINCE'S FACE

423
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,836
TRANSFORMING INTO A PRINCE

424
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,572
CHOOSING WIGS TO FINISH THE LOOK

425
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,910
Do-yeon, I think I'm all set.

426
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,114
Do I look pretty?

427
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,883
You do! Beautiful.

428
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,386
GASP

429
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,088
MY BREATHTAKING PRINCESS

430
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:37,990
-Oh my God.
-Oh, my prince.

431
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,492
Prince, please don't go away.

432
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:42,661
We got married.

433
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:46,131
No divorce, please.

434
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,367
Please, don't go away.

435
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:49,268
I understand.

436
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:52,004
It really suits you, Do-yeon.

437
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,109
Let's get married already.

438
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:59,845
AND SO, AFTER A SHORT WHILE…

439
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:03,282
A NIGHT LIT FOR CELEBRATION

440
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:04,716
CURTSY

441
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,051
Let us go.

442
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,052
GETTING MARRIED ALREADY

443
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:07,953
Here we go.

444
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,023
HAIR TOSS

445
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:13,459
SWIRL

446
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,060
WHIP

447
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,328
You look pretty darn great.

448
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:18,430
-You look stunning.
-You look awesome.

449
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,734
ELEGANT

450
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,537
A MARRIAGE FOR THE AGES

451
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,106
You're in big trouble tonight.

452
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,308
I'm bringing out my sword.

453
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,544
Why is your sword there?
Is that where it's meant to go?

454
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,812
I have no clue.

455
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,950
PRINCESS ALSO GAINS AN ITEM

456
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:41,186
OFFICIAL START
OF THEIR WEDDING PHOTO SHOOT

457
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,155
-Big trouble.
-It's a red carpet.

458
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:44,056
Like this?

459
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,961
DEEP GAZE

460
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,296
TIGHT GRIP

461
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:53,565
INTENSE GAZE

462
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,271
DEMURE

463
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:03,809
AN EVEN MORE DARING TRANSFORMATION

464
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,477
How's this?

465
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,149
SATISFIED

466
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:26,632
-Wow, this is great.
-It's great!

467
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:33,071
A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN
THE HARBIN PRINCE AND PRINCESS

468
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:33,972
Thank you.

469
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,544
SPELL'S BROKEN NOW
TIME TO RETURN THE ITEMS

470
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,711
Oh, we need to return it?

471
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:41,280
Please take them.

472
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,550
Back to reality now.

473
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,219
Great, thank you.

474
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:48,654
PURE RELIEF

475
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:51,690
Thank you, my prince.

476
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,895
Thank you.
Time to snap back to reality now.

477
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,130
-Shall we?
-Goodbye.

478
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,934
Well, that was fun.

479
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,802
It was. Could you help with my train?

480
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,003
Okay, let us go.

481
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,572
ESCORTING HER UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT

482
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:07,472
CURTSY

483
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:13,545
AFTER THEIR MAGICAL WEDDING PHOTO SHOOT…

484
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:19,017
Wowee.

485
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,220
Who'd have thought
we'd fall into these chairs?

486
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:22,588
My butt hurts.

487
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:23,922
I brought this.

488
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,524
Yo-han, snap out of it.

489
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,192
I botched my landing.

490
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,261
Are we in the right place?

491
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:30,162
Yes, we are.

492
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,664
I had a dream on the way here,

493
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,234
and you were dressed
like a prince with a sword.

494
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,768
It was absolutely ridiculous.

495
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,238
I woke up in a fit of laughter.

496
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:41,473
I think we may have had the same dream.

497
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,710
-Maybe in our dreams…
-I think we went somewhere.

498
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,778
Me too. It's strange how drained I feel.

499
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:50,082
Also, I weirdly have glitter on my face.

500
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:53,619
I suddenly blacked out
at Saint Sophia Cathedral.

501
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:56,655
We must be super close
if we're sharing dreams now.

502
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,991
This is freaking me out.
How much closer could we get?

503
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:01,159
-Did you have fun?
-I had a blast.

504
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:02,828
This is our last stop.

505
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:03,829
Cheers.

506
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:05,664
If you don't want beer,
you can drink this.

507
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:06,999
-I can't drink any more.
-Really?

508
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:08,567
I'd rather burp.

509
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:10,002
-He'd rather burp.
-You would?

510
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,604
I'm pretty sure
it's because of that drink.

511
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:13,705
Did it make you sleepy?

512
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,675
That's why we blacked out
at Saint Sophia Cathedral.

513
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:20,045
We vanished and dozed off

514
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:22,948
because we traveled here, to this kingdom.

515
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:26,151
OH… PRINCE…

516
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,987
-Prince.
-That drink turns you into royalty.

517
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:30,722
It's a magical drink.

518
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:32,457
This is great.

519
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:33,592
EXCITEMENT LEVELS RISING

520
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:34,793
I love it.

521
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,061
Are you egging me on?

522
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,063
-No, I'm not.
-You want me to do this?

523
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,465
No, I'm just messing around.
Having a good time.

524
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,869
That's the move in Harbin
to get the crowd going.

525
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:47,306
It is? Does it make people think,
"Wow, they know how to party"?

526
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:50,876
Because this place is close
to Eastern Europe and Russia,

527
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:52,911
a lot of the dance

528
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:56,682
is obviously Chinese,
but there's an Eastern European influence.

529
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,884
-Like the influence in architecture?
-Totally.

530
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:59,885
So the ladies will…

531
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:00,952
HARBIN DANCE CLASS

532
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,354
They keep doing this.

533
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:03,822
And if…

534
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,724
So who makes the first move?

535
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,092
You'd be dancing like this.

536
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,027
Just like this.

537
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,195
Do you have two left feet?

538
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,597
-No, I'm grooving side to side.
-You are?

539
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:15,033
-Oh, you have long legs.
-Yes, my legs are long.

540
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,868
So I just keep grooving like this?

541
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:19,204
Just keep doing that. Stay right there.

542
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:20,639
-Then a man…
-Just on the spot?

543
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,607
He'll turn up wearing a leather jacket.

544
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,076
FOUND HIS TARGET

545
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:25,043
And he'll do this.

546
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,745
DANCE WITH ME, LADY

547
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,414
To show that they're interested.

548
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:30,949
-Really?
-I swear.

549
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,518
And if she's into him too,
what does she do?

550
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:35,253
-Would she also do this?
-Exactly.

551
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,154
I LIKE YOU TOO

552
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:39,391
END OF HARBIN'S DANCE-BARI

553
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,292
My stomach hurts.

554
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:41,626
That was…

555
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:44,496
This was so much fun.

556
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:45,931
Honestly, I had…

557
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,766
-I can tell you enjoyed it.
-You can?

558
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,769
Not just your words,

559
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,038
but your facial expressions

560
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:56,842
and how you've looked after the crew
in between shoots said it all.

561
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:58,977
You're really amazing.

562
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:03,014
You've been amazing,
both on and off camera.

563
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:05,250
I'm so grateful, almost a little guilty,

564
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:08,520
about how you've given our show 120%.

565
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:11,656
What's been a really pleasant surprise…

566
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,960
There are conversations
you can only have with close ones.

567
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:17,162
-Right.
-People you've spent time with.

568
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,631
But you and I don't have any history.

569
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,600
-We've only ever met for work.
-Right.

570
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:25,337
And we've just vaguely
known of each other until now.

571
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,139
But the conversations we had

572
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:30,208
when we were on the move
and the cameras were off

573
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:34,513
were about things I'm not even sure
I've discussed with my closest friends.

574
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:38,350
You opened up so easily,
and I was really happy just to listen.

575
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,317
It's been really cool.

576
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:40,886
-That's good to hear.
-Yes.

577
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:45,190
On the flight back, I'll probably replay
everything we talked about like a movie.

578
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,129
So they've already grilled everything?

579
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:57,302
Beef, pork, and lamb.

580
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,203
Sounds great.

581
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,738
What's your favorite?

582
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,706
I'll try a lamb skewer.

583
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,875
-Pork and lamb?
-All right.

584
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,912
It's nice that they're already grilled.

585
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:09,481
What was that?

586
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:12,050
Wow!

587
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,185
It's tasty, isn't it?

588
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:15,487
Wow.

589
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:17,255
It's so good.

590
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:18,323
Wow.

591
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,125
It's really good.

592
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,664
Do-yeon.

593
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,933
Here's to wishing us both the best.

594
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:29,401
High five.

595
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:33,638
-I'll be cheering you on.
-And the best to your acting career.

596
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:34,539
The very best!

597
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,708
-Here's to Jangdobari.
-Thanks.

598
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:38,276
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

599
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:42,547
It's good.

600
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:46,318
-Do you normally eat chicken feet?
-I eat everything. I'm not picky at all.

601
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:52,324
PAI HUANG GUA
CRUSHED CUCUMBERS IN CHILI OIL

602
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:53,658
MALA LIANGPI

603
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:56,294
SICHUAN-STYLE COLD NOODLES
TOSSED IN A MALA SAUCE

604
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:58,096
I wonder

605
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:00,632
how this will taste.

606
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:04,302
The flavors look bolder
because it's local.

607
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:07,305
I think I'll crave this.

608
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,274
-The liangpi?
-Yes.

609
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,308
Is it good? How is it?

610
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:12,110
-It's so good!
-This too?

611
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,011
Is it good?

612
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:20,552
Is it different? Which was your favorite?
This is our third liangpi.

613
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:23,355
This isn't a peanut sauce.
It's a mala sauce.

614
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:25,056
It's amazing. Super refreshing.

615
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,159
They gave us whole potatoes?

616
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,465
-It's salty.
-It is?

617
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:34,599
It's salty, but good.

618
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:36,935
-Jjayo!
-It's salty.

619
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,471
PERFECT CHEMISTRY

620
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,940
In my dream earlier,

621
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:44,309
a man had something like this on his belt.

622
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:48,947
Who even carries
something like this nowadays?

623
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,215
That's why it's a dream.

624
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,150
I was at the cathedral.

625
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,020
But he wore it like a belt.

626
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:56,388
As though it were a snake.

627
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,524
Was he wearing it here?

628
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:00,859
Hold on.

629
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:07,332
When we first arrived at the hotel,

630
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,935
you said you didn't think
you'd be back in Harbin

631
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:12,037
unless you were on your honeymoon.

632
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:13,705
So I was just breaking the ice,

633
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:16,308
but we imagined we were married

634
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:19,244
and immediately got close
as we set off on this trip.

635
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:20,845
And our trip ends in divorce.

636
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:24,215
But we don't really need
to get divorced, do we?

637
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:26,851
It would be a shame,
so let's just say we're on a break.

638
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,186
-Okay.
-All right.

639
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,421
There's not much to it.

640
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:33,391
This trip with you, Yo-han,

641
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:34,926
I have no regrets.

642
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,064
…HAHA

643
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,833
This is bad. How will I make
people laugh when I get back?

644
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:45,470
As my first travel buddy, you…

645
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:49,441
Sure, each travel buddy
will have their charm,

646
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:53,144
but I'll probably see you
in all their shadows, like a grim reaper.

647
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:55,580
-Burping?
-You wouldn't be there, but you would.

648
00:26:56,181 --> 00:27:00,619
I don't know who your next guest will be,
but I'm already jealous.

649
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,723
Who do you think would be a good fit
as her travel buddy?

650
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:06,524
Who do I think?

651
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:08,760
I want to know too.

652
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:09,861
I think

653
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:12,631
Director Yi Ok-seop would be great.

654
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:17,168
So you think I should travel with people
I'm good friends with?

655
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:18,970
I think that would be fun.

656
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:20,305
-I'd want to see that.
-Really?

657
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:22,741
I'd love to see
how you two travel together

658
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,676
and hear what you talk about.

659
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:25,577
-Really?
-Yes.

660
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,313
I'll let her know you said that.
Try to talk her into it.

661
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,382
It would feel like
I'm traveling with you guys.

662
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,818
If you're ever free,

663
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:36,488
and you can spare a moment or two,

664
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,156
would you come join me again?

665
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:39,858
-As a travel buddy?
-Right.

666
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:41,760
-If it's okay with you.
-Sure.

667
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,328
But I'd have to

668
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:44,963
check my schedule.

669
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,573
END OF DINNER

670
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,642
What is that? Is it a gift for me?

671
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:58,543
What?

672
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,612
-Should I get excited?
-No.

673
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:04,716
Our trip together
will be recorded in video form.

674
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:06,618
-Right.
-But I thought…

675
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:11,056
We've come to the end of what felt like
both a short and long trip.

676
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:13,725
I just wanted to leave something behind.
Like a little memo.

677
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:15,093
Have you ever had a shared diary?

678
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,194
No.

679
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,196
-Well, today's your lucky day.
-Pen pals?

680
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:20,832
You can think of it as pen pals.
There are no rules.

681
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,669
-So I should just write whatever?
-Whatever you want.

682
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:27,739
-But we'll swap and read each other's.
-Okay, sure.

683
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:29,674
-I like this sort of thing.
-You do?

684
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:31,009
Do you like writing diaries?

685
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:33,244
I used to for a long time.

686
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,680
WRITING THEIR HARBIN TRAVEL DIARY ENTRIES

687
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,390
CAPTURING A NEW MEMORY
WITH EACH PEN STROKE

688
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,670
RIP

689
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,676
NOM

690
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:07,946
Dang it.

691
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:09,380
SHAKING HEAD IN DISAPPROVAL

692
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:11,249
Thanks.

693
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:16,621
EXCHANGING GLANCES

694
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:19,257
NO PEEKING

695
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,227
UNDER TIGHT SECURITY

696
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:24,429
Can we drink beer as we write?

697
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:26,097
Hey, you stay put.

698
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:27,398
-Okay.
-I've got this.

699
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,168
Beer, please.

700
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:31,069
Two.

701
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:33,772
I think I could move here.

702
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,273
I'd drink beer every day.

703
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,841
-You're a Harbin princess.
-Me?

704
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,477
CURTSY

705
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:42,147
HARBIN DANCE-BARI

706
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:46,184
I'm touched by how much effort
you're putting into it.

707
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,588
You've turned over the page?

708
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:52,423
I spaced mine out a ton.

709
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,761
-Shall we read them out loud?
-Sure, let's read them.

710
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:59,130
-Read your own.
-Fine by me.

711
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:01,366
Just writing it down
doesn't feel like enough.

712
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:03,535
Right, so you want to capture the tone?

713
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:04,803
-Yes.
-Okay.

714
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:05,770
I'll read mine.

715
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:06,938
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

716
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:09,207
"We met 20-year-old Yo-han together,

717
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,376
the me who was still finding his way."

718
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,945
"When I got the offer to do this show,

719
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:17,348
I was nervous at first,
but I said yes right away

720
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:18,850
because it was you."

721
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:20,552
"You're the best host,

722
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:23,755
and I knew that you would capture my story

723
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,690
from my twenties to now just right."

724
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:34,032
"Thank you for giving me
such unforgettable memories."

725
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:36,000
"This show,
the people you'll go on to meet,

726
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:38,903
and the precious memories you'll make.
Let's keep sharing them."

727
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:41,472
"I'll be rooting for all of you. And,

728
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:42,607
dot, dot, dot,

729
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,243
see you again."

730
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,113
-Thank you.
-It's nothing.

731
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,317
-It was from the heart.
-I could feel your warmth.

732
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:55,887
I couldn't put my feelings into words.
I tried to organize my thoughts,

733
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:57,722
but there's so much I want to say.

734
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:01,392
I think the conversations we had
during our trip will speak for themselves.

735
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:02,327
You're right.

736
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:04,229
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

737
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:06,898
And I know that you will perfectly capture
the stories

738
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:08,867
of everyone you go on to meet.

739
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:11,936
I didn't really know what to write
when thinking about myself,

740
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,571
so I thought about your future guests.

741
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:15,773
Was that good enough?

742
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,276
Hey, you're just feeling shy.

743
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:19,944
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

744
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:23,381
-Your turn.
-Compared to your heartfelt message…

745
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:25,917
-Please trust I also wrote from the heart.
-Of course.

746
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,752
I just wrote what came to mind.

747
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,990
"Thank you so much
for being my first-ever travel buddy."

748
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,225
"I once read

749
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:38,229
that choosing a travel buddy is like
picking the universe you wish to travel."

750
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:41,032
"I had so much fun
in the universe called you."

751
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:43,167
"My unforgettable first trip."

752
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:49,340
"It still rings in my ears, your burp."

753
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:54,045
"It was a trap
I couldn't and wouldn't escape."

754
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,946
"Thank you!"

755
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,149
And I finished with
"End of our Harbin trip."

756
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,753
-Thank you.
-I hope that was heartfelt enough.

757
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,923
Now that the trip's over,

758
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:07,659
I'll put my all into enjoying
my life back in Seoul.

759
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,061
You've given me a newfound spark.

760
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:15,066
In my twenties, I felt really anxious,
just as I wrote in the diary.

761
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,768
I thought I was still figuring things out.

762
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:19,971
This trip made me reflect,
and I think it wasn't so bad.

763
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,272
-Looking back now?
-Yes.

764
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:24,642
Byun Yo-han in his twenties wasn't so bad.

765
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:30,515
I think I am more complete
and much more put together now,

766
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:33,151
but these are just different times.

767
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:37,322
Who I am, my name, and my worth
haven't changed at all.

768
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:38,756
I'm still here today.

769
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:43,594
A lot's changed,
but Byun Yo-han's still standing.

770
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:45,263
I felt really grateful for that.

771
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:49,467
It sounds like this has been
such a meaningful time for you.

772
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,369
It's all thanks to you, Do-yeon.

773
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:54,572
You brought all these stories out of me.

774
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:59,477
END OF HARBIN COUPLE'S TRIP

775
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,045
-Cheers.
-Thank you.

776
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:04,816
BYUN YO-HAN

777
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:08,519
JANG DO-YEON

778
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:14,058
BYUN YO-HAN
JANG DO-YEON

779
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,727
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

780
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:17,462
JANGDOBARI'S SECOND DESTINATION

781
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:18,830
We're here in Wando!

782
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:19,831
ISLAND OF HEALING, WANDO

783
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:22,700
I hear my travel buddy is from Wando.

784
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:24,068
Shall we call them over?

785
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:25,536
It's Wi Ha-jun!

786
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:26,637
Hello.

787
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:27,839
I'm an ambassador of Wando.

788
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:28,940
OUR SEXY GUY

789
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,808
TAKES US ON A WICKED TRIP

790
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,343
WITH MOUTHWATERING FOOD

791
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,178
A TASTY TRIP!

792
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:36,414
WHERE WE DANCE OUR HEARTS OUT!

793
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:37,415
100% GUARANTEED JOY

794
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:39,317
I felt so happy. I got the chills.

795
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:41,119
Were you happy?

796
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,820
Hello? Recruit Jang Do-yeon?

797
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:44,088
TRIP TAKES A HARD TURN

798
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:45,256
LESSON 1: MARTIAL ARTS

799
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:46,858
SHE'S SURPRISINGLY GOOD?

800
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:48,192
RELEASING HER INNER POTENTIAL

801
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:49,293
THAT'S MY GIRL

802
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,995
LESSON 2: LOCAL ACTING

803
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,030
Then who'd you marry?

804
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:53,297
I'm the only one for you!

805
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,532
DIALECTS ARE NOT A PROBLEM

806
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:55,633
FOR OUR ACTING GENIUS(?)

807
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,701
I'd better marry you.

808
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,169
Yeah, just marry me.

809
00:33:58,236 --> 00:33:59,971
-That was great.
-It was?

810
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,706
WE GO HARDER AND BETTER

811
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:02,874
ON JANGDOBARI'S WANDO TRIP

812
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,276
I'll take the lead, so just follow me.

813
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:06,177
Let's go, then.

814
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:09,013
Must-have items on a trip?

815
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,181
Money.

816
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:11,449
Money and a diary.

817
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:13,317
And a book.

818
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,519
Don't I sound cultured?

819
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:16,020
-Why?
-Well, money's key.

820
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:17,422
When you go on a trip,

821
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:20,992
you need money to enjoy
all the good local food when you travel.

822
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,593
So money's just practical.

823
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,429
And secondly, your memories

824
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:27,265
don't stay with you forever.

825
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:28,533
I forget stuff a lot,

826
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:32,136
so if something special happens,
or I feel something special,

827
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:34,772
I'd want to write it all down.

828
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:37,275
I just need to remember,
so I'd bring a diary.

829
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:38,576
And thirdly, a book…

830
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:42,080
This is purely

831
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:44,115
for how others perceive me.

832
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:47,351
I want people to see me as a woman
who reads while on holiday.

833
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:51,956
Please say a few words to the viewers
of Getaway and Go with Jangdobari.

834
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,892
Please watch our show. I beg you.

835
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:58,096
Please be patient, don't skip ahead,

836
00:34:58,162 --> 00:34:59,530
and just binge our show.

837
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:01,899
I swear I'll be good.

838
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:02,800
Thank you.

839
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:07,138
SEE YOU ON NETFLIX
EVERY SATURDAY AT 5 P.M.
