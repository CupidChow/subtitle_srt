1
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:05,839
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

2
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:13,313
Hello. Bound for a breezy break
with bundles of stories in my bag.

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,081
I'm Jang Do-yeon
of Getaway and Go with Jangdobari.

4
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,518
Hello, everyone.

5
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,520
I'm greeting you today

6
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,155
from the city of romance and art.

7
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:23,823
This is Paris.

8
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:29,062
THE CITY OF ROMANCE
THAT BREATHES CULTURE AND ART

9
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:32,465
TODAY'S DESTINATION
PARIS, FRANCE

10
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,467
I'm still in disbelief.

11
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,102
I wonder how it is for you.

12
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:40,306
I often use the phrase "watching
from the front row of your screen."

13
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:45,011
The Eiffel Tower I was used to seeing
on a screen at home

14
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:47,547
is now just a few steps away from me.

15
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:51,217
I'm incredibly excited

16
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:53,386
since this is my first trip to France,

17
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:54,954
and to Paris too.

18
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:58,425
However, part of my excitement
and nerves come from

19
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:01,061
who my travel buddy is.

20
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:03,263
Could you take a wild guess
who that might be?

21
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:04,898
To give you a hint,

22
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:09,569
since we're in France,
I'll introduce her as my mon amie.

23
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:12,105
Mon amie. That's "my friend" in French.

24
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,107
We've traveled a lot together,

25
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:17,243
but Paris is a first for us.

26
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,145
She really loves films,

27
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:20,814
and also makes them.

28
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,781
She's…

29
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:23,917
I don't know what to do.

30
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,686
They're adorable.

31
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,189
That's so cute.

32
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:33,860
YEAH-

33
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,031
PLAYING WITH SOAP BUBBLES
HELPS HER TRAVEL BUDDY RELAX

34
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,133
There are so many people around here.

35
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,335
AWKWARD

36
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,071
TRAVEL BUDDY SPOTTED

37
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:50,076
I've known her for a few years,

38
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,245
and even though it hasn't been that long,

39
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,414
the time we've spent together has shown me

40
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:55,415
that she doesn't like

41
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,217
set-ups like this.

42
00:01:58,551 --> 00:01:59,385
Look.

43
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,521
What is she mumbling about?

44
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,057
This is hilarious. Check her out.

45
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,291
She's scratching her leg.

46
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,834
YI OK-SEOP
MOVIE DIRECTOR

47
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,737
DIRECTOR OF MOVIE MAGGIE
WHIMSICAL AND WITTY IMAGINATION

48
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:22,142
A DIRECTOR DELIVERING
STYLISH VISUALS AND MUSIC

49
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:25,378
SHE GUEST HOSTED
SALON DRIP 2'S 100TH EPISODE

50
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:26,880
You two are much closer than I thought.

51
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:28,348
JEALOUS

52
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:30,550
-We've known each other…
-But you met over 100 times.

53
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,051
…for about two years.

54
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:33,987
But we probably got together
over 100 times.

55
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:37,123
The more time I spent with her,
the more addicted I became.

56
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:41,361
THE TWO GREW CLOSE, AS THOUGH
THEY WERE ADDICTED TO ONE ANOTHER

57
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:46,799
THEIR FRIENDSHIP WAS BUILT
BY TRAVELING TOGETHER OFTEN

58
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:51,871
THEY COLLABORATED AS DIRECTOR AND ACTOR
IN YOUR COUNTRY

59
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,240
How about traveling
with Director Yi Ok-seop?

60
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,677
It'd be nice to see
how you two travel together

61
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,180
and what you talk about.

62
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:03,082
You want me to travel with someone
I'm already close to, right?

63
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:05,251
AT LAST, THE TWO ARE TRAVELING TOGETHER

64
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:06,319
She hates it.

65
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,687
Have a seat.

66
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,089
SLIDING AWAY

67
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:13,226
It's hilarious to see
how much you hate it.

68
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:15,161
My stomach hurts from laughing.

69
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:16,329
Everyone,

70
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,365
here's something you must consider.

71
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:22,468
I might not have a long career,

72
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,637
but I've done many variety shows,

73
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:28,908
so I'm used to adding flair and flavor
to the opening of a show.

74
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,110
But Director Yi will find it awkward.

75
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:32,245
Despite that,

76
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,480
she did her best
sitting here with this picnic basket.

77
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,582
GIGGLING

78
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:37,984
On that note,
could you please introduce yourself?

79
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,586
To the camera.

80
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,654
Who are you?

81
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,090
Hello, I'm…

82
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,292
HOLDING A BAGUETTE MIC
TO EASE THE AWKWARDNESS

83
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,729
I'm film director Yi Ok-seop.

84
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,864
Thank you for having me on the show.

85
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:52,765
BOWING

86
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,534
Thank you for agreeing

87
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:58,338
to travel with me to this faraway country.

88
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,874
First, I think you should tell us
about your outfit of the day.

89
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:03,843
Those who just tuned in

90
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,980
might think you haven't gotten changed
for the show yet.

91
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:10,316
Actually, I'm wearing my favorite clothes
from head to toe,

92
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,285
-and I even have my favorite backpack.
-Really?

93
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,387
I made sure to dress properly
for the viewers.

94
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,789
Don't you carry something fun around?

95
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,291
-Can you show us?
-Which one?

96
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,593
There's an item you always carry around.

97
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,428
My Jang Do-yeon goods?

98
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:26,899
She makes sure to carry around
Jang Do-yeon goods.

99
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,101
-There's also this.
-What is it?

100
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:31,004
This is what I got at the cafe.

101
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,473
A FAN GIVEN OUT TO CELEBRATE
THE 100TH EPISODE OF SALON DRIP 2

102
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:35,541
You're eating bread.

103
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,577
-What?
-You're eating bread.

104
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,079
That's me eating bread?

105
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,581
LAUGHING

106
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:42,582
Shoot.

107
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,752
-Can we expect hilarious jokes today?
-No.

108
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:47,353
But you just served us one.

109
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,589
-And…
-She stuck it on the basket.

110
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:51,357
I also have this.

111
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:52,725
That's also something you carry around.

112
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,995
These are items
she actually carries around.

113
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,230
I couldn't bring the mirror.

114
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,931
Not the mirror though.

115
00:04:58,998 --> 00:04:59,832
That's a relief.

116
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,468
I doubt you're curious about my outfit,

117
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:03,703
but there's a story behind it.

118
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,171
First of all,

119
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:09,409
I bought these pants so long ago
I don't even remember when.

120
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,744
Then I heard Bermuda shorts
were back in style.

121
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,113
I'm wearing the pants low on my hips
so the length looks right.

122
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,049
Since my flight was a red-eye,

123
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,518
they gave me a free pair of pajamas,
which just added to my luggage.

124
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:21,220
The producer told me
to wear the pajamas underneath,

125
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:22,689
so I did, and voila…

126
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,090
-See?
-It looks trendy.

127
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,792
Don't I look stylish like TARZZAN?

128
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,629
This is how TARZZAN of ALLDAY PROJECT
styles his clothes.

129
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,597
Anyway, that's what I chose to wear,

130
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,865
and here I am.

131
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,668
Do you know
what the theme of this trip is?

132
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:36,602
I don't.

133
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,104
The theme of this trip is…

134
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,806
You know the movie Eat Pray…

135
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,108
-Love?
-That's the one.

136
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,843
It's a play on that movie's title.

137
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,913
Eat, drink, and friendship.

138
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,047
That's the theme.

139
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,115
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

140
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:51,084
Honestly,

141
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,519
all I know about Paris

142
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:55,888
is what I picked up from TV.

143
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:57,890
I only know bits and pieces
about the city.

144
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:02,628
Still, if I were given the chance
to go anywhere,

145
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:03,663
I'd definitely

146
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:06,532
go to Monet's house

147
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:10,903
or see his work here in the city,
not anywhere else.

148
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,073
The emotions I'll feel will hit me
on a different level.

149
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,177
As long as I get that chance,
I'll be fine with everything else.

150
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:21,948
I believe what you wish for will come true
if you say it out loud.

151
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,283
Remember going to the Ueno Royal Museum?

152
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,985
Of course. We saw Monet's work there.

153
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,520
She told me

154
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,989
-she'd love to visit Monet's house.
-Exactly.

155
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,158
I'm amazed it came true so soon.

156
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,027
What's something you want to do in Paris?

157
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:37,096
I haven't read a lot of his work,

158
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,899
but Balzac is one of my favorite authors.

159
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,201
As you know, he left behind many works.

160
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:44,604
He's someone I aspire to be like,

161
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,641
and I would like to visit his grave.

162
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:52,211
So maybe
we'll enjoy Monet's paintings and…

163
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,514
Are you happy overall
with our sightseeing plan

164
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,150
-for Paris?
-Absolutely.

165
00:06:57,216 --> 00:07:00,887
-There's no way it can be a flop,
-Absolutely none.

166
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,188
so don't worry too much.

167
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,258
Besides, even when things don't work out,
they become memories.

168
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:09,295
That's true.
Anyway, we always set a rule for the trip.

169
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,330
-Decide on one first.
-Me?

170
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:12,999
What matters to me

171
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:15,201
is not falling out
over something silly that happens

172
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,103
when working with a friend.

173
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,306
I'm afraid you might see something
you shouldn't.

174
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:25,011
If either of us thinks
the other has crossed the line,

175
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:28,181
-let's give some kind of hint.
-I'll text you.

176
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:29,549
-You'll text me? Got it.
-Yes.

177
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,918
I'm not really worried about anything.

178
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,953
We've traveled together a lot

179
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,956
and know each other's likes and dislikes.

180
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:40,193
Still, this trip could reveal something
we didn't know about each other.

181
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,127
That's true.

182
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,263
We can change the rules anytime,

183
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,632
but for now,
let's hint at it if either of us

184
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:49,302
-is close to annoying the other.
-Sure.

185
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:52,038
-Should we head to our first destination?
-Sure.

186
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:54,841
We're first going
to the place we mentioned earlier.

187
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,676
-Monet's house?
-That's right.

188
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:59,178
We'll learn how he lived his life,

189
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,980
-but only after we see his work.
-Sure.

190
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,649
Is there any gallery
that Paris brings to mind?

191
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:04,617
The Louvre?

192
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,319
Sorry?

193
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:07,987
CHUCKLING

194
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,822
-Orangerie Museum?
-That's the one.

195
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,358
We're off to the Orangerie Museum.

196
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,962
-Can you do this with me when I say that?
-Sure.

197
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:17,697
We're off to the Orangerie Museum.

198
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:19,432
-Can you say it with me?
-Got it.

199
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,234
-We're off to the Orangerie Museum.
-We're off.

200
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:26,806
-Oh, no.
-Are you regretting this?

201
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:27,907
Of course not.

202
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,378
Press and wave it around.

203
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,279
FAN

204
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:34,847
GIGGLING

205
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:38,284
Let's help him get a cool shot.

206
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,685
Put bubbles in the background.

207
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:41,487
ADDING BUBBLES TO CREATE A COOL BACKDROP

208
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:45,491
Let's help him get a cool shot too.

209
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,428
THANK YOU!

210
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,331
-And to these guys.
-Thank you!

211
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:56,736
That must feel nice.

212
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,604
He looks so good right now.

213
00:08:58,671 --> 00:08:59,705
Wow!

214
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:08,781
EPISODE 6

215
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,750
CHAMP DE MARS

216
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:13,819
10-MINUTE DRIVE
ORANGERIE MUSEUM

217
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:15,855
Hold on a second.

218
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:19,825
Was the Monet exhibit we saw in Japan

219
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,528
from the Orangerie Museum?

220
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:26,299
There are so many paintings
in the Water Lilies series.

221
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:27,567
There's a lot of them?

222
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,370
-During our trip in Paris…
-Yes?

223
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:36,876
…even though we spoke formally on camera
a few minutes ago,

224
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:40,813
we'll speak casually
since being good friends

225
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,549
-gives off a certain vibe.
-Sure.

226
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,452
GIGGLING

227
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,121
Instead of me calling you Director Yi

228
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,824
and you calling me Ms. Jang,

229
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:56,696
let's pick names to call each other
while we're in Paris.

230
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:57,997
We'll choose one for each other.

231
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:58,931
Sounds good to me.

232
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,800
Good. What will my name be?

233
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,468
We're in Paris, right?

234
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,437
Hold on.

235
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,172
I get to veto it if it isn't pretty.

236
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:09,609
-She's saying that because in Japan--
-In Japan,

237
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:12,712
she called me Sashimi.

238
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:13,813
Sashimi.

239
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,383
I didn't back down

240
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,785
and kept saying
how we both liked raw fish.

241
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,555
SHE CALLED DIRECTOR YI "SASHIMI"
BECAUSE SHE LIKED RAW FISH SO MUCH

242
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,957
Since then, we stopped

243
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:29,161
choosing nicknames for each other
on trips.

244
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:30,763
We're at it again,

245
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,732
-let's go with a good one.
-Anything you'd like to be.

246
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,902
Back in the day, after watching Amélie,

247
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,771
I got my hair cut like the lead actress.

248
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,206
No way. Do you have a photo of it?

249
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:41,607
It was a disaster.

250
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,643
No, I erased them all.

251
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,611
I'm suddenly reminded of that movie.

252
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,014
Amélie? Well…

253
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,616
The name's a little too long

254
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:53,152
-to use easily in urgent situations.
-Is it?

255
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:56,389
How about the one we talked about
on the flight here?

256
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:57,423
Jang?

257
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,557
-I don't mind that.
-Right.

258
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,693
Jang is my last name,

259
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,630
and Monet and Camille's son was Jean.

260
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,666
-Go with the son's name.
-Jean?

261
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:07,600
I don't mind that.

262
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,168
I quite like it.

263
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,603
-Call me "Jean," then.
-Sure.

264
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,204
What should be your nickname?

265
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:15,441
WELL……

266
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,244
Another movie we both like

267
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,313
-is Four Nights of a Dreamer.
-Of a Dreamer?

268
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,016
Call me by the name of the girl
the protagonist likes.

269
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,284
Of course!

270
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,752
I called you that so many times.

271
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,821
Didn't it start with an M or a B?

272
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,790
-I'll look it up.
-Call me by that name.

273
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:31,824
Got it.

274
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:32,825
I hear you.

275
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:34,927
SHE FOUND THE NAME RIGHT AWAY

276
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,128
-Is it Basath?
-No.

277
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:38,197
"Montmartre" is your clue.

278
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,466
-Remove "mont" from it.
-Martre?

279
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,867
-Marthe.
-Yes, it's Marthe.

280
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:45,037
-Marthe, got it.
-I like how it sounds gender-neutral.

281
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,772
You left me "marred,"

282
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:47,973
-so Marthe it is.
-Marthe.

283
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,976
Beginning at our first location,

284
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:55,648
Marthe and Jean will talk casually
and enjoy the trip like two friends.

285
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,117
This is awesome.

286
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:00,586
I'm in awe.

287
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:03,222
Who knew I'd get to visit
the Orangerie Museum?

288
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,025
Merci.

289
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:09,962
-This must be it.
-In the back?

290
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,331
This is so cool.

291
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,799
THE HOME OF MONET'S WATER LILIES
ORANGERIE MUSEUM

292
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:17,770
Are you excited?

293
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:18,838
Of course I am.

294
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:22,441
What are you most excited to see?

295
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,610
SHE'S BEGUN TO TALK LIKE A SOLDIER

296
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,412
-Should we use honorifics again?
-I'm good.

297
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,547
Do you two normally speak with honorifics?

298
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:29,615
Well…

299
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:30,983
We recently dropped them,

300
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,152
so I'm annoyed
that she won't speak casually.

301
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,354
CHUCKLING

302
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,523
Look. There's no line.

303
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,859
THE LINE IS SHORT
BECAUSE IT'S NEAR CLOSING TIME

304
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,360
We'll head inside and enjoy.

305
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:45,164
OFF TO ENJOY THE MONET PAINTINGS
THAT SHE WANTED TO SEE

306
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:48,834
It's so pleasant.

307
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:49,902
ORANGERIE MUSEUM

308
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,437
THE ORANGE GREENHOUSE
REPURPOSED AS A GALLERY IN 1927

309
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:52,972
FEATURES A HIGH CEILING
THAT BRINGS IN NATURAL LIGHT

310
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,507
MONET'S WATER LILIES
DISPLAYED UNDER NATURAL LIGHT

311
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:07,386
MONET'S WATER LILIES SERIES IS DISPLAYED
ON THE OVAL WALL

312
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:14,827
MONET'S WATER LILIES SERIES

313
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,996
THIS 8-PAINTING SERIES IS
THE EPITOME OF IMPRESSIONISM

314
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,131
FEATURING SHIFTS IN LIGHT, SEASONS,
AND EVERYDAY MOMENTS.

315
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,367
MONET DONATED THEM TO HIS COUNTRY,

316
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,569
YEARNING FOR PEACE
DURING AN AGE OF WAR AND DISEASE

317
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,806
They must be sitting here
so they can enjoy the paintings.

318
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,045
It doesn't fit in the frame.

319
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,648
Is it not classy to view them up close?
They're all looking from afar.

320
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:37,683
Who cares?
I'd like to look at them up close.

321
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:41,120
This must've taken him forever.

322
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:48,194
Which of these four paintings
do you want to look at the longest?

323
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,262
Which do you want to look at longer?

324
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,530
That one.

325
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:52,431
Why?

326
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:54,533
Let's go over there.

327
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,269
I just love this one.

328
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:03,442
WATER LILIES: GREEN REFLECTIONS

329
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:09,348
It feels damp.

330
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:13,118
I'd love to know what things were like
when he drew this.

331
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:16,689
Which is your favorite?

332
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,290
That one's so pretty.

333
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,826
Let's head over there.

334
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:27,166
His mind could've been waging a war
on itself at the time.

335
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,201
We have no way to know,
but you could be right.

336
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,239
This is pretty.
Let's look at some other paintings.

337
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:35,941
There's more.

338
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,376
No way.

339
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:42,147
ANOTHER OVAL SPACE

340
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:45,284
He must've felt like he would've died
if he hadn't painted this.

341
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,419
These are even gloomier.

342
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,790
If he were in pain at the time,

343
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:54,360
what would he think of people
enjoying his work now?

344
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,696
I wonder what it would be like
for a painter

345
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,733
to lose their sight.

346
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,936
Her dress color matches the painting.

347
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,237
It's like she wore that on purpose.

348
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:08,641
Looking at trees after only seeing water?

349
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,310
-I feel better.
-I know.

350
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,078
I feel lighter in my heart.

351
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:14,346
There weren't any earlier.

352
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,181
-Exactly.
-There were no trees.

353
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,120
It's so pretty.

354
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,791
-Just seeing it was worth it.
-Of course.

355
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:26,792
A PRECIOUS EXPERIENCE

356
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:31,497
FULFILLED DO-YEON'S WISH,
SEEING THE MONET AT THE GALLERY

357
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:34,066
ORANGERIE MUSEUM, PARIS
A 1-HOUR-20-MINUTE DRIVE

358
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,601
THEY HEAD TO GIVERNY,
HOME OF MONET'S HOUSE

359
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,036
How was it for you, Marthe?

360
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,838
I intentionally didn't look online

361
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:42,441
to find out what paintings
were in the museum.

362
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,510
I wanted to imagine
what I'd be seeing today.

363
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:47,913
Anyway, I'll be checking out
the paintings again online

364
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,281
when I go to the hotel later.

365
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,550
After a day at a gallery,
we always talk about

366
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,186
which piece we'd like to take home

367
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:57,389
or which one we'd want to look at longer.

368
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,659
What we feel while looking
at the paintings is one thing,

369
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:03,862
but I also wonder what the artist
would have thought

370
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:05,297
while painting them.

371
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:09,735
I thought about bringing that up later.

372
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:13,372
The paintings were displayed
in a circle around us,

373
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:16,175
and it felt like we were surrounded.

374
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:20,612
The paintings were done
by someone significant.

375
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,115
No pun intended,

376
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,317
but he painted the Water Lilies series

377
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,820
to really develop his artistry
over many years.

378
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,221
This might not make sense,

379
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:32,091
but I felt so small in comparison.

380
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,761
That's how it was.

381
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:39,298
Have I ever done anything in my life

382
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:42,301
that I can say I truly gave my all to?

383
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:45,237
Would I ever be able to invest myself
in something the way he did?

384
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,541
I thought about it, and it turns out
there wasn't anything I did

385
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,311
that I can say I poured myself into.

386
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:57,950
I got a different impression
from the paintings than I expected.

387
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:00,719
That's how it was.

388
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:03,222
The atmosphere shifted.

389
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:06,258
In Paris, it was like walking along
a street full of luxury brands.

390
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,029
AWAY FROM THE CITY,
HEADING DOWN A COUNTRY ROAD

391
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,631
There. It says Giverny.

392
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,066
How fascinating.

393
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,137
GAZING

394
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,539
The houses share the same color palette,

395
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,941
but no two are exactly alike.

396
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:24,810
They were built in harmony
with one another.

397
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:29,481
A MELLOW GAZE…

398
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:34,086
ACROSS THE ROMANCE-FILLED SEINE

399
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:37,189
It's so quiet.

400
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:43,095
ARRIVING IN THE TRANQUIL VILLAGE
OF GIVERNY

401
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,597
-Wait.
-No way.

402
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,803
-No way. It's like a secret garden.
-I know.

403
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:52,805
It's beautiful.

404
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:55,274
THE CHARMING PLACE
THEY'RE STAYING FOR THE DAY

405
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:58,110
It's like someone named Ms. Charlotte
would answer the door.

406
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,679
With her rabbits tailing along.

407
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,614
It'd be a waste to just stay indoors here.

408
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:05,117
SURROUNDED BY A SPACIOUS GARDEN
OF ABOUT 9,900 SQUARE METERS

409
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,188
I can't believe this is someone's home.

410
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:13,459
GASPING!

411
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,362
No way. Even the lights are pretty.

412
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,597
It's like a studio.

413
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,202
It's endless.

414
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,003
What is this place?
Are we allowed back here?

415
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,840
A COZY AND WARM COURTYARD

416
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:31,910
How cute.

417
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:33,745
Wow.

418
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:35,080
This is so cool.

419
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,550
A REMODELED 13TH-CENTURY HOUSE

420
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,918
It's so pretty.

421
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:41,920
This is amazing.

422
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,489
A VINTAGE-STYLE ROOM

423
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,057
This looks fake.

424
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,425
It's too surreal.

425
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,128
The night has settled in.

426
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:51,530
It's so romantic.

427
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:52,698
A SURREAL DAY COMES TO AN END…

428
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,738
Good morning!

429
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:04,676
(COME HERE!)

430
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,613
Go.

431
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,581
APPEARING IN A "TWIN LOOK"
THAT THEY PERSONALLY PREPARED

432
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,416
Hi, Mr. Sky.

433
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,353
What? Hello, Ms. Tree!

434
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:15,754
Good morning, everyone.

435
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,156
EMBARRASSED BY HER FRIEND
DOING HER DAY JOB

436
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,223
Your turn.

437
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,391
SHAKING HEAD

438
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,292
Go ahead. I'll help.

439
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,828
Look! Hi there, my dear friend bug.

440
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:29,134
HEADING TO BREAKFAST, BURSTING WITH ENERGY

441
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:32,838
It's like a fairy tale.

442
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,814
TRYING ONE OF FRANCE'S
SIGNATURE BLACK TEAS

443
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:43,715
Thanks.

444
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:47,419
GASPING!

445
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:48,954
I didn't get any on me.

446
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,088
SHE TRIPPED AND SPILLED THE TEA

447
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:51,957
-I didn't burn myself.
-Everything's good then.

448
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,859
You watered the wood.

449
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,262
When will our sister-in-law be back?

450
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,898
USING IT AS MATERIAL FOR A SKIT
TO LESSEN OK-SEOP'S EMBARRASSMENT

451
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,033
Marthe.

452
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:05,170
Will we ever be able to go
to parties like princesses do?

453
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,272
Darn.

454
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:11,610
Marthe, I want to dance the waltz.

455
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,047
FLEEING

456
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:18,717
Marthe, that fool,
finds things like this embarrassing.

457
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:21,019
If you do, you'll spend
your whole life cleaning floors.

458
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,455
Marthe. What?

459
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:24,823
The music changed.

460
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,258
I can't dance to this.

461
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,492
I can't.

462
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,795
I can't dance to music like this.

463
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,097
Marthe, come on. Join me.

464
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,899
Marthe, what do I do?

465
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,567
MARTHE TURNS THE OTHER CHEEK

466
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,370
Come back over here. The sketch is over.

467
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:40,105
- END OF SKIT -

468
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,873
I'll have the egg first.

469
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,376
Recently, my favorite way
to eat boiled eggs

470
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:47,145
is with perilla oil, salt, and pepper.
This looks like olive oil though.

471
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,882
SALT+PEPPER+OLIVE OIL
TRYING HER FAVORITE COMBO

472
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:52,951
That looks good.

473
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,123
YUMMY!

474
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,224
That's so good.

475
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,827
No way. The egg's so good.

476
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:03,528
I've been dying for a croissant.

477
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,429
No way.

478
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:06,498
It's the same shape as your purse.

479
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,634
Exactly. My mini purse
is shaped like a croissant.

480
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:10,769
Of course.

481
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:12,304
Here.

482
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,307
-Have it with some jam.
-Sure.

483
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:16,375
I just tried a bit on its own.

484
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,110
How is it?

485
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:19,378
It's so moist.

486
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,279
-Really?
-Yes.

487
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:23,515
You can really taste the butter
in every layer.

488
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:24,916
It won't need more butter then.

489
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,485
It doesn't.
You can taste plenty of butter.

490
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,820
You must like tangerine jam
more than strawberry jam.

491
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:31,089
I like having tangerine jam this way.

492
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:32,257
I haven't had tangerine jam before.

493
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:35,560
-Gosh.
-Isn't it delicious?

494
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,763
It's just as good without strawberry jam.

495
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:40,399
-I like the subtle flavors.
-It's so good.

496
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,034
Isn't it delicious even on its own?

497
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:46,271
A BEE WAS DRAWN TO THE SWEET SCENT

498
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:47,272
Hey, it's a bee.

499
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:48,674
-It must be that good.
-The food must be tasty.

500
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,309
It must've been drawn to the honey.

501
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,177
Are you claiming it?

502
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:54,379
Gosh, what a magical moment.

503
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:56,848
THE BEE LANDS ON THE BREAD TO TASTE IT

504
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:58,283
It must be to its liking.

505
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:01,887
Doesn't it look like a character?

506
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:04,589
Right? It's not threatening at all.

507
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,225
From a traveler's perspective,
even bees are adorable.

508
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:10,696
Watch out.

509
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:11,830
THE BEE SUDDENLY BUZZES AROUND DO-YEON

510
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:12,931
Stay still.

511
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,767
It must think we're flowers.

512
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,136
SHE'S SLIGHTLY AFRAID OF IT

513
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:21,239
You know how people who freak out
always get stung first.

514
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:22,808
I'd rather not jinx it.

515
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:25,844
NOM

516
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:27,312
I actually prefer this.

517
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:28,447
-Let's order everything.
-I prefer this.

518
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,848
THE BEE COMES FLYING BACK TO THEM

519
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:31,216
It's a real bee.

520
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:34,519
SCARED

521
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:38,323
-Be careful.
-I'm kind of afraid. Where is it?

522
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,127
It's gone. No, it's not. Hold still.

523
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:46,064
THE BEE KEEPS FLYING AROUND HER HEAD

524
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:47,032
It's okay.

525
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,569
You're fine thanks to
all that hair on your head.

526
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,239
It could still sting me.

527
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,874
It won't sting you
through your thick hair.

528
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:58,276
The stinger's too short.

529
00:22:58,343 --> 00:22:59,478
I'm terrified.

530
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,313
I'm not kidding. This is scary.

531
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,447
What can I do?

532
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:07,085
Stop messing with me
and chase the bee away!

533
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:08,920
What does my hair
have to do with anything?

534
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:10,222
It might sting you.

535
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:12,491
What if it stings you when I swat it away?

536
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,160
Tell me to move, then.
I can't see where it is.

537
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,561
-It's still buzzing around me.
-Stay still.

538
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:17,863
You need to stay still.

539
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:19,297
If I get stung by a bee,

540
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:22,167
I'll be the happiest person
on earth today.

541
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:24,503
GOSH…!

542
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:28,106
SHE EMBODIES MS. POSITIVE AGAIN

543
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:29,374
Isn't that right, Mr. Louis?

544
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,176
It's my first time meeting him.

545
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:36,081
As of today,
I'll be taking over this house.

546
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:39,050
Get on my good side,
and you'll get strawberry jam for free.

547
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:42,621
You were giving off the vibe
of the classical novels you love.

548
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:43,889
Really? Thanks for saying so.

549
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,926
What would you like to eat today?

550
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:50,462
Dishes eaten by the locals,

551
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:53,298
not what tourists eat when they visit.

552
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,534
When we're on trips

553
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,702
and eat at a good restaurant,

554
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,839
we ask the owner
to recommend other places.

555
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:03,208
You're right. We used to do that a lot.

556
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,110
When we saw someone on the street

557
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:08,146
who just looked like a foodie,

558
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,080
we'd follow them

559
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:12,818
and order whatever they were eating,
which was fun.

560
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:15,187
Then, today…

561
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:16,421
After our walk,

562
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,691
we'll head to Monet's house

563
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:22,027
and then leave Giverny, unfortunately.

564
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:26,798
We only spent such a short time here
that it might feel like a dream.

565
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:29,267
-Still, we'll remember it for ages.
-I know.

566
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:32,504
-I enjoyed that.
-Thank you for breakfast.

567
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,774
We're now off to Monet's house.

568
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,209
What a beautiful morning.

569
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:39,511
-I expected no less.
-It smells incredible.

570
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:41,313
-People should spend time in the sun.
-Right.

571
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:43,315
The roofs are all so pretty.

572
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,421
I like that the weather is cool.
And there's a shade.

573
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,388
PRIME WEATHER FOR TRAVELING

574
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,294
GIGGLING

575
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:58,363
And…

576
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:00,999
Look how pretty that is.

577
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:03,268
You're right. Come over here.

578
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,302
Over there.

579
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:06,471
The only thing there is a bench.

580
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:08,106
It must be a tanning spot.

581
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,509
That flower's beautiful. Do you see it?

582
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:13,979
No wonder the people here
created such incredible art.

583
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:17,082
It's fascinating to see scenery
that feels familiar to the paintings.

584
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:18,116
You're right.

585
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,285
I didn't expect a view like this
behind the inn.

586
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,920
I would've regretted not taking this walk.

587
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:23,855
-We came by car yesterday.
-Exactly.

588
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:25,023
THE RELAXING VILLAGE THEY MISSED YESTERDAY

589
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,358
Hey, is that morning glory?

590
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:27,325
Yes, it is.

591
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:28,593
It's so pretty.

592
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,828
It's shaped like a heart.

593
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:34,432
Isn't it nice to see heart-shaped things?

594
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,001
There are hearts everywhere here.

595
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,703
It's the city of romance for sure.

596
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,138
CITY OF ROMANCE, GIVERNY

597
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,140
Check out that old lady.

598
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:45,076
What a beautiful scene.

599
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:46,378
Isn't this like a scene from a movie?

600
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:48,079
This is stunning to watch.

601
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:51,750
No way. She must be cutting them
to put in a vase.

602
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:53,285
-That's so beautiful.
-Gosh.

603
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,620
It's surreal.

604
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:57,556
What a sight.

605
00:25:57,622 --> 00:25:59,457
That's a Rose of Sharon,
Korea's national flower.

606
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:01,826
Isn't that the result
of KPop Demon Hunters going global?

607
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:05,096
Let's go.

608
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:09,401
Zhang Hao actually gave this to me
as a gift.

609
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:11,336
What is it?

610
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,437
It's a phone.

611
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:13,638
It's a used phone.

612
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:16,308
Take a selfie with this.
It comes out really pretty.

613
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:17,842
It's been trending lately.

614
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,245
After we wrapped up filming,

615
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:22,213
I told him to take it back
just to be sure,

616
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,082
but he said it was a gift.

617
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:25,617
-Does he speak in a dialect?
-Gosh, no.

618
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:28,653
I messed up my impression of him just now.

619
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,755
Well, how adorable of him.

620
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:33,358
He's handsome, but he's even sweeter

621
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,893
on the inside.

622
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,228
Anyway, let's take a few photos
with that phone today.

623
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:40,732
-How about a photo?
-What?

624
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,701
-Where?
-Over there. Come here.

625
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:44,703
Don't look directly at me.

626
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:45,971
What should I do?

627
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:48,273
WIDE- APART

628
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:52,577
A HUMAN TRIPOD

629
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,245
-Should I drink some tea?
-No.

630
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:55,313
AWKWARD

631
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,748
Turn a little away from me.

632
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:57,749
Like this?

633
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:59,217
No, don't turn your head.

634
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,486
-My whole body, then?
-Yes, but look this way.

635
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:02,821
Like this? Got it.

636
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:04,189
Wait. Hold on.

637
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:05,657
With your legs…

638
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:08,126
-I'll take a shot of you, so show me.
-Sure.

639
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:12,030
Look at my poses
and tell me which one I look best in.

640
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:14,799
DIRECTOR YI IS IN HER ELEMENT

641
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:16,534
One, two, three.

642
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:18,103
Three.

643
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:20,505
I got it. Take a look.

644
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,841
You'd get embarrassed if I took too long.

645
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:23,942
-Seriously?
-Isn't it great?

646
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,276
It looks amazing.

647
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,614
I should copy you.

648
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,049
Yes, like that.

649
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:32,851
-My legs are too short.
-It doesn't matter.

650
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,052
One, two, three.

651
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,121
I'll keep taking them. Just do your thing.

652
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:37,022
BURST MODE

653
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,922
We're good.

654
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:42,260
BOWING

655
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:45,964
Hello.

656
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:47,065
Hello.

657
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,201
WHAT!!

658
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,606
This must be where he lives.

659
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:56,875
Wow.

660
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,177
What?

661
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,013
SHOWING THEM HIS GALLERY ON THE SPOT

662
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,215
-This is awesome.
-Are those all of his works?

663
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:05,583
Is this his studio?

664
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,457
A GALLERY EXUDING FRENCH AESTHETICS

665
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,225
-No way.
-This is so cool.

666
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:21,833
GASP

667
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:32,577
Oh, I get it. It's like a container.

668
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:33,511
I see.

669
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:34,612
How is this a container?

670
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,181
It's not. It's a bell.

671
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:38,349
AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE CONTAINER(?)

672
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:39,818
-A container?
-It's my work.

673
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:41,986
-A container?
-A container?

674
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,756
What did he mean by that?
Did he mean something else?

675
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:47,125
-It's so cool.
-There's a lizard.

676
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:49,327
WHAT IS THIS CONFUSING-LOOKING BOX[?]

677
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:55,166
I see. Soap.

678
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:58,937
BRONZE SOAP SCULPTURES

679
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:02,974
SCULPTURES MADE FROM SELECTED ART PIECES
OF DECADES-OLD MARSEILLE SOAP

680
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:07,445
FROM MARSEILLE OR OTHER REGIONS
THAT WERE CAST IN COPPER OR BRONZE

681
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:11,516
This is soap?

682
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,118
FASCINATED

683
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:15,754
He must've sculpted all of these.

684
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,589
Did a rat nibble on this soap?

685
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:19,290
CHUCKLING

686
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:22,026
This one's huge. It's big.

687
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:26,498
Check this out.

688
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:27,899
He says we can sit on it.

689
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,834
-Should I sit?
-Yes.

690
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:32,337
You know what? I'll take a memorable shot.

691
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:34,472
SOUVENIR PHOTO TAKEN
AT THE RECOMMENDED SPOT

692
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:35,373
Did you get it?

693
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,243
THEY TAKE IT RIGHT AWAY

694
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:39,410
You look great.

695
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:43,081
Wow.

696
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,651
THEY CONTINUE THEIR TRIP
AFTER THE UNEXPECTED DETOUR

697
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:48,019
How fascinating was that?

698
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:51,456
Recently, I read somewhere that

699
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:54,626
in order for people
to have good luck and opportunities,

700
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:56,594
they need to be kind and smile often.

701
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:57,762
-Really?
-Yes.

702
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,030
Let's do both today.

703
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:00,698
-Yes, let's make it a day.
-Sure.

704
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:01,900
Are you good?

705
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:05,170
LAUGHING

706
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,839
That's an example of kindness
done the wrong way.

707
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:09,774
-Oh my.
-Cool, right?

708
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,943
-That hat…
-It's so pretty.

709
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,678
We used to call that
the Shim Yang-hong hat.

710
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,380
A lot of them are wearing pink hats.

711
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:16,948
I already saw two today.

712
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:19,884
See? There's another pink hat.

713
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:22,554
-Hold on.
-What if we need one to enter?

714
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,957
-Could it be like an entrance ticket?
-Painters used to wear those.

715
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:28,092
There's another person in a red hat.

716
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,229
Let's buy one
if we come across a stall or shop.

717
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:32,397
Yes, let's.

718
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:35,433
QUEUE

719
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,334
They're waiting in line.

720
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:37,368
This looks like the line.

721
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:39,304
-We should get in line.
-Yes, it's the line.

722
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,505
VISITORS FILL MONET'S HOUSE AND GARDEN

723
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:42,540
Is it this big?

724
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:46,244
How rich was he?

725
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:48,213
It's Claude Monet Road.

726
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:50,815
-No way.
-It's huge, isn't it?

727
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:53,718
In we go. Finally.

728
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,588
I'm so nervous.

729
00:30:57,655 --> 00:30:58,890
-Is that him?
-Yes.

730
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:01,125
-Wasn't he stylish?
-You said so earlier.

731
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,493
CLAUDE MONET
FATHER OF IMPRESSIONISM

732
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,362
What you said you would do
is finally coming true.

733
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:06,731
I know. It feels unreal.

734
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,366
I'm only going to say nice things.

735
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:12,737
Are you kidding me?

736
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:13,705
Nice.

737
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,207
It's the same shade of green.

738
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:18,042
-The same shade?
-This shade.

739
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:21,512
GREEN WELCOMES THEM AT THE ENTRANCE

740
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:25,717
It feels weird.

741
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:28,786
-My feet itch.
-Really? Then, scratch them.

742
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:30,488
I can't. It'd be embarrassing.

743
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:33,124
THEY WALK DEEPER INTO THE GARDEN

744
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,159
-Isn't it so pretty?
-It is.

745
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:37,295
How is this someone's house?

746
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,931
Even the stems are pretty.

747
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:42,800
MONET'S PALETTE, MADE BY NATURE

748
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:46,804
THE FLOWER GARDEN PROVIDES
A CONTRAST OF COLORS

749
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:50,275
How can this be someone's house?

750
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:52,710
Someone actually lived here in Giverny!

751
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:54,479
-How was that?
-It was funny.

752
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:55,847
-I see chicken.
-Are those chickens?

753
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:56,848
SHUTTING DOWN HER AWFUL JOKE

754
00:31:58,049 --> 00:31:59,183
They're as white as swans.

755
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,385
That's an actual chicken.

756
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:01,786
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

757
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:02,754
This is stunning.

758
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,422
-Are those apples?
-They are.

759
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:09,794
EVEN THE APPLE TREE WAS PLANTED
TO RECREATE MONET'S GARDEN

760
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:12,697
It's like we've stepped
into his paintings.

761
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,133
No way. Was this his studio?

762
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:16,668
This is where he lived.

763
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:19,904
It's so pretty.

764
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:21,406
-Come this way.
-Why are there so many rooms?

765
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,107
MONET'S RESIDENCE
FOR 43 YEARS SINCE 1883

766
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:25,176
FEATURING HIS WATER LILIES POND,
A JAPANESE-STYLE BRIDGE, STUDIO,

767
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:26,444
KITCHEN, BEDROOM, ALL IN HIS AESTHETIC

768
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,047
It's beautiful.

769
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,983
Now I see why a lot of things
are this shade of green.

770
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:34,886
The house across the road
caught the green fever too.

771
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,522
You're right. It caught the green virus.

772
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:41,559
Nice. We're heading in now.

773
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:42,961
ENTERING MONET'S HOUSE

774
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:45,229
Look, there you are. Jean.

775
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,265
There's Jean. That's me.

776
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:49,968
JEAN DO-YEON

777
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:50,902
Jean.

778
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:55,073
Look. That one's a famous piece of his.

779
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:57,108
I can't believe I'm seeing it.

780
00:32:57,175 --> 00:33:00,511
THE 1ST FLOOR DISPLAYS REPLICAS
OF MONET'S BEST WORKS

781
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,448
Haystacks is also
a famous painting of his.

782
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:07,251
-I had no idea.
-That middle one is Haystacks,

783
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,454
and he drew a whole series of them too.

784
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,589
WITH OVER 25 PAINTINGS,
THE HAYSTACKS SERIES

785
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,758
CAPTURES THE CHANGING LIGHT
AND PASSAGE OF TIME

786
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,794
-That must be his wife.
-Yes!

787
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:18,196
That's her when she passed away.

788
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:19,330
That's right.

789
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:20,999
He painted her like that,

790
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:22,767
probably because he wanted
to remember her even like that.

791
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,068
CAMILLE MONET ON HER DEATHBED

792
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:28,039
TO THE 2ND FLOOR

793
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,274
Doesn't it feel like we're in Japan?

794
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,443
He was heavily influenced
by ukiyo-e prints.

795
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,911
Do you know what's funny?

796
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:36,848
Pottery was shipped from Japan to Europe,

797
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:39,450
and the paper used for wrapping
had illustrations like that.

798
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,386
-Is that what he copied?
-That's right.

799
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:45,223
Monet and Vincent van Gogh were known
to be heavily influenced by them.

800
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,493
JUST THE KNOWLEDGE YOU'D EXPECT
FROM THE HONORARY(?) SON

801
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,428
Is that why they're displayed
with the pottery?

802
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:53,765
Hey, it's the bedroom.

803
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,334
They must've been so happy.

804
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:00,104
-It's stunning.
-Wow.

805
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:02,507
Did he sleep here after he lost his wife,

806
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:05,209
or did he share this room with her?

807
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:06,644
-The bed's not that big.
-It's small.

808
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,446
They could've cuddled,
being in love and all.

809
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:14,385
LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW IN MONET'S ROOM

810
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:18,189
The flowers look amazing from above.

811
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:19,123
I know.

812
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,459
YOU HAVE A FULL VIEW OF THE FLOWER GARDEN

813
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:28,332
Imagine him standing here
and seeing the gardener from afar.

814
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,369
He would've brought out his canvas
and painted that scene.

815
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:39,377
MY GARDEN IS MY MOST BEAUTIFUL MASTERPIECE
- CLAUDE MONET -

816
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:42,213
LOOKING AROUND THE REST OF THE ROOMS

817
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,982
This must've been a sewing room.

818
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:49,821
Even the wallpaper is charming, gosh.

819
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:54,258
The rooms are different colors,
almost like each has its own theme.

820
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,461
It'd be amazing to eat here.

821
00:34:57,628 --> 00:34:59,030
Right? What a joy that would've been.

822
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,832
Look how pretty this is.

823
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:03,167
This must be where they cooked.

824
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:06,704
Head out there. I'll take your photo.

825
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,275
You look great.

826
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:14,245
Here's the Water Lily Pond. This way.

827
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:15,713
THE POND THAT INSPIRED
THE WATER LILIES SERIES

828
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:18,316
SOUND OF FLOWING WATER

829
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:22,220
I can hear water flowing.

830
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:24,889
We'll simply follow the sound of water.

831
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,157
LETTING THE SOUND OF WATER GUIDE THEM

832
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:29,760
Why don't we paint like Monet did
back in the day?

833
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:30,895
It's a pond!

834
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,230
Do you reckon he said that too?

835
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,831
No, he wouldn't have.

836
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:37,568
I'll play the role
of one of Monet's broke friends.

837
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:38,903
Monet, my friend.

838
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,638
Is this how you spend your days?

839
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:43,307
I don't have this at home.

840
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:46,611
Could I maybe paint something here too?

841
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:48,579
-This is stunning.
-No way!

842
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,580
Are those bamboo?

843
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:53,618
A BAMBOO GROVE EVEN MONET'S FRIEND
WOULD'VE BEEN AMAZED BY

844
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:56,921
-It's the same color as in his paintings.
-Oh my lord.

845
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,056
-Aren't the colors the same?
-Yeah.

846
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:01,626
If we stay still,
we'll hear the water flowing.

847
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:03,294
It's so pretty.

848
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:12,336
THE WATER LILY POND
WHERE A RAY OF SUNLIGHT RESTS

849
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:14,405
This is the best.

850
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,040
It's stunning.

851
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,309
Monet could've sat there

852
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,378
-since this is his home.
-Exactly.

853
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:25,483
THEY GO FURTHER IN,
FOLLOWING THE SOUND OF THE WATER

854
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:29,220
WOW!

855
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:31,789
(ARE YOU SERIOUS?)

856
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:34,458
It's exactly the same!

857
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,726
STOMPING

858
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:36,861
Are you kidding me?

859
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:50,875
THE WATER LILY POND,
WHICH BREATHES MONET'S INSPIRATION

860
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:57,081
THIS WAS THE PLACE OF ART
WHERE HE STUDIED THE ESSENCE OF LIGHT

861
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:02,987
A PLACE HE LOVED
UNTIL HIS EYES SUCCUMBED TO CATARACTS

862
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,522
No way.

863
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:09,594
-Look at that lotus.
-It's so elegant.

864
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,964
I kept seeing that flower on the map.

865
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:13,864
You're right.

866
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:15,533
I wondered why, and now I know.

867
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:21,706
MONET HAD MORE THAN 250 PIECES
IN HIS WATER LILIES SERIES

868
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:25,076
He must've been so happy.

869
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:26,143
-While he painted?
-Yes.

870
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:27,912
Absolutely.

871
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,847
His house is right over there.

872
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:33,184
-He could see it from here.
-This is like a painting.

873
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:35,586
They prepared a spot for you to stand in.

874
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:39,490
-Let's check it out from another angle.
-I love it.

875
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:45,363
The volume of birds chirping
and water flowing is just about right.

876
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:50,868
GLANCING

877
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,003
No way.

878
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:54,238
GLANCING AGAIN

879
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:55,539
I almost cried

880
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:58,509
at the way that person gazed at the pond.

881
00:37:58,576 --> 00:37:59,910
Do you know how it was?

882
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:02,113
Like this.

883
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:03,581
Without even blinking.

884
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:04,982
I can see why.

885
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:07,652
It's stunning.

886
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:09,387
This was worth it.

887
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:15,359
SCENERY THAT'LL NEVER GET OLD

888
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:16,961
Do you want a photo here?

889
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:18,763
You've been dying to come.

890
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,831
Can you turn to me a bit?

891
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:22,533
Done.

892
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:27,905
No way.

893
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,740
All the beautiful colors are
in this garden.

894
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:33,577
There's even a butterfly.

895
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,147
How can it be this perfect?

896
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:39,150
Is that Monet's boat?

897
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:41,285
-No way!
-I've always wanted a boat like that.

898
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:44,388
-I want that boat. I'm so jealous.
-It's so pretty.

899
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:45,923
Enjoy, Do-yeon.

900
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:48,326
Enjoy from a higher position.

901
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:50,628
Are you talking
to that squashed version of Do-yeon?

902
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,464
Let's go grab some lunch now.

903
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:57,835
Are we off to the restaurant
where Cézanne and Monet used to eat?

904
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:00,071
Yes, we're off to that salon.

905
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:01,539
I loved it here.

906
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:04,375
THEY'RE NOW OFF TO GRAB LUNCH

907
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:07,678
ATTENTIVELY

908
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,980
They could've sold the hats here.

909
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:11,982
-Let's look at the hats.
-Let's take a look.

910
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:14,218
THEY'RE LURED INTO THE HAT STORE

911
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,655
-Here they are.
-Where?

912
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:18,789
These are it.

913
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:21,625
None of them are pink.

914
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,561
-They must've already sold out.
-Exactly.

915
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:25,863
Do you want to try on a different color?

916
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:28,566
Try this one.
I think it'll look good on you.

917
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:29,867
RECOMMENDING A BROWN BERET FOR DO-YEON

918
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:35,873
STRUGGLING

919
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,441
I don't know how to put this on.

920
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:38,909
Like this?

921
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:40,845
(LET ME HELP)

922
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:43,481
That's right.

923
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:44,915
She's stretching it out a bit first.

924
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:46,684
You stretch it slightly.

925
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,753
Since she stretched it out,
I'll have to buy it.

926
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:50,521
WON'T I HAVE TO BUY IT NOW?

927
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:51,756
Is this how you wear it?

928
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:54,325
Maybe that shouldn't have been pressed.

929
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,926
Is this what "French chic" is?

930
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:57,328
-Lift up the front a bit.
-Right.

931
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,497
-Don't I look like TWO TWO? In a good way.
-It's pretty.

932
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,232
-I'll also try a different color.
-Really?

933
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:02,333
Sure, try one on.

934
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,501
Is black better?

935
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,002
Black or blue?

936
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,238
Here. Try this navy one on.

937
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:11,242
-Like this?
-You look good.

938
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:13,444
It looks different from yours.

939
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:14,879
Don't I belong at a theme park?

940
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:16,614
I look like a frozen corpse.

941
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,516
I feel like I could make you spin.

942
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,284
-How do I make it look like yours?
-Wear it crooked.

943
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:21,886
Crooked? Oh, like this.

944
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,355
Hey, that looks good.

945
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,823
AWKWARD

946
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,057
I look good as well.

947
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:28,959
-You look just as good.
-You look like a chef.

948
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:31,996
-Two of them?
-How much is it?

949
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:33,831
GIVERNY SOUVENIRS BOUGHT

950
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:36,000
Have a nice day.

951
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:38,302
Wearing this hat alone

952
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,272
makes me feel like a painter.

953
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,875
Is what we saw earlier this way?

954
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:47,044
Hold on. Isn't that…

955
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:49,146
Earlier…

956
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:51,916
Is this the place we mentioned earlier?

957
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:53,617
-Wait. I think it is.
-Right?

958
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:56,787
Wow. Bonjour.

959
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:57,721
Here's an empty table.

960
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:01,926
THEY SIT AT A TABLE
WITH SUNLIGHT POURING IN

961
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,928
Haystacks is here too.

962
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:05,796
That's one of your favorite pieces.

963
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:07,798
This is fascinating.

964
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:14,238
A PLACE LOVED BY IMPRESSIONIST ARTISTS,
INCLUDING MONET, CÉZANNE, AND RENOIR

965
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:15,873
Look, desserts.

966
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,341
What should we order?

967
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:18,375
What's good here?

968
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:22,513
Since the sun is blazing outside,
let's get the sun platter.

969
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:38,229
What would you recommend?

970
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:39,663
THE WAITRESS RECOMMENDS A BEER

971
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,599
Here's what we can have. Then…

972
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:42,533
Two, please.

973
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,701
-Two? Okay.
-Yes.

974
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:47,905
I'm super thirsty right now.

975
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:49,006
GULPING

976
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:52,109
-That's so pretty.
-Look how pretty that is.

977
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:56,847
FRENCH CRAFT BEER
THAT'LL QUENCH THEIR THIRST

978
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:06,757
My God.

979
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:09,093
It's like an ad.

980
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,161
CHUGGING

981
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:13,430
KAH-!

982
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:22,139
That's exactly how I like my beer.

983
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,208
The foam…

984
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:25,809
There's a lot of it, but it's soft.

985
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,711
-Also, it's very bitter.
-Exactly.

986
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:28,646
It's bitter.

987
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:32,049
It's slightly more bitter than Hoegaarden.

988
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:33,250
It must be IPA.

989
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:34,485
JUST HOW SHE LIKES IT

990
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,387
-I can't wait to eat.
-Same here.

991
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:39,023
I'm feeling drowsy.

992
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:42,126
Were Monet and Cézanne best friends?

993
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:45,296
Monet and Paul Cézanne?

994
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:48,465
Cézanne had great respect
for Monet's work,

995
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:52,903
and it was Renoir who helped Monet
through his toughest times.

996
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,239
Anyway, what I found interesting

997
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:59,643
was that Eugène Boudin
was his first mentor.

998
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:00,978
-Monet's mentor?
-Yes.

999
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:03,714
Monet started out as a caricature artist.

1000
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:05,015
I'd love to see his work.

1001
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,084
-Caricature…
-Like those artists at Lotte World?

1002
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:08,519
Yes, that's right.

1003
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,221
Monet drew caricatures,
but when Eugène Boudin saw his work,

1004
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:13,390
he told Monet
to paint landscapes outdoors,

1005
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:16,493
-instead of drawing indoors.
-So that's how.

1006
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,430
That's when Monet started painting
landscapes outdoors.

1007
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:22,766
Outdoors, he learned
how light transformed what he saw,

1008
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:27,338
and that inspired him to hone
and perfect his artistry and style.

1009
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:29,239
Anyway, at one point,

1010
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:33,611
people once said he had become a traitor
to the style.

1011
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:35,879
-Monet--
-When he became an impressionist?

1012
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,314
He changed his style, you see.

1013
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:42,019
At the height of his career, he took
on a challenge and changed his style.

1014
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:45,289
Renoir traveled with him during that time,

1015
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:48,325
and the paintings he created
were just as beautiful.

1016
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:51,328
LA GRENOUILLÈRE

1017
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:53,097
Why was Renoir so good to him?

1018
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:55,232
Renoir was a very loving man.

1019
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:56,834
In Renoir's paintings,
the people are like this.

1020
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,502
DRUNK ON LOVE…

1021
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:00,371
They look like this.
You'll know what I mean.

1022
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:04,908
FEATURING WARM COLORS
AND THE PLAY OF LIGHT

1023
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:08,679
THE ARTIST WHO DEPICTS HAPPINESS, RENOIR

1024
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:11,181
The people in Renoir's paintings
are like this.

1025
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:12,750
CTRL+C, CTRL+V

1026
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:13,917
They all look like this.

1027
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:15,419
AS THEY TALK, FOOD IS SERVED

1028
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:16,353
Here's your steak.

1029
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,755
This looks so good.

1030
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:28,632
A GENEROUS AND HEARTY MEAL
AT A TRADITIONAL FRENCH BISTRO

1031
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:31,268
All of this looks so good.

1032
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,270
Look, it's cooked medium.
It looks so good.

1033
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,572
Are you kidding me? Is that gochugaru?

1034
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:41,278
THEY TRY THE STEAK FIRST

1035
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,746
It's so good.

1036
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,016
MMM

1037
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:48,419
This garlic butter is amazing.

1038
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:50,020
Right. I forgot this was garlic butter.

1039
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:53,757
The steak's incredible.

1040
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:55,859
-Why don't we try this too?
-Sure.

1041
00:44:55,926 --> 00:44:56,960
I want to try the eggplant.

1042
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,163
The cheese looks amazing.

1043
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:00,397
SUN PLATTER FULL OF BRIGHT VEGGIES

1044
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:02,199
Try it like a lettuce wrap.

1045
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,106
It's not salty.

1046
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,675
This is so good.

1047
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:13,844
It's light and fresh, not heavy at all.

1048
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:16,447
The cheese is so tasty.

1049
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:19,983
-This is incredible.
-Have a prawn. You love them.

1050
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,185
It's really soft.

1051
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:32,763
This is huge.

1052
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:38,936
YUMMY!

1053
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:40,437
Do you like that best?

1054
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:43,941
It's worth peeling them
even if you hate peeling prawns.

1055
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:47,044
CRUNCH

1056
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:48,212
How is it?

1057
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:54,451
SHE EATS EVERYTHING, EVEN THE PRAWN HEAD

1058
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:57,621
You know,

1059
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:59,523
whether it's jokbal, chicken feet,

1060
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,759
or mackerel,

1061
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:03,961
you always eat it so clean.

1062
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:06,764
…LAUGHING

1063
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:08,665
You have good eating etiquette.

1064
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:10,834
You must've been taught well.

1065
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:12,136
YOUNG DO-YEON WAS WELL-TAUGHT
IN TABLE MANNERS

1066
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:13,403
My hands are clean.

1067
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:14,438
It's fine.

1068
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,941
-Wow, really? No way.
-Eat up.

1069
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:20,711
There haven't been many times

1070
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,146
when someone else peeled prawns for me.

1071
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,082
When I was young
and didn't know any better,

1072
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:26,750
I loved eating crabs.

1073
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:27,651
Blue crabs.

1074
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:30,754
We'd have blue crab stew,
and my dad would peel the crabs for me.

1075
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:33,056
Do you know what I said while eating?

1076
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,692
"I guess Dad doesn't like blue crabs."

1077
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:38,695
That's how kids are.

1078
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:41,832
It's the same as saying,
"My mom only eats fish heads."

1079
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:43,367
But you know, the head is the best part.

1080
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,369
GIGGLE

1081
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:47,304
-Isn't it good?
-It is.

1082
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:49,006
That's a satisfying chew.

1083
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:53,277
After this, we're heading back to Paris.

1084
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,345
-Cheers.
-That was delicious.

1085
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:58,348
WHAT WILL AWAIT THEM IN PARIS?

1086
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:04,755
Guys, we're here.

1087
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,791
We went from being girls from Giverny
to being Paris girls.

1088
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:09,660
This must be a place loved by locals.

1089
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:11,195
That looks so good.

1090
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:12,362
Isn't it delicious?

1091
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:13,564
It's nice and chewy.

1092
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:14,932
THE TEXTURE IS DIVINE

1093
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,633
I can imagine it snapping and cracking.

1094
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,069
That's really good.

1095
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:22,306
FINDING HER… LIKE A CREME BRULEE…

1096
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:24,174
A SWEET, HEART-FLUTTERING MOMENT

1097
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,676
BROUGHT TO YOU IN PARIS

1098
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:27,811
A ROMANCE MOVIE

1099
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:28,946
IS THIS THE LIFE OF A PARIS GIRL…?

1100
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,647
Did he say he's an actor?

1101
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:32,216
What a charming theater.

1102
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:33,717
Even Blow Up is playing.

1103
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:34,918
PACKED WITH MOVIES
RECOMMENDED BY CINEPHILES

1104
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:36,053
There's Aftersun.

1105
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:36,987
We're going in.

1106
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:38,589
-This is so pretty.
-I know.

1107
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:41,358
EXCITED

1108
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:46,997
BEING A PARIS GIRL IS A CHALLENGE

1109
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:49,666
We're about to see the Eiffel Tower
in a special way.

1110
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:53,370
WILL THEY BE ABLE TO TRANSFORM
INTO TRUE PARIS GIRLS?

1111
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:54,538
PARTYING PARIS WITH PARIS GIRLS

1112
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:58,208
It looks like fireworks, like something
out of A Midsummer Night's Dream.
