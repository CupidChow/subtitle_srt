1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,905
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

2
00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:07,707
WHERE JUN-YOUNG ACTIVELY WORKED
AS A K-POP IDOL

3
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:09,709
HE'S IN TOKYO!

4
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:12,178
We only arrived here a few hours ago.
But we already did a lot.

5
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:13,313
Weird, isn't it?

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,881
Do-yeon, can you stand over there?

7
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:16,549
-Nice.
-Really?

8
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:17,884
We're having monjayaki.

9
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:19,552
-I haven't had it before.
-No?

10
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,221
Could we start with some draft beer?

11
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:22,956
YOU'RE SO COOL DO-YEON, HAHA

12
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,724
THROWING BACK SOME BEER
TO REFRESH THEMSELVES

13
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,126
What the hell is this?

14
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,962
THEY EVEN ENJOYED THE PERFORMANCE
BY SOME CUTE TOYS!

15
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,764
Are you kidding me?

16
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,399
We'll go take photo booth pictures.

17
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:34,100
TURNING THE CORNERS OF THEIR MOUTHS UP
AND SNAP!

18
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:35,769
Look at us.

19
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:39,639
THEY PERFECTLY NAIL A VARIETY OF POSES

20
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,141
Promise not to throw these away.

21
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,442
Why would I?

22
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:44,310
It's where I used to live.

23
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,945
We're off to Kamiyamacho today.

24
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:47,580
I haven't been back in ages.

25
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:48,615
This is where Don Quijote used to be.

26
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:50,150
I ate a lot there as well.

27
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,919
It was that park over there.
I spent a lot of time there spacing out.

28
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:54,888
-No way.
-I love it here.

29
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:58,591
WHAT STORY WILL UNFOLD IN KAMIYAMACHO,
HIS OLD NEIGHBORHOOD?

30
00:00:58,658 --> 00:00:59,859
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

31
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:03,063
It's been so long.

32
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,168
The buildings here aren't tall,
so you can see the sky easily.

33
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:10,837
That's why I love walking like this.

34
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:11,938
Looking up at the sky?

35
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,909
THE SKY JUN-YOUNG OFTEN LOOKED UP AT

36
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:17,444
We're almost there.

37
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,545
You can see it from here.

38
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,282
I SEE IT OVER THERE!

39
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,819
What is it?

40
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:27,120
UNSURE

41
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:29,022
-What is it?
-I can see it from here.

42
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:30,723
It's over there.

43
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,725
-What's over there?
-See that tall building?

44
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,728
-Is that where you lived?
-On the 15th floor.

45
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,433
-It's still there.
-What?

46
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,701
-It's still there.
-Right.

47
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,803
Eight years, was it?
How long did you live there?

48
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,938
-There?
-Yes.

49
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:47,340
We lived there from 2014

50
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:50,710
to around 2021 or 2022.

51
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,679
Eight to nine years? Jeez.

52
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,182
I can't believe it.

53
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:59,252
It was ten years ago.

54
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,520
THEY DRAW NEAR HIS LODGING 10 YEARS AGO

55
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,722
Did all the members live
on the 15th floor?

56
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,857
Yes, in one unit.

57
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,760
It had one, two, three… Three rooms

58
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:09,028
and a bunk bed.

59
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:11,464
One living room.

60
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:15,702
I wonder who lives there now.

61
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,604
Tell me about it. I'm curious too.

62
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,707
You have no idea how wild this is to me.

63
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:22,575
EMOTIONS HIT DIFFERENTLY BEING BACK HERE

64
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,878
I haven't been here in the daytime before.

65
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:28,448
-Say you had a chance to relive this.
-Me?

66
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:30,049
Yes. Would you or wouldn't you?

67
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,185
I guess I would.

68
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,420
Really?
Even though things were tough for you?

69
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,323
It had its own shade of romance, I guess.

70
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,292
You and your love of romance.

71
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,593
This is it.

72
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,861
Sheesh!

73
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,664
No way. I can't believe it.

74
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,166
It's really tall.

75
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:49,435
HE'S FINALLY BACK AT HIS OLD PLACE
THAT'S FILLED WITH MEMORIES

76
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,970
-Is this also the same?
-Yes.

77
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:53,072
NOTHING ABOUT THE BUILDING HAS CHANGED

78
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,542
Our ride used to be out here.

79
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:58,077
I'd trudge out of the building.

80
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,181
TRUDGING

81
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,248
I got in and…

82
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:05,418
And then what?
And you immediately fall asleep.

83
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:06,653
HE PASSED OUT AS SOON AS HE GOT IN

84
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,987
That's how it was.

85
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:09,889
THE MEMORIES ARE VIVID,
JUST LIKE HE'S BACK IN THAT MOMENT

86
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:12,825
-I'm glad everything's the same.
-Me too.

87
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:16,529
EPISODE 6
BOUNCE WITH LEE "NOODLES" JUN-YOUNG

88
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,968
WHERE ARE THEY HEADED?

89
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,704
You might absentmindedly find yourself
on the 15th floor.

90
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,874
This is me dragging my suitcase
on my way to Korea.

91
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,744
Why were you going to Korea?
Was it for good?

92
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:33,146
There was no reason for me to stay.

93
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,316
We had time
before promoting our next album,

94
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,385
so we went back to Korea
to work on projects there.

95
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:40,587
UKISS ALSO WENT BACK AND FORTH
TO WORK IN KOREA

96
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:42,055
How was it for you to go back to Korea?

97
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:44,324
Were you eager to return and work hard?

98
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,259
I was just exhausted.

99
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,394
We had to perform
a lot back then, you see.

100
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:53,866
We toured around the country,
holding over 30 concerts in total.

101
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,635
Each concert actually meant
two full performances,

102
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,370
so the total was actually 100.

103
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,806
Over how many months?

104
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:01,774
We held 100 concerts

105
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,209
within three months.

106
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,844
-A hundred within three months?
-Yes.

107
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,547
I've never regretted it.

108
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,048
I'm asked that a lot, you know.

109
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:13,987
"Have you ever regretted joining UKISS?"

110
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:15,421
I haven't,

111
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:16,956
but…

112
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,593
they ask me that in a way
that makes it seem like

113
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,295
they want me to say I regret it.

114
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,397
I bet you felt the need
to deny it even more firmly.

115
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,966
I haven't. I really haven't.

116
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,636
They should never ask you that again.

117
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,639
-Stop asking me that.
-Why don't you regret it?

118
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,641
Because I don't. It was my choice, anyway.

119
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:39,045
I spent half of my 20s here,

120
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,914
and those were my toughest years.
That's why.

121
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:44,217
THE STRUGGLE AND HARD WORK
ARE SOMETHING HE WOULDN'T TRADE

122
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:47,220
-I'm glad everything's the same.
-Me too.

123
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:49,956
No way.

124
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:53,192
That gas station.

125
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,294
I remember that.

126
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,595
-Is that the same?
-Yes.

127
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:56,829
The cars!

128
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:58,798
That was a dealership.

129
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:00,566
-That's a ramen place.
-That used to be around too.

130
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,968
Is it the same?

131
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,070
I'm glad we came here.
It feels fulfilling.

132
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:07,473
Anyway, Yoyogi Park
is straight down there.

133
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:09,609
No way.

134
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:10,843
JUN-YOUNG IS IN CONSTANT AWE

135
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,844
It's like…

136
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,981
I feel like we did enough to be proud.

137
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:16,449
You're now

138
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,584
an actor,

139
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,520
and you returned after finding success.

140
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:21,821
This is great.

141
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,961
Look at you reliving the memories.

142
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:35,134
HE LOOKS AROUND IN SILENCE…

143
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:40,773
WHERE THE MOMENTS OF HIS YOUTH
ARE STILL BREATHING

144
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,310
I'm meeting the manager
from back then this evening.

145
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,314
Is he still in the industry?

146
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,984
After quitting as our manager,
he moved on to doing something better.

147
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:53,286
It's nice that you're reuniting

148
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,754
-after both finding success.
-Exactly.

149
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,825
LEAVING THE VIEW ON HIS CAMERA

150
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,832
-Did you take a photo of it?
-To show it to him later.

151
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,301
It's tall.

152
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:10,636
-It's really tall.
-It sure is.

153
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,405
I'm hungry.

154
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:13,940
Want to grab a bite?

155
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:16,709
There's a place where I used to eat often.

156
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,177
Is it another ramen place?

157
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:19,078
Not ramen, exactly.

158
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,313
-Really?
-Yes.

159
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,214
Let's go, then.

160
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,516
It's not exactly ramen.

161
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:24,517
Sounds good.

162
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,053
I wouldn't have minded ramen,

163
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,421
but I'm glad it's not.

164
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:33,426
AT WHICH RESTAURANT WAS HE A REGULAR
THAT DOESN'T SERVE RAMEN?

165
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:36,929
Do you have any memories
of the place we're going?

166
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:42,468
The first manager we had in Japan
took me there,

167
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:45,238
and I ate there for years after that.

168
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:46,339
As much as you had ramen?

169
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,273
Yes.

170
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:49,776
You're really a one-dish kind of guy.

171
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:51,644
When I come to Japan,

172
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,179
I hit the ramen place from yesterday,

173
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,148
then this place,

174
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:56,315
and I get ramen again

175
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,785
before I leave.

176
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,621
We should call you
Lee "Noodles" Jun-young.

177
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:03,990
You're Lee "Noodles" Jun-young.

178
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:05,691
You just love your ramen.

179
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:08,995
I haven't been here in so long.

180
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,731
-Come on in.
-Sure.

181
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:12,732
ONE OF JUN-YOUNG'S REGULAR RESTAURANTS
ABURASOBA

182
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,535
-This is the place.
-I'm wondering what they serve.

183
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,969
Can you read this, Do-yeon?

184
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:19,172
It's soba.

185
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:20,173
SOBA

186
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,808
It's not ramen, but soba.

187
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:23,709
Do you know this character?

188
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,912
-Isn't that the character that means oil?
-It is.

189
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,680
-You're right.
-Is it served in oil?

190
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,282
It's called aburasoba.

191
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:31,250
I've heard of the dish,

192
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:32,752
-but I haven't tried it yet.
-Really?

193
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,020
-You'll like it.
-Nice.

194
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:35,388
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

195
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,556
-Hello.
-Hi.

196
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:38,858
-Would you like it spicy?
-Yes.

197
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,359
Or regular?

198
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:42,795
I'll have whatever you're having.

199
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,931
-How about this?
-Sounds good.

200
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,334
-We can sit over here.
-Sure.

201
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,470
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

202
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:55,174
-This place is so charming.
-It stays open until late at night.

203
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:58,110
It'd be nice to eat here
after a few drinks.

204
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,414
Imagine filling up on this.

205
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,082
It's actually pretty satisfying.

206
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,985
This is where I had aburasoba
for the first time.

207
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,422
Is oil added to the broth?

208
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,623
There isn't a broth.

209
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,124
You mix it with a sauce like mazesoba.

210
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,497
Still, the oil they use
is actually pretty healthy.

211
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:25,705
AN OIL-BASED SAUCE

212
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,976
+ SCALLIONS
+ MEAT

213
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,912
+ LAVER
+ BAMBOO SHOOT

214
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,848
That looks so good.

215
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:37,350
I'm drooling.

216
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,585
I feel like I'm watching a Netflix series.

217
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:40,887
Your order is up.

218
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,188
-Here you go.
-Right.

219
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,156
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

220
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,295
Hold on. There's nothing to it.

221
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,297
-The sauce is at the bottom.
-Really?

222
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,465
The oil-based sauce sits underneath.

223
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,866
I'm taking a photo of this.

224
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,136
Me too.

225
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,538
No way.

226
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:02,408
It smells incredible.

227
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,912
-It's pretty too.
-This is raw onion.

228
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,013
Onion?

229
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:08,414
The more you add, the better.

230
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:09,382
I love it.

231
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:11,050
It's better with more.

232
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,451
Lots for me too.

233
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:14,020
You'll want a lot of it.

234
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:15,655
This is vinegar

235
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:17,557
and this is rayu.

236
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,158
Here's how I enjoy it.

237
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,028
I go around with the vinegar seven times.

238
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:26,966
JUN-YOUNG'S CUSTOMIZATION:
GO AROUND WITH THE VINEGAR 7 TIMES

239
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,135
And do it five times with this.

240
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:33,472
JUN-YOUNG'S CUSTOMIZATION:
+ DRIZZLE RAYU 5 TIMES

241
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:36,976
What's this combo?
Did you figure it out yourself?

242
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,844
Yes, I've had this a lot,

243
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,415
and this is how I always enjoy it.

244
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,084
I love it.

245
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,218
I love getting pointers from others.

246
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,188
Wow.

247
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,226
It's different, isn't it?

248
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,162
I didn't know it'd be hidden underneath.

249
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,564
I've never seen anything like this before.

250
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:00,666
My mouth is watering.

251
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,508
FEELING ELATED

252
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:11,611
IT'S THE HAPPIEST HE'S BEEN ON THIS TRIP

253
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:13,746
I'm glad…

254
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,281
-This is insane.
-…this isn't ramen.

255
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:18,284
-I'll enjoy.
-I'll enjoy.

256
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:22,355
PAUSING

257
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,790
-Enjoy.
-Try some first.

258
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:25,891
HIS EYES ARE FIXATED ON HER NOODLES

259
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,026
I'll enjoy.

260
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,261
TAKING IN THE AROMA

261
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:30,162
COPYING HER

262
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:31,464
This looks spicy.

263
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:35,134
WAITING FOR HER TO TRY IT…

264
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:37,770
Good, right?

265
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:41,540
HE TAKES A BITE
AFTER SEEING DO-YEON SATISFIED

266
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:42,842
IT'S THE BEST

267
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:44,010
Thank you so much.

268
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:45,978
It's delicious.

269
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,749
SWAYING

270
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,684
It has the flavors I love.

271
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,319
NODDING

272
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,488
It's not greasy at all,

273
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:58,357
and the spiciness hits
the back of your throat.

274
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:01,127
It's not oily at all,
just soft and savory.

275
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,130
-I couldn't be happier.
-Right.

276
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:06,098
I'll never get tired of this.

277
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:15,741
LEE "NOODLES" JUN-YOUNG SAYS,
"ALWAYS EAT ALL THE NOODLES YOU PICK UP"

278
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:20,346
How is the bamboo shoot this good?

279
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,817
-It's sliced thinner today.
-Right.

280
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,786
Which do you prefer?

281
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,255
I prefer it thicker,

282
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:32,491
but this thickness works perfectly
with the soba.

283
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:33,693
It's all strategic.

284
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,362
I remember the first time I had mazesoba.

285
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,665
I said the dish was revolutionary.

286
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,367
Isn't this different from mazesoba?

287
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:42,368
Very different.

288
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:45,905
-How did they think to mix it with oil?
-Exactly.

289
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,773
They took chili oil

290
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,010
and turned it into a sauce
by adding other ingredients.

291
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,713
-No Korean dish is like this.
-Exactly. You're right.

292
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,347
There's nothing remotely similar.

293
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,583
Spicy with a punch.

294
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,051
I'm fascinated

295
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:01,487
by how they thought
to combine onions, bamboo shoots,

296
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,389
and nori.

297
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,991
Here's how it is.

298
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,960
Say this is a ten-member group
that just debuted.

299
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:10,863
The leader and main vocalist
would be the noodles.

300
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,832
You'd think the noodles would be enough,

301
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:16,001
but then the nori jumps in with rap
and is exceptionally good.

302
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,605
Now you know the reason they added nori.

303
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,475
Just when you wonder
why the bamboo shoot isn't doing anything,

304
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,610
it steals the show with its dancing.

305
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,980
Now you understand
why the group needs the bamboo shoot.

306
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,716
"Hold on.
What does the onion bring to the team?"

307
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,752
Turns out the onion
is the overall producer.

308
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,587
PRODUCED BY ONION

309
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:36,489
Amazing!

310
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:37,690
WINS "BEST PERFORMER"

311
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,759
Everyone's pulling their weight.

312
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:41,127
They were all added for a reason.

313
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,931
Is it better without pepper?

314
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,367
That's up to you. If you want,

315
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,036
you can add more vinegar.

316
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:52,905
The same goes for the rayu.

317
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,040
I'd rather not mess up the ratio
we've got going on.

318
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,109
-This will make it spicier.
-I see.

319
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,011
Good. I should have that too.

320
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:02,815
TRYING THE NOODLES WITH PEPPER FIRST

321
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,917
YUMMY

322
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,354
It's good with pepper.

323
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:10,723
I'll now try a spicier version.

324
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,760
When eating in Korea,

325
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:17,029
I rarely slurp my noodles,

326
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:18,297
but in Japan,

327
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,399
that's considered good manners.

328
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,467
To slurp your noodles?

329
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:24,270
I was told you're supposed
to slurp your noodles.

330
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,905
Really?

331
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,109
SLURP

332
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,945
This is so good.

333
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,016
It's tasty in a different way
than yesterday's ramen.

334
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,786
I tend to keep mixing my noodles
when I'm eating this.

335
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,556
There's a cooking technique
called mantecare.

336
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:44,723
What's that?

337
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,527
You mix the noodles in fat or oil,
so it creates a sauce.

338
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,529
-To soak everything better?
-Yes.

339
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:52,565
You're emulsifying the fat.

340
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:55,301
People who are good cooks
know how to enjoy food,

341
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,036
so it's a joy to hear them
explain the dishes.

342
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:59,939
You should go there sometime on a trip.

343
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:00,873
Where?

344
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,541
There's a ramen museum.

345
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:05,244
ALL HE THINKS ABOUT IS RAMEN, HAHA

346
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,179
Mr. Noodles,
there's no end to your obsession.

347
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,482
You'll see plenty of restaurants there.

348
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:12,985
In the museum, I mean.
There are actual restaurants.

349
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:14,954
-Is it in Tokyo?
-Yes.

350
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,255
Really?

351
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,257
What will you do later on

352
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:20,059
with your former manager?

353
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,193
We'll have ramen first.

354
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,596
FIRST, WE'LL GET RAMEN…

355
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:25,097
He already hates it.

356
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,400
Still, I don't get to come here often.

357
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:30,636
Yes, that's true.

358
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,505
Still, I'm a little cautious
bringing it up.

359
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,774
I'm glad you at least
feel guilty about it.

360
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:36,675
Of course.

361
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:38,677
You have to have it though.

362
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,213
After dishing out a few compliments,

363
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,049
I bring up how I'm really craving ramen.

364
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,253
On top of that,

365
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:48,621
I've been holding back

366
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:51,223
watching my weight recently.

367
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,192
-Were you on a diet?
-Yes.

368
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,327
I had been sticking to one meal a day.

369
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:58,163
Yesterday and today,

370
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:00,032
waves of dopamine have been hitting me.

371
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,701
I couldn't be happier.

372
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:03,769
This is great.

373
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,278
I like how the oil

374
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:13,479
keeps the dish warm.

375
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:15,714
Stirring the noodles keeps them
from getting mushy.

376
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:22,888
THE SPECIAL OIL SAUCE
KEEPS THE NOODLES BOUNCY

377
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,566
IN BLISS

378
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,739
EATING IT ALL DOWN TO THE LAST BITE

379
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:42,942
I thoroughly enjoyed that.

380
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,045
-You cleared your bowl.
-It was that good.

381
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,713
That was amazing.

382
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,381
It was delicious.

383
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,083
-I really enjoyed that.
-Thank you.

384
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,285
-I really enjoyed that too.
-Thank you.

385
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:54,887
Thank you.

386
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,089
We're now off to get some coffee.

387
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,158
I've been to this cafe before.

388
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,859
-Really?
-Yes. Let's go.

389
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:03,896
TO THE CAFE DO-YEON PICKED FOR THEM

390
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,597
The sky is so pretty today.

391
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,266
I know. The weather's amazing.

392
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,871
It's been a long time since I felt like
I was actually on a trip.

393
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:15,074
Everything was fun in its own way.

394
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,042
Even the monkey was hilarious.

395
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,811
THE MONKEY WAS SO MUCH FUN

396
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:22,047
THE MONKEY PLAYING THE CYMBALS
LEFT A STRONG IMPRESSION ON HIM

397
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,051
IN A PURE MANIC STATE

398
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:29,288
The restaurant itself
felt like a mini fantasy land.

399
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:32,558
It's like one of those pop-up stores
that vanish as soon as you leave.

400
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:34,893
"Wait, where's that monjayaki place?"

401
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,796
"What are you talking about?
This has been my home for 20 years."

402
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,698
It was as if I was dreaming.

403
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,968
Remember this? We drove down this road.

404
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:43,902
A FAMILIAR ROAD

405
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,573
THE ROAD THEY RODE THEIR KARTS ON

406
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,707
Down there.

407
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:51,310
That just gave me goosebumps.

408
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:54,213
-People took photos of us over there.
-Exactly.

409
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,517
When a foreigner took photos of me,
I waved with no light in my eyes.

410
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,888
It was so funny to hear
people speaking in Korean.

411
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:04,623
They said your name so clearly.

412
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,991
"Isn't that Jang Do-yeon?"

413
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,960
"Look, it's Lee Jun-young!"

414
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:12,131
I wonder what they thought.
We were out there on a rainy day…

415
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,966
-I wonder.
-…riding go-karts.

416
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:16,502
It was an experience to remember.

417
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,070
AN UNFORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE

418
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:19,805
Time really flies
now that it's our last day.

419
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,807
-Time flew by yesterday as well.
-Really?

420
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,742
Not wanting to leave on the last day

421
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,210
is part of a trip too.

422
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,513
-You want to stay for one more day.
-True.

423
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,314
That's why the sky on the last day

424
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,916
feels the prettiest to me.

425
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:32,584
I wonder if it's intentional,

426
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,820
because the weather is always the clearest
on that day.

427
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:38,590
I remember now. This is the place.

428
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:39,491
Let's go.

429
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,060
THEY ARRIVE AT THE CAFE
DO-YEON VISITED BEFORE

430
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,662
This place is pretty famous
and aesthetically charming.

431
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,130
Is this the cafe of your choice?

432
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:48,500
We got our coffees here
and went to Yoyogi Park.

433
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,668
Yoyogi Park?

434
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,272
What's good here?

435
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:55,607
I can't tell what's good anyway,
so I stick to latte.

436
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,143
What about you? Do you enjoy coffee?

437
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,579
Me? I just stick to iced Americano.

438
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:11,423
THEY WILL GO TO YOYOGI PARK SIPPING COFFEE

439
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,093
-You can sit here.
-It's pretty here.

440
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:15,427
Do-yeon, have a seat.

441
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:18,163
This is a bit embarrassing.

442
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,198
A PHOTO SHOOT WHILE WAITING FOR COFFEE?

443
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,634
Just one more. One, two, three.

444
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:24,470
Hold that. One, two, three.

445
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,940
SOAKED IN A FILM-CAMERA AESTHETIC

446
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:28,941
Good.

447
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,611
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

448
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,649
Were you getting mine?

449
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:40,285
I thought you went in there
to look around the cafe.

450
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:43,355
-This is great.
-I know.

451
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,157
WITH THEIR COFFEE,
THEY HEAD TO YOYOGI PARK

452
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,793
That place is really popular with Koreans.

453
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,130
There were mostly Koreans here
when I last came.

454
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,030
SIPPING

455
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:53,332
They all come to the nicest places.

456
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:54,233
Hey.

457
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,601
-Is it good?
-It's good.

458
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:56,702
I'm glad.

459
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:58,604
-This is delicious.
-Really?

460
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,738
I'm relieved.

461
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,707
Did you go to Yoyogi Park often?

462
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:03,442
Yes, especially for playing Pokémon GO.

463
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:04,543
Pokémon GO?

464
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,878
Were you a serious player?

465
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:07,212
I still play.

466
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,815
I STILL PLAY THAT GAME

467
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:10,816
This is nice.

468
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,117
That's one pure soul you have.

469
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,020
Let's say you returned to Seoul

470
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,822
after a trip like this.

471
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,223
What would be

472
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:22,828
your biggest worry or the thing
you'd be most concerned about?

473
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,229
I'd have to get ready for my next role.

474
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,233
-So, being prepared for it?
-That would be my top priority.

475
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,903
You can probably relate,

476
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,404
but you always want to do well…

477
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:34,873
-Of course.
-…on your shows and stuff.

478
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,676
-That's true.
-My acting career

479
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:40,345
is shorter

480
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:42,714
than my singing career,

481
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:47,119
so I think I'm still getting used to it.

482
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,187
You're still getting used to it,

483
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:52,457
even though you've been doing it for years
and have played so many characters?

484
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,793
Everything's still new to me.

485
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,063
What about you, Do-yeon?
What stresses you out the most?

486
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,667
What are some things
you're concerned about?

487
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:04,269
In a lot of ways, I'm like you.

488
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,038
I worry about my shows,

489
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:09,741
since I need to be prepared
for everything to go smoothly.

490
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:11,276
That's something

491
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,345
I still don't find easy to do.

492
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,614
But now that's how I like it.

493
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,983
At first, I was frustrated that things

494
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,119
didn't feel any easier,
even with all my experience.

495
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:23,689
Preparing for shows
always felt like homework,

496
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:24,756
but now I actually prefer it.

497
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,125
It's way better than thinking

498
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,860
I'm some veteran who knows everything,

499
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:32,764
because that arrogance would backfire.

500
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:34,766
-That's inspiring.
-Oh, please.

501
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,437
Watching this show,

502
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:43,976
I can see how much fun you're having

503
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,310
with your job.

504
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:47,679
-That's what worried me at first.
-What do you mean?

505
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,315
I wanted our time together

506
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:53,652
to feel relaxed and breezy
for you as well.

507
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,721
-Really?
-That's what I wanted.

508
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:57,990
That's something I should've thought of.

509
00:20:58,056 --> 00:20:59,524
-You didn't?
-What?

510
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:03,095
I did. I'm just saying
that's part of my job as the host.

511
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:04,830
Of course I think that.

512
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:05,897
I do.

513
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,034
I'm just touched you considered that too.

514
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,102
Whoa.

515
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,672
-Oh, I know what that is.
-Yup.

516
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,274
What was it called? Jjippuri?

517
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,608
Right, matsuri.

518
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:17,609
Sweet.

519
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,379
These things always fascinate me.

520
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,081
I feel lucky when I come across
local events like this

521
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,883
-while on vacation.
-That's true.

522
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,285
I love that.

523
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:27,986
They're going on right now.

524
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:30,956
-Our timing worked out perfectly.
-Right.

525
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,558
You'd tell your friend,

526
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,661
"We were lucky to pick this date."

527
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,129
They're adorable.

528
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:40,432
-They're baseball players.
-They must be in a baseball club.

529
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,134
They're dreaming of being the next Ohtani.

530
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,702
Gosh, they're so cute.

531
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:46,238
-The restroom.
-The restroom?

532
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,208
What is it? Did you want to go?

533
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:51,109
-That's not it.
-Then what?

534
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:55,147
There's a movie I enjoyed
called Perfect Days.

535
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:58,450
It started as a project
promoting public restrooms in Tokyo,

536
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:02,521
but Director Wim Wenders felt
it should be a film,

537
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:04,990
and it ended up being a gem of a movie.

538
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,059
That is one of the restrooms
featured in the film.

539
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,894
They had a reason to be proud.

540
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,431
I also love going to places
featured in movies I enjoyed.

541
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,133
How does it feel to be there?

542
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,803
How does it feel
when you're finally at that place?

543
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,504
I must've visited that place

544
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:22,808
because the movie really moved me.

545
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:25,777
That's why being there feels like

546
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:29,181
I'm tapping into a deeper part
of the story.

547
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:30,582
The emotions hit differently.

548
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:34,786
Call Me by Your Name is another movie
I really liked.

549
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:38,357
A friend of mine loved it just as much,

550
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:41,693
and she sent me some photos
from her Italy trip.

551
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,830
I asked her why she chose a dingy place
over nicer ones,

552
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:49,434
and she said it was the spot
from my favorite scene in the movie.

553
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:50,335
Hearing that,

554
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:52,371
I had to apologize.

555
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:53,739
That happened once.

556
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:54,639
EVERYTHING IS A MATTER OF PERCEPTION

557
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:58,777
What? Oh.

558
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:00,445
How sweet of you.

559
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:02,881
Auntie should stay safe.

560
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,951
When did my nephew get so grown up?

561
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:08,553
Sis, when did your son grow up so much?

562
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:11,556
THE AUNTIE ISN'T CRYING INSIDE

563
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:14,493
Something I noticed about you

564
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,063
is that you can seem
five years younger than you are,

565
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,966
but also 15 years older.

566
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:22,300
-Is that a good thing?
-Of course.

567
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:23,568
I see.

568
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:27,672
Of course it's a good thing.
It means you can connect

569
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,509
with all kinds of people,
no matter their age.

570
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:32,377
I'm saying you're mature.

571
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,045
-That's nice to hear.
-Right.

572
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,581
But then again, you still collect Pokémon.

573
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:38,450
HE STILL CHASES POKÉMON

574
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,218
It's a fun game.

575
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:41,720
I know, I just haven't played it before.

576
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,523
ON THEIR WALK,
THEY COME ACROSS SOME TRAIN TRACKS

577
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,657
That's pretty.

578
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:48,260
The train has such pretty colors.

579
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:53,365
I heard some people
are really into trains like that.

580
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,067
Do they go around searching
for spots like these?

581
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:58,003
Goodness.

582
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,172
A RAILROAD CROSSING KNOWN
AS A GOOD PHOTO SPOT

583
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:01,306
I see.

584
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,841
Come here, Do-yeon.

585
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:06,912
DASHING FORWARD
AS THE CROSSING SIGNAL GOES OFF

586
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:09,181
-What do I do?
-Make it fast, train.

587
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:10,315
Here it comes.

588
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:15,053
THE PHOTOGRAPHER IS READY

589
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,857
YOUTHFUL AND FRESH

590
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:20,692
SWITCHING IT UP

591
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:25,096
THE BORN-TO-BE MODEL
PULLS OUT HER BEST MOVES

592
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:28,567
PHOTOGRAPHER LEE IS SUDDENLY BUSY

593
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:31,603
Na-na. We got our photo.

594
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,938
Did I just tease you?

595
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:34,639
This is such a pretty color palette.

596
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:36,942
I love it.

597
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:38,710
You're next.

598
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:39,778
THE TRAIN MAKES THE PHOTOS
LOOK MORE NATURAL

599
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:41,613
THE TIMING OF THE TRAIN IS IMPORTANT

600
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,781
They're all waiting for the train.

601
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,853
NATURALLY, SHE TAKES A SHOT

602
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,256
UNLIKE DO-YEON, HIS POSE IS A BIT STIFF

603
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,392
SHE FINDS IT CUTE
THAT HER NEPHEW SEEMS NERVOUS

604
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:58,930
AWKWARD

605
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:02,634
GETTING ATTENTION IS HARD FOR INTROVERTS

606
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:03,768
Nice. You did great.

607
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:11,309
PHOTOS THAT ARE JUST SAD

608
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:14,045
THE AESTHETIC OF AUNTS?

609
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,482
-A restroom?
-Yes, it's right over there.

610
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:18,550
Do you see that tree?

611
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:20,619
-You're right!
-It's that one, isn't it?

612
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,288
-That's the main bathroom in the movie.
-Which one?

613
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,257
-It's the last one.
-I see.

614
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:27,325
-It's transparent.
-I know. It's quite fascinating.

615
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:29,828
As you can tell,
you can see through the glass.

616
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,763
If you've done many bad things,

617
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,866
you'll have to use it
with everyone watching.

618
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:37,536
If you've been good,
the glass will turn opaque.

619
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:38,737
Want to put it to the test?

620
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:41,506
I prepared myself for this

621
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:42,741
and wore my prettiest undies.

622
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,177
I need to swing by Don Quijote
for a second.

623
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:48,346
DON QUIJOTE, THE DISCOUNT STORE

624
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:49,948
-You never know.
-That's hilarious.

625
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:52,651
You have to use it like it is?

626
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,486
-Yes, as it is.
-How is that even sane?

627
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,321
The glass will turn opaque.

628
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,291
Imagine how nervous you'd be
while in there.

629
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:02,127
You can lock eyes with people over there.

630
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:03,428
What did they do to deserve this?

631
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,133
JUN-YOUNG ENTERS
THE STALL OF JUDGMENT FIRST

632
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,768
No, please don't.

633
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:11,169
-It's still transparent.
-You have to lock the door.

634
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,337
You have to lock the door.

635
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:14,573
CLICK

636
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,675
THE GLASS ACTUALLY TURNED OPAQUE

637
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:17,576
Can't you see me?

638
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:18,677
I can't.

639
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:21,646
Damn.

640
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:25,083
AN UNEXPECTEDLY CUTE DANCE BY HER NEPHEW

641
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,852
THE AUNT IS PLEASED
WITH HIS CUTE PERFORMANCE

642
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,120
Can you really not see inside?

643
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:30,055
SHAKING

644
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:32,791
You gave us a fun scene to watch.

645
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:35,927
I can't let you one-up me.
I'll be right back.

646
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:39,264
Please be kind
since I'm a lady using the restroom.

647
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:46,104
STRIPPING

648
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,273
What's with her?

649
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:51,309
STRIPPING

650
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,244
She took off both her socks.

651
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,050
I'll take a quick shower.

652
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:02,988
TRACES OF HER BAD JOKE
ARE LYING ON THE FLOOR

653
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:05,457
You really can't see anything.

654
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:06,491
Fascinating, right?

655
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:08,326
I didn't expect it to be real.

656
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:10,595
UGH

657
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:12,364
SIGHING

658
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,165
I feel like she'll do
something else weird.

659
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:19,371
THANKFULLY, HIS AUNT COMES TO HER SENSES

660
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:20,405
Funny, wasn't it?

661
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,009
I was compelled to do something.

662
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:26,244
Anyway, that's fascinating.

663
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,646
How could anyone even think of that?

664
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:29,047
-It's hilarious.
-I know.

665
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:31,449
What if you trusted the glass
to turn opaque,

666
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:33,585
but it broke while I was in the restroom?

667
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,054
Maybe I did too many bad things,

668
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,455
and it wouldn't work for me.

669
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:41,026
Someone who's in a hurry
might not be aware of it and…

670
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:42,360
That'd be humiliating.

671
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:47,499
FINALLY, THEY HEAD TO THEIR LAST LOCATION

672
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:50,535
I remember this park being huge.

673
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:52,303
It took us a while

674
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,838
-to walk across it.
-Yes, it's huge.

675
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:55,140
YOYOGI PARK

676
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:59,411
IN THE HEART OF TOKYO,
THE PARK IS WHERE PEOPLE COME TO RELAX

677
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:01,813
-It's nice here.
-I know.

678
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,386
You also seem like one of those people
who prefer natural scenery

679
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:11,022
to a forest of tall, flashy buildings.

680
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:12,691
This is a million times better.

681
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,360
Isn't this great?
You already feel relaxed.

682
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:17,896
I love it too,
but I didn't when I was younger.

683
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:20,031
Now, my eyes soak up sights like this.

684
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,068
The trees here are beautiful.

685
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:24,769
You're right. They're stunning.

686
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:26,171
Wow.

687
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,479
They're so cute with those bubbles.

688
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,081
-Wow.
-Nice.

689
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:38,950
No way.

690
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:41,252
Is this CGI?

691
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:42,887
Oh my god.

692
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:45,023
What a sight.

693
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:48,426
DO-YEON SNAPS A PHOTO
OF JUN-YOUNG TAKING A PHOTO

694
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,996
THE AESTHETIC OF AN AUNT
WHO LIKES A DREAMY VIBE

695
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,132
They must be here for a field trip.

696
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,735
They're adorable.

697
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:57,869
The kids must be thrilled.

698
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:01,339
JUMPING

699
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:03,541
Look. It's even fun for adults.

700
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,846
You can take a seat on that stool.

701
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,180
When did you prepare these?

702
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:11,683
Weren't you with me the entire time?

703
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,285
I told you I had a helping hand.

704
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:30,835
THE GROWN-UP KID IS MESMERIZED
BY THE BUBBLES

705
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,670
I thought you were chasing a bee.

706
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:34,973
I figured it would come to me.

707
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:39,644
THE CHILDREN HAVE A GREAT TIME
PLAYING WITH THE BUBBLES

708
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,949
I bet they'll smell like soap.

709
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:48,520
Wow.

710
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:52,757
Nice.

711
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:55,493
Come to me.

712
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:56,861
Here it comes.

713
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,432
HE FINALLY MANAGES TO POP ONE

714
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:03,334
You were up against that little guy.

715
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,537
You won.

716
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:06,538
I've still got it.

717
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:07,806
A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT OF GIVING HIS ALL,
EVEN AGAINST A KID

718
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,374
Check out those kids!

719
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,708
They're so cute.

720
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:12,010
How can they be so innocent?

721
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:19,017
THEY CAN'T TAKE THEIR EYES
OFF THE CHILDREN

722
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:20,518
NOT CHILDREN, THE BUBBLES

723
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:24,889
-Go ahead.
-I just want to.

724
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:26,257
That's a big one.

725
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,727
She's so cute.

726
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:32,964
Oh, no. The bubbles are gone.

727
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:34,365
Oh, no.

728
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:35,633
She's adorable.

729
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,335
SHE CAME RUNNING, LOOKING FOR A BUBBLE

730
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:38,670
My gosh.

731
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:42,841
My word.

732
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:44,475
Run faster, kid.

733
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:45,877
Oh, no. It popped.

734
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,318
This is crazy.

735
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:54,485
THE LEVEL OF CUTENESS IS LETHAL

736
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:55,453
Hurry.

737
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,821
Faster. You can do it.

738
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:00,892
Oh, no.

739
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:04,596
-Where is it?
-Where?

740
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:05,964
Over there.

741
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,765
Good luck, but be careful.

742
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:10,635
Watch your step.

743
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,806
DO-YEON'S INNER CHILD TAKES OVER

744
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,543
I'm sorry. I'm too tall, aren't I?

745
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:20,678
I'm sorry.

746
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:21,646
SORRY I'M SO TALL

747
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,249
SHE SPOTS A BUBBLE!

748
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:32,123
THE BUBBLES THE CHILDREN MISSED
ARE POPPED BY THE GROWN-UP KIDS

749
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:34,759
This is fun.

750
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:38,029
What happened? What did the kid say?

751
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,163
I couldn't understand her.

752
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:41,733
I wanted to, though.

753
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,004
-It's so nice here.
-I know.

754
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:49,407
We might be here all night
if we don't get it together,

755
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:50,808
so let's talk about how the trip was.

756
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:53,378
-Is it time?
-It's time to wrap up our trip.

757
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:54,913
-It's time to say goodbye.
-Right.

758
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:56,080
Just like

759
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:57,916
soap bubbles that eventually pop,

760
00:31:57,982 --> 00:31:59,617
-it's a fleeting moment--
-Did you arrange this?

761
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:02,186
Of course.
The bubble guy wasn't cheap to book.

762
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,888
How was it for you?

763
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,857
HONESTLY, HOW WAS THE TRIP?

764
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,359
I was really worried before coming here.

765
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,528
Going on a trip

766
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:14,766
with someone I barely know
isn't something I'm used to.

767
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,435
I didn't know
if I'd be able to adjust to it

768
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,404
or make you feel comfortable enough.

769
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:22,006
That's what I thought about
going into this show.

770
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:25,443
I'm grateful for how you looked out for me
these past two days.

771
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:30,281
Thanks to you,
I got to feel like I was on vacation,

772
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:31,382
which I haven't felt in a while.

773
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,485
Also, getting to know you better…

774
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:35,653
This is fun.

775
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:38,256
-Do we look like we're having fun?
-This was fun.

776
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,527
Overall, I'm grateful
for this opportunity.

777
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:45,196
I hope this special occasion

778
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:50,835
can be the start
of a good friendship between us.

779
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,538
I think the walls went down pretty fast.

780
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:54,973
-Really?
-I mean…

781
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,975
We got comfortable with each other

782
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:59,110
even faster than I expected.

783
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:01,512
Also, this is something I said.

784
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:04,615
Since we were spending two days together,

785
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:07,352
I thought about what kind of trip
I wanted this to be.

786
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:09,287
I wanted to hear more about you.

787
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:11,589
You told us some stories on Salon Drip 2,

788
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,057
but you came across

789
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:17,595
as a decent young man who grew up
in a loving family you'd see on TV.

790
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,864
But then you look a little deeper

791
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:21,866
and realize you had to work hard
in another country

792
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:25,970
and had to go from being a singer
to being an actor as well.

793
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:29,707
You even tap into the dancer side of you
while maintaining your musician persona.

794
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,476
That's something I found intriguing
about you.

795
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:35,580
I came planning to listen closely
to what you had to say,

796
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:37,949
but I never had to actively yearn for it.

797
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:41,886
I absorbed all of that
just from the conversations we had.

798
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,389
It really was a relief,
and I had the best time.

799
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:47,959
Now…

800
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,963
I'll try that again
and run like the little kid.

801
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:58,302
Pretty unsettling, wasn't it?

802
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,140
Because I'm so tall,
I got over there too fast.

803
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,374
I ran like some stomping giant.

804
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:05,810
There was a time
when I was just as small, you know.

805
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,079
Here's our last order of business.

806
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:11,115
It might be a diary,
but there's no set format to it.

807
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:12,984
We'll wrap up today's trip

808
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,852
by sharing a few words.

809
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:16,554
Look at that.

810
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:19,757
I've filled it up quite a bit.

811
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:25,863
-A diary entry?
-Yes, a diary entry.

812
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:29,333
There's no set format. You can draw in it

813
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,501
or jot down a note.

814
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:38,009
WHAT THEY WERE TOO SHY TO SAY IN PERSON

815
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:46,217
AS THE GOODBYE APPROACHES,
THEY POUR OUT THEIR HEARTS IN WORDS

816
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:58,029
THEY HAVE NEVER SEEMED MORE SINCERE

817
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:03,501
PEEKING

818
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:07,572
Did I take too long?

819
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:09,674
Not really, but that's even better.

820
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,743
-We'll now read what we wrote.
-What?

821
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,178
-Do we… Really?
-Yes.

822
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,349
Did you think we gave you time
to write something meant only for you?

823
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:19,884
-Gosh, no.
-In your dreams.

824
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,018
That was silly of me.

825
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:24,689
Who should go first?

826
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:26,224
-Rock-paper-scissors?
-Sure.

827
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,625
Whoever wins goes first.

828
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:29,460
-Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.
-Scissors.

829
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:32,396
PAPER, SCISSORS

830
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:34,465
Right.

831
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,400
I always lose at it.

832
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,302
Do I go first?

833
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:39,237
-Yes.
-Can you go first?

834
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,338
-Sure thing.
-Good.

835
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:41,372
I don't mind.

836
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:44,342
HE PUT OFF READING IT FOR NOW

837
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:46,511
BUT HE'LL HAVE TO SOON ENOUGH

838
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:48,679
You didn't think we'd be reading this.

839
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,316
I'll read what I wrote first.

840
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:55,186
"I guess I stressed over things
being awkward for no reason,

841
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:57,922
because the trip was easygoing and fun,
with great food

842
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,458
and a special go-kart experience."

843
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,827
"Spending time with Jun-young
where he spent his 20s

844
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:06,430
let me get to know him better,
even though our time was short."

845
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,666
"All in all,
the trip had plenty to enjoy."

846
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:11,169
"Just like how rainy Tokyo yesterday
and clear Tokyo today

847
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:12,537
were both good in their own ways,

848
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:15,940
Jun-young's childlike innocence
and his inspiring maturity

849
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,341
were both amazing."

850
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:18,309
"See you again in Seoul."

851
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:21,245
"At Yoyogi Park, from your friend
and youngest auntie, Do-yeon."

852
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,514
THAT'LL BE ALL

853
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:25,116
NERVOUS

854
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,918
-It's your turn.
-Jeez.

855
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:28,853
IT'S FINALLY TIME
FOR JUN-YOUNG TO READ WHAT HE WROTE

856
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,023
"Thanks to you, half of my intense 20s

857
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:35,293
will be remembered fondly,
with lots of laughter."

858
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:37,862
"Much of what we did was new to me,

859
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:40,164
and it wasn't as nerve-racking
because we did it together."

860
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:41,632
"Haha."

861
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:44,468
"Exclamation mark."

862
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:46,437
"The story of our past two days

863
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:47,872
will be remembered."

864
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:51,842
"I'm grateful I got to be part
of a chapter in your life."

865
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:53,544
"It's truly an honor."

866
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:56,180
"Do-yeon, you carry such a big smile
in every moment,

867
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:58,382
but if there ever comes a time
that wears you down,

868
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:01,152
think of our moment
at the Shibuya Crossing yesterday

869
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,920
and push through by being yourself."

870
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:07,792
"During our time together,
I was deeply inspired by your positivity."

871
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:10,628
"As you keep writing
your own book of life,

872
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,296
as a fan and a friend,

873
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:14,899
I'll wish you well-being and joy."

874
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:17,001
"Call me when life gets tough
or you feel bored."

875
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,903
"From the son of Ms. Choi Jin-suk,
Lee Jun-young."

876
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,504
FROM THE SON OF MS. CHOI JIN-SUK,
LEE JUN-YOUNG

877
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:23,341
A TOUCHING LETTER FROM THE HEART

878
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,475
I'm touched.

879
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:25,943
-Thank you.
-That was nothing.

880
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,846
I'd love to rip that page out
and take it home with me.

881
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,548
-This? Really?
-Yes, it was that touching.

882
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:31,983
Thank you so much.

883
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:34,385
I was wondering how to show my gratitude,

884
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:36,287
so maybe by dancing…

885
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:39,190
That came out weird, didn't it?

886
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:43,227
What would've been a seamless transition?

887
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:44,762
See? I still lack as a host.

888
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:46,797
Anyway,

889
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:50,468
we dove into a lot of topics
during our conversations.

890
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:52,303
It's probably because

891
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,338
you're a professional dancer,

892
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:57,375
but seeing you dance in those videos

893
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,010
reminded me once more

894
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:01,178
that I really enjoyed dancing too.

895
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:04,448
Teach me a few dance moves, Jun-young.

896
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,785
There must be some easy ones, right?

897
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:09,854
Consider it the grand finale of our trip.

898
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,755
Okay.

899
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:12,290
What style of dancing do you prefer?

900
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:14,191
Me? I'm ready for anything.

901
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:16,994
Just teach me something
you think I can pull off.

902
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,362
SOME MOVES SHE CAN HANDLE

903
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:19,263
You know…

904
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,465
-Okay.
-Good.

905
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:23,000
I'll teach you the dance moves

906
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:24,669
for my song "Bounce."

907
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:26,904
There's not a lot of fixed choreography,

908
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,273
-so it really comes down to your vibe.
-Got it.

909
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,708
First…

910
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:33,577
On the word "bounce," stomp with one foot

911
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:36,514
-and cross your arms over your chest.
-Right.

912
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,882
-Then,
-Yes?

913
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:40,584
do a circular neck isolation.

914
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:43,621
The motion should be like a swoosh.

915
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:45,122
A SWOOSH?

916
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:46,023
Swoosh.

917
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:49,994
-Damn. Hold on.
-Here.

918
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:51,262
-Let's take it slow.
-Show me the neck isolation.

919
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,196
Boom.

920
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:55,132
-Boom.
-In the other direction.

921
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,500
-Can you do that?
-Boom…

922
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,803
Can you do this then?

923
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,738
-This.
-I can't do that.

924
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,173
-Then…
-I can't.

925
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:03,274
Just do this instead.

926
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,342
ALREADY HITTING AN OBSTACLE

927
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:06,143
-That, I can do.
-In this direction.

928
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,411
-Like this?
-Slowly.

929
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:10,081
Okay.

930
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:13,050
WITHOUT GIVING UP,
JUN-YOUNG PATIENTLY TEACHES HER THE MOVES

931
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:15,853
-And jump.
-Jump.

932
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,488
Then do what you're good at.

933
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:18,656
Just vibe to the music.

934
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:19,690
Be hip.

935
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,325
Do that twice.

936
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:22,860
-You mean, look like a douche?
-Yes.

937
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:24,428
Okay, then.

938
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:26,764
Show me how it's done, and I'll copy you.

939
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:27,965
-I go like this.
-Boom.

940
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,166
Boom.

941
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:33,170
-This is how I do it.
-Right.

942
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:34,271
But you…

943
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:35,172
ROCKING STYLISHLY

944
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,241
You can just do that.
You know, that thing you do well.

945
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:38,342
-You did it yesterday.
-How am I any good?

946
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:39,577
Repeat what you did yesterday morning.

947
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:41,512
WHAT DO-YEON IS GOOD AT

948
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,715
Okay, fine. What's next?

949
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:46,584
Boom, tak.

950
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,018
Jump and land.

951
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:51,155
FINISHING IT OFF WITH A VIBE,
WHICH DO-YEON DOES WELL

952
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,890
There you go. Give it a try.

953
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:54,258
Can you do it?

954
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:56,060
And go.

955
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:01,065
SUDDENLY, A GUST OF HARSH WIND BLOWS

956
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:03,334
THE SKY SEEMS FURIOUS FOR SOME REASON

957
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,469
Isn't it telling us to quit dancing?

958
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:07,071
I'm so sorry!

959
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:09,006
I'm sorry.

960
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:10,708
I'm really sorry.

961
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:12,343
Can you sing the song for me?

962
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,078
-At least make those sounds.
-Okay.

963
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:15,780
One, two…

964
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:17,348
Swish, swoosh.

965
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:19,450
DANCING RHYTHMICALLY TO "BOUNCE"

966
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:22,219
-Just keep bouncing like this.
-Should I… Like that?

967
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:23,154
Bounce.

968
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,956
A SILENT BOUNCE ECHOES THROUGH YOYOGI PARK

969
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,325
Yes, that's what I'm talking about.

970
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:29,727
JENNIE FROM WANDO IS IN THE HOUSE

971
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:31,996
How's that?

972
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,464
-Did you see me bounce?
-That's good.

973
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:34,665
I love it.

974
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:37,902
Here in Yoyogi Park,

975
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:40,538
we'll wrap up our trip to Tokyo.

976
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,873
Let's end the whole thing
with some fun dancing.

977
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:46,010
And go.

978
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:48,145
Boom, boom.

979
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:49,747
Jump.

980
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,015
What was it again?

981
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:57,321
Nice.

982
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,261
-Dance some more.
-More? Really?

983
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:07,565
-Did I just kick you?
-It's fine.

984
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,835
That's a wrap, everyone.

985
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:11,969
THEIR GROUND-SHAKING PERFORMANCE
OF "BOUNCE" AT THE PARK IS OVER

986
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:13,270
-Good job.
-Thank you.

987
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:14,238
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING THEM DANCE IN TOKYO

988
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,141
We'll slate it in style, then.

989
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:18,876
One, two, three.

990
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:24,281
-Good job.
-Great job, everyone.

991
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:28,285
LEE JUN-YOUNG

992
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:38,729
JANG DO-YEON

993
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:56,547
SAVE IT IN MY HEART

994
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:58,082
Out of all the gems in my gem box,

995
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:00,117
she sits in the very middle.

996
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,485
Where are you?

997
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:03,420
Where is my mother?

998
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:04,755
I'M HERE

999
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:06,724
I'm Yoo Ji-min,
gem no.1 inside Do-yeon's gem box.

1000
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:08,726
The theme of our trip

1001
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,394
is Jang Do-yeon and KARINA's

1002
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:12,730
thrilling adventure.

1003
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:13,898
I love it.

1004
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,033
HOWEVER

1005
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,434
SOON AFTER THEIR LIVELY HELLO…

1006
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:18,936
Do-yeon, what's your MBTI type?

1007
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:20,204
I'm an ISFJ.

1008
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:21,572
Only one of our traits matches.

1009
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:22,840
Favorite scent?

1010
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:23,807
Favorite color?

1011
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,376
What if you were reborn?

1012
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:26,777
AN ISFJ VIEWS THE WORLD REALISTICALLY

1013
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,679
Master Do-yeon!

1014
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:29,847
THE SPARKLING KARINA DOESN'T GET TIRED

1015
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:31,382
IN THE END…

1016
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:32,483
What's the matter with you?

1017
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,651
THE GEM BOX OWNER EXPLODES!

1018
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:36,620
Do I know you?
I'm with Getaway and Go with Jangdobari.

1019
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:38,155
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM?

1020
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,056
Is that so?

1021
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:40,524
THE HIGHLIGHT OF SEASON 3

1022
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:42,192
I said we'd do something special.

1023
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:43,260
Have you tried it before?

1024
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,529
-Whoever wins gets to be the prince.
-Okay.

1025
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:47,131
The loser will be the right-hand man.

1026
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:48,666
EVEN DURING PRACTICE

1027
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,067
PLAYING MIND GAMES

1028
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:52,202
KARINA, please.

1029
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,939
WHAT WILL UNFOLD?

1030
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:56,941
AN ARCHERY GAME
ON GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

1031
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:58,876
WHO HIT DEAD CENTER?

1032
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,912
WHAT WILL BECOME OF THE CAMERA LENS?

1033
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:03,747
Wait. Hold on.

1034
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:05,816
This can't be real.

1035
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:06,884
A TRIP WITH KARINA,
ONE OF DO-YEON'S TREASURED GEMS

1036
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:08,052
LAUGH-UNTIL-YOU-CRY KIND OF FUN

1037
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:09,420
I feel like someone just proposed to me.

1038
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:11,055
-It was fun.
-Cheers.

1039
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:12,423
This is absolutely delicious.

1040
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:13,691
A FUN OVERNIGHT TRIP WITH GREAT FOOD
IN POCHEON

1041
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:17,127
Will there be a second date with Do-yeon
after we wrap up this trip?

1042
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:19,163
BRINGING OUT GEM NO.1
OF JANG DO-YEON'S GEM BOX

1043
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:21,231
