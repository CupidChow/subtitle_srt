1
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:05,872
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

2
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:09,175
JANG PAL-MO AND PRINCE KAMONG

3
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:11,378
AFTER SERVING THE PENALTY
FOLLOWING AN ARCHERY LOSS

4
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:13,380
THEY FACED ANOTHER MAJOR OBSTACLE

5
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:14,280
Wait. Hold on.

6
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,016
This can't be real.

7
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:17,517
DO-YEON'S REAL GEM BOX, WITH JI-MIN INSIDE

8
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:19,319
ARE THEY BACK TO DISTANCING
FROM EACH OTHER AGAIN?

9
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:20,520
What does this mean?

10
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:21,921
Do you think there's a ring inside it?

11
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,289
I feel like someone just proposed to me.

12
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,792
THANKFULLY, ALL IS WELL
IN THEIR LOVE AND ROMANCE!

13
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,727
<i>I think it'll be fun hanging out with you.</i>

14
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:30,964
Just one thing.
I'd like to have a drink in the evening.

15
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,198
Can I come in?

16
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:33,533
A FUN GIRLS' NIGHT WITH DO-YEON!

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,201
-I had a blast.
-I had a blast.

18
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,303
THEY POLISH OFF THE FRIED CHICKEN

19
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,872
BBQ, Captain Q.

20
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:41,041
TRYING TO LAND AN AD DEAL

21
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:42,208
I'd rather

22
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:43,510
talk less with you.

23
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:45,311
Little sis.

24
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:48,148
SPEARHEADED BY JI-MIN,
EAGER TO GET TO KNOW DO-YEON BETTER

25
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,749
What if you were reborn?

26
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,451
FOLLOWING RECENT TRENDS

27
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:52,886
"This is what kids do these days."

28
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:54,020
TRYING TO STAY ON TREND
WITH THE YOUNGER GENERATION

29
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:56,756
WHAT LIES AHEAD FOR THEM TODAY?

30
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,458
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

31
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:03,063
Is it raining outside?

32
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:04,764
Isn't it raining?

33
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:05,698
How charming is that?

34
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,000
Isn't it raining?

35
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,002
-It's raining.
-Seriously?

36
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:09,903
WHOOPIE!

37
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:11,838
It's raining, isn't it?

38
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,373
See? I know what I heard.

39
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,341
IT'S RAINING…

40
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,443
How romantic!

41
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:20,447
FINAL EPISODE
TOWARD A SECOND DATE, AH OH AY

42
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:21,981
<i>Makgeolli</i>!

43
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:23,850
NOTHING BEATS MAKGEOLLI ON A RAINY DAY

44
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,051
Would you like some?

45
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:26,820
Sounds good.

46
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,189
How should we make it?

47
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,957
-That sounds good.
-They say unrefined <i>makgeolli</i>

48
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:33,760
mixed with honey is good for digestion.

49
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:36,663
-Unrefined <i>makgeolli</i> mixed with honey?
-Unrefined <i>makgeolli</i> mixed with honey.

50
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:37,897
That sounds delicious.

51
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:41,301
Wouldn't the honey travel down
when added later?

52
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:43,136
-You don't have to finish it.
-This looks good.

53
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,206
You said it looked good
just as I was telling you

54
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,140
that you didn't have to finish it.

55
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,975
That felt nice.

56
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,810
He said it helps with digestion.

57
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:52,946
Will I get to live longer now?

58
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,815
-Here's to longevity.
-Here's to longevity.

59
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:00,753
DRINKING A GLASS OF MAKGEOLLI WITH HONEY
IN HOPES OF LONGEVITY

60
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:05,492
This is delicious.

61
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,695
-How can this not taste good?
-There's no way.

62
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:09,729
STIRRING

63
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:10,630
LAPPING UP

64
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,932
It was like looking in a mirror.

65
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,701
HAHA

66
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:16,769
Thanks for that.

67
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:18,471
I wouldn't mind a mirror like this.

68
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,513
This is tasty.

69
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:31,384
We have prepared a game
of This or That for you.

70
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,418
What's that?

71
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,387
THIS OR THAT

72
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,757
I see.
Most of these questions are realistic.

73
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,592
Who's worse to travel with?

74
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,096
A. A sleepyhead who always
falls asleep riding shotgun.

75
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,399
B. A minimalist who packs nothing
and borrows everything from me.

76
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:47,700
Can you even say that's a minimalist?

77
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,936
-What a nuisance.
-They're a total nuisance.

78
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,304
Are they broke?

79
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,506
It's like this.

80
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:54,440
Ji-min, I'm sorry, but…

81
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,776
Oh no, do you have a foaming cleanser?

82
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,144
-Can I borrow yours?
-Sure, go ahead.

83
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,045
Thanks.

84
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,547
Ji-min, oh dear.

85
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:02,582
Did you bring your phone charger?

86
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:03,516
-Sure, use mine.
-Really?

87
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,951
I'll use it just for a bit. Thanks.

88
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,420
Ji-min, do you have
fresh underwear I can borrow?

89
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,157
APPALLED

90
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:13,660
My last pair of underwear is so worn out,

91
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:16,229
they might just disappear by tomorrow.

92
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,300
How did you even make it to this trip?

93
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,869
That's the kind of minimalist
we're talking about.

94
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,037
-C.
-A minimalist.

95
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:25,405
-There's a C?
-Yes.

96
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:26,606
There's up to an E.

97
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,576
You have three more people to consider.

98
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:30,510
Unbelievable.

99
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,645
Okay, here's travel buddy C.

100
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,948
This place is amazing.

101
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:36,349
I should come here with my boyfriend.

102
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,685
This is delicious!

103
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:40,486
-I should bring my boyfriend here.
-I should bring my boyfriend here.

104
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:42,622
I love what you're wearing!

105
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,224
I should wear that on a date.

106
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,291
My gosh.

107
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,993
Here's D.

108
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,362
Someone who only wants to stay
at the hotel.

109
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,530
The kind that doesn't go anywhere.

110
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:54,033
Let's look around this area.

111
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,668
I'll stay here.

112
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:57,870
Hey, let's go out and eat!

113
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,305
-That looks delicious.
-What…

114
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:02,141
-I'd rather stay here.
-I'd rather not.

115
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:03,943
And do what?

116
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,246
I'll just watch YouTube.

117
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,148
Lastly,

118
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:11,784
someone who says "anything is fine"
and then complains.

119
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:14,554
I'm fine with <i>bungeoppang</i>.

120
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:17,991
I can't have fish!

121
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:20,927
Who's the worst travel buddy?

122
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:24,530
Who can't you tolerate for even a second?

123
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,665
I'm okay with sleepyheads.

124
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,634
-Same here.
-They could be sleepy.

125
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,570
And if someone wants to stay behind,
I can just let them.

126
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,238
-I think so too.
-Right.

127
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,340
-I'm fine as long as it doesn't affect me.
-Right.

128
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:35,908
-Those two won't cause any harm.
-As for C,

129
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,610
I can just tune out what they're saying.

130
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:38,811
"Sure, go with your boyfriend."

131
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,481
However, B and E?

132
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:42,682
They're really annoying.

133
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:45,084
Personally, B will stress me out the most.

134
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:46,185
You're right. What a nuisance.

135
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:47,820
To what extent can you share?

136
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,355
-Skincare or makeup products.
-Yes.

137
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,558
-Phone charger.
-Yes.

138
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,893
I carry around four of them anyway.

139
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,994
Really?

140
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,063
Are you the type to pack everything?

141
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,299
Totally. My bags are always this big.

142
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:00,199
Then you're in danger.

143
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:03,369
Minimalists like them
tend to latch on to people like you.

144
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,038
My teammates only carry tiny purses.

145
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,342
You're a sweetheart.

146
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:12,145
What if you could only have
one of these qualities?

147
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:13,746
Wait, this…

148
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,248
These are related to your job.

149
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:16,649
A.

150
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:19,752
You only hummed a song,
yet fans demanded an official release.

151
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,888
-Nice.
-B.

152
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:24,557
You just swayed to the beat,
but people gush over your dancing.

153
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:26,859
C.

154
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:30,363
You only repeated what you heard,
but people praise your wit.

155
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,231
C.

156
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,133
Why?

157
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,469
Is it because you already have A and B?

158
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,771
DOES SHE THINK SHE ALREADY HAS
THE OTHER TWO QUALITIES?

159
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,606
-Is that it?
-Of course not.

160
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,909
The first two can be acquired
through practice,

161
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,243
but C cannot.

162
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,312
You either have a funny bone or you don't.

163
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:49,382
Do you think it's more important
to be born with a skill,

164
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:54,253
or to work hard to reach your goal?

165
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,357
It's hard to ignore the advantage
of being born with a certain talent.

166
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:01,627
-The gap is much wider for artists.
-That's true.

167
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,696
Besides, talented people
can give it their all too.

168
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:07,867
How much of what you have
do you think you were born with?

169
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:11,604
I wasn't naturally talented
at singing or dancing.

170
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:14,474
I worked hard to get to this level.

171
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,142
So you're effort-based.

172
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,043
Totally.

173
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,845
But I was naturally clever and witty.

174
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,981
I AGREE…

175
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,783
Right. I guess I can't argue with that.

176
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:29,021
Hearing that from someone
as good at dancing and singing as you

177
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,623
makes me like you even more.

178
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:33,693
This is a sad one.

179
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,062
Choose which is better.

180
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,598
Would you rather forget a memory
you shared with your best friend…

181
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:39,999
You're the one forgetting it.

182
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,101
Or would it be better
for your friend to forget?

183
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,004
That's so sad.

184
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:47,240
-Oh no.
-That's so sad.

185
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:48,975
I might start crying.

186
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,044
What's better? Or what's worse?

187
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:55,915
I'd rather my friend forget

188
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,818
and then do it all over again with them.

189
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:00,253
I'll remember it.

190
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,254
Really?

191
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:06,426
Maybe I should start an event company.

192
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:09,862
We can quickly become best friends again
since I know what they like.

193
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:10,930
That's so sad.

194
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,201
Wait, is that it?

195
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:16,702
What a bummer.

196
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:20,873
I was wondering why Kani and Choni
was on here. Together, they're Kancho.

197
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,608
Do they have names?

198
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:23,843
-Should we get hunting?
-Yes.

199
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,744
I haven't done this before.

200
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,078
-Apparently, it's trending.
-Me neither.

201
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,080
I bet we'll find my name.

202
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:29,482
-Really?
-It's a common name.

203
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:31,250
-Ji-min?
-Yes, Ji-min.

204
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,921
Could you tell me your name?

205
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,923
SWEET KARINA ASKS THE CREW FOR THEIR NAMES

206
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:38,491
-It's Su-bin.
-Su-bin?

207
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,493
-I'm Mi-hyeon.
-Writer Mi-hyeon.

208
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,094
-I think they will be here.
-Let's hunt.

209
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,830
I hope they're in here.

210
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,264
-Wait. Damn.
-Did you find one?

211
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,599
I found Su-in.

212
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,734
Here's Yun-jae.

213
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:49,969
Yun-jae. That's Yong-jin's son.

214
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,204
YONG-JIN'S SON, YUN-JAE

215
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,005
-Hi, Yun-jae.
-Sorry, Yun-jae.

216
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:54,340
Auntie Do-yeon will have this.

217
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,244
Grow up healthy and happy.

218
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,879
-What?
-Here's a member of IVE.

219
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:00,913
IVE? Who?

220
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,381
Leeseo? Nice.

221
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:03,583
Hey, I found Hyeon-jun.

222
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,650
Hi, Shin Hyun-joon.

223
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,153
-General Hwang, I hope you're well.
-Cheers.

224
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,721
Sure. Let's eat.

225
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,056
Let's try this.

226
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,727
I like Ahyeon from BABYMONSTER.

227
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:18,431
Right? I'm a huge fan of your rapping.

228
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,201
Actress Park Bo-young.

229
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,705
She's so adorable.

230
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,306
DEVOURING

231
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,009
This is probably Jae-i, right?

232
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,044
I thought it said Jae-mi.

233
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:34,213
Comedian Oh Jae-mi, I respect you so much.

234
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,048
BOING!

235
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:38,351
HAHA

236
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,753
My pals in their 40s to 90s
are going wild.

237
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,091
There's some unexpected fun in this.

238
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:46,526
I didn't find any.

239
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,462
Unfortunately,
we'll have to open another box.

240
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,431
No wonder people buy
a large number of boxes.

241
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,233
Hey, I found Ye-na.

242
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,102
-Nice.
-Ye-na!

243
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:57,303
DUCKLING YENA

244
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,538
Yena, the duckling.

245
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,041
I found Kim Hye-soo.

246
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,176
KIM HYE-SOO

247
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,545
Hello.

248
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:08,514
My cousin, Hyeon-su!

249
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,684
HYEON-SU, IT'S YOUR COUSIN!

250
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,352
Still no Ji-min?

251
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:14,887
I know. Why can't we find our names?

252
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,023
We haven't found the names
of anyone here yet.

253
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,090
They're not here either.

254
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,493
-This is harder than it looks.
-Tell me about it.

255
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,962
It may seem simple,
but there's joy in this.

256
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,132
Let's see.

257
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:28,434
They should be turning up by now.

258
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:29,802
Let's see at least one of you show up.

259
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,105
Here's IU.

260
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:34,240
IU (GIVEN NAME: LEE JI-EUN)

261
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:35,708
CHUCKLING

262
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,945
That wasn't a nice thing to pick up.

263
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,246
BAD INFLUENCE SPREADS FASTER

264
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,149
Here. I found Kim Yeon-koung.

265
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,785
-She's the best head coach.
-She's awesome.

266
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:46,986
SPIKE!

267
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,788
Hey, I have Min-jeong.

268
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,456
Isn't that WINTER's given name?

269
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,525
-I'll eat that one.
-Sure.

270
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,794
MIN-JEONG, ARE YOU WATCHING THIS?

271
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,062
CAREFULLY

272
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,664
Hey, it's Tae-o.

273
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,232
Tae-o.

274
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,935
Meanwhile, our channel is called Teo.

275
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,004
-Salute.
-Salute.

276
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,038
With determination!

277
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,540
I'll work myself to the bone.

278
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,441
With determination!

279
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,010
I found Young-ji's name.

280
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:12,411
-Nice.
-She's your friend.

281
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,014
At this rate, we'll gain 50 kg.

282
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,719
-Imagine having a stack of boxes.
-I know.

283
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,287
This can get scary.

284
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,756
Unfortunately,

285
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,891
I couldn't find one with my name on it.

286
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:26,859
What a bummer.

287
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,662
This sure is a bummer.

288
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,499
If that's how it is, I'm going to drink.

289
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,002
SOOTHING THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT
WITH MAKGEOLLI

290
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:40,906
This has also been trending.

291
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,109
-What's that?
-We're like

292
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,678
a group of 40-somethings

293
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,113
-trying to act young.
-It's like this.

294
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,081
"This is what kids do these days."

295
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,716
"Guys, let's try what's trending."

296
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,318
-What's that?
-Oh, this.

297
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,954
It's called <i>the Book of Answers.</i>

298
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,757
Here are the instructions
on how to use the book.

299
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,426
"With the book closed,
place it on your hand, knees"…

300
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,927
-Knees?
-"…or a table."

301
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,530
"Focus on your question,
with one hand on the book

302
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:07,700
and the other running up and down
the corner of the pages."

303
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:08,934
That sounds weird.

304
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,036
I feel like a pervert.

305
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:14,507
"Stop moving your finger
when you're ready for the answer."

306
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,443
"Open to the page
where your finger stopped,

307
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,179
and you'll have your answer."

308
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,517
It ends like this.

309
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,785
"Are you seeking answers?

310
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,787
Well, they're all in here."

311
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:29,955
Nice.

312
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:31,657
Want to try it?

313
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:35,594
Here goes.

314
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:39,231
Will there be a second date with Do-yeon
after we wrap up this trip?

315
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:46,772
WILL THE BOOK HAVE AN ANSWER FOR HER?

316
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,276
NERVOUS

317
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:58,584
WHAT WAS IT?

318
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:00,753
Do-yeon, this is shocking.

319
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,158
Everything we did…

320
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,393
"Move on."

321
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,061
…was for nothing.

322
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,196
Do-yeon!

323
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:11,297
WE HAD IT GOOD, DIDN'T WE?

324
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:12,998
One of us caused this.

325
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,667
-Just know I was sincere today.
-You ask one.

326
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,968
Ask whose fault it is.

327
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,570
Okay, got it.

328
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,572
-Whose fault is it?
-Got it.

329
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,407
I was sincere today,

330
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,743
<i>and I believe the same goes for Ji-min.</i>

331
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,713
<i>But just now, you told us to move on.</i>

332
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,348
Whose fault is it?

333
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,783
Who's to blame?

334
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,486
I'd like to know
who wasn't fully invested.

335
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:34,920
Please give me an answer.

336
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:39,191
WHAT IS THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION?

337
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,461
"It could be very special."

338
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,362
What could be special?

339
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:45,064
What do you mean?

340
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,567
Sorry, but I have to ask this book…

341
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:50,169
What did you mean by that?

342
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,605
Please explain it so we can understand.

343
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,106
Please.

344
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,077
"It will bring you luck."

345
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,781
-Please.
-What are you talking about?

346
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:03,883
-What could bring us luck?
-Please!

347
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,451
KARINA JOINS HER

348
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,219
I want us to get along.

349
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,854
She isn't so bad.

350
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,090
Just please.

351
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,695
"You will be rewarded
for your perseverance."

352
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:17,630
Okay.

353
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,265
Okay, we'll leave it at that.

354
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,368
I'll keep making an effort
to get closer to you.

355
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:23,669
That's all right.

356
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:24,837
So I shouldn't?

357
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,173
I didn't mean it that way.

358
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:28,941
I didn't.

359
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,509
Was that really necessary?

360
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,411
You have really sharp hearing.

361
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,846
Anyway, that was scary.

362
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,650
There are only two months left
in the year.

363
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:40,619
What was my 2025 like?

364
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:47,226
"You will have to pay."

365
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,229
What the hell did I do wrong?

366
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:51,997
What did I do wrong?

367
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:54,700
"That is unclear."

368
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,969
What do you mean it's unclear?

369
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,103
I just don't get it.

370
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:00,806
-She's getting angry again.
-"Don't try too hard."

371
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:01,974
I'm not trying anything.

372
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,610
Just speak to me
in a way I can understand.

373
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,713
I'm only asking because
this might keep me up at night.

374
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,951
"You will have to pay."

375
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:15,554
-That's the same answer.
-What exactly do I have to pay for?

376
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,122
Did you do something wrong?

377
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,557
I didn't do anything wrong.

378
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,394
I'm not sure what it is,
but I guess I'll have to pay.

379
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:25,965
Will I have a smooth 2026?

380
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,166
Nice.

381
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,338
-"Wait for a better offer."
-"Wait for a better offer."

382
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:33,272
That's deep.

383
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,675
I don't get what you mean.

384
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:39,178
Please be more specific.

385
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,646
You were taught well.

386
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,548
"Fulfill your duties."

387
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:46,285
-Maybe you can just carry on.
-Okay.

388
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:48,854
IT'S ALMOST AN ADDICTION NOW

389
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:49,788
She's addicted.

390
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:53,192
What will 2026 be like for me?

391
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:56,328
At this rate,
you'll rub your fingerprints off.

392
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,364
"It'll certainly be more interesting."

393
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,798
-Yes!
-Nice.

394
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,469
There we go.

395
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:05,638
I'm happy to leave it at that.

396
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:06,538
I know.

397
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:10,009
Could I take this to my room?

398
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,812
What should I wear tomorrow?

399
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,247
"Hmm, beats me."

400
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:19,151
HMM, BEATS ME

401
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:22,021
-Jeez.
-It knows what it's doing.

402
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,055
That was fun.

403
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:26,125
May I quickly brief you
on tomorrow's schedule?

404
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,795
What will my last day with Ji-min
look like tomorrow?

405
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,966
"You will be grateful for something."

406
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,704
-Something grateful?
-That warmed up my heart.

407
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,106
Tomorrow, we'll start

408
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:43,642
by going to an arboretum.

409
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:44,743
-Are you excited?
-Totally.

410
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,246
-You love the smell of leaves…
-And the smell of grass.

411
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,581
-…and being in nature.
-I love nature.

412
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,750
This place will be perfect for you.

413
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:54,687
It rained for a bit today.
You know that, right?

414
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:57,756
Greens look clearer
the day after it rains.

415
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:01,360
Because of that, we'll be able
to enjoy the arboretum at its best.

416
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,063
There's something to be grateful for!

417
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,097
It is something to be thankful for.

418
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:07,599
Since we're going to the arboretum,

419
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,935
-get a good night's sleep tonight.
-Got it.

420
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,804
I'll be taking this book with me.

421
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,707
Tomorrow, you might see me
with bags under my eyes.

422
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:15,908
Make sure to get some sleep.

423
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,843
-All right.
-Good.

424
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,445
See you tomorrow.

425
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:20,846
Good job today.

426
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,082
-Good night.
-Good night.

427
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,555
Bound for a breezy break
with bundles of stories in my bag.

428
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:33,325
I'm Yoo Ji-min
of Getaway and Go with Yoojimini.

429
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:36,195
Sadly, due to personal reasons, Do-yeon…

430
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,697
I'm putting my shoes on
and getting ready to leave.

431
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:43,969
When I walk out the door,
we'll be saying our goodbyes.

432
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,571
All right, here I go.

433
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:47,506
Left foot.

434
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:50,009
Right…

435
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:51,677
SIGHING

436
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:53,912
SNIFFLING

437
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:54,980
Right foot.

438
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:58,317
Are you supposed to talk to the camera?

439
00:16:58,384 --> 00:16:59,651
That's the correct way,

440
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:02,154
but Do-yeon tends to hold it
at waist level.

441
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,823
Isn't it always filmed from this angle?

442
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:06,658
THAT'S RIGHT…

443
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,360
DO-YEON'S UNIQUE LOW ANGLE

444
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:11,363
WE USUALLY SEE HER SHARP JAWLINE

445
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,031
I've seen it so many times.

446
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,601
She lowers it, then suddenly remembers.

447
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:16,802
A SHARP OBSERVATION
FROM A TRUE FAN OF THE SHOW

448
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,370
What do you think today will be like?

449
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:19,938
I get the feeling…

450
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,242
things will be awkward again.

451
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,979
We'll either be awkward
or super comfortable.

452
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,180
I hope it's the latter.

453
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:31,950
We asked a book a question last night.

454
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,086
What did it say again, "Go back"?

455
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:37,823
THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION:
WILL THERE BE A SECOND DATE WITH DO-YEON?

456
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,893
The book told us not to get our hopes up.

457
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:45,097
I woke up this morning and read <i>Demian</i>.

458
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,932
What crossed my mind was,

459
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,301
"It feels suffocating
to read in the morning."

460
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:53,038
From now on,
I'll only read once I'm fully awake.

461
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,808
Even after reading it three times,
I still couldn't understand it.

462
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,976
Still, <i>Demian</i> is an excellent novel.

463
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,746
I've been hooked on Hermann Hesse lately.

464
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:03,382
How should I put it?

465
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,317
To read the works of a great writer
from the past…

466
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:09,388
That's strange. You rarely see
someone's head sticking up over a wall.

467
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:12,524
Do I know you?

468
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:14,960
-Hold on.
-What?

469
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,995
I'm with Getaway and Go with Jangdobari.

470
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:18,564
I'm with Getaway and Go with Yoojimini.

471
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,698
Is that so?

472
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,301
I only have one camera on me,

473
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:26,004
while Yoojimini has this many on her.

474
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,507
It's upsetting to say the least.

475
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,409
I'll take it as your way
of preparing for goodbye.

476
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:31,410
Hang on.

477
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,545
-Hold it.
-I saw your head above the wall.

478
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,680
How odd.

479
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:35,681
That's pretty rare.

480
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:36,849
Hold on.

481
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:41,487
Normally, walls are meant
to block the view.

482
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,522
You shouldn't be able to make eye contact
with anyone from here.

483
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:44,690
That's strange.

484
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,959
I crouched a bit, but nothing changed.

485
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:47,893
Ma'am?

486
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:51,396
That's odd.

487
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:55,968
You weren't late at all,
and you didn't run away.

488
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,803
-Of course.
-You're back with us.

489
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,304
I wonder if you slept well.

490
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,373
I slept like a baby,
but it's chilly today.

491
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,441
It sure is.

492
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,343
The cold air from last night
is still lingering.

493
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:05,410
It rained last night,

494
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,045
and the ground is still wet.

495
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,113
The ground is wet behind us.

496
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,648
But we're on relatively drier ground.

497
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,049
However, over there…

498
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,585
OPINIONS ARE COMPLETELY SPLIT THIS MORNING

499
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,654
I see we've grown pretty close.

500
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,358
It seems we should
probably keep our distance.

501
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:20,759
-Should we head out?
-Should we?

502
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,427
-Sounds good.
-Let's go.

503
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,862
It's really cold.

504
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,065
Morning, sir.

505
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:28,767
-Morning.
-Morning.

506
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:29,835
It's so cold.

507
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,036
It's really cold today.

508
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,105
I think I'll get a runny nose later.

509
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,139
Like Maeng-gu?

510
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,175
You kept talking about Maeng-gu…

511
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,743
-I'm turning into him.
-…and now you're just like him.

512
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,848
33 MINUTE DRIVE, KOREA NATIONAL ARBORETUM

513
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:46,652
As you know,
today is your last day of filming.

514
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:47,886
How are you feeling?

515
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:49,988
It still hasn't hit me yet.

516
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:54,359
It'll probably feel real
when I take off the mic at the end.

517
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,595
I try to approach every day
like it's my first.

518
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:59,164
I don't want to be caught up in it
being the last…

519
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,699
WEEPING

520
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,901
Everyone, just leave.

521
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,304
-Hasn't the show been on for a while?
-A while?

522
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,772
-When was our first day of filming?
-Time flew.

523
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:08,507
-In April.
-Wasn't there a break?

524
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:09,541
April.

525
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:13,245
Hello. Bound for a breezy break
with bundles of stories in my bag.

526
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,214
I'm Jang Do-yeon
of Getaway and Go with Jangdobari.

527
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,215
THE FIRST OPENING WAS FILMED 7 MONTHS AGO

528
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:17,983
I bet you made many memories.

529
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,151
I did, and it was nice

530
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,119
-having new guests every week.
-Of course.

531
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:23,522
Each trip was unique.

532
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,224
Every time, we went somewhere different.

533
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,925
It's kind of sad.

534
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,695
-Is it?
-How can this be the last episode?

535
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:30,996
Why am I feeling sad though?

536
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,197
WHY AM I FEELING SAD THOUGH?

537
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,466
Thanks for agreeing
that this is such a bummer.

538
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:37,803
The windows are fogging up
like it's winter.

539
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,072
I know. I always used
to write on them on buses.

540
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:40,973
Me too.

541
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,008
We absent-mindedly drew hearts.

542
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:43,976
Exactly.

543
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,547
WHY DON'T I WRITE SOMETHING HERE TOO?

544
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,117
FOCUSED

545
00:20:57,022 --> 00:21:02,194
JANGDOBARI

546
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,295
That's cute.

547
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:07,866
DON'T FORGET THE HEART

548
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:15,240
Don't tell me…

549
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:18,877
DO-YEON

550
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,746
-My drawing is really funny.
-It's adorable.

551
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:30,722
-That's cute. Is that you?
-Yes.

552
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,090
How adorable.

553
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:33,725
-Is that your hair?
-It's in a bun.

554
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:35,894
JANG DO-YEON AND KARINA, FOREVER

555
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:36,928
That's cute.

556
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,665
How was it spending yesterday with me?

557
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,433
I felt more at ease than I expected.

558
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:44,870
That's what I love hearing the most.

559
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:47,272
I felt surprisingly comfortable.

560
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:51,276
Before these trips with random guests,

561
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,645
if I wasn't already close
to my travel buddy,

562
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,514
I felt cautious and worried

563
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,083
about whether they'd be comfortable.

564
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,484
It wasn't like that with you.

565
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:00,719
That's a relief.

566
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,988
For me, it was the cafe.

567
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,624
-The cafe.
-I felt much closer to you

568
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:06,558
after our time there.

569
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,360
Where we spend time together
really matters.

570
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:09,261
Absolutely.

571
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,264
-I didn't expect a cafe like that at all.
-Exactly.

572
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:16,468
<i>It felt like a hidden fairy-tale cafe</i>
<i>you stumble upon</i>

573
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,071
<i>-after taking a wrong turn.</i>
<i>-For real.</i>

574
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,340
Isn't it beautiful on the left?

575
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:22,708
-My gosh.
-Hold on.

576
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:25,243
It's a color you only see at this hour.

577
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,279
That's so pretty.

578
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,481
It's charming and serene.

579
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:32,517
I wouldn't mind spending a week here.

580
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:34,219
-It'll feel like a detox.
-Right.

581
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:40,292
AS DAY BREAKS,
THEY HEAD TO THE KOREA NATIONAL ARBORETUM

582
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,671
GWANGNEUNG FOREST,
KOREA NATIONAL ARBORETUM

583
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:55,073
"Fir Forest Rest Area."

584
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,110
Look how tall the trees are.

585
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,144
Seriously.

586
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,680
How tall do you think they are?

587
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:03,115
FIR TREES SHOOTING UP OVER 30 M TALL

588
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:04,383
I couldn't even guess.

589
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:08,186
You all did great work on the show.

590
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:10,789
Let me document that.

591
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:13,225
-Does that include me?
-Yes, it's a group shot.

592
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,228
THEN…

593
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:18,330
Guys, it's a group shot.

594
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,165
It's the last day, after all.

595
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:22,334
GRADUALLY

596
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,903
Make sure to get
a screenshot of this moment.

597
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,973
All right. One, two, three.

598
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,274
Go.

599
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:32,411
THE CREW LEFT A GROUP SHOT,
THANKS TO KARINA

600
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:33,845
Okay, we're done.

601
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,213
Nice.

602
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,982
That must be here for a group shot.

603
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:39,518
A DRONE IS LAUNCHED
FOR A GROUP SHOT WITH KARINA

604
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,519
It's cute.

605
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,788
One, two, three.

606
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:43,755
<i>Ta-da.</i>

607
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:46,725
GOOD LUCK ON THE FINAL DAY OF THE SHOW
FEATURING KARINA

608
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:47,759
That's cute.

609
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,596
I heard this is one of the nation's
top three fir forests.

610
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:52,798
This is incredible.

611
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,733
-Strong roots must be essential.
-Right.

612
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,201
That goes for trees and people.

613
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,636
Whoa, how poetic.

614
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:58,537
Roots.

615
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,440
Stay strong and sturdy,

616
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:03,742
-my roots.
-Roo-roo-roots.

617
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:11,416
I don't think it'll get any better here,
so let's head to the secret forest.

618
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:12,350
Off we go.

619
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:13,752
Let's head there next.

620
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:16,354
TO THE SECRET GARDEN,
THE HEART OF THE KOREA NATIONAL ARBORETUM

621
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:17,456
This is amazing.

622
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,058
Wow, my sinuses feel completely clear.

623
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,326
-Totally.
-Right.

624
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:24,830
Now I understand
why they call it forest therapy.

625
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:25,897
True.

626
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,599
We should take in all this clear air.

627
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:30,135
It's amazing here.

628
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,138
My soul feels healed.

629
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,475
It'll be stunning
with flowers in bloom everywhere.

630
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:37,442
It'll be pure art.

631
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,678
When the flower-filled spring arrives…

632
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:45,951
THROUGH THE FIR FOREST,
THEY REACH THE SECRET GARDEN

633
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:48,720
-No way. It's like a secret passage.
-Are we allowed in here?

634
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:49,988
I thought the same thing.

635
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,190
-It looks like it's off limits.
-I know.

636
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:53,925
What if we're not allowed in here?

637
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:59,998
THE SECRET GARDEN, THE ESSENCE
OF THE 560-YEAR-OLD GWANGNEUNG FOREST

638
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:02,200
TO PROTECT THE WILDLIFE IN THE GARDEN

639
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:04,236
VISITORS MAY ENTER
ONLY WITH A FOREST GUIDE

640
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:08,206
THE GARDEN IS LIMITED TO 15 VISITORS A DAY

641
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,242
Do we open the door and head inside?

642
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:12,077
Looks like it.

643
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:14,379
Gosh, it's stunning.

644
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,248
Korea National Arboretum.

645
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:17,482
Come hither!

646
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:19,918
SUDDENLY, A SKETCH BEGINS

647
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:21,152
I had no idea this existed.

648
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,260
Wait, where am I?

649
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:29,327
Hang on.

650
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:32,631
Wait, my phone.

651
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,634
Year 1925?

652
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,404
I hear there's a performance happening
at the marketplace today.

653
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,406
Where's the entertainer?

654
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:42,941
Where's the performer?

655
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:45,944
A performer named Yoo Ji-min

656
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:48,013
is set to sing today.

657
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,681
I'm afraid she's running a little late.

658
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:51,483
Nonsense.

659
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,319
Pull yourself together and bring her here!

660
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,190
What am I supposed to do?

661
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,693
You're up next.

662
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,330
Follow me in
and pretend you're the performer.

663
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:10,335
KARINA is a world-renowned artist,

664
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,238
so let's see
what kind of comedy she brings

665
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:14,306
as she walks in.

666
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:17,375
She doesn't have to do this to get by,

667
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:22,480
but we'll see
how she powers through the challenge.

668
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:23,648
How will she do?

669
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:24,549
HOW WELL CAN KARINA ACT?

670
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,152
I can't go out there!

671
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:29,988
-It's okay.
-I can't go out there.

672
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:31,156
It'll be all right.

673
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:32,591
You can do this. Walk out,

674
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:35,193
say "Your performer is here,"

675
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,529
and take a bow. That'll be all.

676
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,930
Got it.

677
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:39,965
Here I go.

678
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,569
Yay.

679
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:46,471
Your performer is here.

680
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,608
Master Do-yeon!

681
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:53,578
You did great. Nice job.

682
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:55,246
You've taken another step forward.

683
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:58,750
-Good job.
-I don't think I'm cut out for comedy.

684
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:00,719
I'll focus more on my singing career.

685
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,587
I sort of messed it up too.

686
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,122
That really wasn't easy.

687
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:07,926
You get points just for being cute.

688
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,262
I'm enjoying the sound of the water.

689
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:12,263
For real.

690
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,598
I'd love to jump in.

691
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:15,066
Strike that.

692
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:17,869
That was close.

693
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:20,438
Careful what you say with a mic on.

694
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,109
It's stunning!

695
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:25,810
This is beautiful.

696
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:27,312
I feel cleansed from within.

697
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,414
-Me too.
-How refreshing is this?

698
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,652
It's so beautiful over there!

699
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:35,453
Look at the leaves falling!

700
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:41,760
-What a sight.
-This is beautiful.

701
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,261
It's a real spectacle.

702
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,697
This is absolutely beautiful.

703
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,133
I should bring my parents here sometime.

704
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:49,968
My gosh.

705
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:52,404
Wasn't it beautiful with the wind blowing?

706
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,173
That split second was a sight
for sore eyes.

707
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,275
We were so lucky.

708
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,445
Look at how clear the water is!

709
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,880
You could drink that as is.

710
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:03,948
It's so pretty.

711
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,517
How can the water be this clear?

712
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:08,620
No way. It's unbelievably clear.

713
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,689
You can see how well
this area has been preserved.

714
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:12,223
It was definitely worth it.

715
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,959
I think it's even prettier in the fall.

716
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,261
How can it be so…

717
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:17,929
Do-yeon is clearly delighted.

718
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:19,597
What?

719
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:23,568
From that angle,
doesn't it look like I'm peeing?

720
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,970
-Along with the sound…
-That's bad.

721
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,739
It's beautiful.

722
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,642
My goodness.

723
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:35,246
It feels as if my past sins
are being washed away.

724
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:37,716
I should live a clear, innocent life.

725
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:38,850
This is incredible.

726
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,020
Child-sized chairs are waiting for us.

727
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:43,221
How adorable.

728
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:45,824
All right.

729
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,125
Goodness.

730
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:52,063
This is a unique place where you
must be accompanied by a forest guide.

731
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,699
She's not a certified forest guide,
but we'll be joined by Dr. Park.

732
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:57,435
-Welcome.
-Hello.

733
00:28:57,502 --> 00:29:00,405
Isn't it amazing
being in the secret garden?

734
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:03,174
-This is incredible.
-The door we came through

735
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,844
<i>is a big part of</i>
<i>what makes this place special.</i>

736
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,778
<i>That's right.</i>

737
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:09,180
Not everyone can visit this garden.

738
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,248
From here,

739
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:13,084
you can see the fir forest on the left.

740
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:17,055
On the right, there's a natural forest
that's been preserved for 560 years.

741
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,590
No way. 560 years?

742
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:21,593
That's right.
On the left is a man-made forest

743
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:25,296
where fir trees were deliberately planted.

744
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:28,266
Fir trees fill the space,

745
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,801
keeping it green all year round.

746
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:34,639
As for natural forests
like the one on the right,

747
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:37,709
they start with grass, followed by trees
gradually inhabiting the area.

748
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,612
Over time, pine trees gain dominance,

749
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:45,483
and broadleaf trees survive for centuries.

750
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,384
-So…
-That's so cool.

751
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,153
…when walking through an old forest,

752
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:51,656
you'll see
naturally fallen broadleaf trees

753
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:54,759
and others adorned with fall foliage.

754
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:58,730
A natural forest offers
all of these sights.

755
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:02,834
This is a natural forest.
Only what survives is chosen by nature.

756
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:05,837
That's right.
Since this is Gwangneung Forest,

757
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,941
where King Sejo and Queen Jeonghui
lay to rest,

758
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:12,343
it was designated as a royal forest.

759
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,912
Because of that,

760
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,581
it has been preserved and closed off
from the public.

761
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,349
It's been preserved incredibly well.

762
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:19,951
The water is unbelievably clear.

763
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,588
The sound of the water
is what makes this place special.

764
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,689
I agree.

765
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,625
This is stunning!

766
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,832
It'll feel warm once the sun hits us.

767
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:34,933
You're right.

768
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,069
-It'll be gorgeous in the spring.
-I agree.

769
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:40,038
Nothing's blocking our view.

770
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,641
Even the path is beautiful.

771
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:44,576
It really is.

772
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:49,047
Forests and nature strengthen
our immune system

773
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:51,015
and help relieve depression.

774
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:54,485
This place feels so pure and innocent.

775
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:58,189
I love this smell.

776
00:30:58,256 --> 00:30:59,724
-Nice.
-The smell of leaves and grass.

777
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,292
Exactly, it's your favorite scent.

778
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,763
Maple trees are beautiful.

779
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,032
-I even love the name "maple."
-Exactly.

780
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,838
These stepping stones are adorable!

781
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:15,640
They must extend all the way here.

782
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,041
It's so pretty!

783
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,545
This is absolutely beautiful.

784
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:23,248
LAKE YUKRIM

785
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:25,617
It'll be stunning here
when the lotus flowers bloom.

786
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,619
I love it.

787
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,625
LOOK!

788
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,193
They're adorable.

789
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,362
-Look!
-How cute is that?

790
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:39,130
That's so cute.

791
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,733
-They must be on their way to work.
-They're welcoming us.

792
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,002
-Hi.
-Hi.

793
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,404
Did you see that second one?

794
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:47,305
I did.

795
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:48,940
It's like it was saying, "Who's fussing?"

796
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:50,475
"Who's being so loud?"

797
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:52,677
They must be on their way to eat.

798
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:55,013
Let's grab a bite ourselves, then.

799
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,414
-Let's go.
-Sounds good.

800
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:57,682
I'm hungry.

801
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,018
The water sounds so calming.

802
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,120
I'd love to take this sound home with me.

803
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:06,491
AFTER HEALING IN NATURE,
THEY HEAD FOR SOME HOT KIMCHI JJIGAE

804
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:08,159
A 27-MINUTE DRIVE
FROM THE KOREA NATIONAL ARBORETUM

805
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:09,494
PYONGYANG-STYLE KIMCHI JJIGAE

806
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,195
-The sign alone…
-It smells great.

807
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:13,264
Wow.

808
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,500
Gosh, the smell.

809
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:18,703
Hello.

810
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:22,507
-Wow.
-There's no doubt the food here is good.

811
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:24,609
THE WALL COVERED IN AUTOGRAPHS
IS A GUARANTEE OF GOOD FOOD

812
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:26,611
Can I put my autograph up there too?

813
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:28,913
Of course.

814
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,782
-Hello. Would you like to order?
-Hi.

815
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:33,885
We're going to order kimchi <i>jjigae</i>
and a tofu square.

816
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:37,055
Will two portions of the stew be enough?

817
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,656
-That's what we'll have.
-Sure.

818
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:39,958
Thank you.

819
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:42,393
-Can we order extra meat?
-Yes, of course.

820
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,695
That too, then.

821
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:45,263
-One portion for now?
-Sure.

822
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:46,264
-Got it.
-Right.

823
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:47,432
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

824
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:50,034
I wasn't expecting so many autographs.

825
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:52,770
-Hey, there's your friend.
-Who?

826
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:54,205
It's Se-chan's.

827
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,408
Lee Dong-wook's autograph is next to his.

828
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,543
You're right.

829
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,679
It smells incredible.

830
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,247
I can really smell the sour kimchi.

831
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,416
What do you prefer in kimchi <i>jjigae</i>,
meat or tuna?

832
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,018
Meat all the way.

833
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:08,853
-Likewise.
-I sometimes

834
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,122
crave it with canned tuna, but…

835
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:13,157
-Meat comes first.
-Always.

836
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,960
-<i>Doenjang </i>or kimchi <i>jjigae</i>?
-Kimchi.

837
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:17,762
Kimchi or soft tofu <i>jjigae</i>?

838
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:19,931
-Soft tofu.
-Hey, me too.

839
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,833
-Soft tofu tops everything.
-That's the winner.

840
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:24,068
-I'll serve the stew.
-Sure.

841
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:26,170
My gosh, thank you.

842
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:28,639
It's served with eggs. Wait, is that tofu?

843
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:30,074
-These are onions.
-Onions?

844
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:32,210
Careful, it's hot.

845
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:34,679
My mouth is watering.

846
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:35,847
This looks delicious.

847
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:37,348
It's not like we can show the viewers.

848
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:39,584
I love sea mustard stem.

849
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:42,120
They all look so good. Sea mustard stem!

850
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,222
It's braised eggs in soy sauce. Thank you.

851
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:45,590
Thank you.

852
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,762
TODAY'S MAIN DISH, KIMCHI JJIGAE

853
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:55,266
That's hot!

854
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,267
-That's hot!
-Thank you.

855
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:57,468
Careful, it's hot. What was that?

856
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,370
I thought that was a new dance move.

857
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:01,839
That really startled me.

858
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:05,043
It's been a long time
since I had rice this hot.

859
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:06,744
It's hotter than just warm.

860
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:08,312
SO HOT

861
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,215
You can see the steam coming off it.

862
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,018
I'm starving.

863
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:15,186
HOT STEAMED RICE AND KIMCHI JJIGAE

864
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:16,354
It smells so good.

865
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,257
Look at how shiny the rice is.

866
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:22,360
Can you pass me the ladle
so I can give it a stir?

867
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:37,809
There was tofu hiding underneath.

868
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,010
I'm practically drooling.

869
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,078
Nice.

870
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:42,113
-This looks so good.
-Right.

871
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,051
-Look at the meat.
-Why is it so big?

872
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:49,987
If it isn't enough,
we can add more meat later.

873
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:52,223
I kind of want more though.

874
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:56,094
Can you believe it? Look.

875
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,161
THE SIZE OF THE MEAT LEAVES YOU
IN CONSTANT AWE

876
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,465
Here's your tofu.

877
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:02,667
JUST THEN, THE SQUARE TOFU IS SERVED

878
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:06,104
Check out the square tofu.

879
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,839
STEAMING HOT, MOIST SQUARE TOFU

880
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:12,310
BOUNCY

881
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:14,112
-Let's dig in.
-Let's dig in.

882
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,247
SQUEALING

883
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:17,882
-Should I get you some?
-It's fine.

884
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,183
Have some first.

885
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,352
I'LL SCOOP SOME UP FIRST, THEN

886
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:22,553
Oh no.

887
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,624
Want to play rock-paper-scissors?
The loser doesn't get to eat.

888
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:29,794
Cruel, right? We won't do it.

889
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:31,863
THEN WHY DID YOU SUGGEST IT?

890
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:33,965
I always lose at rock-paper-scissors.

891
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:35,500
Can't we play a round just for kicks?

892
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:38,069
Let's pretend the loser
doesn't get to eat.

893
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:40,071
Get a grip on yourself.

894
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,239
I'm already annoyed.

895
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,240
I'm pissed off too.

896
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,574
Don't you dare lose.

897
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:44,876
I'll hit my hand.

898
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:47,411
-Loser misses out, rock-paper-scissors.
-Loser misses out, rock-paper-scissors.

899
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,546
Oh, no.

900
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:49,747
See?

901
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,916
Pull it together, or I'll rip you apart.

902
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,253
-Do-yeon, you always throw scissors.
-I never stood a chance.

903
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,187
What?

904
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:57,255
She's right.

905
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,623
What did you just say?

906
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:00,858
I always lose at rock-paper-scissors
with my teammates.

907
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:03,694
When I asked why,

908
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:05,863
they told me I only throw rock.

909
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,832
SHE ONLY THROWS SCISSORS,
SHE ONLY THROWS ROCK

910
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:10,668
I've never gone up against someone
who only throws scissors before.

911
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:13,404
FATE IS AT PLAY

912
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:15,806
I always forget and end up throwing rock,

913
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:17,842
but you always throw scissors.

914
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:19,844
-Thanks for getting me some.
-I mean…

915
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:21,445
-I'm grateful.
-Thanks.

916
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,314
From now on, you're Rocky.

917
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:24,582
And you're Scissy.

918
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,417
Scissy?

919
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:28,986
-That doesn't sound nice, but still.
-Scissy?

920
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:30,555
-That's cute.
-Dig in, Do-yeon.

921
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:31,622
No, I'll wait for you.

922
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:34,792
This is exactly
how I like my kimchi <i>jjigae</i>.

923
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:35,693
Really?

924
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,828
The soup isn't heavy,

925
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:40,565
and the pork comes in thick chunks.

926
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:42,533
I couldn't be happier.

927
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,270
-Thanks for the meal.
-Thanks for the meal.

928
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:48,873
TRYING THE SOUP FIRST

929
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:51,876
TOUCHED

930
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:54,178
Mommy.

931
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:58,349
It's spicy. Thanks.

932
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,017
-The flavors are clean.
-Tell me about it.

933
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,453
REFILLING IT RIGHT AFTER ONE SPOONFUL

934
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:05,590
This feels like the kind of place

935
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:07,892
dads come to drink during the day.

936
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:08,826
It'll drive them crazy.

937
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,695
It's so good.

938
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:12,863
EATING A PIECE OF WELL-COOKED KIMCHI

939
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:13,931
YUMMY!

940
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:18,236
I knew it.

941
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,705
The kimchi itself is tasty.

942
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,074
I'll try it with the meat next.

943
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:26,110
A MOUTHFUL

944
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,149
The pork tastes amazing.

945
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:33,251
-Really?
-Yes.

946
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:36,220
GOING IN WITH ANTICIPATION

947
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,391
No way, the meat…

948
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:41,792
Isn't the meat incredible?

949
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:43,094
It's thick and hearty.

950
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,636
A dish like this only needs some rice.

951
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,339
YUMMY!

952
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:58,075
I'll try the square tofu next.

953
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:03,648
Is it good?

954
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:04,615
AN EXPRESSION SAVED ONLY
FOR DELICIOUS FOOD

955
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:06,384
Even their soy sauce tastes great.

956
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:08,786
How can it be this soft?

957
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:12,890
NODDING IN AGREEMENT,
EVEN THE SQUARE TOFU IS PERFECT

958
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:16,060
Is there anyone in aespa
who likes to cook?

959
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:17,928
I guess we can all cook a little.

960
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:19,063
Really?

961
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,232
Does every member have something
they can cook well?

962
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:28,005
GISELLE is good at stir-fried rice,

963
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:29,674
NINGNING

964
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,476
cooks Western or Chinese food,

965
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:33,944
and WINTER cooks Korean dishes.

966
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:35,446
I see. What about you?

967
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:37,048
I'm the taster.

968
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:39,150
TASTER

969
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:41,152
That's nicely balanced.

970
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:42,186
-Right?
-Someone has to taste the food.

971
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:43,087
Exactly.

972
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:46,123
Cooking is only meaningful
when you have someone to eat it.

973
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,758
Of course. Eating is part
of the whole process.

974
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,695
I bet NINGNING's food is kind of bland.
Is it?

975
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:51,696
My gosh.

976
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:53,230
Who knows?

977
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:55,933
-I'm just saying.
-Is that a feeling you got?

978
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,270
The last day is when I go shameless.

979
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:01,739
-Who cares?
-Yeah, bite me.

980
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:03,607
I think it's funny.

981
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:06,510
The fir forest? That was fire.

982
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:10,648
OKAY, THAT MAKES SENSE…

983
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:11,982
I'm going all out on the last day.

984
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:13,317
SHE LETS HERSELF RUN WILD

985
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:20,358
Gosh, that's hot.

986
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:21,726
Imagine being cold instead.

987
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:24,228
We're better off burning the roof
of our mouths.

988
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:26,564
-Enjoy it.
-I'm happy.

989
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,465
That's right.

990
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,404
We finished everything.

991
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:35,239
-We ate it all, didn't we?
-Yes.

992
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,741
The owner will love it.

993
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:38,609
-I should show her.
-Nice.

994
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:39,910
I should show her what I'm made of too.

995
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:42,113
-We only ordered what we could eat.
-She'll love it.

996
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:43,047
HER GOAL IS TO EAT EVERYTHING THEY ORDERED

997
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:45,783
ONE LAST BIG MOUTHFUL

998
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:49,887
Did you finish your bowl?

999
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:51,188
Yes, this was delicious.

1000
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:52,356
I really enjoyed that.

1001
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,926
Next, we'll explore the value of labor.

1002
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:57,895
EXPLORING THE VALUE OF LABOR

1003
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:59,063
We're off to pick apples.

1004
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:00,831
Wouldn't that be the perfect dessert?

1005
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,032
Totally.

1006
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,168
Sure, whatever.

1007
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,236
"Sure, whatever."

1008
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:06,470
Sounds good.

1009
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,539
Delicious apples will be waiting for us.

1010
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:09,573
REENERGIZING WITH A WARM STEW,
NOW OFF TO AN APPLE ORCHARD

1011
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,780
HOP IN

1012
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:17,615
TWIRLING

1013
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:19,417
That was something.

1014
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:23,020
I haven't had apples for a while.

1015
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:23,921
How so?

1016
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:26,223
I live with my teammates,
which means I don't eat apples often.

1017
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,459
-Don't you eat fruit much?
-I don't.

1018
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:30,060
The fruit we have

1019
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:32,196
is usually things like Shine Muscat.

1020
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,198
-The sweet kind.
-Right.

1021
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,333
I don't tend to buy apples often.

1022
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,601
I'm sorry, guys.

1023
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:39,103
I used to love apples a lot.

1024
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:41,405
-Good apples taste like honey.
-Exactly.

1025
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,841
-The sky's so pretty today.
-Tell me about it.

1026
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:47,578
How can clouds look like that?

1027
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:49,847
Looking at the sky
always makes me feel better.

1028
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:53,250
Hey! Doesn't that look like broccoli?

1029
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:54,318
What?

1030
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:55,786
-It's cute.
-A jumbo broccoli.

1031
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:56,687
Jumbo.

1032
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:58,556
It's delicious
with a vinegar-gochujang sauce.

1033
00:40:58,622 --> 00:40:59,924
YUMMY

1034
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:01,792
Look, Apple Boss.

1035
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:03,260
APPLE BOSS

1036
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:04,962
-It really is a gangster.
-I'm excited.

1037
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:07,498
-The apple's wearing sunglasses.
-I know.

1038
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,333
Wow.

1039
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,068
There are apples on the trees.
A lot, actually.

1040
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,736
They look like peaches.

1041
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:15,306
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1042
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:16,674
Whoa.

1043
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,509
-Hello.
-Hello.

1044
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:20,377
-Are you the apple boss?
-That I am.

1045
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:21,412
Sorry about that.

1046
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:24,014
You'll be picking Fuji apples.

1047
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:25,316
-We know what they are.
-Honey apples!

1048
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:27,551
FUJI APPLE:
ONE OF THE MOST WIDELY EATEN APPLES

1049
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:29,320
HARVESTED IN THE WINTER, SWEET AND JUICY,
SUITABLE FOR LONG-TERM STORAGE

1050
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:32,323
-Allow me to demonstrate first.
-Sure.

1051
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:34,124
As you can see,

1052
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:36,927
apples hang from the tree by their stems.

1053
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,930
It's important to leave
the apple spur in place.

1054
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,900
Support the branch to prevent damage,

1055
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:45,669
and remove the apple
with an upward motion.

1056
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:46,670
-Easy, right?
-Yes.

1057
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:47,938
-Here's your basket.
-Thanks.

1058
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,507
-Right.
-Thank you.

1059
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:53,110
What if we accidentally
yank the spur off as well?

1060
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,246
Will that section stop producing apples?

1061
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:56,614
That's right.

1062
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,415
That suddenly feels like
a huge responsibility.

1063
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:00,618
-I don't think we can do this.
-I'm sorry.

1064
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:04,255
Once you try it,
you'll see it's pretty easy.

1065
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:06,056
This one's ripe and ready.

1066
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:07,491
-Go ahead.
-That looks pretty.

1067
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:08,792
-Please go ahead.
-Ji-min, you're up.

1068
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:09,994
I'll give it a try.

1069
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:11,896
Support the branch.

1070
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:14,231
-That's right. Now, lift.
-Support the branch.

1071
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:16,400
-Nice.
-Good job.

1072
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:17,368
Nicely done.

1073
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:18,269
CHUCKLING

1074
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:20,104
-It's the first apple I picked.
-In one try.

1075
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:21,405
-Nice.
-Hi, there.

1076
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:23,707
-Support and…
-Don't be afraid and lift.

1077
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:24,675
Lift.

1078
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:27,144
This will be considered less premium
on the market.

1079
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:29,914
-Oh no.
-It's missing its stem.

1080
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,415
I thought it was better without the stem.

1081
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:33,484
It's actually the opposite.
Why don't you try again?

1082
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:34,518
Sure.

1083
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:36,720
But it's not like we eat the stems.

1084
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:39,657
The stems are crucial
for longer storage, you see.

1085
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:42,259
Apples stay fresher
with the stem attached.

1086
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:43,594
Can I try picking this one?

1087
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:45,029
That one looks so pretty!

1088
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,097
-I'd like to name it.
-There.

1089
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:48,666
-Nicely done.
-Is that okay?

1090
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,167
-You did great.
-That was close.

1091
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,802
Here's a pretty one.

1092
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:53,971
POP

1093
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:56,006
I just realized
I'm naturally good at this.

1094
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,775
The apples look so pretty.

1095
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:59,910
And they're hanging everywhere.

1096
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:01,011
Everywhere.

1097
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:05,549
Nice.

1098
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:09,520
Yo! This is great.

1099
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:13,324
Gosh, this one's so small.

1100
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:15,693
It's so cute.

1101
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:16,961
IT'S SO CUTE

1102
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:20,497
It's so cute.

1103
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:23,634
-What is it?
-It's so cute.

1104
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:24,868
That's a baby apple.

1105
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:26,303
Done.

1106
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:29,974
Here's to finishing strong.

1107
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,342
There.

1108
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:34,244
SHOWING OFF THE APPLE WITH THE STEM INTACT

1109
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:35,779
-There.
-It's so cute.

1110
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:38,682
-It's like the back of a baby's head.
-I'm thinking Snow White.

1111
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:40,117
Wow.

1112
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:41,852
This feels heavy now.
I picked a whole basket of apples.

1113
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:43,754
Let's show them off.

1114
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:46,423
BASKETS FULL OF FRESH, PRETTY APPLES

1115
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,726
-Should we go eat some now?
-Should we?

1116
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:51,228
THEY HEAD INDOORS
TO EAT THE APPLES THEY PICKED

1117
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,229
Check out the dog.

1118
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:53,731
It's adorable!

1119
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:54,999
What's its name?

1120
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:56,400
-It's Black.
-Black?

1121
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:57,801
-Black.
-Hey, Black.

1122
00:43:57,868 --> 00:43:58,869
Hey, Black.

1123
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:00,137
ITS TAIL IS IN HELICOPTER MODE

1124
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:01,305
It's so cute.

1125
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,040
-How adorable.
-Hey, Black.

1126
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:06,210
-Oh no.
-My gosh, I think I'm in love.

1127
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:07,144
So cute.

1128
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:09,747
Hey, where were you all this time?

1129
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:10,848
What a sweet dog.

1130
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:12,449
Black must be fine with strangers.

1131
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:14,151
Only when they're pretty.

1132
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:16,587
Really? Too bad I asked that
when Black went to Ji-min.

1133
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,955
I should've asked
when it was with me instead.

1134
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:21,058
That white patch of hair is so cool.

1135
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:22,326
-My gosh.
-What?

1136
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:24,094
-Seriously?
-Are you kidding me?

1137
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,095
-I can't believe you.
-Don't seduce us.

1138
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,330
We're leaving for Seoul soon.

1139
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:29,033
No way. I haven't felt
the warmth of a dog in a while.

1140
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:31,602
-So cute.
-Black.

1141
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,904
-It doesn't recognize its name.
-Black.

1142
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:35,105
It does.

1143
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,907
-Come here.
-It's wagging its tail.

1144
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:38,542
-Black.
-You won't leave, right?

1145
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:40,944
"I'm not leaving."

1146
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:41,845
ONLY RESPONDING WITH ITS TAIL

1147
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:43,347
-Black.
-Hey, Black.

1148
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:46,316
-Come here.
-How adorable.

1149
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:47,618
My gosh.

1150
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:48,686
What should I do about you?

1151
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:51,055
He must be back with treats.

1152
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:52,423
-Black.
-He has treats.

1153
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:53,924
TEMPTING BLACK WITH TREATS

1154
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:55,826
He has treats.

1155
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:58,696
Did you upset Black in any way?

1156
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:00,297
The issue right now

1157
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:03,434
is that you don't seem to know
what Black wants.

1158
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:06,070
How was my tribute to Dr. Oh?

1159
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:06,970
That was great.

1160
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,240
You'll be showing your belly…

1161
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:11,875
-No way.
-…soon.

1162
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:15,045
-You little genius.
-Hey!

1163
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:16,246
It's so cute.

1164
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,482
-How adorable.
-It's showing its belly.

1165
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,918
-It's so squishy.
-Goodness.

1166
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,520
EVENTUALLY, THE OWNER COMES FOR BLACK

1167
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:25,489
Black doesn't want to leave. Look.

1168
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:27,891
You liar.

1169
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:29,159
I bet you and Black just met!

1170
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:31,929
That was so much fun.

1171
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:33,530
How can it be that sweet?

1172
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:36,266
We'll now peel some apples.

1173
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:37,801
I don't think I can do this.

1174
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:39,703
-You can do it.
-Yes, I can.

1175
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,205
HAHA

1176
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,942
-You're quick to admit things.
-I guess I am.

1177
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:46,477
We're going to see

1178
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:48,178
-who gets the longest peel.
-Okay.

1179
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:52,916
SNAP

1180
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:54,685
Game over.

1181
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:55,753
Start on a new strip of peel.

1182
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:57,187
What the… Hold on.

1183
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,856
Pretend like nothing happened.

1184
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,357
PEELING

1185
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,860
-How are you so good at this?
-I'm good, aren't I?

1186
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,294
I'm terrible at cooking…

1187
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:05,863
-You look so sexy.
-…but I can peel fruit.

1188
00:46:06,363 --> 00:46:07,598
TOSSING

1189
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:12,269
-Wait a second.
-Aren't I good at this?

1190
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:15,472
-I've still got it.
-Mine snapped again.

1191
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:16,840
Game over.

1192
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:20,043
Still, your peels are nice and even.

1193
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,478
Yours is like <i>sujebi</i>.

1194
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:22,613
<i>Sujebi</i>?

1195
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:25,582
Did they call yours <i>sujebi</i>?

1196
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:26,984
I'm mortified.

1197
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:30,154
I'll practice until the next time we meet.

1198
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,421
Why didn't I ever learn this?

1199
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:33,490
This isn't a life skill you need to know.

1200
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:35,893
-Do-yeon…
-I'm happy to know I'm good at something.

1201
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,961
-You should get married.
-Because I know how to peel fruit?

1202
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:39,997
Should I show off to my father-in-law?

1203
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:42,399
No way.

1204
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,735
Wow, you could jump rope with that.

1205
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:47,137
Seriously?

1206
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:49,173
It snapped while I was playing with it.

1207
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:50,941
-Damn it.
-Wasn't that wet?

1208
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:52,810
-That's amazing.
-Check this out.

1209
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:53,977
That should go on your résumé.

1210
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:54,912
Thanks.

1211
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:57,047
I should write that as a talent of mine.

1212
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:58,282
You really should.

1213
00:46:58,348 --> 00:46:59,383
What should I put on mine?

1214
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:00,851
That you're good at making <i>sujebi</i>

1215
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:02,019
using apple peels.

1216
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:04,388
TALENT: ABLE TO MAKE SUJEBI
USING APPLE PEELS

1217
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:05,622
They're the same length.

1218
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:07,157
No way.

1219
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:09,393
Here's some modern art.

1220
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,061
How do you do it?

1221
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:13,831
I've been doing this
since elementary school.

1222
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:15,999
My mom handled the cooking and dishes,

1223
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:18,602
so I peeled fruit
since that was all I could help with.

1224
00:47:19,102 --> 00:47:20,270
You're a sweet daughter.

1225
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:24,107
I don't usually peel apples
since I like having them with the skin on.

1226
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,742
That works out nicely for you.

1227
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:29,680
You're so annoying.

1228
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:33,083
She just called me annoying.

1229
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:36,386
I was wondering what you were up to.

1230
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,190
HEH HEH

1231
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:41,725
I'm all done now.

1232
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:43,994
That was a real struggle.

1233
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:45,929
It's nice to see you keep going.

1234
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:47,231
All done.

1235
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:49,032
I'm impressed.

1236
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:50,734
Let's try it. I bet it tastes good.

1237
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:54,404
CRUNCHY

1238
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:55,772
HMM!

1239
00:47:56,974 --> 00:47:59,476
-Is it good, fairly good, or really good?
-It's really good.

1240
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:02,646
Is yours tasty too?

1241
00:48:03,313 --> 00:48:05,082
This has been trending recently.

1242
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:07,618
-This?
-It's a vibey dessert.

1243
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:10,754
I know people eat apples
with peanut butter,

1244
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:12,222
but olive oil is new to me.

1245
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:18,495
1. CUT APPLES INTO DECENT-SIZED PIECES

1246
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:20,497
SLICE

1247
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:25,869
So sexy.

1248
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:26,837
2. DRIZZLE WITH OLIVE OIL

1249
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:30,874
I used to eat this right out of the jar.

1250
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:33,644
Is this it?

1251
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:36,179
Yes. Then drizzle some olive oil
and serve with peanut butter.

1252
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,481
Nice.

1253
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:39,316
-It's pretty simple.
-Seems that way.

1254
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:41,285
I'll eat this one now.

1255
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:43,320
3. ADD A DOLLOP OF PEANUT BUTTER ON TOP

1256
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:47,658
How do I make it look presentable?

1257
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:49,793
WHINING

1258
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:52,262
WHINING LIKE SHIN-CHAN

1259
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:53,597
Get off the knife, will you?

1260
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:54,965
It's for me anyway.

1261
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:56,500
Exactly. It doesn't matter.

1262
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:58,302
We're not serving this, so don't worry.

1263
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:01,204
ADDS OLIVE OIL

1264
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:03,674
AND DECORATIONS

1265
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:05,943
HAHA

1266
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:07,844
This looks like abstract art.

1267
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:09,846
-I always have a plan.
-Really?

1268
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:11,715
Done.

1269
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:15,218
What is the name of this abstract piece?

1270
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,453
It's called…

1271
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:18,689
I'm not sure.

1272
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:20,324
LET ME SEE…

1273
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:21,658
I know what it is.

1274
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:23,293
What is it?

1275
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,728
"Dirty Work."

1276
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:27,965
I don't know

1277
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:29,333
-what you mean by that.
-"Dirty Work."

1278
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:30,567
"Dirty Work."

1279
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,536
Can I ask what you mean by that?

1280
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:36,440
As someone who loves aespa's music,

1281
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:40,477
this art piece suggests that you wanted to
promote "Dirty Work" for a longer period.

1282
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:42,479
Based on how it looks,

1283
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:43,914
it might also be meant literally.

1284
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,582
CHUCKLING

1285
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:49,286
Does the meaning
lean more toward the latter?

1286
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:50,587
No comment.

1287
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:58,395
THE VIBEY DESSERT PLATE IS READY

1288
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:00,097
Let's try it.

1289
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:03,567
-Let's dig in.
-Lots of olive oil.

1290
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:08,605
HMM

1291
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:11,742
HMM

1292
00:50:11,808 --> 00:50:13,877
-I'll be objective on this.
-Sure.

1293
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:16,413
The olive oil itself is tasty,

1294
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,614
the apple is good too,

1295
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,550
and the peanut butter is good as well.

1296
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:23,020
BASICALLY A REVIEW OF THE INGREDIENTS

1297
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,590
What an honest re-view of the dish.

1298
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:28,825
-A re-view.
-Yes, a re-view.

1299
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:30,060
Re-view the dish.

1300
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:30,961
Boom.

1301
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,996
With the olive oil,

1302
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:34,831
-doesn't it feel healthy?
-Like it's easy to digest.

1303
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:35,732
Exactly.

1304
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:37,667
Please share your thoughts on the dish.

1305
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:38,602
My thoughts?

1306
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:40,404
WELL…

1307
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:43,607
The olive oil enhanced the flavors so much

1308
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:45,842
that I have to say,

1309
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:47,544
olive oil, I love you.

1310
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:48,779
-My gosh.
-Oh no.

1311
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:50,414
My jokes are getting worse.

1312
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:53,116
This is bad.

1313
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:54,351
You're hilarious.

1314
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:58,388
Both peanut butter and olive oil
are pretty oily.

1315
00:50:58,455 --> 00:50:59,523
-But they go well together.
-Right.

1316
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:01,191
The tangy apple must balance it out.

1317
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:03,827
-The apples are just so tasty.
-Exactly.

1318
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:06,563
I was wondering
how the overnight trip was for you.

1319
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,032
It'll all be over after this.

1320
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:10,600
IN TEARS…

1321
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:13,703
Even though

1322
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:15,939
the past two days were short,

1323
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:18,775
I enjoyed a rich and eventful trip.

1324
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:22,979
I'd compare it to a rich, strong espresso.

1325
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:23,947
I see.

1326
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:25,382
Nice, I totally agree.

1327
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:26,750
And time passed

1328
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:28,518
so quickly.

1329
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,320
-You're right.
-Right?

1330
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:32,622
<i>We'd go somewhere and chat,</i>

1331
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:35,225
<i>-and a few hours would fly by.</i>
<i>-Exactly.</i>

1332
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:36,460
<i>Before I knew it, it was sundown.</i>

1333
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:39,763
It was the same this morning,
and we got off

1334
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:40,831
<i>to an early start today.</i>

1335
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:43,166
<i>-Right.</i>
<i>-We started at dawn, and after the meal,</i>

1336
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:45,735
<i>-half the day had flown by.</i>
<i>-Exactly.</i>

1337
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:48,939
This is the first time our conversation

1338
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:52,509
-hasn't followed a script.
-That's right.

1339
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:55,479
I felt comfortable with you,
like I'd known you forever.

1340
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:57,047
That's what I was thinking.

1341
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,049
This is a little gross to say,

1342
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,984
but I had this thought
in the shower last night.

1343
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:02,819
-What happened?
-Do you remember that question?

1344
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:05,722
Would you rather your friend
forget their memories of you,

1345
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:06,823
or would you forget them yourself?

1346
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:09,693
Since we were so comfortable
with each other,

1347
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:13,630
I wondered if we used to be friends
but had both forgotten.

1348
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:14,831
Do you get what I mean?

1349
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:16,700
It's not something cheesy,

1350
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:19,402
like a past-life connection.

1351
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:22,405
It's more like,
did we both forget we were friends?

1352
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:23,874
That's just how great

1353
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:26,409
-we got along.
-We forgot because we're idiots.

1354
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:27,544
Our brains malfunctioned.

1355
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:29,246
-Life got in the way.
-Our memories are terrible.

1356
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:31,081
That's how I felt.

1357
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,682
Anyway, I'm glad.

1358
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:35,919
The same goes for me and the crew.

1359
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,954
The other guests were amazing,

1360
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:41,224
but we wanted to end the show
on a high note.

1361
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:42,726
This was amazing.

1362
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,195
She quickly scanned the crew.

1363
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:46,696
SCANNING THE CREW

1364
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:47,831
Huh, I finished my plate.

1365
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:49,099
Me too.

1366
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,535
I was obviously still full.

1367
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:52,802
Weird.

1368
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:56,373
It'll really be over
after we write in these diaries.

1369
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:57,440
This is an honor.

1370
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:02,579
THE DIARY ENTRIES MARK
THE REAL END OF THE TRIP

1371
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:06,850
WHAT THRILLING EXPERIENCE DID THEY HAVE
DURING THEIR TRIP TO POCHEON?

1372
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:11,488
WHAT THRILLING EXPERIENCE DID THEY HAVE
DURING THEIR TRIP TO POCHEON?

1373
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:23,400
AS IT'S THE FINAL TRIP,
THEY WRITE MORE SINCERELY IN THE DIARIES

1374
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:28,505
SHE'S DONE

1375
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:30,140
-Are you done?
-We finished at the same time.

1376
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,274
What? Jinx!

1377
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:34,110
We'll now read what we wrote.

1378
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:35,312
We can decide with rock-paper-scissors.

1379
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,613
Aren't you going to throw scissors anyway?

1380
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,048
No, I'm a changed woman.

1381
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:40,383
I'll show you just how much I've changed.

1382
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:42,285
Okay, I'll show you
how much better I look now.

1383
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:43,587
-Rock-paper-scissors.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

1384
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,789
LOOK AT THAT

1385
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,257
I'm no easy target.

1386
00:53:47,324 --> 00:53:48,425
Rock-paper-scissors.

1387
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:49,693
ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS

1388
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:51,494
SCISSY AND ROCKY ARE BACK

1389
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,730
I went for a twist on a twist,
but it failed.

1390
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:55,565
HER MIND GAME DIDN'T WORK

1391
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:56,900
You're hilarious.

1392
00:53:57,701 --> 00:53:59,736
How stupid am I?

1393
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:01,805
I thought I was being smart.

1394
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:05,342
"The final trip
of Getaway and Go with Jangdobari took me

1395
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,843
to Pocheon with Yoo Ji-min."

1396
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,246
"Having already seen her fun
and hard-working side on other shows,

1397
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:12,282
I expected a trip
full of fun and laughter."

1398
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:13,984
"What I didn't expect was how quickly

1399
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:16,019
we would grow close
and enjoy so much together."

1400
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,887
"In parentheses, 'All thanks to Ji-min.'"

1401
00:54:17,954 --> 00:54:21,157
"You are just as charming offstage as
you are onstage, and one overnight trip

1402
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:22,926
wasn't enough
to fully enjoy everything about you."

1403
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:25,695
"I hope there's a next time
somewhere down the road."

1404
00:54:26,229 --> 00:54:28,031
-I'm touched.
-I added,

1405
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,667
"Did I sound like a grandma just now?"

1406
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:32,068
I probably wrote this like a monologue.

1407
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:34,437
"As <i>The Book of Answers</i> told us yesterday,

1408
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:37,207
if there's a price to pay
for a second date,

1409
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,908
I'll handle the consequences."

1410
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:41,144
"Thank you once again
for helping us end on a high note."

1411
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:43,280
"I speak for the production crew, too."

1412
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:46,549
"I hope you stay safe, healthy, and happy
as you work on your projects."

1413
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:47,984
"To Kamong, from Jang Pal-mo."

1414
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:49,853
HEH HEH, PRINCE KAMONG!

1415
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:50,887
PRINCE KAMONG IS MORE THAN SATISFIED

1416
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,222
Gosh, I'm touched.

1417
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:55,158
I kept it as simple as I could.

1418
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:56,559
Well, I'm touched.

1419
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:57,560
You're too kind.

1420
00:54:58,928 --> 00:54:59,896
SCRATCHING

1421
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:00,964
EMBARRASSED

1422
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:03,333
Gosh, this is so embarrassing!

1423
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:05,702
"My time in Pocheon with Do-yeon."

1424
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:07,437
"I didn't know you personally,

1425
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:10,240
but you always shone from afar."

1426
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:13,143
"Getting to know you up close showed me

1427
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:14,944
that you're the one who radiates light."

1428
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:16,713
"During these past two days,

1429
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,082
I ate well, laughed a lot,
and truly rested thanks to you."

1430
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:21,251
"I hope you had as good a time as I did."

1431
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:23,553
"It was an honor to appear

1432
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,655
on the final episode of a show
I truly enjoy."

1433
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:28,124
"Seeing everyone in action on site

1434
00:55:28,191 --> 00:55:31,895
helped me realize
why I love the show so much."

1435
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:34,764
"Thank you for sharing the warmth
of your crew beyond the screen."

1436
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:37,667
"That goes for the crew
as well as Do-yeon."

1437
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:41,571
"If it's not a bother,
can I call you sometime to grab a bite?"

1438
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:43,306
"I won't take no for an answer."

1439
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,711
"And lastly, thank you to everyone
who supported us on this trip."

1440
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:49,779
"From Yoo Ji-min,
gem no. 1 from Do-yeon's gem box."

1441
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,350
That was so heartwarming.

1442
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,186
Warm and fuzzy like a hand warmer.

1443
00:55:56,252 --> 00:55:57,987
That was heartwarming.

1444
00:55:58,054 --> 00:55:59,222
That was he…

1445
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:00,990
That was really heartwarming.

1446
00:56:01,491 --> 00:56:02,459
Sorry about that.

1447
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:05,795
I stuttered
as I tried to give a compliment.

1448
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,797
This felt too cheesy to add

1449
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:09,099
to the end of my letter,

1450
00:56:09,165 --> 00:56:11,634
but I'm glad my last trip on this show
was with you.

1451
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:15,372
-I'm really grateful.
-Oh, please.

1452
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:17,574
As you may have noticed,
the crew is a delight.

1453
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:18,508
Absolutely.

1454
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:25,849
THE REALITY OF IT BEING THE FINAL TRIP
HIT HER FROM TIME TO TIME

1455
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:34,424
I mean… Wait, are you crying?

1456
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:35,358
I'm quick to cry.

1457
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:37,727
Do-yeon, I start crying when others do!

1458
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:38,628
Really?

1459
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,096
So…

1460
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:41,464
Oh no, she's crying for real.

1461
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:43,633
-I'm being silly.
-Oh dear.

1462
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:46,736
-Everyone is…
-Oh no.

1463
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:48,004
TIGHTLY

1464
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:51,207
-You did great, Do-yeon.
-I just feel bad, you know.

1465
00:56:51,274 --> 00:56:53,443
I know how hard everyone
on the crew worked.

1466
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:54,544
You did great.

1467
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:56,980
I'm sorry I wasn't able to do better.

1468
00:56:57,046 --> 00:56:59,015
SOBBING

1469
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:00,850
HAHA

1470
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:03,353
I'm so sorry!

1471
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,521
WAILING

1472
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:07,390
If only this had taken off
like <i>Squid Game.</i>

1473
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:10,593
I'm so sorry I'm not like Lee Jung-jae.

1474
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,595
I'm so sorry.

1475
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:14,297
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY…

1476
00:57:14,364 --> 00:57:15,865
Anyway, I'm grateful.

1477
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:19,235
Please don't. This is embarrassing.

1478
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:20,737
Don't be embarrassed.

1479
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:22,605
Anyway, thank you so much.

1480
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:23,973
You're inspiring.

1481
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,009
-No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

1482
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:27,043
Thanks for saying so.

1483
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,179
-You--
-Someone cried!

1484
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:31,047
Don't point at me like that.

1485
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:31,981
Sorry.

1486
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:33,783
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1487
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:35,552
I'll beat you this time.

1488
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:36,486
THROWING PAPER

1489
00:57:36,553 --> 00:57:38,755
She threw paper. How sweet is that?

1490
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:40,757
IN TEARS

1491
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:43,193
Thank you for this trip. I had a blast.

1492
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:45,061
Same here. Please don't cry.

1493
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:47,864
-I had a great time.
-You joined us despite your busy schedule.

1494
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:50,767
There's obviously a reason
she's so successful.

1495
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:53,102
She's probably tired,
but never lets it show.

1496
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:54,337
This wasn't tiring at all.

1497
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:56,606
You were all smiles on set

1498
00:57:56,673 --> 00:57:58,508
and even looked out for the crew.

1499
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:01,744
Anyway, these two days were a lot of fun.
Great job.

1500
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,814
-Good work.
-Good work!

1501
00:58:05,682 --> 00:58:06,783
We'll close it out with a slate clap.

1502
00:58:07,684 --> 00:58:09,285
I'll clap the slate.

1503
00:58:09,352 --> 00:58:10,920
Getaway and Go with Jangdobari…

1504
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:12,222
HAHA

1505
00:58:12,288 --> 00:58:13,323
I slipped into host mode.

1506
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:16,259
Thank you for three amazing seasons
of Getaway and Go with Jangdobari.

1507
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,927
-Great work, everyone.
-One, two, three.

1508
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:18,828
Clap.

1509
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:21,564
-Great job, guys.
-Great job!

1510
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:24,133
-Good work.
-Thank you.

1511
00:58:25,802 --> 00:58:30,173
YOO JI-MIN

1512
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:40,216
JANG DO-YEON

1513
00:58:53,496 --> 00:59:00,503
JANG DO-YEON AND KARINA'S
THRILLING ADVENTURE

1514
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:03,540
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI,
A 7-MONTH JOURNEY

1515
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:06,309
Bound for a breezy break
with bundles of stories in my bag.

1516
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:09,579
I'm Jang Do-yeon
of Getaway and Go with Jangdobari.

1517
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:11,147
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI,
A 7-MONTH JOURNEY

1518
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,549
I can't believe I'm back here.

1519
00:59:12,615 --> 00:59:16,386
WALKING DOWN TRAVEL BUDDIES' MEMORY LANE

1520
00:59:16,452 --> 00:59:19,122
-Did they tear down all the buildings?
-It's all different now.

1521
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:20,823
I'm approaching my stage.

1522
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:22,892
We went to that cafe all the time.

1523
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:25,061
All we lived for was comedy.

1524
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:28,731
I can't believe it.

1525
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:30,066
It was ten years ago.

1526
00:59:31,534 --> 00:59:33,136
-It's delicious.
-Really?

1527
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:38,141
SHE ENJOYED AND SHARED
THE TRAVEL BUDDIES' FAVORITES

1528
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:39,242
This is good.

1529
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:45,048
He used the desk for 10 years,
and the chair for 25.

1530
00:59:45,114 --> 00:59:49,185
SHE ENJOYED AND SHARED
THE TRAVEL BUDDIES' FAVORITES

1531
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,188
Si-wan, are you on my tail?

1532
00:59:54,057 --> 00:59:55,892
You can do it!

1533
00:59:55,959 --> 01:00:02,398
THEY TRIED THINGS
THEY NEVER WOULD HAVE ON THEIR OWN

1534
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:04,100
Who'll be going to Songdo?

1535
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:11,874
IT WAS BEING TOGETHER
THAT MADE THE STORIES RICHER

1536
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:13,977
This is fun.

1537
01:00:27,523 --> 01:00:28,524
You look good.

1538
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,028
It's so lousy and silly.

1539
01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:33,730
This is so silly.

1540
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,265
It's been so long!

1541
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:42,305
THANK YOU FOR TRAVELING WITH US

1542
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:18,274
