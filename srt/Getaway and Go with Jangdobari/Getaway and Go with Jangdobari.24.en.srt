1
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:05,839
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

2
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:07,807
-And at this moment--
-Is it Tae-goo?

3
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:09,476
Do-yeon, hi.

4
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:10,543
SO NICE TO HEAR FROM HIM

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,012
Do you know who Yang Se-chan is?

6
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:13,480
I don't. Just kidding.

7
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:15,181
HAHA

8
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:17,751
AFTER A SHORT PHONE CALL
WITH VARIETY SHOW GENIUS UM TAE-GOO

9
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:20,520
IS SE-CHAN STILL THIRSTY FOR LIVE SHOWS?

10
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:23,023
Jang Do-yeon and Yang Se-chan.
Jang Do-yeon and Yang Se-hyung.

11
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:25,625
Park Na-rae and Yang Se-chan.
Park Na-rae and Yang Se-hyung.

12
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,093
"All four of us? We'd be unstoppable."

13
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,028
-Right?
-Right.

14
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:30,263
I want to do
something similar next year as well.

15
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,698
I'll try to get the four of us together.

16
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:32,632
I LOVE IT

17
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:35,068
Next, we're off to a photo studio.

18
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:36,036
Sure. Sounds good.

19
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:37,737
This totally makes sense.

20
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:39,205
Here we go.

21
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:41,141
AS A NOD TO THEIR OLD PHOTO~

22
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,143
DO-YEON AND SE-CHAN HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT!

23
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,577
This makes total sense.

24
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:46,312
I love these.

25
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,014
Now, let's go climbing.

26
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:48,948
Climbing?

27
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:50,417
Dinner will taste even better after that.

28
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:51,651
-Let's go.
-Sure.

29
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,053
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

30
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,055
It's fun talking
about the memories we share.

31
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:56,056
What a laugh that was.

32
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:56,956
THEY HEAD TO THE CLIMBING GYM

33
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:59,325
I haven't done indoor climbing before.

34
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,694
Really? I actually went there once

35
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,597
looking into the membership.

36
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:05,999
What? Then why didn't you get one?

37
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,301
Since I have a weak core,

38
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:11,671
I couldn't climb up the wall
during the tutorial session.

39
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,139
-You couldn't?
-No.

40
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:15,041
I'm terrible at it. You'll see.

41
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,109
I swear I have the weakest core.

42
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,777
What does this place
have to do with past memories then?

43
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:19,112
It's a place that reminds me
of my weak core.

44
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:20,580
Sure. That makes sense.

45
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,182
SURE, THAT MAKES SENSE

46
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,817
That makes sense.

47
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:24,984
Of course.

48
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:26,786
All that's left
is the memory of your weak core.

49
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:29,189
-MC for short.
-Yes, MC.

50
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:30,657
That's it.

51
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:35,395
EPISODE 3
MY PARTNER IN THIS WALK DOWN MEMORY LANE

52
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:36,296
This is a first for me.

53
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:37,831
-Hello.
-Hi.

54
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:38,932
Hello.

55
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:41,501
TODAY'S MAIN ACTIVITY: INDOOR CLIMBING,
WITH A MEMORY OF ONE'S CORE

56
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:47,040
HOW WILL THEIR FIRST TIME
CLIMBING TOGETHER GO?

57
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,509
-The changing room's further inside.
-I see.

58
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:50,410
Change and meet us out here.

59
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:51,511
-Got it.
-Got it.

60
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:54,881
This makes sense.

61
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:55,882
Oh, please.

62
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:57,584
This makes sense.

63
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:02,088
Anything like a bouncy castle
works for me.

64
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,390
CHANGING INTO WORKOUT CLOTHES

65
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:05,792
Shall we?

66
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,662
A trampoline park would've been fun too.

67
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:10,897
I'd love that!

68
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:11,965
I WANT TO GO TRAMPOLINING

69
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:14,601
Boom. You know this one, don't you?

70
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,302
-Jumping and crossing your legs?
-Boom.

71
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:17,504
I bet that'll hurt.

72
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,206
-That kind of hurts.
-Does it?

73
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:21,908
-Hello.
-Hello.

74
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,810
Here you go.

75
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,645
BASHFULLY HANDING OVER THE FOXTAIL

76
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,082
-I hope we get along.
-I hope so too.

77
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,383
I see you brought that with you.

78
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,318
Jeez, that gave me the chills.

79
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:33,419
Why don't you place that there?

80
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,188
-Where we can see it.
-That friend of ours…

81
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,957
-It gives us energy.
-Please watch over us.

82
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:39,559
(THAT MAKES SENSE)

83
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:42,562
These are the climbing shoes
you'll need to wear.

84
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:43,830
What's your shoe size?

85
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:44,931
I'm a 265 mm.

86
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,666
Why don't you try these on?

87
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:47,667
What's your shoe size?

88
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,068
-It's 290 mm.
-It's 280 mm.

89
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:50,103
I see.

90
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,305
-It's 250 mm.
-Got it.

91
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,540
Give these a try then.

92
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:54,807
Your feet have gotten smaller.

93
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:55,808
Come on!

94
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,777
-I always fold my toes.
-Of course.

95
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:01,114
Can beginners do this
even if they have a weak core?

96
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,248
Yes, of course.

97
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,150
I'll make sure you can
climb up the wall today.

98
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,518
-Got it.
-Nice.

99
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:06,986
These feel great.

100
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:10,056
-I'll explain some safety rules first.
-Of course.

101
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,492
The holds are higher up
than you might think.

102
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,594
-So--
-Are you saying we'll reach up there?

103
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,563
Yes, you'll be climbing
all the way up there.

104
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:17,864
I don't think that's possible.

105
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:18,765
I DON'T THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE

106
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:21,334
I see we won't be wearing a harness.

107
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,503
-Will we be free-falling then?
-That's right.

108
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,772
-I see.
-You only wear harnesses

109
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,374
for lead climbing,
where you climb an 18 m wall.

110
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:29,776
-It's a different category.
-Yes.

111
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:31,444
Today you'll be bouldering,

112
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,180
which means climbing a wall
that's only four to five meters high.

113
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,949
-The floor is fully padded,
-Sure.

114
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:38,418
so it's pretty safe to fall.

115
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:39,886
Before we begin,

116
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,655
-I'll show you the correct way to fall.
-Of course.

117
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,458
Even when you're learning to ski,
they teach you how to fall first.

118
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,594
Exactly, so let me explain.

119
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,463
Falling from the top headfirst
or dropping on your butt

120
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,465
could cause injuries

121
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,567
-because of the impact.
-Right.

122
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:57,537
When you fall,
always remember to land on your feet.

123
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:00,707
After you jump, the soles of your feet
touch the ground first.

124
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,342
That's how you should land.

125
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,377
As a way to absorb the impact,

126
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:07,213
you'll then sit and lie on your back.

127
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:08,881
Do we lie down?

128
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,516
-Should I demonstrate?
-Yes.

129
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,452
Could you take a few steps back?

130
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:19,392
-I'll climb up to about here.
-That's so cool.

131
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,860
You climbed that like it was nothing.

132
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,395
-Right.
-That's really cool.

133
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,030
Once your arms are tired,

134
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,999
it's tough to climb back down the wall.

135
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,334
In that case, you have to free-fall.

136
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:31,738
Before you do, make sure you have
a clear, empty space to land.

137
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,439
Check that first.

138
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:34,741
Then, as I mentioned earlier,

139
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:36,976
land on your soles, then your butt,
then your back,

140
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,144
-and gradually lie down.
-Right.

141
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,579
And your arms?

142
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:40,513
LAND WITH ARMS CLOSE TO THE CHEST

143
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,514
Butt and back.

144
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,016
Lie down like so.

145
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:44,951
Do you have to lie down
even if you've stuck the landing?

146
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,186
Yes, this is how you absorb the impact.

147
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,321
Even if you stick the landing…

148
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,224
It's a sequence.

149
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,192
Yes, drop all the way to your back.

150
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,428
Sometimes, there are people

151
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,765
who try to stop their fall
by putting their arms behind them.

152
00:04:58,831 --> 00:04:59,932
That could injure your elbow.

153
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,001
Yes. To avoid hurting your arms,
place them across your chest

154
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,403
like you're on a waterslide.

155
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,104
Like this?

156
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:08,207
First, let's practice falling
on your backs

157
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:10,576
while on the floor.

158
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:11,544
PRACTICING THE ROLL

159
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,446
Watch your head, Do-yeon.
Actually, you stand here.

160
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,181
That's sweet of you.

161
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,282
Chivalry isn't dead.

162
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,019
Why are you saying that
looking like a killer?

163
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:21,954
Let's jump first.

164
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,223
-That was easy.
-Right.

165
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,592
You'll then sit and roll back

166
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,928
with your arms across your chest.

167
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:29,862
Jump,

168
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,297
sit, and roll back.

169
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,133
Darn, the mic.

170
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,702
-Nice.
-Good job. Easy, right?

171
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:39,339
We'll do that in one motion from the wall.

172
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,074
You'll fall, sit, and roll.

173
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,075
-Here we go.
-Go ahead.

174
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:43,743
-Me?
-Sure. Ladies first.

175
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,311
I'm nervous. I'm bad at these things.

176
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,113
You'll only climb up a few steps.

177
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,381
Right foot, first.

178
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,149
Place your left foot on this hold.

179
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,651
Climb up.

180
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:52,785
Nice, Do-yeon.

181
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,455
-I'm sure anyone can do this.
-Don't say that.

182
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,190
It's scary.

183
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,491
Please check behind you.

184
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,860
-Check where you'll be falling.
-Sure.

185
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,896
You'll fall down
the way we just practiced.

186
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,498
Jump, feet, roll.

187
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,033
(CLAPPING)

188
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,101
Good job.

189
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,605
-That was perfect.
-That was nothing.

190
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:13,840
I give it 9.8 points.

191
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:15,475
You must have low expectations of me.

192
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,744
This isn't so bad. It looks easy enough.

193
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,878
-Right foot.
-Right foot.

194
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:19,912
-Left foot.
-Left foot.

195
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,081
Check behind you.

196
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,750
One, two, three.

197
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:25,218
And butt.

198
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,155
SUCCESS

199
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,292
-Is that how it's done?
-Yes, good job.

200
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,560
You were on point just now.

201
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:37,964
I'll now explain how to climb up the wall.

202
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:41,134
-Do you see the stickers here?
-Yes.

203
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,670
They are color-coded in yellow,
yellow-green, red, and so on.

204
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,874
Level indicator posters are up
all around the gym.

205
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,575
As you can see,

206
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,177
pink's the easiest,

207
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,178
-then yellow.
-Right.

208
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,813
The next is the green level.

209
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,448
That shows the level of difficulty.

210
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,418
Pink is the easiest level,

211
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,019
but because you've gotten the hang of it.

212
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,189
you'll start with yellow.

213
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:07,360
You'll find yellow holds
beside the yellow stickers.

214
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,229
From here on,
use only the yellow holds to climb.

215
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:11,964
-That's the basic rule of bouldering.
-Hold on.

216
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:15,001
Can our feet only go on yellow holds too?

217
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:18,237
That's right. Your feet must stay on
the yellow holds as well.

218
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,606
You can see yellow stickers at eye level

219
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,175
and another one high up on the wall.

220
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,843
You start here and end there.

221
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,146
You must start with your arms
side by side.

222
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:31,751
To complete the climb,
you must end with both hands on that hold.

223
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,821
Do we start off with our hands like this?

224
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:36,856
These two holds are marked with stickers,

225
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,458
so grab them like this or this.

226
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:39,826
Do we have to grab that one
with both hands?

227
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:40,860
That's right.

228
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,728
I see. I got it now.

229
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,996
There's one more thing.

230
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:46,799
Using holds of any other color
disqualifies you.

231
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,801
-If we grab it?
-If you grab it or step on it.

232
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,503
In both cases.

233
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,872
These two holds are each marked
with stickers.

234
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:53,873
-We grab both of them.
-Yes, both.

235
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,709
These blocks have colored holds
on them as well.

236
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,177
-So,
-They're hidden.

237
00:07:58,244 --> 00:07:59,278
you can use this too.

238
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,515
-Even those blocks with holds.
-That's right.

239
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:03,983
Grab these.

240
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,284
CLIMBING SLOWLY USING THE YELLOW HOLDS

241
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:07,353
Place your foot on this like so.

242
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,324
Wow.

243
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,228
Climb up using just the tips of your toes
on the holds.

244
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,798
When you get up here,

245
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,933
-touch with both hands to finish.
-You're so cool.

246
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,202
I'd love to take a photo of you.

247
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:25,137
To get down,

248
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:26,506
you can jump like earlier,

249
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:30,176
but it's safer to climb down the holds
if you can.

250
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,377
This will be easy for you.

251
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:32,478
Sure.

252
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:33,846
How long have you been into climbing?

253
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:36,549
I've been climbing
since I was in third grade.

254
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:37,950
You must be a pro athlete.

255
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,187
-Are you on the national team?
-I was, but now I'm taking a break.

256
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,321
Go for it.

257
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:43,823
DO-YEON TRIES THE BEGINNER LEVEL

258
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,093
Once you start climbing,
I'll teach you the basic techniques.

259
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,761
After you get up there,

260
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,230
ask where you should place your feet.

261
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,332
She once wanted to do this.

262
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,734
Go.

263
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,435
-Here?
-Yes. You can step on that too.

264
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:57,870
-There.
-Good job.

265
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,039
-And…
-You can probably reach up there.

266
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,941
-Being tall helps.
-Bring your hands together.

267
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:02,975
I think I can reach that.

268
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:03,976
From there?

269
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,678
Grab that with your left hand.

270
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,179
-What about my foot?
-Step on this little hold.

271
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:08,681
-This one?
-Step on this with your right foot.

272
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:09,582
Do-yeon, be careful.

273
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,050
Two, three.

274
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,318
I think you've made it.

275
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,519
-Hold on.
-Nice.

276
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:14,620
Watch your foot.

277
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:15,855
-I did it.
-Come back down slowly.

278
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,290
Step on every hold possible.

279
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:18,925
-I probably owe it to my height.
-Easy, right?

280
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,127
You stepped on a red one.

281
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,228
That doesn't matter
when you're coming down.

282
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:25,498
QUICKLY USING
THE FREE-FALL TECHNIQUE SHE LEARNED

283
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,767
Do-yeon, you're good at this.

284
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,902
It's because I'm tall.

285
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,905
This is already at the height of my head,
and I can reach this high.

286
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:34,540
This is fun.

287
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:35,441
This seems easy.

288
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:38,210
The instructor makes it easy for us.

289
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:39,378
-Step on this too.
-Okay.

290
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:40,313
Try grabbing that.

291
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,747
This is scary, Do-yeon.

292
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:43,549
Can I grab this one?

293
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:44,750
-Yes, of course.
-Like this?

294
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:45,885
Feel free to use any of the yellow holds.

295
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,053
-Like this.
-Left foot, right foot.

296
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,054
-Why?
-Step on this.

297
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,322
Don't question her.

298
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:50,823
-Okay.
-Reach the one up top.

299
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,291
-This one?
-Grab it with both hands.

300
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:53,559
-Do-yeon…
-Don't forget

301
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,194
-that hold.
-No way.

302
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,996
-I gathered my hands.
-Good.

303
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,631
-You're done.
-You've finished the climb.

304
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,533
-Take your time coming back down.
-Like this.

305
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,934
This is fun.

306
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,302
And land.

307
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:04,971
I DID IT TOO

308
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:07,173
I tried to look sexy.

309
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,874
That was sexy for sure.

310
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,376
The yellow level isn't so hard.

311
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,545
-The yellow level is pretty easy.
-It is.

312
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,981
I've been giving you pointers
with my laser just now,

313
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:18,417
but there's a way
to stay balanced up there.

314
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,119
It's called "frogging."

315
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:23,556
Let's say you have both hands
on this one hold.

316
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,890
Make a triangle with your body.

317
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,293
-Can you see the triangle I made?
-Yes.

318
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,328
Keep making that shape as you climb.

319
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:32,298
Once your hands are in a steady position,
make a triangle.

320
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,834
Nearly every problem can be solved

321
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,068
-with a triangle.
-Make a triangle?

322
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,036
That's right.

323
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,838
That's one of the moves.

324
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:42,575
Now, let's try a trickier level.

325
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,909
ATTEMPTING A HARDER LEVEL

326
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,779
Se-chan, as a guy,
you're naturally stronger than she is,

327
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:49,081
but Do-yeon has an advantage
in height and reach.

328
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,851
-This could be an interesting match.
-Sure.

329
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,486
This will be

330
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:55,688
three levels higher
than the problem you solved earlier.

331
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:57,490
You might find it difficult,

332
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:58,891
but the course you'll attempt

333
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,926
-is this right here.
-The purple one?

334
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,295
The purple holds with blue stickers.

335
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:04,463
In this case,

336
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,033
-you'll only use the purple holds.
-Just the purple holds.

337
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:08,134
START, FINISH
ONLY USE THE PURPLE HOLDS TO CLIMB

338
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,136
-Make a triangle.
-The frog stance.

339
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:11,904
You can make a triangle like so.

340
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,106
Is it okay to put your foot up like that?

341
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,942
You can touch, grab, and step on the wall
however you please.

342
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:22,214
From this position, move,
and make another triangle.

343
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,184
REACHING UP

344
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,519
Goodness.

345
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,120
REACHING UP

346
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,657
Gather both hands on this hold
to complete the climb.

347
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:32,858
That was so cool.

348
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,896
It's so cool how you climb up
and then look back to talk to us.

349
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:39,098
It is kind of cool, right?

350
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,399
-"Like this…"
-"Make a triangle."

351
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:41,801
-It's like this.
-Here.

352
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:42,968
-Just like when you drive.
-Exactly.

353
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,570
"So that's how you do it."

354
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,605
It's like steering with one hand
while you're driving.

355
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:47,907
While grabbing the hold…

356
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,141
"Make a triangle."

357
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,077
Yes, make a triangle.

358
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:53,079
She then went back
and made another triangle.

359
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:54,547
A triangle.

360
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,883
-That's so cool.
-Do-yeon, you're up.

361
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,585
How can you compete in climbing?

362
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,353
-Whoever is faster wins?
-Actually, no.

363
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,389
How many attempts you take
is important, right?

364
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:04,590
-The number of attempts?
-Yes.

365
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,859
-Who can finish with the fewest tries?
-I like that.

366
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,427
-How about that?
-Sounds good.

367
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,963
-See who does it in the fewest tries.
-Sure.

368
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,666
I'll help you both equally.
Reach with your right arm.

369
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,768
Nice. Now, gather your feet.

370
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,470
-Place your right foot over there.
-Here?

371
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,538
With your left hand, reach.

372
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:20,973
You'll be able to do this easily.

373
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,575
-Nice, Do-yeon. Careful.
-Left foot.

374
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,043
Make a triangle!

375
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,044
Reach your left arm high.

376
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,946
-That seems the hardest.
-Grab with both hands.

377
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,380
Both hands. Okay.

378
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:31,250
-Did she do it?
-Yes, she completed it.

379
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,585
SHE COMPLETED THE CLIMB
ON THE FIRST TRY AGAIN

380
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,154
I didn't expect…

381
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,289
SHE KNOWS HOW TO APPLY WHAT SHE LEARNED

382
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:38,357
Nice.

383
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,092
If it's easy enough for you…

384
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,695
I have to start here,
and not from here, right?

385
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,996
Yes, please start where it's marked.

386
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:44,964
Let's see.

387
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,265
HOW WILL SE-CHAN DO?

388
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,867
Right foot.

389
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,235
Bring up your left foot.

390
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:50,870
Now, the right hand. Nice.

391
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,805
Please gather your feet on the hold below.

392
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,173
-Here?
-Yes, where your right foot is.

393
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,175
Now, take your right foot over here.

394
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,510
-Here?
-That's right.

395
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:58,477
-Left hand, here.
-Like this?

396
00:12:58,544 --> 00:12:59,411
Right hand, here.

397
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,747
-Like this.
-Nice.

398
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,516
-Left foot, here.
-Like this.

399
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:04,583
Then I'll turn around.

400
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,786
LOOKING CHARMING
WHILE HANGING FROM ONE ARM

401
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:08,420
That's so cool!

402
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:09,321
Okay, you did it.

403
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:10,422
You can climb down slowly.

404
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:11,323
Like this.

405
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:13,592
SE-CHAN FINISHES THE CLIMB
ON HIS FIRST TRY AS WELL

406
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:14,493
Now roll down.

407
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,830
HAHA

408
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,001
-That wasn't so hard to do.
-You guys are good at this.

409
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,003
We owe it to your instructions.

410
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:25,271
I want to do well just to hear you say,

411
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:26,438
-"Nice."
-Exactly.

412
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:28,140
You're really good at this.

413
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,608
Especially this.

414
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:32,378
I guess that's thanks to having
some forearm strength.

415
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:33,746
You're both doing better than I expected.

416
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,715
Most beginners have a hard time
completing this level,

417
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,617
-but you guys did great.
-What's a level above this?

418
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:39,985
-Over here.
-Yes?

419
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,221
You could make this a hobby.

420
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,592
You'll see that the wall is now
at a steeper angle.

421
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,994
The walls keep getting steeper in angle.

422
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:51,597
I bet this is tougher
the steeper the angle gets.

423
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,033
Yes, it'll require more core
and muscle strength.

424
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,570
She's right. The challenge comes
from the angles, not the height.

425
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:00,773
Se-chan might have the edge
if we move on to this level.

426
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,441
It'd be nice for Do-yeon to try it.

427
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,542
-That's true.
-Really?

428
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,578
This is the next course I'll be climbing.

429
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,380
-First, you grab this with both hands.
-Like this?

430
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:11,884
Grab this hold with both your hands.

431
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,385
The course ends up there.

432
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,955
You must go all the way up there.

433
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,457
-How can you climb up there?
-That's the course.

434
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:20,359
How do you do this?

435
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:25,965
AN UPPER-INTERMEDIATE LEVEL
WITH A STEEP WALL AND OBSTACLES

436
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,600
Will you be able to demonstrate?

437
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,034
Yes, of course.

438
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:30,436
Oh, like that.

439
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:31,570
Here's the starting position.

440
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,607
With your hand…

441
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,041
Reach like this.

442
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:37,943
She does it so easily.

443
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,511
-No way.
-Wow!

444
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,380
Should I pose for you?

445
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,451
-This is so cool.
-You must bring your foot up

446
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:46,719
to this block.

447
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,754
You need to be flexible too.

448
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,689
Next, pull and reach.

449
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:51,824
Wow!

450
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,459
-She makes it look so easy.
-Place the foot here

451
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:54,526
and grab with both hands.

452
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:56,295
That's how you complete the course.

453
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,097
That was so elegant.

454
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,933
-Thank you.
-No way.

455
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,837
Do you think you can do this?
The angle doesn't seem easy.

456
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,907
How do I do this? Oh, gosh.

457
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:10,542
If you manage to complete this course,

458
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:11,677
you should just register today.

459
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,245
It means this is right for you.

460
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,613
-This?
-That's right.

461
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,382
I'll sign you up for three months.

462
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,583
This is super tough.

463
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,051
I'll get you a one-year membership here.

464
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:20,753
If you manage this, I mean.

465
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:23,856
Good luck.
Let's try and get in on the first try.

466
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,492
-Like this?
-You can do it.

467
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:29,662
This is no joke!

468
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,330
-Right hand, here.
-The angle is too steep.

469
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,232
Press through your feet
and reach with your left hand.

470
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:34,833
Nice.

471
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,068
Right foot, here.

472
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:39,271
-What about my left foot?
-Can you bring both your hands here?

473
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,272
Both hands.

474
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,273
What about my other foot?

475
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,975
-Leave it there.
-Here?

476
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,376
-No, right foot goes here.
-Here.

477
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,377
Bring your hands

478
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,578
together.

479
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:48,347
DO-YEON FAILS

480
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,248
It's too hard.

481
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,849
This isn't easy.

482
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,451
Se-chan, let's do this.

483
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,821
Can you tell me what to grab
and step on quickly?

484
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,289
-Before my arms give out.
-Sure.

485
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:58,390
I can't afford to tire out.

486
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,492
-Keep telling me where to go.
-Sure.

487
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,294
-Gather both your hands here.
-Got it.

488
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:03,929
Place your foot there.

489
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:05,030
Sure thing.

490
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,299
-There.
-Right hand, here.

491
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,701
-Here.
-Reach up with your left hand.

492
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,169
Nice. Bring up your right foot.

493
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:11,770
-Like this.
-Gather your hands here.

494
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,305
Give me a second. This is the tricky part.

495
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:14,239
Right?

496
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,708
So this is where I need to go.

497
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:17,142
Left foot, here.

498
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:18,177
-Here?
-Right foot, here.

499
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:19,278
Reach with your right hand.

500
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:20,179
All right.

501
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:21,714
REACHING UP

502
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:23,716
-Left hand, here.
-Left hand.

503
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:24,783
Nice. Can you bring your foot here?

504
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:26,752
-He's really good.
-Like this.

505
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,287
To the other side,
reach and grab with your right hand.

506
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,289
-Nice.
-I can't believe it!

507
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:34,126
(FLAPPING)

508
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,696
You're really good at this.

509
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:38,998
I was able to hold on.

510
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,232
That was amazing.

511
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:41,767
Having the camera on me
gave me extra strength.

512
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,302
Still.

513
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:44,570
Do-yeon, this is the trickiest part,

514
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:45,904
but I think you can get past it.

515
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:46,972
Wasn't it hard to grab this?

516
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,107
Yes, exactly.

517
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,375
Come on. Give it another try.

518
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,477
Do-yeon, just think

519
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,746
about grabbing this and pushing forward.

520
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:54,847
Otherwise, you'll get tired.

521
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,615
Grab and push forward.

522
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,617
You get me, right?

523
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,219
Good luck. Let's do it this time.

524
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,287
I'll let you know
the next step right away.

525
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,523
Place your left foot here.

526
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,657
All right. Right hand, here.

527
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:06,959
Nice. Left hand, here.

528
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,227
-Okay. Right foot, here.
-That's it.

529
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:09,995
-Grab this with both hands.
-This is the hardest part.

530
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:11,730
Oh, no. Hey, you got it!

531
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:12,998
-You got it!
-Left foot, here.

532
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,600
-Nice. Reach with your right hand.
-Take it slow now.

533
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,101
-Grab with both hands.
-Take your time. That's it!

534
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:17,603
Okay. Left hand, here.

535
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:18,570
What about my foot?

536
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:19,471
Grab it with your left hand first.

537
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,606
-Over here.
-With your left hand.

538
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:21,940
Grab it with your left hand first.

539
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:22,841
-Nice.
-Like this?

540
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:24,009
-No!
-Like this?

541
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:25,444
Bring your right foot up here.

542
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:26,445
-Take your time.
-The other foot goes here.

543
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,947
Nice! Now, pull up.

544
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,850
Argh, I can't… There's no way!

545
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:34,053
(SLIDING DOWN)

546
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,157
You're like a huge sloth.

547
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:40,726
You can do it.

548
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,194
You need to engage your core here.

549
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,229
You can do it!

550
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,198
I see it can't be done.

551
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:48,467
-You can do it.
-I'm scared.

552
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:49,835
Do-yeon, you still made it far.

553
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,236
-Really?
-Yes, you made it very far.

554
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:53,138
-I might throw up.
-Come back down slowly.

555
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:56,608
SLIDING

556
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:57,876
You know,

557
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:59,311
you looked really cool

558
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,380
-sweeping across.
-Do you know what?

559
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:02,314
You were right.

560
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,649
It's easier to do it quickly.

561
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,518
-Taking a break made things harder.
-Don't you grow tired?

562
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,986
The core strength matters.

563
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,055
Still, you were great.

564
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:10,989
-As if.
-Didn't she do great?

565
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,958
-Yes, absolutely.
-Really?

566
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:14,426
You're above average.

567
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:15,527
Should I sign up?

568
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,296
Is the green level difficult?

569
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:20,966
That's a level above
the course they attempted.

570
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:24,336
-Which one?
-The course with the green holds.

571
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:25,737
Does it end up there?

572
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,506
Yes, you must reach up there.

573
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:28,574
Can you show us?

574
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,508
-Should I?
-Yes.

575
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,410
Don't you get tired up there?

576
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:32,578
Not quite.

577
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,613
-No way. My fingers have no strength left.
-I know.

578
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,315
Start with both hands here.

579
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:37,549
-Two hands.
-Here we go.

580
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,987
-Wow!
-There.

581
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,189
-Place your foot here.
-Jeez.

582
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:49,228
You look like you're dancing.

583
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,630
-Place your foot here.
-How is that even possible?

584
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:52,564
Tell me about it.

585
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,465
No way.

586
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:55,767
She simply tapped the wall
with her foot just now.

587
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:56,902
-Goodness.
-Like this.

588
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,838
My gosh.

589
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,473
-I'll give it a try.
-Challenge accepted!

590
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,975
TRYING THE UPPER-INTERMEDIATE LEVEL

591
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,143
-I'm so jealous.
-Get it on the first try.

592
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,110
SPITTING!

593
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,347
There we go.

594
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:10,349
-Can I get you some chalk?
-What's that?

595
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:11,817
This is chalk powder

596
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,520
that helps keep your hands dry
in case you sweat.

597
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:15,787
This white thing here

598
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:16,755
is the chalk.

599
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,658
Rub your hand in there,
and you'll get chalk on your hands.

600
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:20,759
That feels weird!

601
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:22,928
It's like pulling a lottery number.

602
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,597
The first number is…

603
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,900
-one.
-One!

604
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,268
Rub your hands together.

605
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,439
-Are your hands dry now?
-Yes, they are.

606
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,542
This doesn't seem easy.

607
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:39,011
This isn't easy at all.
Besides, you're already tired.

608
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:39,912
Here I go.

609
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,781
If you manage this on the first try,
you should sign up.

610
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:44,349
Let's go.

611
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,285
I don't think I'll be able to do this.

612
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,520
Reach with your right arm. Nice.

613
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,055
Left hand, here. Next,

614
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,089
gather your feet together.

615
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:52,324
Now, left foot here.

616
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,393
-Left foot.
-Yes!

617
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:55,827
Reach with your right hand.

618
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:56,862
Nice!

619
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:57,930
Right foot, here.

620
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:58,830
-Where?
-Right foot.

621
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:00,799
-My right foot?
-Reach with your left hand.

622
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,502
Nice! Left foot, here.

623
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:04,770
WOW!!!

624
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,371
Try grabbing it with your right hand.

625
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:07,306
Right hand, here.

626
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,807
Nice! Now, grab with both hands.

627
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,176
FINISHING THE CLIMB
BY GRABBING IT WITH BOTH HANDS

628
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,180
(FLOP)

629
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,150
You looked incredibly sexy

630
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,484
when you pushed up to reach the hold.

631
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,986
-Really? Was I charming?
-Yes.

632
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,754
My hands have given out now.

633
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,257
I won't be able to do anything tomorrow.

634
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:29,094
You'll need to feed me
when we grab dinner later.

635
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:32,297
I don't think I'll be able
to use chopsticks at this rate.

636
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:33,298
Is this natural?

637
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,033
Stretch your hands when you can.

638
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,836
(ENERGY DEPLETED)

639
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,304
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

640
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:41,640
Help me eat my food later.

641
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:44,009
Do-yeon, you'll reattempt

642
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,044
-the course you failed earlier.
-This one.

643
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,113
-Good luck.
-Can I get some chalk too?

644
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,381
Knead it gently.

645
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:50,882
ARGH!!!

646
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:52,150
Damn.

647
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:53,986
-Let's not drag it out.
-I'm exhausted now.

648
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,487
I mean it.

649
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:56,421
HER 3RD ATTEMPT

650
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:57,489
Reach with your right hand.

651
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:00,058
Nice. Now, reach with your left hand.

652
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,126
Nice. Right foot, here.

653
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:02,995
Gather both hands here.

654
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:04,930
-This is where…
-I'll support you.

655
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,499
Okay, good. Left foot, here.

656
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:09,401
-Thank you.
-Pull up and reach with your right hand.

657
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:10,402
Nice.

658
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,104
Okay, good. Now, reach left.

659
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,272
-This is where it gets hard.
-Nice.

660
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:14,172
-Raise your foot.
-What about my feet?

661
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:15,407
Put it up here. Good.

662
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:16,575
Bring up the other foot.

663
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:17,776
TAP

664
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,177
-Then…
-Just go for it.

665
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,479
You can do it.

666
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:22,114
SCREECHING~

667
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,181
Let's do this.

668
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,150
Do it. Reach up there.

669
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,285
You can do it. Do it right now.

670
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,120
THE TRICKIEST STAGE FOR THE SLOTH

671
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:30,455
-I can't.
-It doesn't seem possible. Be careful.

672
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:31,823
Take your time.

673
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:32,891
SHE RAN OUT OF STRENGTH

674
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,027
That's it. Do-yeon.

675
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:37,229
I bet you couldn't hold on

676
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,031
-with just your left hand.
-No.

677
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:42,334
Let me show you a hack
that'll make it easier.

678
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:43,902
You reached up here, right?

679
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,404
-The left foot was there.
-Right.

680
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,772
LIGHTLY

681
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,840
If you try to pull up
with your arms tucked in,

682
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:51,276
you have no choice
but to lift your whole body.

683
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:52,311
I couldn't do it.

684
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:53,745
Here's a technique you can use.

685
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:58,583
Press this knee inward
and reach around and up.

686
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,518
-To the side?
-This…

687
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:01,253
We call this the "outside."

688
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,289
-Make more room by twisting your foot.
-Like this?

689
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:05,590
Just start from there.

690
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,825
That I should.

691
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,727
-Right there.
-Grab them with your hands.

692
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,362
TRYING AGAIN
AFTER LEARNING A NEW TECHNIQUE

693
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:11,263
Yes, start from there.

694
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,764
Bring your right foot up.

695
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,666
Press your knee inward.

696
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,101
That's it.
Now, reach up with your right hand.

697
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:17,636
-Okay.
-Yes!

698
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:18,637
Grab it with both hands.

699
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:20,872
SHE FINALLY MANAGES TO GRAB IT
WITH BOTH HANDS

700
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:23,108
Help!

701
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,509
Grab this and climb down slowly.

702
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:26,378
-Jump down.
-There.

703
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,780
ENDING IT WITH A VICTORY CEREMONY

704
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,350
I didn't know that technique existed.

705
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:32,584
You were able to do it.

706
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:35,253
There are certain moves you can make.

707
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,189
I never thought
it'd hurt my fingers so much.

708
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:38,790
-This is no joke.
-I know.

709
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,959
-Workouts should be this tiring.
-Of course.

710
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:44,529
No way.

711
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:45,464
SHE GAVE IT HER ALL TO SUCCEED

712
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,433
-You guys did a great job today.
-Thanks.

713
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,634
We should shake hands.

714
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:50,836
-Sure.
-Here.

715
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:53,238
-Thank you.
-Just a second.

716
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:57,509
Thank you so much.

717
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,478
You did great today. Thank you.

718
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:02,147
-That was fun.
-I gave it everything I had.

719
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,215
-I enjoyed that.
-Let's change clothes.

720
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:04,483
-That was fun.
-Was it?

721
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,184
-I'm glad to hear that.
-It takes a lot of strength.

722
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:07,319
Tell me about it.

723
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,121
-You had to have worked out before.
-Exactly.

724
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:11,957
-I'm so worn out that I'm a mess.
-I'm a mess too.

725
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:14,426
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

726
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:17,229
We should grab some dinner.

727
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:18,397
Sure, I'd like that.

728
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:21,333
You're on an MBC show, and so am I.

729
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,834
It's like this.

730
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,836
The theme is a trip down memory lane,

731
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,406
so we should've come here
after a long time,

732
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:28,640
but I was here a couple of days ago.

733
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:29,641
Same here.

734
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,477
The only difference is that we were
on Comedy Big League back then.

735
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,946
-That's right.
-That was the building we worked in.

736
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:36,548
-Exactly.
-But now,

737
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:37,749
-You're right.
-we go to work at MBC.

738
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:40,285
-Exactly.
-I come here once a week,

739
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:41,887
and you come every other week.

740
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:43,588
What are we having for dinner?

741
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,425
We'll be having spicy braised chicken.

742
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:47,926
Spicy braised chicken?

743
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:49,361
Hold on a second. Chicken?

744
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:52,531
Imagine chicken braised
in a delicious sauce.

745
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,966
-That's right.
-Tender drumsticks

746
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,067
and chicken thighs.

747
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:58,170
Spicy braised chicken?
Will it be stir-fried?

748
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:00,338
-Chicken breast dipped in the sauce
-I love it.

749
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,141
with potato on the side.

750
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:06,611
Will it be a plate
of spicy braised chicken and potatoes,

751
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:08,413
mixed with the memories we share?

752
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,781
That makes sense.

753
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,684
Do-yeon, that makes sense.

754
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:16,087
Let's stir-fry our memories into the dish.

755
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:18,523
This spicy braised chicken

756
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,459
isn't your usual spicy braised chicken.

757
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:21,893
It'll be mixed with happiness.

758
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,528
HAPPY SPICY BRAISED CHICKEN

759
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:25,263
Happy spicy braised chicken?

760
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:27,599
That makes sense.

761
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,201
Happy spicy braised chicken.

762
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:31,269
-Happy spicy braised chicken?
-Yes?

763
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:32,270
Let's get frying.

764
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:34,039
That's just too funny.

765
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:37,709
We used to come
to this building sometimes to eat

766
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:40,412
-back when we worked on Comedy Big League.
-You're right.

767
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,248
-I haven't seen this lit up in a while.
-That's true.

768
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,650
Seeing this lit up
meant we were stuck working late

769
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:47,853
since our meetings weren't going anywhere.

770
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,522
That's why I wasn't pleased to see it.

771
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:51,990
Just look at them.

772
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:53,758
We were sure they weren't laughing either.

773
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,627
Look. Look how sad they seem.

774
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:58,430
"See? They don't think
it's funny enough to laugh."

775
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:01,867
We attached meaning to everything,
didn't we?

776
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:04,169
All we lived for was comedy.

777
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:09,975
I wanted to be crazy.

778
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,109
Crazy about comedy.

779
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,944
Yes, I was a nutjob back then.

780
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,479
I was nuts about comedy.

781
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:16,848
This was where our office was.

782
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:18,683
-Back in the day.
-This is the place.

783
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,684
WHERE THEY BRAINSTORMED DAY AND NIGHT

784
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:22,287
-Our passion and grit.
-It's a bagel place now.

785
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,922
What? Oh, you're right.

786
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:25,757
We used to brainstorm on the first floor.

787
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:27,292
THE CAFE THEY USED TO GO IS GONE NOW

788
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,928
Our memories are being erased one by one.

789
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:32,230
Wait. What's that smell?

790
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:35,534
-What smell?
-I smell the passion we have for comedy.

791
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,735
It's still there.

792
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:39,804
I thought we had lost it ages ago,
but it's coming back to us.

793
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,573
-Of course.
-It's buried somewhere in this building.

794
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:43,575
It looks so different now.

795
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:45,710
I wouldn't have recognized it
if I were just walking by.

796
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:46,811
Exactly.

797
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:50,982
Their crepe cake was delicious.

798
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,485
-The one where you rolled each layer.
-Right.

799
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:55,854
Here's another cafe we went to often.

800
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:57,355
-That's right. Mocaria.
-Mocaria.

801
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,524
Se-hyung once said on a show

802
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:02,327
that he paid the cafe in advance
so junior comedians could eat for free.

803
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,995
-How cool of him.
-This is the place.

804
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:06,965
It's a different coffee shop now.

805
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:09,634
This is the other one we used to go to.

806
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:11,236
Back when Comedy Big League was still on,

807
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,572
you'd see comedians
brainstorming in cafes everywhere.

808
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:15,974
-Exactly.
-You'd always see a small group at cafes.

809
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,544
Remember the budae stew place we liked?

810
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:22,981
The budae stew place
is now a braised spicy chicken place.

811
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:24,983
This was the budae stew place.

812
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,586
-This is where I always had hotteok.
-That's right.

813
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:31,723
We had budae stew here a lot.

814
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,459
-You're right.
-Their fish cake side dish was delicious.

815
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:36,695
I remember always asking for more.

816
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,063
Are you talking about Seungri Budae Stew?

817
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:39,197
It's actually one block over.

818
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,465
IT'S ACTUALLY ONE BLOCK OVER

819
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:41,766
-This isn't the place.
-What a relief.

820
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:44,903
Sambong Spicy Braised Chicken.

821
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,338
SAMBONG SPICY BRAISED CHICKEN

822
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:47,606
Let's head inside.

823
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:48,873
Sounds good.

824
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,875
It's so cute.

825
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,677
Let's see.

826
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:55,046
Ma'am, can we get
one small spicy braised chicken,

827
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,248
with extra jjolmyeon and sujebi?

828
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:58,249
-Pajeon too.
-And pajeon.

829
00:26:58,316 --> 00:26:59,351
-Pajeon?
-Like that.

830
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:00,418
Can't we order pajeon?

831
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:02,654
You can. Order anything you want.

832
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:04,656
-Thank you. That's what we'll order.
-Thank you.

833
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,358
What's Sangam-dong without its passion?

834
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,593
Passion is
how you stay relevant in this town.

835
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,328
I loved how she said it.

836
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:11,529
"Order anything you want."

837
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,931
Did you see the passion in her eyes?

838
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:15,300
THE PASSIONATE FOXTAIL GRASS
JOINS THEM UNTIL THE VERY END

839
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:16,401
-I just saw it.
-This friend?

840
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,569
It makes sense.

841
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:18,970
I can't believe it's here as well.

842
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:20,705
-You know…
-It joined us throughout the day.

843
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:21,806
This little guy

844
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:24,109
hasn't withered. It's a weed, you know.

845
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:25,276
I plucked it from the ground,

846
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:27,345
but it's still fresh.

847
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:29,214
-Are we having beer?
-Would you like some?

848
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,649
-We should have a glass.
-A glass, it is.

849
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:33,051
-Just beer, not somaek.
-Of course. Not somaek.

850
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:35,086
-Ma'am.
-Somaek doesn't makes sense.

851
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,554
We'll passionately have some beer.

852
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:38,556
-Do you have beer?
-Sure!

853
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:39,891
Which brand would you like?

854
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,193
If we're going down memory lane,
it should be Cass.

855
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,629
Yes, Cass. That's actually what I wanted.

856
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:45,764
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

857
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,399
THE CHILLED, PASSIONATE BEER IS SERVED

858
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:49,567
No way. Check out this chilled glass.

859
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:51,970
Let's have it while it's cold.

860
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:53,238
How can this not be tasty?

861
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:54,706
I like to let some of the fizz out.

862
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:55,640
Sounds good.

863
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:57,409
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

864
00:27:57,976 --> 00:27:59,611
That looks amazing, Se-chan.

865
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,546
It's like what you might see
in a beer commercial.

866
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:02,647
This looks better.

867
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,617
Are you going to turn on the charm?

868
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:06,584
ABRUPTLY STANDING UP

869
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:07,619
All right.

870
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,454
Being household names now

871
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,256
isn't an excuse to be arrogant
or overconfident.

872
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:12,657
Always channel your original mindset.

873
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:14,693
The original mindset and passion.

874
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,361
Let's live our lives

875
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:17,696
with those two things in mind.

876
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:19,064
When I say, "pas",

877
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:20,565
you say, "sion."

878
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:22,100
-Pas…
-Sion!

879
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,668
CHEERS

880
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:32,377
Did you drink it all? The beer's so good!

881
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:33,578
I knew it.

882
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,980
Colleagues comfort me too,

883
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,382
but so does this friend.

884
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:39,417
That was great.

885
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:41,019
The beer's so good.

886
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:42,187
The beer made my day.

887
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:45,023
-It's served immediately.
-I love it.

888
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,257
Thank you, ma'am.

889
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:47,692
It already smells good.

890
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:48,860
SPICY BRAISED CHICKEN THAT YOU BOIL TO EAT

891
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:51,930
No way. How can this not be good?

892
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:53,631
I bet this place opened only recently.

893
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:55,300
-It's been about two years.
-See?

894
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:58,703
-It's been a while since we left here.
-Of course.

895
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,406
This is sujebi we make at the restaurant.

896
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:02,474
-No way.
-How long…

897
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,442
-About three minutes.
-Three minutes?

898
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:06,177
I think they've been cooked in advance.

899
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,212
You're right.

900
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:09,047
-They're already soft.
-I love it.

901
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,416
I had a blast today.

902
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:12,717
-Really?
-Yes.

903
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:13,952
Do you know what this feels like?

904
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:15,520
Like brainstorming a new comedy sketch.

905
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:17,722
You get it, right?

906
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,657
You know what that entails.

907
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:21,025
It needs to be good,

908
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,261
but also new and fresh.

909
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,196
-Exactly. All of the above.
-There's also the anticipation.

910
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,466
The excitement, the anticipation,

911
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:31,569
the worry over whether it'll be funny

912
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:33,171
and how our chemistry will turn out.

913
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:34,572
We worry about all that.

914
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:36,508
It felt like brainstorming a new sketch.

915
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:37,976
That's a nice way to put it.

916
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:40,912
I like the way you put it,

917
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:44,315
because we need to be confident
before performing a sketch.

918
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:46,951
We need to feel like it'll be funny.

919
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,687
It's the best compliment ever.

920
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:50,588
I had fun.

921
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:52,257
It was fascinating.

922
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:53,591
-There's this though.
-What is it?

923
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:55,326
Even though we're both busy,

924
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:59,297
if we have to work together,
we make it happen.

925
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:01,599
But sometimes, it's easier said than done.

926
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:02,500
-Totally.
-Right?

927
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:05,270
There's something enjoyable
about meeting up after a while

928
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:07,438
just to chat and have fun.

929
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:08,540
That's true.

930
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,477
I mentioned this earlier,
but chatting with you is always fun.

931
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,145
-Let me give you some.
-Thanks.

932
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,114
How sweet of you.

933
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:18,349
-Of course.
-There are long tteokbokki rice cakes.

934
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:20,285
-Do you want those?
-Not really.

935
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:21,686
Didn't you have enough of that earlier?

936
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:23,421
DIDN'T YOU HAVE ENOUGH
AT THE TTEOKBOKKI PLACE?

937
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,522
I'm just asking.

938
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:27,292
-Thank you.
-Watch your hands.

939
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,460
-I bet the sujebi will be good.
-I think so too.

940
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:30,795
-I…
-Everything's neat.

941
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:33,765
I talked to the staff
before coming on to the show.

942
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,934
They asked me about what I do on trips,

943
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,303
and when they asked
which dish I've been into lately,

944
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:39,370
I said spicy braised chicken.

945
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:41,906
We prepared this just for you.

946
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:43,474
I've been so into it these days.

947
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:45,810
But it's a tough dish to order
for just one person.

948
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,579
Although, many places
offer single portions now.

949
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:48,780
I sometimes make it myself.

950
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:49,981
-Do you cook it yourself?
-Yes.

951
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:51,015
It actually tastes better.

952
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:52,984
-Why?
-Are you a good cook?

953
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:54,919
Did you seriously ask me that?

954
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:57,522
I know that Se-hyung's a good cook, but…

955
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:58,756
I'm not too bad myself.

956
00:30:58,823 --> 00:30:59,924
I could make this easily.

957
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,159
-Really?
-Yes.

958
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:02,927
I wouldn't even need a recipe.

959
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:04,128
I could just eyeball the sauce.

960
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:08,600
-It's really good.
-You're right.

961
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:10,401
-The flavors are rich.
-This is good.

962
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:12,003
It's on the spicier side.

963
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:14,372
The sujebi is awesome!

964
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:15,306
It's good.

965
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,544
It's really good. I get why
the sujebi was highly recommended.

966
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,546
If we were still on Comedy Big League,
we would've eaten here often.

967
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:22,847
-Right.
-Right?

968
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:24,649
You said today felt like
putting together a new sketch.

969
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,317
So how was it for you?

970
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,852
We spent a whole day together.

971
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:28,853
-Here's how it feels.
-How?

972
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,054
We put together a new sketch

973
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:31,956
-and showed it to the audience.
-Right.

974
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:33,925
Did the audience laugh at our jokes?

975
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,261
They stomped their feet
howling with laughter.

976
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:39,297
It feels like we're here having a drink

977
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:41,165
after putting on a good show.

978
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,567
-That's how it feels.
-I see.

979
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:46,137
-It was fun, and I had a good time.
-Hold on.

980
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:49,807
Watching YouTube must've helped you
express yourself more smoothly.

981
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,211
The doctors are great with their words,

982
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:54,379
in their suits and all.

983
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,381
Maybe I should've worn a suit today.

984
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:00,785
You're killing me.

985
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:04,989
-How was it for you today?
-Me? To be honest,

986
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:07,058
you've been on every show of mine

987
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:09,394
every time I asked you.

988
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,630
I feel guilty every time you agree
to be on one.

989
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:13,831
Oh, please. There's no need for that.

990
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:14,933
You're obviously busy.

991
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:16,134
-I'm not.
-Anyway,

992
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,237
I'm just glad to have you on the show,

993
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:21,272
and you never fail to deliver.

994
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,573
-I see.
-That's how I feel.

995
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,342
-Thanks for saying that.
-That's why

996
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:27,412
I sometimes felt like I was the one
appearing on your show,

997
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,280
not the other way around.

998
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:30,815
-Really?
-You know what I'm saying.

999
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:34,285
Even when I spaced out,
you kept the show going.

1000
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:35,787
It was fun just to play along.

1001
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:38,389
I'd say the most ridiculous things,

1002
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:39,791
but you made them funny.

1003
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:41,326
Really? You're too kind.

1004
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:42,994
This is why good partnerships
can be scary.

1005
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:45,463
-Right?
-Of course.

1006
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,498
This is something I've been thinking
a lot about.

1007
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:50,702
Over the last few years,

1008
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:53,705
we haven't been in touch a lot.

1009
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:55,440
I blamed that on us being busy.

1010
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,041
-It's the same with Na-rae.
-Exactly.

1011
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:59,177
Se-hyung's my brother,

1012
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:00,545
but we don't really talk often.

1013
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:03,648
I think we're all busy
with our separate work.

1014
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,416
Still, this I know for sure.

1015
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,819
Even if we haven't talked often,

1016
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:09,253
it's the same
when we meet up after so long.

1017
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,522
We're the way we used to be
five to ten years ago.

1018
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,324
-It's not awkward.
-It's not awkward at all.

1019
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:14,525
That's what I like about us.

1020
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:15,693
Here's the thing.

1021
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,929
If things are only good in a relationship,

1022
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,999
the memories don't stick with you
in a meaningful way.

1023
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:24,569
-But a relationship with ups and downs?
-You're right.

1024
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:26,671
That's how we keep building
our relationship,

1025
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,606
-True.
-and I like that.

1026
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,174
We had our ups and downs.

1027
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:33,044
Even when we meet after a long time,
it's still the same.

1028
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:34,178
The chemistry speaks for itself.

1029
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:35,913
What we have is different.

1030
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,616
It's perfect to eat
now that it's absorbed all the sauce.

1031
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,585
It's good.

1032
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:43,921
Which part of the chicken do you prefer?

1033
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:45,056
Drumsticks.

1034
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:48,926
You should know it's never wise
to only have drumsticks.

1035
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:50,595
-I mean…
-Did you see this on YouTube?

1036
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:52,397
It's fattier than you think.

1037
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:53,998
Eating drumsticks could lead
to weight gain.

1038
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:55,733
They say chicken meat is lean,

1039
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,102
but drumsticks are tender

1040
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:00,972
and can be as fattening as thighs.

1041
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,440
I bet you'll live until 150.

1042
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:04,509
It's so good.

1043
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:11,849
-Check this out.
-What is it?

1044
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,317
There's a huge piece in the pajeon.

1045
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:18,623
It's nice and soft.

1046
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:20,458
-It's really good.
-This is good.

1047
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,160
The food is great, Do-yeon.

1048
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:24,629
I'm loving this.

1049
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:27,298
I mean it.

1050
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:29,467
Let's have another glass, Do-yeon.

1051
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:31,936
I made the toast earlier,
so you make one this time.

1052
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:35,606
The place where Se-chan and I poured out

1053
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:37,775
the passion we had in our early 30s.

1054
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,410
This place.

1055
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:41,245
-In Sangam-dong.
-Sangam-dong.

1056
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:44,415
If we only talked about our past,

1057
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:45,817
it would have been bitter for us

1058
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:48,186
and seemed like we were stuck in it.

1059
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,253
-However,
-Yes?

1060
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,523
you come to the MBC studio
to film Where Is My Home,

1061
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,292
and I come to host MBC's Radio Star.

1062
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,129
Here in Sangam-dong,
where the past meets the present,

1063
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:01,566
we got together today
to take a trip down memory lane.

1064
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:03,067
Let's set any sorrows aside

1065
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:04,402
and hope we can meet again

1066
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,804
a few years from now
to reminisce about this day.

1067
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:09,207
We'll toast awaiting that day.

1068
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,475
When I say "until,"

1069
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,176
-you say "that day comes."
-Got it.

1070
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:13,111
Until!

1071
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:15,246
That day comes!

1072
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,449
HAHA

1073
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:22,286
-My gosh.
-No way.

1074
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:25,323
Do you remember the rule
you set for today?

1075
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:27,358
Oh, of course. Don't fall for one another.

1076
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:30,027
How was it for you?
There were moments I almost gave in.

1077
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:31,095
Same here.

1078
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:31,996
It was this moment.

1079
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:32,964
WHEN HE TURNED AROUND
HOLDING HIMSELF UP WITH ONE HAND

1080
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,599
Did that do it for you?

1081
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:36,200
-I guess it was similar.
-What was it for you?

1082
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,002
It was at the gym.

1083
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:41,439
When you were hanging from the wall
after completing the course.

1084
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,307
"Look at her will and passion."

1085
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:45,776
-That moment when you went up
-Really?

1086
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:47,311
after pressing your leg inward.

1087
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:49,480
That amazed me.

1088
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:50,982
Really?

1089
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:54,418
Maybe I should show you
how I climb a tree sometime.

1090
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,087
Let's wrap up the show
while dangling like cicadas.

1091
00:35:58,122 --> 00:35:59,390
What did I tell you?

1092
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,225
I said this was a happy stew.

1093
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:02,326
What made me happy today?

1094
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:04,829
I'm so glad I got to end the day
with this chicken.

1095
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:06,063
Thanks, chicken.

1096
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:07,632
Thanks.

1097
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:09,967
We owe this chicken.

1098
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:13,237
A JOYFUL DAY THAT ENDS
WITH HAPPY SPICY BRAISED CHICKEN

1099
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:14,138
Here.

1100
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:15,606
IT'S NOW TIME TO WRITE IN THE TRAVEL DIARY

1101
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:17,642
I want to see their handwriting.

1102
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:18,676
Sure, go ahead.

1103
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:21,546
-Harbin? Byun Yo-han must've written this.
-That's right.

1104
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:22,947
He has decent handwriting.

1105
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,282
HE HAS DECENT HANDWRITING

1106
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:26,884
Wait, who wrote this?

1107
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,352
I see it was Ga-bee.

1108
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:30,054
I can tell by her handwriting.
Aren't I right?

1109
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:31,088
Yes, Ga-bee Girl wrote that.

1110
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:33,191
This was by Zhang Hao.

1111
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:34,559
Isn't he Chinese?

1112
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:37,128
How is his handwriting better than mine?

1113
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,496
There's nothing he can't do.

1114
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:39,664
He's an amusing guy.

1115
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,900
"Thank you. Jang Hatchet Shot!"

1116
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:44,035
-That was by Um Tae-goo.
-What?

1117
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:45,736
That was by Um Tae-goo.

1118
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:47,371
That makes sense.

1119
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:51,175
Jeez. Jang Hatchet Shot?

1120
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:54,078
See? I told you he was a funny guy.

1121
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:55,279
Like I said, it makes sense.

1122
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:56,214
He's a funny guy.

1123
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,316
-Did he draw this for you?
-Yes.

1124
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,750
Here's where I'll write my entry.

1125
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:01,586
-Sure, go ahead.
-Okay.

1126
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:04,322
Writing things like this is the hardest.

1127
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,523
-I know.
-Right?

1128
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,458
Don't feel pressured. Keep it light.

1129
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:17,335
HOW WAS TODAY'S TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE
FOR BOTH OF THEM?

1130
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:19,136
PONDERING

1131
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:27,011
WRITING EACH WORD CAREFULLY

1132
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,919
DO-YEON FINISHES FIRST

1133
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:36,354
It's taking me some time
to collect my words.

1134
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,755
Don't worry about it.

1135
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:39,924
Don't you dare make me cry.

1136
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,327
Don't worry.
You know I'm not much of a writer.

1137
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:44,262
Come on.

1138
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:47,465
Forget about penmanship.
Just write from the heart.

1139
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:49,033
That's what I've been doing.

1140
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:49,967
Thanks.

1141
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:53,004
Se-chan, you.

1142
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,305
What now?

1143
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,007
(QUIETLY)

1144
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:57,441
What's this?

1145
00:37:57,508 --> 00:37:58,576
This is for you.

1146
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:00,311
Wait, is that from Gucci?

1147
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:02,947
This is some kind of joke,
which is why you're laughing.

1148
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:03,948
That makes sense.

1149
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:06,384
HAHA

1150
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,085
I had to stop writing for a second.

1151
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:09,787
Should I open it right away?

1152
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:11,088
No, that's not necessary.

1153
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:12,223
What's in it?

1154
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,358
Okay, I'll focus harder to wrap this up.

1155
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:16,694
What do you say?
Don't you think you should do your best?

1156
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:18,262
Totally. Hold on a second.

1157
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:20,031
-I'm almost there.
-Otherwise, you won't get this.

1158
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:21,032
Do-yeon, I'm almost done.

1159
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:22,133
I'll take back this Gucci gift.

1160
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,834
No, stop. That's mine.

1161
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:25,536
(WRITING AS FAST AS HE CAN)

1162
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:28,072
-I'm done.
-Are you?

1163
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,340
-Jeez.
-All right.

1164
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:30,608
-I now have a headache.
-Here.

1165
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:31,876
Who'll read theirs first?

1166
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:33,277
It should be you.

1167
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:34,211
(STANDING UP)

1168
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:36,080
Do we have to stand up?

1169
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,014
-Yes.
-Okay.

1170
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:38,649
What tone should I read this in?

1171
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:41,852
Use the tone that matches the emotions
behind the writing.

1172
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:48,659
"A trip down memory lane in Sangam-dong
with my best partner Se-chan."

1173
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:49,627
Nice.

1174
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:52,229
I love it.

1175
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:54,965
I love how you added a twist
by using that tone.

1176
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:59,070
"From the bouquet of weeds
to a perfect pot of spicy braised chicken,

1177
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:02,039
it turned into a day full of fun."

1178
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:05,076
"Sharing memories with a friend
who was by my side

1179
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,378
during my passionate 30s

1180
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:10,614
is always fun,
no matter how often we do it."

1181
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:14,418
"Thank you for always sticking
with me, Se-chan."

1182
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:17,722
"The time I did comedy sketches with you

1183
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:19,790
was when I shined
the brightest in my life."

1184
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:22,593
"Let's keep doing our best where we are

1185
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,296
and meet again someday
to relive those memories."

1186
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,732
"Until we get sick and tired of it,
that is."

1187
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:30,801
"Here's to wrapping up
our trip down memory lane in Sangam."

1188
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,307
I love it, Do-yeon.

1189
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,908
I meant all those words.

1190
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:40,544
Now, let's listen to what Se-chan wrote.

1191
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:43,047
Here I go.

1192
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:45,216
I took a poetic approach.

1193
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,351
I'll get ready to be touched.

1194
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,520
"Title, Jangdobari."

1195
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,224
"Jangdobari, who always gives us a laugh."

1196
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,894
"Jangdobari,
who is always a good listener."

1197
00:39:57,495 --> 00:40:00,064
"Jangdobari,
who is constantly considerate."

1198
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:03,267
"Jangdobari,
who always puts others first."

1199
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:06,871
"She always gives people her time

1200
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:08,472
to listen to their stories,

1201
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:10,174
and she gives us all a big laugh

1202
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,810
while still being
considerate of everyone."

1203
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:16,514
"She has now become
one of Korea's best show hosts."

1204
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,848
"The country's best show host?"

1205
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,350
"That makes sense!"

1206
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:20,985
That'll be all.

1207
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:23,621
I'm touched.

1208
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:25,823
-That was great.
-I was dead serious.

1209
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,024
I meant every word.

1210
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,125
That was fun.

1211
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:29,660
You're right about it being fun.

1212
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:30,628
It didn't feel like work.

1213
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:32,163
-Wait, I should have it now.
-Have what?

1214
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:33,397
The thing you waved in front of me.

1215
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:35,966
Okay, Se-chan.

1216
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:37,234
Hold on. Let me calm my nerves.

1217
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:39,703
EXHALING…

1218
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:41,205
(PULLING OUT)

1219
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:43,174
Lastly…

1220
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,176
BEGINNING AND ENDING THE SHOW
WITH FOXTAIL GRASS

1221
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:47,278
Jeez, you're killing me.

1222
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:48,646
You guys are no joke.

1223
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,248
Today,

1224
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:53,117
even though you were a guest,

1225
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:54,685
you performed just as well as the host,

1226
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:56,153
showing great talent

1227
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,922
with impressive and well-timed ad-libs.

1228
00:40:57,988 --> 00:40:59,457
You also showed

1229
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:00,958
how well you can turn any situation

1230
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,660
into something fun.

1231
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:05,196
Se-chan, your performance today

1232
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:06,163
gets five stars.

1233
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,498
-Goodness.
-That's why

1234
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,867
we present

1235
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:12,169
this Gucci gift.

1236
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:14,438
THIS IS FOR YOU

1237
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,374
The weight of this makes sense.

1238
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:19,109
May I open it?

1239
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:20,177
-Sure.
-Okay.

1240
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:26,350
Now I'm getting nervous.

1241
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,252
I haven't seen
a Gucci case like this before.

1242
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,322
-Let's see.
-Take a look.

1243
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:32,223
OPENING

1244
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:34,892
MY GOSH…

1245
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:35,826
Don't be surprised now.

1246
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:36,927
No way.

1247
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,463
NO WAY~

1248
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,398
Yes, of course.

1249
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:43,667
Right, exactly.

1250
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:45,202
There's a photo on the back.

1251
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:47,671
It's a Gucci box
with a bottle of beer inside.

1252
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:49,940
It's not Gucci, but a knock-off, right?

1253
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,475
-A Gnock-off.
-A Gnock-off.

1254
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:53,310
That makes total sense.

1255
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,581
So that's the taste of bitterness.

1256
00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:59,984
We wanted to see your pink gums again,

1257
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:02,520
-so we put this surprise gift together.
-This was clever.

1258
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:04,121
-Good going.
-Don't throw it away.

1259
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,055
I'm keeping this.

1260
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:06,824
Don't toss out the photo
we took today, either.

1261
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:08,292
I should keep this too.

1262
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,227
Are you planning to reuse
this Gucci gift box?

1263
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:11,495
That's for you to keep.

1264
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:12,763
Why would we take that from you?

1265
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:13,964
-Really?
-Of course.

1266
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,500
I heard you've been into wine lately,

1267
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:19,236
so I thought about what I could get you.

1268
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:21,338
-Beer's fine.
-I searched online

1269
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:22,907
-and asked other people,
-I love this.

1270
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:25,643
but with you, I knew I had to go all out.

1271
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,111
-I knew it.
-All right.

1272
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:28,412
-Se-chan.
-Nice.

1273
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:30,047
Would you like your real gift?

1274
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,849
Of course. I knew it.

1275
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:35,052
I've always been quick to catch on.
Bring it out.

1276
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:37,755
All right.

1277
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:39,523
Could it be another twist?

1278
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,492
COULD IT BE ANOTHER TWIST?

1279
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,993
You know how it is
with twists upon twists.

1280
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,194
That's an outdated joke.

1281
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:45,429
Don't I know it.

1282
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:47,565
-But that's what this is.
-I love twists upon twists.

1283
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:50,568
-It's been decorated with flowers.
-This is for real.

1284
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:51,602
It's heavy.

1285
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:54,004
-I'll receive it seated.
-Sure.

1286
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,639
Does every guest get a gift?

1287
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:56,740
No way.

1288
00:42:56,807 --> 00:42:58,008
This is a first.

1289
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,243
This is for real.

1290
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:02,379
-What's this?
-I did my research on this.

1291
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:05,849
-No way. It's white wine.
-I heard that was quite nice.

1292
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:08,118
I love Chardonnay.

1293
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:09,186
-Do you?
-Yes.

1294
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:12,623
This is the type of wine
that anyone can enjoy.

1295
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,725
-I don't know much about wine though.
-That's a relief. Please enjoy.

1296
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:16,727
-Anyway, it's Italian wine.
-Italy?

1297
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:19,163
Thank you.
I really appreciate this.

1298
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:20,064
Please enjoy.

1299
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:21,832
-Thank you so much.
-I'm the one who's grateful.

1300
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:23,033
I can't have this by myself.

1301
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,635
We should have it together.

1302
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:25,803
This bottle…

1303
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:28,839
I'll open this bottle
to share with Jangdobari.

1304
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:30,841
-I'll be waiting.
-I'll chill it

1305
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:32,376
at just the right temperature.

1306
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,878
Hey, it's a 2020 vintage.

1307
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:37,448
Wait, 2020? Do-yeon, listen.

1308
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:38,983
Five years ago?

1309
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:40,084
What did we do five years ago?

1310
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,819
-Five years ago?
-In 2020.

1311
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:43,854
I'll see what we did in 2020.

1312
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,289
-It's 2020.
-Got it.

1313
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:47,758
I don't think we were
on Comedy Big League back then.

1314
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:50,661
-Wait, I know what we were doing.
-What is it?

1315
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:52,162
The One Percent.

1316
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:53,197
-Really?
-Yes.

1317
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:54,531
You're good at remembering these things.

1318
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:56,767
I mostly remember it because
it was the last sketch we did together.

1319
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:58,469
The One Percent.

1320
00:43:58,535 --> 00:43:59,870
-It was The One Percent.
-Right?

1321
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:01,972
There's an article about a new segment.

1322
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:02,940
Really?

1323
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:04,908
No way!

1324
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:07,311
See? The staff on this show is no joke.

1325
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:09,580
You chose it to match 2020,

1326
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,583
as if our final moments were bottled
with this wine.

1327
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,818
It symbolizes
that what we have will never end.

1328
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:16,086
This is a new beginning.

1329
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,287
THIS IS A NEW BEGINNING

1330
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:19,056
I absolutely love it.

1331
00:44:19,623 --> 00:44:22,192
Should everything we do today
make sense like this?

1332
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:23,093
Seriously.

1333
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,495
What if it all makes sense?

1334
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:26,030
Neigh like a horse.

1335
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:26,930
What the…

1336
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,332
Wait, hold on.

1337
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:29,767
Actually, that was good.

1338
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,468
The Korean word for horse
also means speech.

1339
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:33,103
-Please laugh.
-Check this out.

1340
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,672
-Neigh!
-We've become horses.

1341
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:36,273
That totally makes sense.

1342
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,307
It makes sense, right?

1343
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:39,176
Of course. You made it work.

1344
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:40,310
I still have it, don't I?

1345
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:41,245
That was amazing.

1346
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:42,146
Thanks.

1347
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:43,347
Thanks, Se-chan.

1348
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:47,017
It makes sense!

1349
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:48,018
IT MAKES SENSE

1350
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:51,989
As long as someone laughs, it's a joke.

1351
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:54,491
Of course.
Who cares as long as we have fun?

1352
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:55,592
We were just goofing around.

1353
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:57,895
-Thanks for that.
-Thanks, Do-yeon.

1354
00:44:57,961 --> 00:44:59,863
-I appreciate this gift.
-Head home to watch YouTube.

1355
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,598
Yes, I should hear from the doctors today.

1356
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,635
I'll go over what I ate with the doctors,

1357
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,270
including the calories and everything.

1358
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:07,604
Right. You did great today.

1359
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:09,273
-Should I clap the slate?
-Please do so.

1360
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:11,341
Here we go in one, two, three.

1361
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,478
-Good job, everyone.
-Great work.

1362
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:22,519
YANG SE-CHAN

JANG DO-YEON

1364
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:51,882
MEMORIES MEAN EVERYTHING

1365
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:53,217
Can you see where I am?

1366
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:55,986
A neighboring country far from home.
I'm here in Tokyo, Japan.

1367
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:57,755
I love you, everyone!

1368
00:45:57,821 --> 00:45:59,656
Who's my travel buddy for this trip?

1369
00:45:59,723 --> 00:46:01,225
Can you dance?

1370
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,993
HE DANCES WHENEVER HE GETS THE CHANCE!

1371
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,128
THE BEST DANCER EVER
AN INTROVERTED ENTERTAINER, LEE JUN-YOUNG

1372
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:05,596
Thank you for having me.

1373
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:06,997
There's a theme to today's trip.

1374
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:08,999
-Save it in my heart.
-Save.

1375

CAPTURING MEMORIES IN PHOTOS

00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:13,170

1379
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:17,741
PRETTY PHOTOS MAKE THE HEART FLUTTER

AESTHETICALLY PLEASING PURIKURA PHOTOS

1381
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,813
ARE YOU KIDDING ME? HAHA

1382
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,748
I hope it gets dark soon.

1383
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:25,682
BUT THE LAUGHING DOESN'T LAST…

1384
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:29,253
In the heart of Tokyo?

1385
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:30,721
Somebody, help.

1386
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,556
INTROVERTS GO CART RACING!

1387
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,525
There were more and more people
on the street.

1388
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:37,427
I couldn't be more embarrassed.

1389
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:40,497
ARE THE INTROVERTS GETTING USED TO IT?

1390
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:41,565
This is a blast.

1391
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:43,167
Happy New Year.

1392
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:44,701
HE ENDS UP JUST GREETING THEM…

1393
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:46,470
This is driving me nuts.

1394
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:48,138
BUTTERFLIES WILL DANCE IN YOUR STOMACH!

1395
00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:50,007
LOADED WITH MEMORIES MADE!

1396
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:53,410

1397
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,778
AND

1398
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:57,281
FILLED WITH A LOT OF DANCING SESSIONS

1399
00:46:57,347 --> 00:47:01,919

1400
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,288
