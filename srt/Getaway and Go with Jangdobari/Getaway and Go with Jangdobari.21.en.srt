1
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:05,872
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

2
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,174
DO-YEON AND OK-SEOP
RETURNS TO PARIS FROM GIVERNY

3
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:11,077
THEIR DAY IN PARIS BEGINS
AT A RESTAURANT WITH GREAT VIBES

4
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:12,379
GETTING DOWN TO BUSINESS,
ENJOYING PARIS

5
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:13,813
This looks delicious.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,015
The skin is delicious.

7
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:16,349
JEAN & MARTHE
ENJOY THEIR MEAL TO THE FULLEST

8
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:17,684
A MUST-DO FOR PARISIANS (?)

9
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:18,918
What a charming little place.

10
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:20,020
That's so cool.

11
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:21,187
FINISHING OFF A MOVIE~!

12
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:22,789
…OR MAYBE NEXT TIME, HAHA

13
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,257
What will it look like at 1 a.m.?

14
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:25,258
At 1 a.m.?

15
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:26,793
-Wow.
-Hurry. Look!

16
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,828
THE EIFFEL TOWER DAZZLES IN WHITE…!

17
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:29,929
It'll be beautiful even from afar.

18
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:31,564
DO-YEON AND OK-SEOP SAVORED THE ROMANCE
DEEP INTO THE NIGHT

19
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:33,633
Even though it's our last day,
we'll make it worthwhile.

20
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,268
We'll have even more fun than yesterday.

21
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:37,871
Is this where Amélie worked as a waitress
in the movie?

22
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:39,039
We can see the whole city from here.

23
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:40,807
STANDING TALL AT MONTMARTRE,
THE HIGHEST POINT IN PARIS

24
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,142
Everyone here is unique in their own way.

25
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,410
That's why it's a joy to watch the people.

26
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:44,978
REVEALING THEIR FINAL DAY IN PARIS!
TOO FULL OF ADVENTURE TO FEEL SAD

27
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,079
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

28
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:52,819
WOW…

29
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:56,656
-The bridge and that building…
-Stunning, right?

30
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,825
-It's like the National Assembly building.
-You're right.

31
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:00,593
That's the Orsay Museum.

32
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,296
Is that the Orsay Museum? No way.

33
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:08,068
It feels as though time is frozen
in that place.

34
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:10,437
-How grand is that?
-I know.

35
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:12,906
It's Notre Dame Cathedral.

36
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:14,574
Where?

37
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:17,544
Is that the cathedral?
The pointy building?

38
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,445
That must be it.

39
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:20,847
NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL IS KNOWN
FOR ITS POINTY SPIRES

40
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,482
Are you talking about those pointy tops?

41
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:24,884
Quasimodo's up there, ringing the bell.

42
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:26,119
AN ICONIC EXAMPLE
OF FRENCH GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE

43
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:28,221
It's huge.

44
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:29,556
It's still being reconstructed.

45
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:30,623
RECONSTRUCTION IS STILL UNDERWAY
AFTER THE FIRE

46
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,192
I bet it'll look cooler at night.

47
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,260
Look at the people standing over there.

48
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:40,366
We're currently being taken
to the Panthéon,

49
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:44,337
where famous French figures are buried.

50
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:47,173
Marie Curie and her husband, Victor Hugo,

51
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,409
Émile Zola, Jean-Jacques Rousseau,

52
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:54,180
Alexandre Dumas, André Malraux and others
are buried there.

53
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,950
-They're buried there?
-Yes.

54
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:58,618
Yes, within the Panthéon.

55
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:00,820
I thought it'd be like a park.

56
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,255
Same here. Like a memorial park.

57
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,624
HISTORICAL FIGURES REST
IN A GRAND BUILDING, NOT IN A PARK

58
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,860
It says "Panthéon" on top.

59
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:12,632
- EPISODE 8 -
THE THIRD NIGHT WITH MY FRIEND

60
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:15,034
If I was born in Paris,

61
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,369
I doubt I would've done comedy.

62
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:17,504
Why not?

63
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,404
I don't know.

64
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,572
What would you have done instead?

65
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,376
I don't think I would've been obsessed
with success.

66
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,479
It just crossed my mind, but who knows?

67
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,049
THEY ARRIVE AT THE RESTAURANT
AFTER A TAXI RIDE THROUGH PARIS!

68
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,385
-This must be it. Let's go.
-Sure.

69
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,554
Follow me.

70
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:35,855
Nice.

71
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,591
THEY ARRIVE AT A VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT

72
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,196
It has the vibe of a good restaurant.

73
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:47,066
Even those look super cute.

74
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,671
DECORATIVE ITEMS THAT ADD
AN AUTHENTIC VIETNAMESE TOUCH

75
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,873
I think the owner filled the space
with what they liked.

76
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,842
It's like a gift shop in Mangwon-dong.

77
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:57,544
I can't wait.

78
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,480
Who knew we'd have pho in France?

79
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:01,381
Who knew?

80
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,150
We also had pho in Istanbul.

81
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,585
I know, and it was incredible.

82
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:06,586
It was the best.

83
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:14,594
People might think it's strange
to have pho in France,

84
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:18,264
but when France colonized Vietnam,
many Vietnamese people came here

85
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:19,666
and introduced their food.

86
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:21,968
I prefer beef pho.

87
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,536
I heard it was really popular.

88
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:26,573
We'll have the beef pho, then.

89
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,473
Sweet.

90
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,809
-Let's have this since it's something new.
-Sure.

91
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,779
Sure. Banh mi chao.

92
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:34,847
Banh mi chao and…

93
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,222
Pork works.

94
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:44,757
-She's so sweet.
-I know.

95
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,893
I can't wait. I bet it'll be good.

96
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,962
I'd love to just drink the broth.

97
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,331
That's ours.

98
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,135
-Let's share.
-Sure.

99
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:57,837
-Elders first.
-Bao is supposed to be bread.

100
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,039
BANH BAO KEP: STEAMED BUN WITH PORK,
PICKLES, CARROTS, PEANUTS, AND SHALLOTS

101
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,040
I'll enjoy.

102
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:02,342
Take a big bite.

103
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,917
MMM~

104
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,218
Have some while it's hot.

105
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,853
Is it warm?

106
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,887
It's very warm.

107
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:18,024
The meat is super moist as well.

108
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,993
The sauce is incredible,
and it has peanuts in it.

109
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,197
There's something fried inside too.

110
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,633
It's so good.

111
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,234
It tastes like jokbal.

112
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,435
You're right.

113
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,404
It's a sweeter take on jokbal.

114
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:34,140
HIGHLY SATISFIED WITH THEIR FIRST DISH

115
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,675
That's so good. Let's order some drinks.

116
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:39,379
BANH MI CHAO IS SERVED

117
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,049
-Saigon?
-Yes, Saigon Beer.

118
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,651
This also looks good.

119
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,986
BANH MI CHAO: A WARMER TAKE ON BANH MI,
SERVED IN A HOT IRON PAN

120
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,688
I've never seen this
at a pho place before.

121
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,123
Me neither. I'm glad we ordered this.

122
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:51,624
-Shall we try some?
-Sure.

123
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:52,792
Let's try this first.

124
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,528
-It looks like minced meat.
-You're right.

125
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,630
-Various meat--
-There are three cuts of meat.

126
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,899
One looks like pork belly.

127
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,534
Let's try the minced meat first.

128
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,303
Sure. It's the most unusual.

129
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:05,204
-Have some with the onions.
-Right.

130
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:06,472
Cheers.

131
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:10,610
Is it good?

132
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,645
-I don't think it's meat.
-Isn't it?

133
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:16,049
-Hold on.
-Is it liver?

134
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:17,150
It's liver.

135
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:19,819
That's really unusual.

136
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,487
PÂTÉ: A SMOOTH PASTE
MADE FROM GROUND BEEF AND LIVER

137
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:23,923
The liver just melted in my mouth
before I even chewed.

138
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,594
THEIR PHO IS SERVED

139
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,163
Let's try the other meat.

140
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,531
We'll try that over there.

141
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,171
THE SAIGON BEER IS ALSO SERVED

142
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:40,840
Is it hot?

143
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,409
HAVING A BITE
AFTER COOLING IT DOWN WITH A BLOW

144
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:47,046
Isn't it good?

145
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,015
It's so soft.

146
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:50,917
It's good.

147
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,652
It must be eaten with bread.

148
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,220
It's a baguette.

149
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:58,424
With the bread, it's kind of like banh mi.

150
00:05:58,491 --> 00:05:59,525
You're right.

151
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:01,627
With more vegetables, I mean.

152
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,062
THIS TIME, THEY PUT MEAT ON THE BREAD

153
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,603
-Is it good?
-That reminds me of bulgogi.

154
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:14,841
Careful.

155
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,611
Right?

156
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:19,946
It's a familiar taste.

157
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:21,914
-The texture's like bulgogi too.
-Exactly.

158
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,550
CHEERS!

159
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,424
-Is it good?
-It's icy cold.

160
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,660
It's not like the Saigon Beer I remember.

161
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,628
It's not.

162
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:38,197
BEEF PHO: HANOI-STYLE PHO
WITH HOUSE NOODLES AND RICH AROMATIC BROTH

163
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,433
-Should I add the spicy chili?
-I'd love that.

164
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,468
ADDING SOME VIETNAMESE CHILI

165
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:43,503
Should I squeeze the juice in?

166
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,271
Maybe just a little.

167
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:47,707
ADDING SOME LIME JUICE

168
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,308
-Let's try the broth.
-Sounds good.

169
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,052
That's a rich broth.

170
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,223
I'm glad we added the chili.
It's nice and spicy.

171
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,191
It's good.

172
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,528
It's rich but not heavy.

173
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,864
It's similar to the pho we've had,
but a bit different.

174
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,099
In what way?

175
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,535
I like how the broth is richer.

176
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,704
I'd crave this broth
while getting over a cold.

177
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,607
I bet I'll sweat the cold off right away.

178
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:24,610
Try the noodles too.

179
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,783
None of the food here
is particularly greasy.

180
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,820
You often find yourself wanting kimchi
with meals when traveling abroad,

181
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,555
but this feels like beef radish soup.

182
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:37,523
We even had some bulgogi.

183
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:41,394
(MEAT + NOODLES TOGETHER)

184
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,362
-The meat is also nice.
-Right.

185
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,098
What are you most thrilled about today?

186
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:47,266
Visiting the burial site.

187
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,769
What part of it
are you looking forward to?

188
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:50,703
At the burial site?

189
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,873
I wonder how it'll feel to see
the building up close for the first time.

190
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,242
The Panthéon, was it?

191
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,812
When I first heard about a burial site
for historical figures,

192
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,215
I thought it'd be an ordinary building

193
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:05,451
with a graveyard like a park.

194
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,453
-Cremation wasn't allowed in the past.
-No.

195
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,555
It's fascinating how the burial site

196
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,524
has a look similar to a charnel house.

197
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,192
It looks like a temple.

198
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,595
There are several options,

199
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,129
including a grave,

200
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,931
-a woodland burial,
-That's right.

201
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,067
and cremation.

202
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,134
What would you choose?

203
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:25,738
I've always wanted my ashes
to be scattered in the sea

204
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,940
instead of being buried in one place.

205
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,910
I still want that,

206
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:34,146
but I'm also considering
my loved ones' wishes for me.

207
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:37,116
If my remains or ashes are set
in one place,

208
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,751
-they could--
-They could visit you.

209
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:43,055
I'm not sure if it's better
to give them a place to mourn

210
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:46,158
or to let them think
my soul is free to wander.

211
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:47,627
Is it legal to scatter ashes in the sea?

212
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,229
In the sea? They do that in movies.

213
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,697
I should check what's legal.

214
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,466
That's why I considered
a woodland burial instead.

215
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,401
Under a tree.

216
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,572
You try to think about death
as often as possible.

217
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,374
-Right.
-What prompted you to do that?

218
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:03,809
Every morning,

219
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:08,481
you wake up to news of unexpected events

220
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,617
and accidents that happened overnight,

221
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:13,185
any of which could easily happen to you.

222
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:15,021
I read somewhere

223
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:17,123
that there's no specific reason

224
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:18,791
why freak accidents happen.

225
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,459
They just happen.

226
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:21,994
Finding a reason only deepens the pain.

227
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,330
But we're wired
to ask why things happen to us,

228
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:28,267
or to believe we didn't do anything wrong
to deserve it.

229
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:31,003
However, now that I realize
there's no reason for things happening…

230
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,906
It's like you've accepted it
before it even happened.

231
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,575
I'm training myself to get there.

232
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:45,751
This is so good.

233
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,286
I feel as if we had Korean food.

234
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,187
I know.

235
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,523
When abroad,

236
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,193
Asian food serves as a good alternative
to Korean food.

237
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,494
It's the best.

238
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:59,665
In Istanbul, we had Asian food
at the perfect time.

239
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:01,601
I learned to treasure pho.

240
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:07,740
CHUGGING
(THE PRECIOUS BROTH)

241
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:08,808
-Let's go.
-Sure.

242
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:09,842
Thanks for the meal.

243
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,143
THEY FILLED UP ON PHO IN PARIS

244
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,179
I feel great now that I'm full.

245
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,714
This is also a vlog with closed captions.

246
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,283
-Right now--
-Friends aren't usually on camera.

247
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,052
-Only parts of their bodies are shown.
-Like this?

248
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,288
I'll place a smiley sticker
over your face in the video.

249
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,192
Right now,

250
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:30,429
we're following the line that runs
from Notre Dame Cathedral

251
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:31,731
along the Seine.

252
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:33,866
For lunch, we had pho.

253
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,436
The pho we had in France was memorable,

254
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,005
but mostly…

255
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:40,573
They're like the rats from Ratatouille.

256
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,043
-They're so cute.
-So cute. What are you looking at?

257
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,579
Is that bug in the painting or on it?

258
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:50,116
No way. It got stuck on the painting
and became part of it.

259
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:52,318
-There's a drawing of a man below.
-There's a man.

260
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:53,853
This is so cool.

261
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,022
Can you believe these rats?

262
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,156
-They're adorable.
-I know.

263
00:10:58,424 --> 00:10:59,558
-Look.
-Are those toothbrushes?

264
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,693
They're so cute.

265
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,794
Eiffel Tower toothbrushes.

266
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:04,330
Are you kidding me?

267
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,065
Isn't this a scene from About Time?

268
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,100
-No way.
-Wow.

269
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,835
BRIDE AND GROOM IN AN ADORABLE CART

270
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,005
Gosh.

271
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,208
-It was like a movie scene.
-That was sweet.

272
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,476
THEY ENCOUNTERED A MOVIE-LIKE MOMENT

273
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,612
-No way.
-I have a new dream.

274
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,646
-Doing that?
-Yes.

275
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:21,781
I want that for my wedding.

276
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,917
I must say,
it feels like living in a dream.

277
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,019
What kind of world do they live in?

278
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,154
What would you like?

279
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,089
How about mango?
That seems to be most popular.

280
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,158
We'll get mango, the most popular flavor.

281
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,493
This is a generous serving.

282
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,461
It's like a small hill.

283
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:36,862
A BITE

284
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,231
Is it good?

285
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:40,266
It's so good.

286
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,568
It's so good it makes my eyes widen.

287
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,637
-Boing.
-Boing.

288
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:47,106
Look!

289
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:50,142
Modigliani is one of my favorite artists!

290
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,078
You talked about him earlier.

291
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,946
Yes, and this is his painting.

292
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,951
They must make music boxes here.

293
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:00,920
How fascinating is that?

294
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:03,589
I feel like they'll start moving
when the lights go out.

295
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,691
Here are the rats we adore.

296
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:09,061
This is so pretty.

297
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,496
You're right. That's cute.

298
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,697
CUTENESS EVERYWHERE!

299
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,032
There's a heart. Come closer.

300
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:17,069
-Someone left their mark here.
-Yeah.

301
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,938
There's a bird.

302
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,741
Over here, someone's being asked

303
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,276
-for directions.
-What is this place?

304
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:26,412
It's fascinating.

305
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,882
There are fun details hidden everywhere.

306
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:30,916
You're right.

307
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:32,351
See this over here.

308
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,486
It's a portrait of a woman.

309
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,222
It's so pretty here.

310
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,256
Stand over there.

311
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,625
(SHE DOESN'T FIND IT HARD
BECAUSE SHE'S USED TO SKITS)

312
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:43,996
Anyone can tell it's not my house.

313
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:45,831
It's a boat.

314
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,034
-How peaceful is this?
-I know.

315
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,936
HOW PEACEFUL…

316
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,139
What's your take on the gentleman
with the dog?

317
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:54,774
How sweet is that?

318
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:56,375
It's a beagle.

319
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,443
He's my kind of guy.

320
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:01,647
My ideal man is someone
who walks his dog in a suit.

321
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:02,548
This is adorable.

322
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,316
The locks came all the way here.

323
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,718
THE PADLOCKS FROM MONTMARTRE
ARE HERE AS WELL

324
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,052
We're seeing a lot of hearts today.

325
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,587
I know. This is so cute.

326
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,956
This was hung by Dudu and Bubu.

327
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,292
Dudu and Bubu.

328
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,660
I hope they're still happy.

329
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:15,961
I hope you're all well

330
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,163
and at peace.

331
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,466
We'll head back
to the Vietnamese restaurant now.

332
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,101
See you later at the cemetery.

333
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,937
PARIS VLOG, THE END!

334
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:29,008
VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT, A 20-MINUTE DRIVE,
PÈRE-LACHAISE CEMETERY

335
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,143
So, we enjoyed the pho.

336
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,078
I don't know if it's right
to go here next,

337
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:37,449
but the well-fed living are on their way
to a cemetery.

338
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,819
It's where your favorite writer,
Balzac, is buried.

339
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,054
How does it feel being a fan of his work?

340
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:46,725
I've never gone to a memorial park
when traveling abroad,

341
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,494
but this time I wanted to.

342
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:51,764
Kim Cho-hee,
the director of Lucky Chan-sil,

343
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,165
visited Japan

344
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,401
and tended Yasujiro Ozu's grave,

345
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:58,737
pulling weeds and wiping his tombstone…

346
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,106
-Really?
-…out of admiration.

347
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,976
I came across a video

348
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:07,279
where she shared the experience.

349
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,216
Just hearing that cleansed my heart.

350
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:15,421
I may not be able to pull weeds
or wipe anything clean, but--

351
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,489
You need tools to pull out weeds.

352
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,592
-She used her bare hands.
-That's admirable.

353
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:22,561
Her love and admiration for him were clear

354
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,497
just from how she cleaned his tombstone.

355
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:26,765
I suggested coming here,

356
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:29,802
as I wanted to visit Balzac's grave
during my time in Paris.

357
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,571
I like the idea of doing something
"while we're at it"

358
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:34,673
or "since we're already doing it."

359
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,442
Because anything we do in the moment

360
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:39,144
will be okay, even if it doesn't go well.

361
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,380
He gave me so much already.

362
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:46,252
Is paying tribute to him
your way of giving back?

363
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:48,153
I'm doing it to feed my own soul.

364
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,955
That's how we all are.

365
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,558
It's my first time

366
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,094
visiting the grave
of someone I never personally knew.

367
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,796
You came all the way to Paris to do that.

368
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:02,034
If there's any trash on the ground,
I'll pick it up.

369
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,336
I'll be as kind as Amélie.

370
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,304
Nice.

371
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:10,009
THEY'RE ALMOST AT THEIR DESTINATION

372
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,544
Wow, it's so big.

373
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:13,579
Is this it?

374
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,881
THEY ARRIVE AT THE PÈRE-LACHAISE CEMETERY

375
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,384
PÈRE-LACHAISE CEMETERY

376
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,685
It's this way.

377
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,787
-No way.
-It's vast.

378
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:22,721
Tell me about it.

379
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:24,323
Wow.

380
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,360
The cemetery must be spacious.

381
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,129
But of course.

382
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:33,565
Let's keep it down.

383
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,234
We'll remain quiet to honor the deceased.

384
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,637
THE LARGEST CEMETERY IN PARIS
THAT ALSO BREATHES HISTORY AND CULTURE

385
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,372
HERE LIE THE REMAINS OF MANY ARTISTS
INCLUDING BALZAC, OSCAR WILDE,

386
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,041
CHOPIN, MOLIÈRE, LA FONTAINE,
DELACROIX, AND MODIGLIANI

387
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:46,445
AROUND 70,000 TOMBS
ABOUT A MILLION PEOPLE ARE BURIED HERE

388
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,851
WHERE PARISIANS ARE LAID TO REST
WITH GREAT NAMES IN HISTORY

389
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:54,753
MOLIÈRE (1622~1673)

390
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,289
THE GREATEST FRENCH ACTOR AND PLAYWRIGHT
WHO PERFECTED FRENCH CLASSIC PLAYS

391
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:58,190
VIVANT DENON (1747~1825)

392
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,625
DIPLOMAT, WRITER, AND ARTIST
WHO TOOK PART IN NAPOLEON'S EXPEDITION

393
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:00,759
AND SERVED AS THE FIRST DIRECTOR
OF THE LOUVRE MUSEUM

394
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,127
ARMAN (1928~2005)
CONTEMPORARY ARTIST

395
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:04,363
KNOWN FOR HIS DESTRUCTION
AND REASSEMBLY OF EVERYDAY OBJECTS

396
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,565
There's a map. Let's check it out.

397
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:08,968
Let's take a photo of it.

398
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,340
So that's how they're marked.

399
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,241
They've been sorted alphabetically.

400
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:18,911
Hey. There's Balzac.

401
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,512
Number 97.

402
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:23,015
-Number 97.
-Where is number 97?

403
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,883
Number 91, number 96,

404
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:25,884
number 97.

405
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,820
I'll take a photo of this.

406
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,321
This is where we are.

407
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,757
-We'll walk straight up.
-It's quite far away.

408
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,059
-We'll walk to the far end.
-Let's visit another person we know.

409
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,561
How about Chopin?

410
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:36,996
-Number 20?
-Yes.

411
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:38,097
It's right here.

412
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,231
-In the center.
-I see.

413
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,132
Then…

414
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,535
We'll walk this way, visit Chopin's grave,

415
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:46,572
and go around this way
to where Balzac rests.

416
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:47,706
Why don't we go that way?

417
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,241
BALZAC
CHOPIN

418
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:53,012
I'm going to clear away spider webs
as I go along.

419
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:54,513
-I'll help.
-Sure.

420
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,583
-I love Balzac's work just as much.
-Right.

421
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,618
The face is covered.

422
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:01,587
I wonder why.

423
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:02,988
STATUE WITH FACE COVERED
AND APPEARS TO BE CRYING

424
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,990
Look at what's on our left.

425
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,293
-She looks sad.
-I know.

426
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,328
A MOURNING STATUE

427
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:10,696
-I feel the pain.
-Me too.

428
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,969
I don't see any numbers on the tombs.

429
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:18,303
They're just here.

430
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,606
What if those numbers were only
for the map?

431
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:24,510
WHY DO THE WORST FEELINGS
ALWAYS TURN OUT TRUE?

432
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,913
A MAZE-LIKE CEMETERY WITH NO NUMBERING

433
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,617
THEY WALK…

434
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:33,952
AND WALK…

435
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:39,825
DESPITE WALKING SO FAR,
THEY CAN'T SEE CHOPIN'S TOMB

436
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,464
I heard this place was huge,
and it really is.

437
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,901
-Chopin's tomb was in the center.
-Yes.

438
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:50,669
So we're not even halfway
into the cemetery yet.

439
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:52,704
This place is massive.

440
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,742
THE SUN IS BLAZING

441
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,311
AND TIME KEEPS PASSING

442
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:09,421
WHERE DOES CHOPIN REST?

443
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:12,224
Wait, here's Chopin.

444
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,593
AT LAST, THEY FIND CHOPIN'S TOMB

445
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,496
-He's had so many visitors.
-I know.

446
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,432
He's still loved even after his death.

447
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:22,835
FRÉDÉRIC CHOPIN (1810~1849)

448
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,636
POLISH COMPOSER AND PIANIST
OF THE ROMANTIC ERA

449
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:27,306
KNOWN AS A POET OF THE PIANO
FOR WORKS SUCH AS NOCTURNE IN E-FLAT MAJOR

450
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,041
WALTZ IN A-FLAT MAJOR,
AND REVOLUTIONARY ETUDE

451
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,877
Look. Someone placed a candle here.

452
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,178
-Where?
-Here.

453
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:36,582
FANS HONOR AND REMEMBER CHOPIN
IN THEIR OWN WAYS

454
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:40,919
She's his wife,
so who's that woman up there?

455
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:41,887
Maybe she's the wife.

456
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,455
What does she have in her hands?

457
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,390
-It looks like an instrument.
-Really?

458
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,458
CHOPIN'S PROFILE
NOT HIS WIFE

459
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:49,094
STATUE OF EUTERPE
THE GREEK MUSE OF MUSIC

460
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,997
MOURNS CHOPIN'S UNTIMELY DEATH
WHILE HOLDING A BROKEN LYRE

461
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,533
It's a dog.

462
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,735
I thought a dog was buried there,

463
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,871
but apparently the one buried
was just a dog lover.

464
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:03,375
If it's possible, I'd like to ask
for a statue of my dog Gyeo-ul.

465
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,377
What about you?

466
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:09,715
If I could choose
how to decorate my grave,

467
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,683
-I'd choose photos.
-Photos?

468
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,953
I could decide ahead of time
which photos to decorate

469
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,688
-my grave with.
-How about this?

470
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,757
The photo that looks different
depending on the angle.

471
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,092
A hologram?

472
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,961
It'll look like I'm moving in the photo.

473
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:24,863
-That's not a bad idea.
-You could keep bowing.

474
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,732
THRILLED ABOUT DECORATING THEIR GRAVES(?)

475
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:27,733
I love it.

476
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,938
This person appears to be
looking at their smartphone.

477
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,606
When has a phone like that been released?

478
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,242
-It's someone's face!
-It's a face!

479
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:38,477
FERNAND ARBELOT (1880~1941)

480
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:39,645
THE STATUE OF THIS FRENCH ACTOR
AND MUSICIAN

481
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:41,113
EXPRESSES HIS DESIRE TO FOREVER GAZE
AT HIS WIFE'S FACE

482
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,514
Is he looking up at his wife?

483
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:46,051
-No way.
-Now that's bizarre.

484
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:51,356
DESPITE WHAT YOU MIGHT THINK,
THE STATUE EXPRESSES LOVE

485
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,961
That's not it. Sorry. I was mistaken.

486
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,534
It's Balzac's tomb.

487
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,169
HONORÉ DE BALZAC (1799~1850)
A FOUNDER OF 19TH-CENTURY LITERARY REALISM

488
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,137
I feel strange for some reason.

489
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,972
HIS BEST WORKS INCLUDE THE HUMAN COMEDY,
FATHER GORIOT, THE LILY OF THE VALLEY

490
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,240
I feel funny.

491
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:09,908
What does it say down here?

492
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,745
Those are the names
of the people buried here.

493
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,047
It's not just Balzac.

494
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:17,616
-Really?
-Yes, like his wife.

495
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,384
HE RESTS WITH HIS WIFE, HAŃSKA

496
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,853
It's good to know he won't be lonely.

497
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:27,125
What's fascinating is that the
black-and-white photo of him I saw online

498
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,595
made me think of him as just
a great writer from the past,

499
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,430
but standing at his tomb

500
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:34,032
reminds me he was once alive.

501
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,003
OK-SEOP LOOKS AROUND THE TOMB

502
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:42,374
I'd love to get rid of the spider webs,
but I can't seem to.

503
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,843
-I'm embarrassed.
-Do you think that would dishonor him?

504
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,912
-Then honor him with all your heart.
-Sure.

505
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:51,483
SHE SEEMS DISAPPOINTED
SHE COULDN'T CLEAN HIS TOMB

506
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,652
-Shall we get going?
-Sure.

507
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:57,422
CONCLUDING THEIR BRIEF
BUT ANTICIPATED VISIT TO BALZAC'S TOMB

508
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:01,193
We've never been able
to see him in person,

509
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,362
and it feels kind of strange.

510
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,364
Even though we never saw him in real life,

511
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,300
visiting his tomb made it feel

512
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:09,735
-as if we had.
-Does it seem real?

513
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,303
-We feel like he existed.
-Yes, exactly.

514
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,038
Now he feels like a person
who really existed.

515
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:17,276
Thinking about classical writers
from the past,

516
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:20,178
I know we can read their work
because they once lived.

517
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:21,580
Yet because it was so long ago,

518
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,448
-they feel like mythical figures.
-Exactly.

519
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:25,651
They really did exist, as it turns out.

520
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:31,123
Now that we've visited Balzac's tomb,

521
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:32,958
we'll go to his workroom.

522
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,393
THEY'RE NOW HEADED TO BALZAC'S HOUSE

523
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:38,130
Taking this feeling with me to his study
will make the visit feel different

524
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,265
from going there
without visiting his tomb first.

525
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,367
Right?

526
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,637
Didn't he live there for seven years?

527
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,073
That's right,
when he was hiding from creditors.

528
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,775
TO THE HOME BALZAC LIVED IN FOR 7 YEARS
WHILE AVOIDING HIS CREDITORS

529
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,011
Visiting Balzac's grave was your dream.

530
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:54,713
How did it feel to be there?

531
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,183
I wanted to tidy it up a little,
but I couldn't bring myself to do it.

532
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,685
You honored him from the heart.

533
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:02,054
I imagined myself
clearing away the spider webs.

534
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,322
Good.

535
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:04,456
Why couldn't I do it?

536
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,392
I was amused by our conversation earlier.

537
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:10,028
We were able to truly grasp
that he had once been alive

538
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:11,530
when we stood at his grave.

539
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:15,500
His death proves he once lived,

540
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,602
and that's an amusing way
to think about it.

541
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:20,639
I bet Balzac's studio is a lot different

542
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,007
from Monet's house.

543
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:24,276
-I'm excited to see how it differs.
-Same here.

544
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:29,014
As you know,
Paris has been home to many artists.

545
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:32,384
Of all of them, why did you choose
to visit Balzac's grave?

546
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,820
The reason is simply

547
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:39,224
my annoyingly pure love and admiration
for his work.

548
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,159
The Lily of the Valley, right?

549
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:42,160
Yes.

550
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,930
Two people forbidden to be together

551
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:47,666
end up falling in love.

552
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,001
Holding back her feelings for him
leads to her death.

553
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,036
That's right.

554
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:55,340
The longing and love
are depicted so movingly

555
00:22:55,407 --> 00:23:00,278
that they reached me,
even here alive in the 2020s.

556
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:01,346
I know, it's fascinating.

557
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:02,547
Balzac, too,

558
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:05,751
longed for and waited for
the woman he loved.

559
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:08,820
I think it was his pure love

560
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,255
that drew me in.

561
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:11,390
SHE FELT DRAWN TO HIS PURE LOVE

562
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:13,325
Are you mostly at your studio?

563
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:16,695
Yes, I sometimes work from home,

564
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,930
but I'm more motivated at the studio.

565
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:21,266
Getting some fresh air
during my commute and all that

566
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:24,469
is how I stay energized.

567
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:28,807
About a month or two ago,
we splurged a little

568
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:31,510
and bought a desk each.

569
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,378
-The same one.
-Yes, the same one.

570
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:36,381
Of all the items I've bought,

571
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,284
that was the most expensive.

572
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:42,320
Same for me.
It was way out of my price range.

573
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:45,023
That's why I want to see Balzac's desk.

574
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:46,558
I'm curious too.

575
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:48,560
I bet his setup's pretty minimal.

576
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:50,662
-I agree.
-I doubt it's extravagant.

577
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:53,465
Only a poor craftsman blames his tools.

578
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:54,399
I wonder

579
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:57,936
if he kept a lot on his desk
or if it was mostly empty.

580
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,405
I wonder how it was.

581
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:01,640
HOW DID HE KEEP HIS DESK?

582
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,774
We're here.

583
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:06,311
BALZAC'S HOUSE

584
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,614
"Maison de Balzac."

585
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,751
-Are you nervous?
-Well…

586
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:16,154
It's like going
to a friend's birthday party.

587
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:17,055
-Really?
-Yes.

588
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,224
"He's such a gifted writer

589
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,526
and wins awards at writing competitions."

590
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:24,396
That makes me think strange things like,
"I wonder what his room is like?"

591
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,065
-How is that strange?
-Finally, I'm getting to see it.

592
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,502
This must mean, Balzac's house.

593
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,772
MAISON = HOUSE

594
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:41,179
DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF BALZAC
GREET THEM AT THE ENTRANCE

595
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,181
DRAWING OF BALZAC

596
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:46,718
BY BENJAMIN ROUBAUD, THE 19TH-CENTURY
LITHOGRAPHER AND CARICATURIST

597
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:50,121
Where's the rest of his hair?

598
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:52,657
A CUTE LITTLE SCULPTURE OF BALZAC
SHOWING HIS RECEDING HAIRLINE

599
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:54,559
Look, this is adorable.

600
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:55,727
That's really well made.

601
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:56,628
Look how cool this is.

602
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:59,264
I heard he didn't look as funny
as people make him seem.

603
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,333
-Check this out.
-Oh, no.

604
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,002
-No way.
-This is so cool.

605
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:06,171
Isn't that lovely?

606
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,540
QUIRKY AND UNIQUE SCULPTURES

607
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,545
His desk is tiny.

608
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:20,418
BALZAC'S DESK WAS MORE MODEST
THAN THEY HAD EXPECTED

609
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:21,520
Ours…

610
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:23,288
-is about four times bigger.
-Let's return them.

611
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,758
His desk is so small.
I sort of knew it would be.

612
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:29,361
That's where he wrote all those books.

613
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:33,398
SEEING HIS DESK ONLY DEEPENED
THEIR ADMIRATION FOR HIM

614
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:36,468
How many years did he spend writing
at this desk?

615
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,203
THE MANUSCRIPT WRITTEN AND REVISED
BY BALZAC

616
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:41,940
He used this for 25 years.

617
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:42,874
Just the chair.

618
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:45,477
He used the desk for 10 years,
and the chair for 25.

619
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,415
How could he use the same chair
for 25 years?

620
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,118
That's amazing.

621
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:55,287
THE CHAIR THAT HELD BALZAC
THROUGH 25 YEARS OF JOYS AND SORROWS

622
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:58,623
Let's try reading this
with the translator app.

623
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,760
THIS BALZAC FAN IS CURIOUS
ABOUT MANY THINGS

624
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:04,362
I wrote for 19 hours yesterday and
will have to write 20 or 22 hours today.

625
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:05,630
I'm neck deep in writing manuscripts

626
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,399
I have 16 to 20 pages to complete,
revisions and all.

627
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:09,801
Le Constitutionnel printed all my work,
and I still need to write more.

628
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,069
That's why I can't leave this desk.

629
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,772
He had to write for 20 hours.

630
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:15,173
Yes, 20 to 22 hours.

631
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,510
-He wrote 16 to 20 pages…
-He was amazing.

632
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,978
AN INSANE WORKLOAD

633
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,614
Let's look over here.

634
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:25,951
Is she the woman he longed and waited for?

635
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:27,452
EWELINA HAŃSKA
A POLISH NOBLEWOMAN AND BALZAC'S MUSE

636
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,020
THEY FINALLY MARRIED,
BUT BALZAC DIED 5 MONTHS LATER

637
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:32,857
She married Balzac
only after her previous husband died,

638
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,225
but Balzac died shortly afterward.

639
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:38,597
If you compare their story
to The Lily of the Valley,

640
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:40,699
she would be the equivalent
of Lady Mortsauf.

641
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,435
NOW THAT THEY KNOW
ABOUT BALZAC'S LOVE LIFE

642
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:45,537
THEY UNDERSTAND THE BOOK MORE DEEPLY

643
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:49,474
THERE'S A LOT TO SEE IN HIS STUDY

644
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,278
"I'm a huge fan,

645
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,880
and The Human Comedy
is disgustingly good."

646
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,782
I think that's a compliment.

647
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:58,984
I think so.

648
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,987
Isn't that what we saw earlier?

649
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:03,688
BALZAC'S FAN ENJOYS HER TIME

650
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:04,856
Did he limp?

651
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:08,093
Perhaps he used a cane
since he was quite a large man.

652
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,362
-Let's read this as well.
-Sure.

653
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:16,101
EXPLORING THE STUDY,
CAREFULLY READING THE DESCRIPTIONS

654
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,203
Wow.

655
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:22,307
NEXT IS A ROOM
DISPLAYING LITHOGRAPHS OF CHARACTERS

656
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:23,642
What am I seeing?

657
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:28,213
Wouldn't they be the characters
that Balzac created?

658
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,081
-From his stories?
-Yes.

659
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,784
-He introduces countless characters.
-Exactly.

660
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:34,886
He reused a lot of them in various books.

661
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:36,488
THE HUMAN COMEDY

662
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:40,959
IS THERE ANY CHARACTER I RECOGNIZE…?

663
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:46,364
It feels unique
to have them shown this way.

664
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,235
What a spread, right?

665
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:54,606
I guess they drew inspiration
from Balzac's style for this one.

666
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:55,974
Why don't we read this?

667
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:06,584
This is a list of characters
from The Human Comedy.

668
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,954
He introduces about 2,500 characters.

669
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,589
Fascinating, right?

670
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:13,425
"Who became monsters…"

671
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:18,129
They must be called monsters
because they're distorted in some way.

672
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:21,866
Wasn't there a comment saying
The Human Comedy is disgustingly good?

673
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:23,668
-That's the best compliment ever.
-Completely.

674
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:25,136
The Human Comedy.

675
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:28,473
OK-SEOP CAME TO VISIT BALZAC
DO-YEON ALSO CAME TOGETHER, THEN LEFT.

676
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,776
THEY END THE BALZAC TOUR
BY WRITING IN THE VISITOR'S LOG WITH LOVE

677
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:33,645
GETTING SOME COFFEE
AFTER AN INTERESTING TOUR

678
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,180
There's no A/C here.

679
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:36,281
I actually prefer that.

680
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:53,264
HOT GREEN TEA, ICED CAFE LATTE

681
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:54,566
Are you fine with hot green tea?

682
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,334
Fight fire with fire.

683
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,270
Have some ice cubes if it gets too hot.

684
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,540
THEY HAPPILY PICK UP THEIR DRINKS

685
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:04,075
That looks refreshing.

686
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:05,510
Sure. Help yourself.

687
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:10,582
What do you think of us enjoying
coffee and tea in front of Balzac's house?

688
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:12,250
I never even dreamed of this.

689
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:14,853
HOW ADORABLE, HEHE

690
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,823
Before coming here, you said
this was what you were most excited for.

691
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:22,293
You were most curious about Balzac's desk.
What did you think when you saw it?

692
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,028
-It was modest as expected.
-Yeah.

693
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,431
-He sat with his back toward the window.
-I know.

694
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:30,535
I sit facing the window, so I often end up
gazing outside and spacing out.

695
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,905
You said you didn't want your desk visible
as soon as someone walks in,

696
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:36,007
so you placed it deeper in the room.

697
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:38,510
Meanwhile, Balzac's was right by the door,
turned away from the window.

698
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,012
This was also memorable.

699
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:43,248
He once spent a day working 17 hours…

700
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:44,983
But he had to work 20 to 22 hours
the next day.

701
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:46,851
Today and the next day.

702
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:49,320
He had to write for 20 hours straight,

703
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:51,322
-and that…
-Amazing, right?

704
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:53,658
Visiting his grave made us realize
he truly lived,

705
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:57,061
and we felt it even more at his home.

706
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,664
I still can't believe
he actually wrote at that desk.

707
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:00,765
Were you amazed to see it?

708
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:02,400
It's hard to believe

709
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,035
he was a real, living person.

710
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:06,304
-Even though you saw his study?
-Exactly.

711
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:08,273
It's mind-blowing.

712
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,276
After visiting Monet's House,

713
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:13,478
we talked about the importance
of an inspiring space.

714
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:17,015
-Yet in that small study,
-He wrote a lot.

715
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:20,185
Balzac created many of his masterpieces.

716
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:22,187
Compared to Monet's house, his is small.

717
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:23,988
Also,

718
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:27,926
Monet's house was surrounded by nature
and felt open and spacious.

719
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,528
Meanwhile, Balzac worked

720
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:33,531
in a small, square-shaped room.

721
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:34,833
Who would've imagined?

722
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,435
-Now…
-Now?

723
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,903
What do you want to do?

724
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:42,207
Didn't you say you wanted to go
to Pont Neuf?

725
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:43,474
That dream of yours

726
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:44,776
will come true.

727
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:48,513
Keep saying it out loud.
That way, it'll come true.

728
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,249
Since we're going to Pont Neuf,
we'll teleport there,

729
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,218
and reappear with a poof.

730
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:56,254
-Do we stand?
-Let's head to Pont Neuf.

731
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:58,690
On the count of three, we'll teleport.

732
00:30:58,756 --> 00:30:59,824
-Do we jump?
-Yes.

733
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,526
One, two, three.

734
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:02,493
-Poof.
-Poof.

735
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:06,464
This is Pont Neuf. Goodness me.

736
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,432
It's pretty.

737
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:08,433
PONT NEUF BRIDGE

738
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,368
-Sweet.
-Don't you think

739
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:12,036
they all have different expressions?

740
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:13,838
You're right. That's so cool.

741
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:16,941
We're at Pont Neuf,
the place we'd only heard about.

742
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:20,645
Being here at Pont Neuf
makes me want to watch

743
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,413
The Lovers on the Bridge.

744
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:25,316
It would be a joy to watch.

745
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:26,951
I don't know why I never watched it.

746
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:28,653
-I bet you'll like it.
-Right.

747
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,955
I ask because you're a filmmaker.

748
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:36,227
As you know,
this bridge has been in many movies.

749
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:40,565
Let's capture this view
of the bridge right here.

750
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:43,668
What scene would you set against it?

751
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:45,036
Any ideas?

752
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:48,373
The Lovers on the Bridge was so iconic

753
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:50,708
that it's hard to imagine
another scene here.

754
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:54,145
It's like how that hill scene
in Léon: The Professional,

755
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:55,980
where she walks up carrying a plant,

756
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:59,450
made it impossible
for anyone else to do it better.

757
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:00,585
No other scene here

758
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:03,421
could ever top that iconic moment
from The Lovers on the Bridge.

759
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,624
I'm saying I'm drawing a blank.

760
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:08,393
Here's what I was meaning to ask.

761
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:10,561
Since the scenery is beautiful as it is,

762
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:14,732
would you choose to pair it
with a sad scene

763
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,568
or one that contrasts its beauty?

764
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:18,836
Or would you

765
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:22,473
save this scenery for a scene so beautiful

766
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,909
that the view would make it even better?

767
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:27,445
When I write a story,

768
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:31,049
I like to film in places
I've seen firsthand.

769
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:33,084
What's an example of that?

770
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:34,919
I did that for Your Country.

771
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:37,188
Anyway, at this bridge?

772
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:39,157
Nothing's coming to me yet.

773
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:40,091
That's your assignment.

774
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,893
Got it.

775
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,562
The deadline is whenever
you figure out an answer.

776
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,964
Get back to me on that when you can.

777
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,632
I'll try to answer over dinner.

778
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,472
PEOPLE CROSSING THE PONT NEUF
UNDER THE AFTERNOON SUN

779
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:59,978
Isn't there a nearby restaurant
from a movie you enjoyed?

780
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:01,446
Yes, from Me Before You.

781
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:06,918
I watched that movie when I was
going through a hard time in my life,

782
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,721
and I watched it again
just to have an excuse to cry.

783
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:11,489
The movie only lasts two hours,

784
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:15,193
but I still had feelings
I needed to get out of my system,

785
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:16,661
so I bought the book afterward.

786
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:17,795
Was the book better?

787
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:22,300
I enjoyed the book more
because I could imagine the scenes better,

788
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,002
even though I had watched the movie.

789
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:26,471
When I was watching the movie,

790
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:30,308
I really wanted to visit the place
since it looked nice.

791
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:34,612
Which part of the movie
has the restaurant scene?

792
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,715
The two main characters
are deeply in love,

793
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:41,119
but the ending is quite sad.

794
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:46,524
There's a scene that brings
the whole movie together,

795
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:50,695
where Louisa reads the letter
the man left for her.

796
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:54,065
-She reads it at this cafe.
-At this cafe?

797
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:55,633
If you watched the movie

798
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:00,271
hoping the main characters
would stay together in the end,

799
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:03,641
you're heartbroken by this scene.

800
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,811
But because Louisa had
to move on with her life…

801
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,947
She reads it with the strength
of a champion, you see.

802
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:14,752
She doesn't cry or fall apart
while reading his letter.

803
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:17,155
She reads it calmly.

804
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,222
In that moment,

805
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:22,326
I felt like Louisa would be okay
and able to move on.

806
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,162
Is that why you wanted to go to this cafe?

807
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,464
No, just since we're here.

808
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:29,400
Tell me this isn't lucky.

809
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:33,304
I'd love to try what they serve.

810
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:34,505
I bet it's delicious.

811
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,210
FILMING LOCATION OF ME BEFORE YOU
RESTAURANT PAUL

812
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:40,344
Here she comes.

813
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,215
Beer and…

814
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:46,517
Jade Blonde, one.

815
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:58,396
She's so sweet.

816
00:34:58,463 --> 00:34:59,597
She made my day.

817
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:01,766
Ravioli and tartare.

818
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:02,967
Beef tartare.

819
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:05,269
She's stunning.

820
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,940
THEY ORDER IN GOOD SPIRITS,
THANKS TO HER SMILE

821
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:11,075
This is why we should smile more.

822
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,343
She made my day.

823
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,879
ARMED WITH A SMILE
CHUCKLING…

824
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:16,447
(HURT)
CHUCKLING…

825
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,551
I'm a lady in one of Renoir's paintings.

826
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:25,990
(SOMETHING… LIKE THIS?)

827
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:28,159
You're freaking me out. Look away.

828
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:32,330
You kind of look like Pinocchio.

829
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:33,498
Since it's a painting.

830
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:35,800
-This time, I was filming a scene.
-Sure thing.

831
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:37,468
You should watch Me Before You sometime.

832
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:40,605
You'd recognize this restaurant
and be happy to see it.

833
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:42,373
-Does she sit outside?
-Yes.

834
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,742
She sits right about here

835
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,644
and reads the letter.

836
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:50,548
-I remember seeing it from this angle.
-Really?

837
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:51,549
SHE REMEMBERS VIVIDLY

838
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:54,252
I'd only seen this cafe in a movie,

839
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,553
and now I'm here.

840
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,322
We watched Four Nights of a Dreamer

841
00:35:58,389 --> 00:35:59,557
-in May.
-Exactly.

842
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:01,292
And now we're at the Pont Neuf.

843
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,494
The Pont Neuf,

844
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:05,196
much like the Eiffel Tower,

845
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:06,998
is a beautiful place to visit,

846
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:09,267
romantic in every sense.

847
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,702
However, the film opens
with the female lead attempting suicide.

848
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:14,472
It was eerie to me somehow, and I wondered

849
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:16,440
what inspired the director to do that.

850
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,909
It's fascinating to be here.

851
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:21,846
When I watch movies in the future,
I'll imagine myself

852
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:23,247
going there someday.

853
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:24,215
You're right.

854
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:26,817
-Something tasty is on its way.
-Really?

855
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:28,085
-Is it ours?
-Yes.

856
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:29,854
FIRST, BEER TO QUENCH THEIR THIRST

857
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,256
What's that? This is a Monaco.

858
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:34,325
Enjoy.

859
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:40,398
MONACO

860
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:45,803
JADE BLONDE

861
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,906
QUENCHING THEIR THIRST

862
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:50,808
CHUGGING DOWN

863
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:52,543
Oh my.

864
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,245
This isn't sweet at all.

865
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:55,379
-It's so good.
-This is also good.

866
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:56,314
It only smells sweet.

867
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:58,583
-This is my kind of beer.
-Really?

868
00:36:58,649 --> 00:36:59,784
PERFECT TO DO-YEON'S LIKING!

869
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,586
It's lightly carbonated and smooth.

870
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:02,553
THEY TRY EACH OTHER'S DRINKS

871
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:07,425
-It's mildly sweet.
-Really?

872
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,193
This is the life.

873
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,628
It still feels surreal.

874
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:14,298
Here's what I thought
about Four Nights of a Dreamer.

875
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:18,436
Falling for the person who saved you

876
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:20,738
is a typical love story.

877
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:22,440
But that movie was different.

878
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,843
The guy falls in love
with the woman he saved.

879
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:29,213
He gets lost in a fantasy
and pines for her.

880
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,382
-That--
-They came up with a clever title.

881
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:32,850
-It only lasted four nights.
-Right.

882
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,119
Did we stay here for four nights,
or was it three?

883
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:37,054
-We stay for three.
-Is it three?

884
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:38,756
We're one night short
of becoming a dreamer.

885
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:40,258
For us, it's Three Nights of a Korean.

886
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:42,593
That sounded like Korean Dining Table

887
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:45,229
or Documentary 3 Days.

888
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,099
What was the theme of our trip again?

889
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:49,834
Eating, drinking, and friendship.

890
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,936
We ate enough and are now drinking.

891
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:53,738
So what's the status of our friendship?

892
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:54,872
EATING, DRINKING, AND FRIENDSHIP?

893
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,408
What I can say for sure

894
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,477
is that I ate well and drank well.

895
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:02,179
But I'm not sure
where our friendship stands.

896
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:03,147
What do you mean?

897
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:04,315
I can confidently say

898
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:06,217
that we ate delicious food

899
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,419
and enjoyed good drinks on the trip.

900
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:09,787
But friendship?

901
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:11,889
-It's hard to discuss an abstract concept.
-Yes, exactly.

902
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,225
-Maybe this question will clarify things.
-What is it?

903
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,561
If you're open
to traveling together again,

904
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,663
then our friendship was good.

905
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:20,364
But if this trip…

906
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,603
-While we're at it…
-Maybe we've hung out enough.

907
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,104
We even traveled to Paris together,

908
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:28,606
so maybe it's time to…

909
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:30,841
Maybe this will be our last.

910
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,178
So, how was it for you?

911
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:37,248
I'd love to travel with you again.

912
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,284
Why are you saying something nice
in such a lackluster tone?

913
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:42,853
Because sounding too enthusiastic

914
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,288
-feels corny.
-Is it corny?

915
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:46,757
You're right. I had a great time.

916
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,192
-It was fun.
-It was fun.

917
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,161
It was also a treat to visit

918
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:52,596
so many places in such a short time.

919
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,531
Think about it.

920
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:56,334
Just visiting Monet's house in France

921
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,070
would make the trip unforgettable.

922
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:00,805
Is that what you enjoyed the most?

923
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:01,706
For me, yes.

924
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:03,974
We not only went to Monet's house,

925
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:06,844
but we also visited Balzac's study.

926
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:08,879
-Even his tomb.
-The Lovers on the Bridge…

927
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:10,614
Both of them lived in France.

928
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,550
What a wild trip this was.

929
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:13,651
Truly unbelievable.

930
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:15,786
Sometimes,

931
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,589
what feels like a dream
ends up becoming real.

932
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,225
Amazing, right? Just live long enough.

933
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:22,493
We're super lucky.

934
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,828
Just live long enough.

935
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:25,629
This has to be a dream.

936
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,831
It is.

937
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:30,768
No, it's not!

938
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:33,437
AAAAAAAHHHHHH!

939
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:34,672
FLUSTERED

940
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:37,708
IF THIS IS A DREAM,
I NEVER WANT TO WAKE UP…

941
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:42,646
Don't tell me this is a set.

942
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:45,349
We're not in Sangam-dong, are we?

943
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,686
Who the hell are you?
Are you an actor from Surprise Mystery TV?

944
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:53,524
THE FOOD SNAPS HER BACK TO REALITY

945
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:54,959
EMBARRASSED

946
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,397
-Everything looks good.
-See?

947
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:01,399
You can't go wrong with the food here.

948
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:05,703
BEEF TARTARE

949
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:10,341
A CLASSIC FRENCH DISH
OF SEASONED RAW MINCED BEEF

950
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:15,446
RAVIOLI

951
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:18,215
A CLASSIC ITALIAN DISH
OF PASTA POCKETS WITH FILLINGS

952
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:20,017
I'll enjoy. What will you try first?

953
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,353
I'd like to start with the brighter dish
that's not so red.

954
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,554
-The ravioli, then.
-Sure.

955
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,590
Given that Marthe

956
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:29,393
attempted suicide on the Pont Neuf,

957
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,495
she might have eaten here once as well.

958
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:32,530
That's possible.

959
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,699
What if she had eaten the food here and…

960
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:36,734
A BITE

961
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:38,969
And?

962
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:41,305
She might've changed her mind
if the food was that good.

963
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:43,774
There's a reason I'm saying that.

964
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:46,844
I sometimes watch food review channels.

965
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:47,745
This is delicious.

966
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:50,147
I can't recall what the food was,
but I do remember this.

967
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:51,916
It was described as
"a taste worth living for."

968
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:54,251
This is how I'd define our trip.

969
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:56,120
-How?
-"A trip worth living for."

970
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:59,490
-Really?
-You said before that living long enough

971
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:00,991
has its perks.

972
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:02,693
You're right. Just live and you'll see.

973
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,329
Isn't it delicious?

974
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:07,164
It's like… Is this mushroom?

975
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:09,967
The smell of the cheese
and mushrooms is amazing.

976
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:13,103
Anything made with flour here
turns out soft and thin.

977
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,271
Let's try that too.

978
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:15,406
Yes, let's.

979
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,478
Isn't it like tuna?

980
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,547
The flavors are simple,
but it's nicely tangy.

981
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:24,682
It's a main dish,

982
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:26,784
but I'm eating it like a salad.

983
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:31,589
CAN'T STOP MOVING THEIR FORKS

984
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:34,625
It's so good.

985
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:36,360
I'm glad we ordered this.

986
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:38,896
FLAVORS THAT LEAVE YOU SPEECHLESS

987
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:39,964
It's so good.

988
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:42,466
You know how you always feel sad

989
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:45,269
-at the end of a trip.
-Right.

990
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,570
How do you cope with that?

991
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:49,006
When I know I'll be going back tomorrow,

992
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:52,076
I try to find something that excites me
in my everyday life.

993
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:55,813
Whether it's a gig I'm excited for,
meeting a good friend,

994
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,382
or spending time with my family,

995
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:00,184
I keep thinking about those things.

996
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:02,419
I try to force myself
to be excited to go home.

997
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:04,588
-That's a good idea.
-If there's nothing to look forward to,

998
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:07,992
I remind myself to plan my next trip soon.

999
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:12,196
I had such a great time, and working hard
is what lets me go on another trip.

1000
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:13,831
That's what I always tell myself.
What about you?

1001
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:15,232
I feel it through my whole body.

1002
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:16,600
"Damn." Just like that.

1003
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:18,469
YOU'RE SO RIGHT

1004
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,404
It's like your entire body is aching.

1005
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:22,973
RETURNING TO EVERYDAY LIFE
IS HARD FOR EVERYONE

1006
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,843
If we get to come back,
I wonder what will lead us here.

1007
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,077
I'm curious.

1008
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:28,145
Isn't that up to us to decide?

1009
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:31,382
If you had a diary,
what would you put in it?

1010
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:34,251
We mentioned this before, but Balzac wrote

1011
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:38,522
that he had to work 15 hours today
and 20 tomorrow.

1012
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:40,291
Oddly enough, that comforted me.

1013
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:42,393
Even Balzac, as great as he was,

1014
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:45,963
had to meet tight deadlines and recorded

1015
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,365
how tough his work was.

1016
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:50,534
I could relate to
what he was going through.

1017
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:53,837
That left me with good feelings
I want to hold on to,

1018
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,439
and I'd like to write about that.

1019
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:58,175
-I had a great time.
-It was a lot of fun.

1020
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,110
IT WAS EVEN BETTER BECAUSE
THEY SHARED THIS DREAMY 3-DAY TRIP

1021
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:01,712
Now it's time

1022
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:03,581
for the final part of the trip.

1023
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:05,783
-This is how we end the show.
-I know what it is.

1024
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:07,618
We'll write in the travel diary.

1025
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:08,752
It's like this.

1026
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,988
Imagine the camera is off,

1027
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:13,257
and write what's in your heart.

1028
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:20,564
In a way, you're the main character
of this diary session

1029
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:22,566
we're about to start.

1030
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:24,668
TRAVEL BUDDY OK-SEOP TAKES THE SPOTLIGHT
IN THIS SEGMENT

1031
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,072
I can't resist reading what others wrote.

1032
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:29,173
That can't be helped.

1033
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:35,846
FILLING ONE MORE PAGE IN A DIARY
BRIMMING WITH MEMORIES

1034
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:42,820
THREE NIGHTS IN PARIS WITH TWO DREAMERS
WHO FOLLOWED THEIR HEARTS

1035
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:49,293
THEY FILL THE TRAVEL DIARY
WITH SHARED MEMORIES

1036
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,664
LIKE CLOSE FRIENDS,
THEY FINISH AT THE SAME TIME

1037
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:54,632
Done?

1038
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,736
I'm too embarrassed
to read it out loud though.

1039
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,038
-Then--
-Can't we just read what the other wrote?

1040
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:02,640
Why don't we read what each other wrote?

1041
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,075
FOR THE FIRST TIME,
THEY'LL READ EACH OTHER'S WORDS

1042
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,410
Who should go first?

1043
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:07,645
-You.
-Me?

1044
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:10,314
"What I received
from the people I met in Paris."

1045
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:13,651
"Balzac worked 17 hours today
and planned another 20 tomorrow."

1046
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:18,088
"Despite the stress, he met his workload
and produced countless works."

1047
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:21,625
"Monet worked in bliss, painting
the garden he created for his art."

1048
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:24,695
"I'd love a garden of my own.
Monet was fortunate to have good friends."

1049
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:27,131
"What would it take
to have a life like Monet's?"

1050
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:29,066
"When filming at Pont Neuf was banned,

1051
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:33,303
Director Leos Carax even built a replica
to complete The Lovers on the Bridge."

1052
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:36,874
"The witty nature of Do-yeon shines
in Getaway and Go with Jangdobari."

1053
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,576
"Eating, drinking, and friendship.
Two exclamation marks."

1054
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:40,778
"Let's do this again."

1055
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:42,713
That was clean and simple.

1056
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,614
My turn.

1057
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:48,519
"I still can't believe I'm in Paris,
a city I once only dreamed of visiting."

1058
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:51,755
"It's bittersweet knowing
I'll be reluctant to leave,

1059
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:54,358
but that only makes me want
to come back even more."

1060
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:57,528
"In life, I'll see new things,
visit new places, and have experiences

1061
00:44:57,594 --> 00:44:59,229
that will motivate me."

1062
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:01,065
"If what I say could come true,

1063
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:04,168
I should make sure to think positively
and imagine good things."

1064
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:07,304
"Instead of being negative,
I'll say I'll go there someday."

1065
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,273
"I'm in Paris now.
So my next stop is Greece."

1066
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:11,341
"I will go there someday."

1067
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:12,843
"Greece, here I come."

1068
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:16,513
"I also hope my friend had fun
on her first trip as part of a show."

1069
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,283
"Here I am, writing near the table

1070
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:21,852
where Louisa sat in that Paris restaurant
from Me Before You."

1071
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:24,288
I had a blast.

1072
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:26,190
All right.

1073
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:27,925
This is what I do

1074
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:31,361
with a close friend
to greet or say goodbye.

1075
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:34,932
After toasting
to eating, drinking, and friendship,

1076
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:36,066
we'll stand up.

1077
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:38,335
Come over here.

1078
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:41,672
WHAT NOW…

1079
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,273
This is what we'll do.

1080
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,309
Bounce, tap, bounce, and tap.

1081
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:48,145
1. TAPPING THEIR FEET TOGETHER

1082
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:49,313
Next, lock legs.

1083
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,015
Then, hop around in a circle like this.

1084
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,250
Got it.

1085
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:55,619
-That's all.
-Sure.

1086
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:56,954
Okay, let's try that.

1087
00:45:58,622 --> 00:46:00,224
THE FINAL GOODBYE
DANCING WITH A FRIEND

1088
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:01,325
Okay, I had a great time.

1089
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:03,761
-To eating, drinking, and friendship.
-Friendship.

1090
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:05,629
CHUGGING

1091
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:08,899
Goodness, Marthe.

1092
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:10,100
Don't make me do that.

1093
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:11,935
Bounce, tap, bounce, and tap.

1094
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,972
What a blast this was.

1095
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:19,343
That was embarrassing.

1096
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:21,745
THE DREAMLIKE BUDDYMOON ENDS
ON A HIGH NOTE

1097
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:29,186
YI OK-SEOP

1098
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:35,959
JANG DO-YEON, YI OK-SEOP

1099
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,403
I wonder what he'll be wearing.

1100
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,705
As for me, I'm in my finest clothes.

1101
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:51,708
I've gone on a blind date with him,
dated him,

1102
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:53,377
and even married him.

1103
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:56,413
He's a friend
with the most charming pink gums.

1104
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,682
Don't be nervous.
You've got this, Do-yeon.

1105
00:46:58,749 --> 00:46:59,683
Do-yeon!

1106
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:01,385
Se-chan!

1107
00:47:01,451 --> 00:47:03,520
SEASON 3'S FIRST TRAVEL BUDDY

1108
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:05,522
Looks like I'm going on a date
with Jangdobari.

1109
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:07,457
HE'S STILL AS ATTENTIVE AS EVER

1110
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:10,427
Doesn't this look like my tongue?

1111
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:11,628
Are you asking for a kiss?

1112
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:13,263
Kissing in the middle of the day?

1113
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,798
Please close your eyes.

1114
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:16,934
Jangdobari and I are going to smooch.

1115
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:21,471
SHOWING OFF THE CHARM AND DIGNITY
OF THE ORIGINAL STUD

1116
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:22,873
You looked sexy just now.

1117
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,274
-Really? Did I seem charming?
-Yes.

1118
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:26,243
FOR SE-CHAN, WHO'S MAKING AN EFFORT

1119
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:29,079
JANGDOBARI REVEALS A NEW SIDE!

1120
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:30,314
THAT'S SO COOL

1121
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,648
AND…

1122
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:33,517
-Hey, Se-chan.
-Hey, there.

1123
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:34,785
Hi, Do-yeon.

1124
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:35,886
FRIENDS CELEBRATING THEIR REUNION?

1125
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:37,621
We were on
Comedy Big League together, remember?

1126
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,289
LAUGHING SO HARD
THEIR GUMS COULD NEVER DRY

1127
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:42,326
DO-YEON AND SE-CHAN'S
A TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE IN SEOUL~!

1128
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:44,828
All we lived for was comedy.

1129
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:48,432
