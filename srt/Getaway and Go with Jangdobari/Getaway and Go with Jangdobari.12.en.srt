1
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,839
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

2
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:08,641
A MORNING BLANKETED IN SOFT, GENTLE MIST

3
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:11,511
AND A LIGHT DRIZZLE

4
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:15,849
HERE IS A PLACE FILLED
WITH A SERENE, SNUG ATMOSPHERE

5
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:20,153
Hello, everyone!

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,023
Bound for a break
with bundles of stories in my bag.

7
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:25,258
I'm Jang Do-yeon
of Getaway and Go with Jangdobari.

8
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:28,528
Right now, I'm in Yeongam, Jeollanam-do.

9
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,632
TODAY'S DESTINATION
YEONGAM COUNTY, JEOLLANAM-DO

10
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:37,804
WHAT JOURNEY AWAITS US
IN YEONGAM, THE LAND OF VITAL ENERGY?

11
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,974
The rain's coming down in a drizzle.

12
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,343
It's a bit damp,
but the sight is breathtaking.

13
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,546
Now, shall we head off
to meet my travel buddy for today?

14
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,416
MEANWHILE…

15
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:51,017
When is she coming?

16
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,753
A YOUNG MAN WAITING FOR DO-YEON

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,321
I'm nervous.

18
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,857
Not sure if the camera can capture this,

19
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:01,795
but right before my eyes is a masterpiece
named Wolchulsan Mountain.

20
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:04,431
You can see a light veil of mist.

21
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:07,000
The mountain's surrounded by thick fog,

22
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,870
so much so that a mountain spirit
could appear any moment.

23
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:13,540
Look over there,
raindrops falling from the eaves.

24
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:15,408
Now that's a scene full of charm.

25
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:20,246
My travel buddy here in Yeongam is,

26
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:21,714
without exaggeration,

27
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:25,051
someone I've really been hoping
to meet again on a variety show.

28
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,087
My favorite entertainer-slash-idol!

29
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:30,523
It's her!

30
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,625
What should I do? Do I stay here?

31
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,227
IS SHE HERE?

32
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:36,563
My role model…

33
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,634
DANCING AWAY THE NERVES

34
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:46,306
Because of his flair and talent
that are perfect for an idol,

35
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:50,076
I think his sense of humor was overlooked,
which is a pity.

36
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:53,613
I'd really hoped
to work with him on a show,

37
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,015
and thankfully,
he's joined us on our program.

38
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:57,417
SHE'S HERE!

39
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:58,785
This person is a foreigner,

40
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,720
but he speaks better Korean than I do.

41
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,258
-Goodness!
-Hi!

42
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:07,760
ZHANG HAO
SINGER

43
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:09,062
You seemed to love durians.

44
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,498
A CERTIFIED DURIAN AMBASSADOR

45
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:12,599
CHOMP CHOMP

46
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:15,135
I got first place
in Fujian Province, China.

47
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:16,603
1ST IN COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAMS

48
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:20,206
But winning Boys Planet
is a bigger honor than that.

49
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:21,474
SURVIVAL SHOW FOR IDOLS

50
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:22,642
What's "love-it-or-hate-it"?

51
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:23,743
The rich are rich?

52
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,011
The rich get richer!

53
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,579
PERFECT YET ENDEARINGLY FLAWED

54
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,515
That's hilarious!

55
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:29,782
Today's my debut.

56
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:30,683
Says who!

57
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,752
You spoke so highly of me.

58
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,287
Who would say no to that?

59
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:37,090
He speaks so well when he's upset.

60
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,826
Your character would be coveted
in variety shows.

61
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,928
VARIETY SHOW PROSPECT CHOSEN BY DO-YEON

62
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,497
-May I? Oh my!
-Thank you.

63
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:47,867
-Thank you so much for coming.
-Thank you for having me.

64
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,335
Did you dye your hair?

65
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:51,104
-I did.
-When did this happen?

66
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,640
-Yesterday.
-What made you dye your hair?

67
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:56,576
I did it because this show
really matters to me.

68
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,278
-Jangdobari matters to you?
-Yes.

69
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,848
Today, I'm going to play
a certain character.

70
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,483
What kind of character?

71
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,019
-You are Ms. Jang, aren't you?
-That's right.

72
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:08,855
So I'm going to be Master Zhang.

73
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:12,692
We're at a cultural landmark.

74
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,294
WOOD CULTURE EXPERIENCE CENTER

75
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,828
So I'll be a young master.

76
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:19,499
Should I call you "Master Zhang"
throughout the trip?

77
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,701
No. I'm your little brother.

78
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,102
Young lady and young master.

79
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:24,971
LADY JANG AND MASTER ZHANG
SIBLINGS FOR THE DAY

80
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,406
-You're my brother?
-Yes.

81
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:28,274
Will you be calling me noona?

82
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,809
That will be today's rule.

83
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,979
You're the first guest
to bring up the rule before I did.

84
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,347
You're quick to catch on.

85
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,783
Fine. So I can talk casually to you?

86
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:40,386
Yes, and I can only call you noona.

87
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:42,388
I should not call you otherwise.

88
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:45,725
On the other hand,
you're not allowed to speak formally.

89
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,926
-Only casually, then?
-Yes.

90
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:48,127
Suits me.

91
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,163
THRILLED

92
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,232
Awesome! She's treating me like a kid!

93
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,502
I'll just be friendly and call you Hao.

94
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,570
-Sure.
-All right.

95
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,672
Now that we've set the rule--

96
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,274
What, you want me to join?

97
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,543
Let's do our best.
You said this show mattered to you.

98
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,478
Yes. It does matter to me.

99
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:06,646
Just spin it!

100
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,781
Whatever. Let's just dance.

101
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:09,916
You see…

102
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,050
ONE-TWO STEP

103
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:15,255
I always get nervous
when filming the intro, you know.

104
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,190
-Okay.
-I did the last time we met.

105
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,761
It'd be great
if you could help me loosen up a bit.

106
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,363
Yes, I'd love that too.

107
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,964
IN SYNC LIKE THE SIBLINGS THEY ARE

108
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:28,167
What would you like to do today?

109
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:29,435
Are you the host?

110
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:35,275
I just want to kind of stroll around.
What about you?

111
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:37,277
-I have a gift for you.
-What is it?

112
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,979
Hey, you didn't have to come so prepared.

113
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,383
What is it? It's a phone.

114
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,651
It's a used phone.

115
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,253
Take a selfie with this.
It comes out really pretty.

116
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,855
It's the trend these days.

117
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:51,424
Do you actually carry this phone around?

118
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,525
I used it for a while.

119
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,729
Then I decorated it for you.

120
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,765
-Can I keep it?
-Yeah.

121
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,167
Take a look at the home screen.

122
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,235
This is you.

123
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:05,305
It's Zhang Hao's universe.

124
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:09,375
Can I carry this around
and take pictures with it for today?

125
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,711
Yes, we can take selfies together.

126
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,846
Sure. It's nice to capture the moment.

127
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,581
Anything else you want to do?

128
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,216
See the Wolchulsan Mountain?

129
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,252
Yes, that's Wolchulsan Mountain.

130
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,653
You've done your homework.

131
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,355
Yes. I want to go up there.

132
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:23,656
-Wolchulsan Mountain?
-Yes.

133
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,758
I haven't gone hiking at all
since I came to Korea.

134
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,660
You look like you just did.

135
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:30,196
-Oh, this?
-Were you attacked by an animal?

136
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,130
Were you?

137
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:34,367
-That's from the all-out dancing earlier.
-Is it?

138
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,469
Dancing with noona!

139
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:38,905
You don't have to play along.

140
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,573
-I learned something.
-What?

141
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,375
If you can't play along,

142
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:43,509
just ask a question.

143
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,778
NEVER FORGETS WHAT HE LEARNED

144
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,380
Who taught you that?

145
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:48,648
Mr. Kim Seong-ju.

146
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:51,017
-Did he teach you that?
-Yes.

147
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,019
Change the topic if you can't play along?

148
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:56,189
Exactly. You have to think quickly
and throw something out there.

149
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,458
That's true.
You have to keep the vibe going.

150
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,594
-I see you've grown.
-Thank you.

151
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:05,131
But I think you've made me
more famous in Korea.

152
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,632
AFTER APPEARING ON &lt;SALON DRIP 2&gt;

153
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,067
What are you talking about?

154
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,135
-I mean it.
-Really?

155
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,003
-Yes.
-Oh well…

156
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,440
Then I'll take it that our show
contributed just a little.

157
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:19,178
Today, I'll be traveling around Yeongam
with my friend Hao here.

158
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:21,214
You love durians, don't you?

159
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,982
-Prince Durian, if you will.
-Okay.

160
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,884
It's a different type of fruit,

161
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:29,222
but there's a fruit you'd probably like
since you're into durians.

162
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:34,427
It's a fruit that Yeongam is super famous
for producing and--

163
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,162
-I know what it is.
-You know?

164
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,296
-Yes.
-What is it?

165
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:38,498
Fig.

166
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,233
CORRECT

167
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,035
Let's go.

168
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:48,474
Off we go!

169
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,512
I'm a young master,
so you're the princess.

170
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,347
So you have to act with grace.

171
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:57,016
-So you're the princess's brother?
-Yes.

172
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:04,857
EPISODE 12: LADY JANG AND MASTER ZHANG
YOU ARE MY NOONA

173
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,326
Noona, let me get the door for you.

174
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:08,261
Will you?

175
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,363
My brother is such a gentleman.

176
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:11,731
-Princess.
-Thanks.

177
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:12,932
-Xie xie.
-Xie xie.

178
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:18,371
Did you match your hair color
with your outfit?

179
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,840
That's right. This is my signature color.

180
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:24,043
So before I came here for the shoot,
I told them to book me a dye job.

181
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,012
-That's your personal color?
-Yes.

182
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,547
It suits me the best.

183
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,183
It's a cool color. What is it called?

184
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:31,384
-Wine.
-Oh, wine?

185
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,253
When I got invited to this show
a month ago,

186
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,456
I was so thrilled.

187
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:38,057
I've been waiting just for this day.

188
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,793
Don't think of this as work. I'm serious.

189
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,129
Yeah, today will be super fun.

190
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,998
(CUTE LOL)

191
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:47,233
To be completely honest,

192
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,404
I've been preparing for this show
for a long time.

193
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,407
As you know, I work with the producer
for Salon Drip too.

194
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,776
The very first guest
the producer mentioned was you.

195
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,044
-Really?
-Yeah.

196
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,480
When we were talking over possible guests,

197
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:02,582
the producer was like,
"What about Zhang Hao?"

198
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,217
And I said, "Yes, please!"

199
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:09,055
That's probably why
the offer reached you so quickly.

200
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,557
And I was grateful when you said yes.

201
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,159
TOUCHED

202
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,862
I did think you might be too busy.

203
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:19,065
No matter what else is going on,
how could I say no?

204
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:22,168
-This show comes first.
-That's so nice of you.

205
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,504
You can eat anything you want.

206
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,872
-Really?
-Yeah.

207
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,039
With your money?

208
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:29,075
Nope, I won't spend a dime.

209
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,845
We'll be using the corporate card
for the day.

210
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,514
I thought we'd be using your card.

211
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,583
Well, the show's got my name on it.
I'm basically a figurehead CEO.

212
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:39,619
Do you know what that means?

213
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,522
"Figurehead. Verbal contract."
I've learned these things.

214
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,258
That was a verbal contract.

215
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,193
"You can eat anything you want."

216
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,996
Yesterday, my manager and stylists told me

217
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:53,933
that Jeollanam-do has the tastiest food
in all of Korea.

218
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,635
Jeolla is known for its food.

219
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,170
Other regions have
their share of delicious food

220
00:08:58,237 --> 00:08:59,839
and their own specialties,

221
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:03,442
but they say you can walk into any place
and never go wrong while you're here.

222
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,044
Is that true?

223
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,646
Tables filled with side dishes.

224
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,248
-Then let's go to a must-eat place.
-Should we?

225
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,516
You're quite the big eater.

226
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,919
Not just you.

227
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:15,521
Your fellow members
have huge appetites too.

228
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:19,191
Honestly, watching you guys eat so well
made me proud.

229
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:22,528
I've been watching my weight for today.

230
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,964
Yeah? But you're always in shape.

231
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,066
Thanks.

232
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,968
Yeongam is known for its figs.

233
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,303
ARRIVED AT A FIG FARM

234
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:31,370
-Hop out.
-Okay.

235
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:34,440
Now this is a fig farm.

236
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,442
Yeongam is known for its figs.

237
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:39,745
I heard that 60% of the country's figs
are produced in Yeongam.

238
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,547
THE BIGGEST FIG PRODUCER IN KOREA

239
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:44,383
I've never tasted a fig before,
not even in Seoul.

240
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,552
You haven't? You're in luck, then.

241
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,487
-Let's do our ritual.
-What is it?

242
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:50,590
Two, one.

243
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,091
-Excuse me!
-Excuse me!

244
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,060
-Yes!
-Oh, you're here.

245
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,695
-Hi there.
-Hello.

246
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:57,463
What a surprise.

247
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,468
-It's an honor to have you.
-Why, thank you.

248
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:06,839
We came here
because we heard Yeongam figs are famous.

249
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,808
I was told this place is an indoor farm.

250
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,076
-Correct.
-It is?

251
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,211
So they're harvested all year round.

252
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:15,781
-It's not really fig season now, is it?
-No.

253
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:19,685
You must be managing things
like temperature control really carefully.

254
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,420
This place is basically a jungle.

255
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:22,488
-A jungle?
-Yes.

256
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,690
This is a huge farm. If I were to guess…

257
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,626
-About 4,000 square meters.
-Four thousand?

258
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,761
-Could we take a look around?
-Sure.

259
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,665
-It smells very sweet.
-Yeah.

260
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,767
-Smells like fig, doesn't it?
-I love that smell.

261
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,802
-A fun fact.
-Yes?

262
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,237
One fruit grows on each leaf.

263
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,373
It really does. Adorable!

264
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:41,273
Interesting, huh?

265
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,442
It looks like a tiny lump.

266
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,979
This one's huge!

267
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,649
I've never seen a fig this big before.

268
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,717
-Can I touch it?
-Yes.

269
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,419
GENTLE

270
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:54,754
Is it soft?

271
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,023
It sinks in.

272
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,892
-Will this one come off?
-Yes, you can pick it.

273
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,027
-This one's ripe.
-Yes.

274
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:02,161
Just turn it.

275
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,529
See?

276
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,531
-Can we eat it here?
-Yes.

277
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:06,499
You try.

278
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:07,566
Like this.

279
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:09,368
Just like a banana.

280
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,404
-Can I really try it?
-Your first fig.

281
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,672
My first fig.

282
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,509
-It's really good.
-Look how plump and clean it is.

283
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:21,514
It really is plump on the inside.

284
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,715
-It's soft.
-Yes.

285
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,250
-This is…
-How is it?

286
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,385
-It's not too sweet.
-Yes?

287
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,888
-It tastes healthy.
-Healthy?

288
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:33,325
-Looks tasty!
-We often eat the skin as well.

289
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:37,196
-Good, huh?
-It's amazing.

290
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,231
It's not like the store-bought ones.

291
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:42,635
It doesn't fall apart,
and there's actually something to chew on.

292
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,336
-Right?
-It's so good.

293
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,305
What you see as pulp is really flowers.

294
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,873
-You're eating flowers.
-Flowers?

295
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,843
Figs are called "flowerless fruit"
in Korean. Why do they have flowers?

296
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,578
It is called "flowerless fruit,"

297
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,614
but actually,
it's a fruit that eats its own flowers.

298
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,516
Oh, it eats the flowers?

299
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,019
This place is endless.

300
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,354
FIG HARVEST BEGINS

301
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:04,457
This one's ripe.

302
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,859
Those are twins.

303
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:08,394
Twins.

304
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,233
You pick them so well.

305
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,801
CLAP!

306
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:18,337
Snap!

307
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:21,474
Look at that one.

308
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:23,709
It's perfectly ripe.

309
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:26,912
You're good at picking.

310
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,415
Can you see the crack on this one?

311
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,317
Yes, it's a little…

312
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,652
As the saying goes, its side burst open.

313
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,021
-Just like gimbap.
-Gimbap?

314
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,625
AFTER A FUN FIG-PICKING

315
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,461
IT'S TIME TO TASTE THEM

316
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,996
Take one out and slice it open.

317
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:44,997
-Okay.
-Have a taste.

318
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:46,766
SINKS IN

319
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,300
-Cuts like butter.
-Right?

320
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:51,237
-Try slicing it in half again.
-Cross section.

321
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,306
Goes right through.

322
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:55,441
Thank you.

323
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,309
That one looks good.

324
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,245
-It's so smooth.
-The color is different.

325
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:00,579
Yours looks tastier.

326
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:03,783
See how it cuts so smoothly?
It means that it's fully ripe.

327
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:06,485
-It also means that this one's sweeter.
-I see.

328
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,254
Let's try this one first.

329
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,356
HAO CHOOSES AFTER NOONA

330
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:11,423
Don't forget to toast.

331
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,358
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

332
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:15,494
Smells delightful.

333
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,934
It's sweeter than the one
I had on the farm.

334
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,702
-I bet.
-The same goes for this one.

335
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:27,473
If you visit the farm,
you get to enjoy perfectly ripe fruit.

336
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,841
That's the charm.

337
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:33,979
Good?

338
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:35,514
Absolutely delicious.

339
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:38,050
What are these little things
that look like sesame seeds?

340
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,785
-Those are the seeds.
-Seeds?

341
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:42,888
There's that crunchiness of the seeds.

342
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,391
Yes, they burst with a little pop.

343
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,626
We really should savor every bite of this.

344
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:48,928
That was awesome, sir.

345
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:49,995
Thank you, sir.

346
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,297
TASTED BETTER AT THE SOURCE

347
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:52,464
-Noona.
-Yeah?

348
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,733
I brought something.

349
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,735
You called me Prince Durian earlier.

350
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,404
Yes. You're also the durian ambassador.

351
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,272
That's right. So I brought one with me.

352
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,008
-Is that an actual durian?
-Yes. Wanna hold it?

353
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:05,177
Hold it with your hands spread out.

354
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,079
If you keep them close, it'll hurt.

355
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:07,980
Spread them out.

356
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,317
-How are you even holding it?
-Stings, doesn't it?

357
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:15,254
It's heavy. I think I'm touching a durian
for the first time.

358
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,389
How big is this one?

359
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,725
It's a tiny durian.
There are many kinds of durians.

360
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,393
-It's so heavy.
-Yeah.

361
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,329
-Fascinating, isn't it?
-It is.

362
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:24,663
Doesn't smell like a fart.

363
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,599
Right? It smells like trees.

364
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:29,268
Yeah, it just smells like grass or trees.

365
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:30,836
People are wrong about this fruit.

366
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,605
I can't hold it for long though.

367
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:34,139
SNIFF

368
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,242
-Smells amazing.
-Is it good?

369
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,043
Does that count as a good smell?

370
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,212
Careful now.

371
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,981
INFATUATED

372
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:43,549
How do you eat it?

373
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,284
Just split it open and eat it.

374
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:46,886
Be careful.

375
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:47,786
CRACK

376
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,990
No seeds inside?
Can you just eat the whole thing?

377
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,424
There are seeds inside.

378
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:54,393
CRACK

379
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,297
FULL

380
00:14:58,364 --> 00:14:59,865
It's fuller. Can you eat this?

381
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,467
You can make soup with the rind.

382
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,802
Durian chicken soup tastes really good.

383
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,337
It's a Cantonese favorite.

384
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,106
-Do you boil it down?
-Yes.

385
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,074
-Like hot pot.
-Hot pot?

386
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:11,644
How do you like my new ear?

387
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,981
Dear viewers, I'll be a good host
and really listen to you!

388
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:17,683
Let me pick my ear.

389
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,687
Finished. It's all done.

390
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:25,824
I don't even need a knife to prep this.

391
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:27,426
I just do it with my hands.

392
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,528
That's worthy of an ambassador.

393
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,729
Shall we taste it?

394
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,331
Sure. How do you eat it?

395
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,233
This guy kept calling out to me.

396
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,901
But this one chose you.

397
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,236
SNAP

398
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,204
This one looks like it's curious.

399
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,074
It also looks like an ear.

400
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,509
It looks like it's alive.

401
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:45,544
Or is it a nose?

402
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,646
-How is the smell?
-It smells…

403
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:48,714
I think it just farted.

404
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,182
TRUE IDENTITY REVEALED

405
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:53,352
Before, it was like
a sneaky fart leaking out.

406
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,420
Now it's exploded.

407
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,155
LIBERATED

408
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:57,723
Cheers.

409
00:15:58,524 --> 00:15:59,925
This part tastes better.

410
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,193
RECOMMENDS THE TIP

411
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,227
-Here I go.
-Let's go.

412
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,336
This durian is delicious.

413
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,740
NERVOUS

414
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,243
-It's good.
-Really?

415
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,144
Yeah!

416
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,913
THRILLED

417
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,847
Really good.

418
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,115
I knew you'd like it.

419
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,616
Yeah. It's delicious.

420
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,185
-But…
-The fart smell?

421
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,553
Is it supposed to feel this way?

422
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,289
-Yes, it's super smooth.
-It just melts in your mouth.

423
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:31,924
-Just like butter.
-Exactly!

424
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,560
So if you bake it with cheese on top,
like sweet potatoes,

425
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,428
it tastes way better.

426
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,063
-This is amazing.
-Right?

427
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,631
Durians are actually tasty.

428
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:40,532
It's misunderstood.

429
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:43,836
Lately, you see a lot of stores
selling durians in Korea.

430
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,838
-It's tasty.
-Right?

431
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:47,473
I'm relieved.

432
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,508
Why was I so blinded by the smell?

433
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,111
-You'll like it now.
-Yes, it's better now.

434
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,780
Maybe it smelled weird before
because I wasn't used to it.

435
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,782
I can't stop.

436
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:58,317
LOVIN' IT

437
00:16:58,384 --> 00:16:59,218
-Good?
-Yeah.

438
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:03,022
For a while, my fans told me
to stop talking about durians.

439
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:05,157
They could smell it through their phones.

440
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,495
That made me so sad.

441
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,131
RELIEVED THAT NOONA LIKES IT

442
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,299
(BRAGGING)

443
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,469
It's good!

444
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,105
-I guess I turned you into a fan.
-Yes.

445
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,640
WELCOME, FELLOW DURIAN FAN

446
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,142
Now I get why people like durians.

447
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,676
No other fruit can replace it.

448
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:26,645
-Yes.
-It has a unique texture.

449
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,014
-It's really good, isn't it?
-It really is.

450
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,416
CHOMP

451
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:31,817
So good.

452
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,819
Eating it is quite an undertaking though.

453
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:34,787
What is an undertaking?

454
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,021
It takes some effort.

455
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,956
Split it open, pull the inside out…

456
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,626
Splitting it open
actually relieves your stress.

457
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:41,627
-It does?
-Yeah.

458
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:44,696
Now that we've eaten the figs

459
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:47,166
and even the durian you brought as a gift,

460
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,068
it's time to head for a proper meal.

461
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,203
-All right!
-Thank you.

462
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,671
20-MIN DRIVE TO JANGSANRI PUJUGAN

463
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,640
When did you graduate from university?

464
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:55,641
I didn't.

465
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,376
That's why I think you're awesome.

466
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:58,577
-You graduated.
-Yes.

467
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:01,180
1ST IN COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAMS,
HAO WENT ON TO MAJOR IN EDUCATION

468
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,849
-First place in the entrance exams?
-Yes. First place.

469
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,951
I majored in music education.

470
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:09,321
I ranked first overall, combining
both the skills test and the written test.

471
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,457
Even more impressive
that you took the skills test.

472
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,626
Did you want to become
a teacher back then?

473
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:15,694
Yes, totally.

474
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,830
That was my plan,
then I got roped into this.

475
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,833
Roped into this?
Were you scouted on the street?

476
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,768
On social media.

477
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,236
-Social media?
-Yes.

478
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:29,308
I came to Korea
thinking of it as going to school.

479
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,643
Here, I could learn to dance and sing.

480
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,146
And I was really into K-pop too.

481
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:37,149
And you even ended up debuting.

482
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,785
You never know where life will take you.

483
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:40,853
True.

484
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,522
I guess fate has brought you here.

485
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,758
Now you're an idol,
shooting in Yeongam, Korea.

486
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:47,893
I know. I'm in Yeongam.

487
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,628
Picking figs with a stranger.

488
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:50,896
You're not a stranger.

489
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:51,797
DISAPPOINTED

490
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:52,698
I used to be.

491
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,667
Our paths crossed so many times.

492
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,069
How cute.

493
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,737
People adore you, don't they?

494
00:18:58,804 --> 00:18:59,638
Yes.

495
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:02,374
Any Chinese you'd like to teach Do-yeon?

496
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:03,509
You can teach me.

497
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:05,477
Chinese?

498
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,946
I can't think of anything funnier
than xi fa shui.

499
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:09,214
That's not true!

500
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:12,351
"Shampoo" in Chinese is…

501
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:13,252
What is it?

502
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:15,921
Do-yeon, you know some Chinese.

503
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:16,822
You do?

504
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:17,723
Hey.

505
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:19,491
Good morning.

506
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:21,760
Why are you angry?

507
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,230
RAISED HER VOICE TO SHOW OFF

508
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,131
Sorry.

509
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:27,666
"Good morning. Pretty."

510
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,235
"Two beers, please."

511
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,804
-You learned this in Harbin?
-Yeah.

512
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,273
"Thank you. I'm sorry."

513
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:35,941
"You're welcome."

514
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,075
Hey, you know a lot.

515
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:38,210
AND THAT'S ABOUT IT

516
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,212
Even though we only picked one row,

517
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:44,283
we still got to work at the fig farm
and experience it for ourselves.

518
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,351
Now we enjoy a proper meal.

519
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:49,688
-Yeongam is also famous for Hanu beef.
-Hanu?

520
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,557
HAO'S MUKBANG IN THE LAND OF HANU

521
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:53,559
-Hi.
-Hello!

522
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:55,294
Take your pick.

523
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,461
MANY CUTS TO CHOOSE FROM

524
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,629
I love chuck flap tail.

525
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:58,931
Chuck flap tail, it is.

526
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:00,599
HAO'S FAVORITE HANU CUT

527
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,234
You should pick one too.

528
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,302
-Me?
-Yes.

529
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,771
Then I'll have the most expensive one.

530
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:07,673
Bougie.

531
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,041
That's 77,990 won.

532
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:11,710
Pretty noona who always buys me food!

533
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,646
Hey! Stop it!

534
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,215
Not always. This is the first time.

535
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:17,549
Thank you.

536
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:18,884
BAG SPOTTED

537
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,152
Nice bag you got there.

538
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,055
Let me take a look at it.

539
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:24,089
-Take a look?
-Yeah.

540
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,490
I won't look inside.

541
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,625
-You can.
-Pretty.

542
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,694
Are you up for What's In My Bag?

543
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,962
-What's In My Bag?
-Yeah.

544
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,331
Zhang Hao's What's In My Bag?

545
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,433
These are toothpaste and a toothbrush.

546
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,101
For Hao's dental health.

547
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,770
-What do we have here?
-Shampoo.

548
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,307
Shampoo, aka xi fa shui.

549
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:45,310
-And this is my iPhone 6.
-A phone.

550
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,745
FOR TAKING PICTURES

551
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,480
-And my card holder.
-How simple.

552
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,015
It's a Gucci.

553
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,551
-Is this a custom add-on?
-Yes, it is.

554
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,922
DIRECTOR HAO NEVER WASTES HIS TIME

555
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,190
What are you filming?

556
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,092
-This is fun.
-It's fun?

557
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:02,227
-Yes.
-You know how to entertain yourself.

558
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:03,629
You know what?

559
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:08,200
It makes no sense that I'm chatting
with Jang Do-yeon right now.

560
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,535
-Why is that?
-Because you are a top talent.

561
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,037
-Please stop!
-I'm serious.

562
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,339
SIDE DISHES SERVED AT PERFECT TIMING

563
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:15,507
Thank you.

564
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,442
-What's this?
-What's this one?

565
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:18,977
Braised mushrooms.

566
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:21,847
-Is it a side dish that's also a sauce?
-Yes.

567
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:25,117
-Acorn jelly. I love acorn jelly.
-Me too.

568
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:26,585
FULL OF FAVORITE SIDE DISHES

569
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:31,823
NOONA FIRST

570
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:32,958
-A gentleman.
-Of course.

571
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:37,062
I'm doing that too.

572
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:39,765
-That's "eight."
-Eight?

573
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:41,733
I heard Chinese people love
the number eight.

574
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,634
Yes.

575
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:47,172
In Chinese, "eight" is pronounced
like the letter "bal."

576
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,841
-"Bal"?
-There is this word, baljae.

577
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:52,411
It means "to become wealthy."

578
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,612
Hence, the number eight?

579
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,047
SYMBOL OF LUCK AND PROSPERITY

580
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:58,483
I heard that is why
G-Dragon is so loved in China.

581
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,353
He has a lot to do with eight.
He was even born in 1988.

582
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,421
That's right.

583
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,789
I met him earlier.

584
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:06,224
-Where?
-The café next door. TheVenti.

585
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,093
-He's in their ad.
-Oh, you met him like that?

586
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,095
SO YOU DIDN'T REALLY "MEET" HIM…

587
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,297
I met Son Heung-min yesterday.

588
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,832
-At Mega Coffee?
-At Mega Coffee.

589
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,535
Thank you so much!

590
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:17,769
Thanks for humoring me.

591
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,071
I won't ever leave you behind.

592
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:22,007
You were so quick to play along.
A top talent for real.

593
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:24,076
Nah, it's all about action and reaction.

594
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:25,143
TOP MC GIVING OUT TIPS

595
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:27,546
-Thank you.
-Hi.

596
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,282
Looks amazing!

597
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,284
-Let me.
-That's okay.

598
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:34,619
That sounded really fake.

599
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,821
BUSTED

600
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:38,323
I'm not really good at grilling meat.

601
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,624
I'll do my best.

602
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,728
Medium, rare, or well-done?

603
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:44,563
-Rare, please.
-Rare?

604
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:45,964
You can have this.

605
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:48,200
Too silly?

606
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,108
You're no better than me, are you?

607
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:57,342
NOD

608
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,277
Just let me do it already!

609
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:02,314
MESSY

610
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:04,683
GIMME THOSE TONGS

611
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,017
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

612
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:07,953
Wait, let's grill our own meat.

613
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:10,922
Okay. It's a competition.

614
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:12,858
Yeah. A competition.

615
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:14,059
Thanks.

616
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:15,227
This one's overcooked.

617
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:16,762
Oh no. Save it!

618
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:17,763
(SAVE ME)

619
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:21,566
RESCUED BEFORE IT BURNED

620
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:22,968
I'll leave it on the edge.

621
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:25,937
You're doing a good job.

622
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:27,038
-Right?
-Yeah.

623
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,840
Show me what "rare" means to you.

624
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,776
A little more cooked than this.

625
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:34,079
-This one should be good for you, then.
-Thanks.

626
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:37,282
-You should eat.
-Let's dig in.

627
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:39,951
YUM

628
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,588
Wow, that's good.

629
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,290
YUM

630
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:49,394
-It's very tender.
-Yeah, it is.

631
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:50,962
Dip it in the mushroom sauce.

632
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,397
Me too.

633
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:01,273
This should be served in Seoul too.

634
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:03,041
Yeah. It's really sweet.

635
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,543
Strong mushroom smell.

636
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,144
Can we have naengmyeon?

637
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:07,946
-Naengmyeon? Sure.
-Yes.

638
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:09,347
Thanks.

639
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,083
One naengmyeon, please.

640
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,852
-One?
-Yes, one.

641
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,321
Oh yeah! Thank you.

642
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,523
UNUSUALLY BIG PILE OF VEGGIES

643
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,193
-Looks a lot like mulhoe.
-Yeah.

644
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,461
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

645
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:24,362
(NOONA FIRST)

646
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:25,530
Thanks.

647
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:26,731
Delicious.

648
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,268
The texture's way off
from Seoul naengmyeon.

649
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:32,838
They kind of look like buckwheat noodles.

650
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:33,738
Yes.

651
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:36,174
Do you like naengmyeon?

652
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:37,309
I love naengmyeon.

653
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:41,480
When I first came to Korea and tried it,
it felt kind of strange.

654
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:42,447
-Naengmyeon?
-Yes.

655
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:44,683
But there is the Chinese-style naengmyeon.

656
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:47,319
-That's Korean Chinese.
-It was Koreanized?

657
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:48,320
Yes.

658
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,896
-It's buckwheat.
-Right.

659
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:00,665
-It really is a different naengmyeon.
-So good!

660
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:01,833
SLURP

661
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:06,538
So many veggies.

662
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:09,040
(LOST IN THE FOOD)

663
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:10,775
This is the dish of the day.

664
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:11,843
-Is it?
-Yeah.

665
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:20,752
It's really good.

666
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:22,621
DON'T FORGET THE MEAT

667
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,090
Love to see you eat so well.
Let me know if you want seconds.

668
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:28,360
We've got to try the yukhoe.

669
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:29,995
It'd go well with the naengmyeon.

670
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:31,329
EXCITED

671
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:32,797
Thank you!

672
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,333
THE LONG-AWAITED YUKHOE MAKES ITS ENTRANCE

673
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,602
-Sweet.
-You can wrap it in the seaweed.

674
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:39,037
Or dip it in sesame oil sauce.

675
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:39,938
GLOSSY

676
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,940
It looks very fresh.

677
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,009
I bet it's delicious.

678
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,950
-Hey!
-Is it good?

679
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:53,885
-Too good.
-You're angry again.

680
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:57,022
WITH PEAR AND BIBIM SAUCE

681
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:58,623
Yukhoe was the real deal.

682
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:59,858
OPEN WIDE

683
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:01,626
It's so fresh.

684
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:05,096
It's super fresh.
There's no meat smell at all.

685
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,832
GASP-INDUCING FRESHNESS

686
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,334
And the sauce is remarkable.

687
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,403
SPECIAL BIBIM SAUCE MADE WITH YEONGAM FIG

688
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:15,440
ONE DIP IN THE SAUCE LEAVES YOU MESMERIZED

689
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:16,508
So good.

690
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,376
You can wrap it in gamtae too.

691
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:21,513
How does it taste?

692
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:24,716
Wanna know?

693
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:25,984
(IT'S A SECRET)

694
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:27,352
CHOMP

695
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:32,724
I'm glad we ordered yukhoe.

696
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,326
THE BEST DECISION TODAY

697
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:35,594
Gotta try it this way.

698
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,663
FAIL-PROOF COMBO
YUKHOE ON NAENGMYEON

699
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,899
I heard you love ticking off
must-eat places.

700
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:43,168
Yes, I love it so much.

701
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:44,836
-I'll show you something.
-Okay.

702
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,104
-Just a sec.
-Yeah.

703
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,206
Eating comes first.

704
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:54,012
So good.

705
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,681
-Do you have a list?
-Yes, look.

706
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,621
Are these the places you've been to?

707
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:06,992
I've been to some,
and I'll check out the rest someday.

708
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:09,427
I've never seen a map packed so tightly.

709
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:13,365
There are tons marked around Hongdae.
There's plenty in Gangnam.

710
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:16,134
I've saved spots in every region.

711
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:17,902
Hey, Hongdae is swarming!

712
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,304
Look at all these spots.

713
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:20,672
FULL OF MUST-EAT PLACES

714
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:24,376
When I'm getting my hair and makeup done
or can't fall asleep,

715
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:26,711
I scroll through them one by one.

716
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:29,514
"I'm gonna go here someday. Here too."

717
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,650
-So you just daydream about it?
-Ye.

718
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:34,019
-This is pure gold.
-Right?

719
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:35,620
-Yeah.
-I'll share it with you.

720
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:36,888
That would be awesome.

721
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:38,623
TRAPPED IN FOODIE HAO'S GOURMET MAP

722
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,558
You're like a cartographer.

723
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:41,459
It's all here.

724
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:43,495
I just love good food.

725
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:47,298
Since you're serious about food,
what's your standard for a good spot?

726
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:49,501
First, is it private enough?

727
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:50,769
Second,

728
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:53,972
is it something
you can't find anywhere else?

729
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,640
Those are my standards.

730
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:57,876
-Is this a thing in Korea too?
-What is?

731
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:01,813
The more run-down the place,
the more delicious the food.

732
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,481
It's a thing in China.

733
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:06,985
These places are called "fly restaurants."

734
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:08,186
What is that?

735
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:11,056
It means restaurants
with flies buzzing around.

736
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:12,991
A COMPLIMENT FOR SERVING AMAZING FOOD

737
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:14,859
-Because no one comes?
-Nope.

738
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:17,662
The smell's so tempting,
even flies line up.

739
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:20,165
So even the flies can't resist their food?

740
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:21,099
Yes.

741
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:25,003
That's why we say
we have to find a fly restaurant.

742
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,738
It's a good thing to say.

743
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:30,809
You can look up "fly restaurant" online.

744
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,277
This is what I'm talking about.

745
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:33,344
AWESOME VIBE

746
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:34,612
Hey, it's beautiful!

747
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:37,148
Doesn't it look delicious?
That's what shows up.

748
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,384
-It's got a nice mood to it.
-Yeah.

749
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,352
It's straight out of a movie.

750
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,322
Noona, I'm done eating.

751
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,824
CLOSING LINE OUT OF NOWHERE

752
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,860
Since when did you become
such talk-show material?

753
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:50,995
Since Salon Drip 2.

754
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,566
I really started wanting it.
I'm not just saying that.

755
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:58,870
For the first time, it made me think,
"Maybe I've got talent for this."

756
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,271
-Did it?
-Yeah.

757
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,408
-I'm good at this, aren't I?
-You?

758
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:06,878
Back then, during that shoot,
I thought you were an unpolished stone.

759
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,880
I felt like I'd discovered you.

760
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:11,616
But the truth is,
you were already a cut diamond.

761
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:16,221
I just happened to see you
at the right time.

762
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:21,493
I actually heard variety show producers
have their eyes on you these days.

763
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:22,393
TOUCHED

764
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,695
-It's true.
-Thank you.

765
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,130
-So…
-Yes?

766
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:26,798
Now that we're done eating,

767
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,199
let's hit the café.

768
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:32,370
No, we're going
to Wolchulsan Mountain now.

769
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,073
It's time to go hiking.

770
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,375
Go hiking right after eating?

771
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,043
Let's do that!

772
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:43,248
All right, now that we're full,
let's head to Wolchulsan Mountain.

773
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:44,983
-Three, two, one.
-Poof!

774
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,252
THIS ISN'T WOLCHULSAN MOUNTAIN

775
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:49,020
We're at Wolyo Café.

776
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:53,191
My bag arrived a bit late. Where's yours?

777
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:54,192
It got here before me.

778
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:56,995
Mine's more expensive.

779
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,197
So it moves faster.

780
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:00,331
INSANE JOKE CATCH

781
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,902
I can't win against you.

782
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,970
-That was nice and quick, huh?
-Yeah.

783
00:30:06,037 --> 00:30:07,872
People might think we took a cab here.

784
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:09,607
Right? That was crazy.

785
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:10,675
-Wasn't it?
-Yeah.

786
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:13,111
Can we teleport
when we go hiking later too?

787
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:14,646
No editing on the mountain.

788
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,481
OH BOY

789
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:17,949
I thought you were Sun Wukong.

790
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:19,918
-Riding a cloud and all.
-I am not.

791
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,220
Let's go and order our drinks.

792
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:23,488
Okay.

793
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:27,659
We'll have one grapefruit soda,
one Wolyo coffee,

794
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:29,460
a slice of Basque cheesecake,

795
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:32,463
black sesame cake,
and Earl Grey cake, please.

796
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:34,465
Thank you.

797
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:36,601
-Oh my!
-It's so pretty!

798
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,437
-This is made of wood. It's not edible.
-Okay.

799
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,006
I have to take a picture.

800
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,808
PHONE SHE GOT FROM HAO

801
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,177
It's beautiful.

802
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:48,680
-Thank you.
-Earl Grey cake.

803
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,316
TRIPLE CAKE COMBO SERVED

804
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:53,585
Hey, I wasn't expecting this.

805
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:56,187
Look at this. It's cute.

806
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:58,289
Teach me how Gen Z takes photos.

807
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,624
Gen Z? All right.

808
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,327
Grab your knife and fork.

809
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:05,263
Then just give a strong wink like this.

810
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,965
DID YOU JUST SAY "WINK"?

811
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,468
I have to wink?

812
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,270
Not if you don't want to.

813
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:13,338
I'll try.

814
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:15,373
I'll just pretend that I'm really tired.

815
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:18,843
GETTING INTO IT

816
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,145
-I'm sick! I'm tired!
-You're winking right now.

817
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,547
I AM?

818
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:25,783
WHAT IT MEANS TO KEEP UP WITH GEN Z

819
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:26,718
Take a look.

820
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,753
It came out well.

821
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,556
I look as if I'm ill.

822
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:35,894
It looks pretty good. Not bad at all.

823
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,263
Now your turn. Show me how it's done.

824
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,199
You have to take it from above.

825
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:42,734
From here.

826
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,369
You didn't take mine like that.

827
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:46,671
-I did!
-You did? Sorry.

828
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:49,974
How come you look good, no matter what?

829
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:53,411
GEN Z WANNABE DESPERATELY DOING HER BEST

830
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:58,082
Cute. Three, two, one.

831
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:00,785
Come on, where's the wink?

832
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:02,220
Oh my!

833
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:03,488
ANYONE ASKED FOR AN IDOL?

834
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:04,923
Idols are on another level.

835
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,357
Show me.

836
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:09,027
-Don't inspect me.
-I'm not…

837
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:11,029
Good, isn't it?

838
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,096
BEYOND EXPECTATIONS

839
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:13,564
This is my new profile pic.

840
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:14,766
-Really?
-Yeah.

841
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:17,602
I think your picture is better than mine.

842
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,070
It's because you're in it.

843
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:21,773
It's the model that counts.

844
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:24,042
So cute!

845
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:26,544
SNIFF

846
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:30,415
So, when do we actually start
the real conversation?

847
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:32,116
What time is it now?

848
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:34,118
-It's 3:30 p.m.
-Right.

849
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:36,120
Did we meet at 8:30 in the morning?

850
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:38,022
-Yes.
-That means…

851
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:40,158
We've been shooting for seven hours.

852
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:42,994
The real conversation will begin at 5 p.m.

853
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,364
-This show has the longest openings.
-Still one and a half hours to go.

854
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:47,865
Having fun?

855
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:50,134
I've already put
my whole life story out there.

856
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:51,803
I don't think so.

857
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:52,937
There's more.

858
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:55,039
Then I'd have no story left to tell.

859
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:57,842
You can tell it again.
Hey, I'm not gonna force you.

860
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:00,345
Then I'll keep quiet
for the rest of the day.

861
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:01,546
That's totally fine.

862
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:03,181
Do your thing. Play games or something.

863
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:07,018
I should check
what people are saying about me.

864
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:10,154
It's been a while since I last looked up
articles about myself.

865
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:12,090
-I always look myself up.
-Really?

866
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,624
The latest article about me?

867
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:17,095
The last article I remember
said I stole my friend's bag.

868
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,163
JANG DO-YEON STEALS
PARK NA-RAE'S DESIGNER BAG

869
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,999
DID JANG DO-YEON ROB PARK NA-RAE'S HOUSE?

870
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:22,467
I think I read about this.

871
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,068
I don't usually read articles,

872
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:27,071
but the algorithm threw one
about me in my face.

873
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:30,008
It was so absurd I just went,
"Whatever," and ignored it.

874
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:33,578
When that happened, I was shooting
a commercial with the production team.

875
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:36,514
I was like, "Hilarious!
Look what they're accusing me of!"

876
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:38,249
I was laughing so hard.

877
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:40,985
Then I returned after a ten-minute break,

878
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:42,620
and the air felt different.

879
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,989
So I asked, "Is something wrong?"

880
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:48,326
I thought there was an issue
with the shoot.

881
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:51,896
"The thing is, Do-yeon,
my mom just called me."

882
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:54,032
"She asked if you're the robber."

883
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:56,234
Obviously, her mother knew
she was working with me.

884
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,437
So during that short break,
a lot of the staff got worried calls.

885
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:00,972
FAKE NEWS SPREAD LIKE WILDFIRE

886
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,807
They thought I'd rob their kid.

887
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:04,942
"Keep your eye on your bag."

888
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:08,079
If I were a parent, I'd have worried, too,

889
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:11,215
if my kid's colleague got caught up
in that kind of trouble.

890
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:12,683
You didn't do it, did you?

891
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:16,454
You saw me checking out your Gucci bag.

892
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,858
We'd barely met
for a split second this morning,

893
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:22,593
and you spotted my bag right away.

894
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:24,429
Nice bag you got there.

895
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:27,398
DO-YEON SHOWED UNUSUAL INTEREST
IN HAO'S BAG

896
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,367
You should check
if that's really your bag.

897
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,072
There were some funny rumors.

898
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:36,874
"She teamed up with Han Hye-jin to steal."

899
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:39,710
"She went with her ex and stole it."

900
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,849
What were they even talking about?

901
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,250
So, Hao,

902
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:49,520
remember that life throws
all kinds of things at you.

903
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,823
I didn't see that one coming at all.

904
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,825
Sheesh, I need a smoke.

905
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:58,930
Wherever I go,
something always ticks me off.

906
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:01,499
I told you not to do that!

907
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,234
Do you even know how old I am?

908
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:06,370
A robber? Me?
I've never stolen a thing in my life.

909
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:08,673
OH DEAR, NOONA…

910
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,608
Take care of those fancy cameras.

911
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:13,211
IMPOSSIBLE TO COOL DOWN

912
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,378
Are you into investing?

913
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,279
-Investing?
-Yes.

914
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:16,481
Any money management?

915
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:18,483
I don't do any of that stuff.

916
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:20,751
I just put everything in the bank.

917
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:23,321
-Me too. But I'm thinking about starting.
-Same.

918
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:26,124
I'm thinking of switching to another visa

919
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:29,560
so I can start a business in Korea.

920
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,262
-What kind of business?
-Hot pot.

921
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:33,431
-Serious?
-Totally serious.

922
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,199
When did you start planning this?

923
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:36,100
Yesterday.

924
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:40,037
Did you whip that up for today's shoot?

925
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:40,938
IS THIS A JOKE?

926
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:46,511
No. Yesterday,
I talked with Yuqi, and she said,

927
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:50,915
"I've always wanted to open
a hot pot place."

928
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,584
"Want me to make a presentation
and send it over?"

929
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,953
So you've always had it on your mind?

930
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,890
Yes. As you know, Haidilao blew up here.

931
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:01,292
But they don't have a shop in Sangam yet.

932
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:03,961
-Broadcasting stations are there.
-Many stations.

933
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:05,630
It'd be a success, don't you think?

934
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,199
That's quite a detailed plan.

935
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:09,467
Will you…

936
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,203
invest in me?

937
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,338
I'll send you my presentation.

938
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:15,239
QUITE EAGER

939
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,141
Will I have to pay a lot of money?

940
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:18,509
Yes.

941
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:22,780
Is this why you've been talking
about money all along?

942
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,583
I think it'd do well.

943
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:26,517
-Right?
-Yeah.

944
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:29,020
You seem to think about your future a lot.

945
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:31,088
Because I can't be a celebrity forever.

946
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:33,624
-How long do you want it to last?
-Me?

947
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:37,328
I want to do it as long as I have my fans.

948
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:40,731
As long as there are fans who love me,
I'll keep going.

949
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:44,535
So it's not about having work or not,
but about having fans?

950
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:45,536
Yes.

951
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,305
-How about you?
-Me?

952
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,974
I don't think I can keep doing this
for much longer.

953
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,342
But you already did.

954
00:36:57,481 --> 00:37:00,084
That's right.
I've been doing this for a long time.

955
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,653
How long, may I ask?

956
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,428
-It's my 19th year.
-Nineteenth?

957
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:12,296
That's older than me.

958
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,699
You? What are you on about?

959
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:16,000
You were born in 2000.

960
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,069
-Who told you that?
-The Internet.

961
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,005
Don't even try to fool me.

962
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,006
Start eating.

963
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,274
ENOUGH PLAYING AROUND

964
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:25,810
Do you like dessert?

965
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,712
Hey, you know what's delicious?

966
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:28,779
Towel cake.

967
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:31,415
Can you show me what it is?

968
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:32,850
Did you say "tower"?

969
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:33,918
Towel cake.

970
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:35,920
I see it all the time on TikTok.

971
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:38,456
What is that?
Your algorithm is a bit weird.

972
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:41,359
My algorithm? You'd think I'm Chinese!

973
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:44,595
Didn't I tell you
about Ryang Jin-hee Chicken Feet?

974
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:47,164
Recently, my algorithm has been showing me

975
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:49,367
Ryang Jin-hee Chicken Feet.

976
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,736
She's from North Korea.

977
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:53,004
Here it is.

978
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,138
Towel cake.

979
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,174
-Noona.
-Is it famous?

980
00:37:57,241 --> 00:38:00,111
-I know a place in Korea that makes this.
-Where?

981
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:02,246
Tell me.

982
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:04,482
I'll have it delivered to you.

983
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:06,150
Hao.

984
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:07,151
TOUCHED

985
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:08,486
-For real?
-Yeah.

986
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:11,322
I'll invest in you.

987
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,793
CONGRATULATIONS
SUCCESSFUL FUNDING SECURED

988
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,695
Thanks, but I can't accept it.

989
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:21,632
So, is this towel cake a famous dessert?

990
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:22,533
Yeah.

991
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:27,204
-This world is full of good desserts.
-I know.

992
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:31,275
I've been really hooked on
TikTok challenges lately.

993
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:33,377
You've got a bunch of famous ones.

994
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:35,012
-You've seen it?
-Yeah.

995
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:37,014
You were spinning your head in one.

996
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:39,483
And there's one with crazy views.

997
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,951
There's the phone call challenge.

998
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:43,821
You have to make
a phone-call gesture to the beat.

999
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:49,126
SUPER ADDICTIVE PHONE CALL CHALLENGE
WITH 10 MILLION VIEWS

1000
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:51,729
-How is it done?
-Like this.

1001
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:53,130
Do this first.

1002
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:54,732
Shake it. That's it.

1003
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:56,801
Extend your arm,
then bring it to your ear.

1004
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:58,402
HAO'S ONE-ON-ONE LESSON

1005
00:38:58,469 --> 00:38:59,970
And then, bam bam.

1006
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:01,839
-Bam bam.
-Bam bam.

1007
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:03,040
-Bam bam.
-Bam bam.

1008
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:04,642
-Bam bam.
-And then…

1009
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,510
Boom boom.

1010
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:08,312
Boom boom.

1011
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:10,981
You have to do a sexy wave.

1012
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:12,750
Do I have to?

1013
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,020
Okay, I'll try. Boom boom.

1014
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:17,154
You're doing well.

1015
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:19,390
FROM THE TOP

1016
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:22,193
STEP 1: BAM BAM

1017
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:23,127
STEP 2: INHALE

1018
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,795
STEP 3: BOOM BOOM

1019
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,698
You got it.
Can you do it without the music?

1020
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:29,300
-Yeah.
-Let's record it together.

1021
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,868
-Sure.
-That's one of my wishes.

1022
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:32,937
-Okay.
-I'll add music to it.

1023
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:34,505
-And send it to you later.
-Great.

1024
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:36,240
You have a lot to do after this trip.

1025
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:40,211
Order a towel cake.

1026
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:41,479
Send the presentation.

1027
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:44,115
And edit the challenge video.

1028
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:45,716
Basically, the trip never ends.

1029
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:47,051
-Right?
-I love it.

1030
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:48,786
I'll go, "Five, six, seven, eight!"

1031
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:50,054
THE REAL PRACTICE BEGINS

1032
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:51,389
-Seven, eight!
-Reach out.

1033
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:53,791
-Oh, is it this hand?
-Yes, your right hand.

1034
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,061
Bam bam.

1035
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:58,329
Bam bam.

1036
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:00,731
You've got talent.

1037
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:02,166
Bam bam.

1038
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:03,667
I'm not stupid.

1039
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,102
DO-YEONNIE
JENNIE OF WANDO

1040
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:07,338
Five, six, seven, eight.

1041
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,541
-Bam bam.
-Bam bam.

1042
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:12,276
-What next?
-Bam bam.

1043
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:13,177
Bam bam.

1044
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,685
-Final rehearsal.
-All right.

1045
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:22,686
Ready, go.

1046
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:33,731
-Nailed it on the first try!
-We shouldn't have rehearsed.

1047
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:35,366
-Do it one more time, Do-yeon.
-Okay.

1048
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,634
-Do-yeon?
-Noona!

1049
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:39,703
THAT WAS SMOOTH

1050
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,505
-You're my student for now, so…
-Yeah.

1051
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:43,207
-No, it's okay.
-I forgot.

1052
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,909
I told you earlier it's okay. Sorry.

1053
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:45,910
What a boomer.

1054
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:48,045
You did say that. Is this a boomer move?

1055
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,647
Yes. I'm sorry.

1056
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:51,682
-Again.
-One more time.

1057
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:53,184
THE REAL CHALLENGE STARTS

1058
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:02,460
When am I supposed to do this dance?
Can I just do it anytime?

1059
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:04,628
-When you celebrate.
-Celebrate?

1060
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:08,532
For example,
when one of your videos blows up,

1061
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,602
"Oh! I did it!"

1062
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:13,003
"Hey, this is delicious!"

1063
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:15,039
"So tasty!"

1064
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:19,710
-Do you have an account?
-What account?

1065
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:21,378
-TikTok.
-I'm not on TikTok.

1066
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:22,646
I'm on Instagram.

1067
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:25,282
You do? Then post it on Instagram.

1068
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:26,183
Okay…

1069
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,184
RELUCTANT

1070
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:28,085
You'll send it to me?

1071
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,488
Do this for me, not the investment.

1072
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:32,389
-Are you sure?
-Good?

1073
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:33,824
Even better.

1074
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:35,626
How many followers does she have?

1075
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:39,997
How many do you expect?
I have less than a million.

1076
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:40,998
About 900,000.

1077
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:43,167
-About 900,000?
-No, it's less than that.

1078
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:44,635
-Will that do?
-It's perfect.

1079
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:46,904
-I don't even have an account.
-You don't?

1080
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:49,440
-Okay, I'll post it on mine.
-Thank you.

1081
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,674
-You will?
-It's good for me.

1082
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:52,510
But what if your account is…

1083
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:54,111
-I mean, on Instagram…
-Yes?

1084
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:58,349
Some users curate their feed
so that it sticks to a certain mood.

1085
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:02,453
I'm worried that our video
might ruin the mood of your feed.

1086
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,688
Don't worry. Mine doesn't have any mood.

1087
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:05,890
Can I check it out?

1088
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:08,325
Don't do this to me.

1089
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:10,628
Should I look up "Jang Do-yeon"?

1090
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:13,531
What did I even post?

1091
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:18,269
I'm not sure.

1092
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:21,105
Good, there's no mood.
You can post our video.

1093
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,709
"There's no mood."

1094
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,678
I said it first, but…

1095
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,447
To hear it from you, it's…

1096
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:32,483
How embarrassing.

1097
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:35,986
What's your dopamine boost these days?

1098
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,988
Dopamine boost? I wanna know yours.

1099
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,291
-What's your dopamine boost?
-My boost?

1100
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:41,292
Is it me?

1101
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,195
Nice! Got something for the teaser.

1102
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:47,631
(2ND EPISODE WITH ZHANG HAO
TEASER COMING UP)

1103
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:49,767
-I have many dopamine boosts.
-Expensive bags?

1104
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:52,069
I SWEAR, I'M NOT A THIEF

1105
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:54,004
One second.

1106
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:55,973
THIS IS HER CHANCE!

1107
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,842
I finally got my hands on the Gucci bag!

1108
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:02,379
I'm totally hooked on short dramas
and over-the-top storylines.

1109
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:04,348
DRAWS DO-YEON'S ATTENTION

1110
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:06,617
WHAT DID I JUST SEE?

1111
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:08,519
THE TWO BUDDIES ACT OUT

1112
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,021
SCENES BURSTING WITH THRILLS

1113
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,222
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

1114
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:13,857
Please take her phone away.

1115
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,359
This is my dopamine boost!

1116
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,428
Give me something stronger!

1117
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:18,896
NOW IT'S TIME

1118
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:19,964
FOR THE REAL TALK

1119
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:20,864
"Hi, Hao!"

1120
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:21,765
WITH OCTOPUSES?

1121
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:24,335
In one bite?

1122
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:25,803
You don't have to try so hard.

1123
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:28,272
REALITY CHECK

1124
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:31,342
HAO'S EATING SKEWERED OCTOPUS!

1125
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:32,810
OCTOPUS AMBASSADOR FROM TODAY

1126
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:35,179
TASTES SO GOOD

1127
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:38,048
THE TIME HAS COME TO WRAP UP ANOTHER TRIP

1128
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,084
Will our paths cross again?

1129
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,452
I'm touched.

1130
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:43,253
You moved me more than anyone else.

1131
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,855
-More than the octopus?
-Yes.

1132
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:46,523
What do you mean, the octopus?

1133
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:47,558
Sorry!
