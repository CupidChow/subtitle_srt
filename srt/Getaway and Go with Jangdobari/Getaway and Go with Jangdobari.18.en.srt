1
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:05,839
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

2
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:07,807
Today, I greet you in Buyeo.

3
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:08,875
JANGDOBARI ARRIVES IN BUYEO

4
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:10,810
A travel buddy will join me today.

5
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:11,945
HIS LOOKS SHINE
EVEN BEHIND A FAN

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,480
ACTOR YIM SI-WAN

7
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:14,881
The theme of this trip

8
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:17,150
is a walk through Buyeo with Yim Si-wan.

9
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:19,185
THEY MAKE A WISH AT THE LOTUS POND

10
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:22,055
People around me say
my personality is a little unusual.

11
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:24,557
I hope you'll understand my vibe.

12
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:25,658
-Hey!
-I got it.

13
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:28,361
IS THIS SI-WAN'S VIBE?

14
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,096
It's a mystery I've yet to solve.

15
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:32,365
What counts as better manners?

16
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:36,903
I'll be the one with better manners.

17
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,471
One, two, three, mic test.

18
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:39,773
-One, two, three.
-So annoying.

19
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:41,741
SI-WAN ACTS AND DO-YEON FOLLOWS
CLEANING THE LENS

20
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,510
I should make today
a day of unusually good manners.

21
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:46,546
Are you testing how good manners
might make someone uncomfortable?

22
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:49,616
-Let's go.
-Let's go get our dessert.

23
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:51,251
WHO WILL WIN AT GOOD MANNERS
IN BUYEO?

24
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:52,652
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

25
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,953
The battle of manners is hilarious.

26
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:55,755
The battle of manners.

27
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,858
That sounds like a good concept.

28
00:00:58,925 --> 00:00:59,959
-The battle of manners?
-Yes.

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,030
Just how much politeness
is considered good manners?

30
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:06,066
EPISODE 5
THE BATTLE OF MANNERS

31
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,068
How's the AC for you?

32
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:11,204
What about you?
Should I put it lower? Are you good?

33
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,639
How's your seat?

34
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:13,873
How's your seat belt?

35
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,544
Is the fan too heavy? Are you good?

36
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,312
-Even my fan?
-Are you good with that?

37
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,548
-Isn't your mic heavy?
-I'm fine.

38
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:22,782
IT'S A BATTLE TO LIGHTEN THE LOAD

39
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:23,917
Aren't your earrings heavy?

40
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:25,185
They're fine.

41
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,553
These are the perfect weight.

42
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:28,755
-I was worried they might be heavy.
-I'm good.

43
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:29,989
Are you good?

44
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:31,191
All right, that's good.

45
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,292
I should stay attentive.

46
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:33,793
It's the battle of manners.

47
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:36,863
What beautiful sky we have today.

48
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,865
They say we should
look up at the sky often.

49
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,367
That's right. We should look at the sky.

50
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:45,271
Do-yeon, this is where I came
for my language training.

51
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:46,506
-Really?
-This is the place.

52
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:47,674
Is this the place?

53
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,309
It's this neighborhood.
I remember this street.

54
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,077
What made you decide to come here?

55
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:55,482
When I heard I was filming
a project in Buyeo,

56
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,851
-You thought you'd check it out?
-I felt the urge

57
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:02,856
to listen to the locals speak the dialect.

58
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:06,426
-What did you do while you were here?
-I walked around the neighborhood,

59
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,261
but as you can see, the streets are empty.

60
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,429
I know. The streets are quiet.

61
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,197
-No one's around.
-But…

62
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,333
you visited the city
to listen to the locals talk.

63
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:14,934
-My plan failed miserably.
-So what did you do?

64
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,036
I wandered around for quite a while

65
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:19,706
and even went to the marketplace,

66
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,975
but no one seemed to be outside.

67
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,378
-Do they stay indoors?
-I've been there before.

68
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:26,746
What is that place?

69
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:30,016
-What do they serve?
-I considered the trip a flop

70
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:34,487
and went to get dinner and drinks
at a spot that felt like a tent bar.

71
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:37,157
It was bustling with people, you see.

72
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:40,059
After eating dinner there,

73
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:42,128
I headed to the hotel to sleep.

74
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:43,696
-Did you come here alone?
-Yes.

75
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:44,764
Here's how I spent my day.

76
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,934
I arrived here in the morning,
and walked around town.

77
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,737
-Without a destination in mind?
-But no one was around.

78
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:54,007
I knew I was screwed,
but I got some lunch first.

79
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:57,610
I went to a chicken place nearby
that was open.

80
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,446
It was Hoolala Chicken.

81
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,815
It was run by two owners.

82
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:05,251
Thinking it'd be a good chance
to study the dialect,

83
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:09,155
I deliberately
kept trying to talk to them.

84
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:11,624
-Like, "What's good here?"
-In a dialect?

85
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,294
I asked them what was good here.

86
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,597
"What's a good drink
to have with fried chicken?"

87
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,632
"Could you recommend a drink?"

88
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,402
You spoke in a dialect you could manage.

89
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:25,538
"Try some of our draft beer."

90
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,273
I was like, "It's really good."

91
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,841
-That got me comfortable.
-Really?

92
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,743
I felt like I could talk to them.

93
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:32,378
So I was excited.

94
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,280
"The fried chicken is splendid."

95
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:37,283
"You must've managed the tap quite well."

96
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,018
"It's hard to get beer
to taste this good."

97
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:40,286
You praised their tap?

98
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,923
I kept going like that.

99
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,961
And the owner answered my questions
all excited too.

100
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:51,598
The locals understood the
Chungcheong Province dialect I'd learned.

101
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:55,768
And feeling proud,
I asked for another glass of beer.

102
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:57,670
After finishing lunch,

103
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,640
I went to the owner
and said I was ready to pay.

104
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,342
"How much is everything?"

105
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,643
The owner took my card and said,

106
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,211
"You must be from Seoul."

107
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,115
My face is blushing.

108
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,617
I'm actually embarrassed for you.

109
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,018
I don't think I can look at you.

110
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,624
After that, I couldn't say another word.

111
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,126
I took back my credit card
and left quietly.

112
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,328
ENDING HIS FUN TIME WITH THE DIALECT

113
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:23,396
Goodness.

114
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,698
Another shop opened
where the chicken place used to be.

115
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:29,002
I always wanted to go back there.

116
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,270
What a bummer.

117
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,372
AH…

118
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,375
Maybe we should head to
where that shop was.

119
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,477
The owners could be the same.

120
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,912
That's true.
It could just be a different shop.

121
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,914
-I'd love for it to be them.
-Right.

122
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,416
It'd be nice to see them again.

123
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,484
Let's head there later.

124
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,819
For now, we'll go get some dessert.

125
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:50,023
HURRYING

126
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,557
Are you good? Should I carry you?

127
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,760
I could carry you. How are your legs?

128
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:54,827
Do you need help walking?

129
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,462
-Wait, your purse.
-It's fine.

130
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,398
-That looks heavy.
-No, I'm good.

131
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,566
-Do-yeon, your watch.
-How's the street for you?

132
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,202
Only step where my feet have been.

133
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:05,672
Unbelievable. What's with him?

134
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,775
He's tiring me out by being so polite.

135
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,710
Hello.

136
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,245
What are you getting?

137
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,381
Should I get the tofu-spänner?
I'll have that.

138
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:16,916
One hot Americano, please.

139
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,084
Really?

140
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:22,121
Let's also have the mugwort injeolmi
and Buyeo chestnut sando.

141
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:23,389
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

142
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,491
THEY ARE DONE ORDERING

143
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:30,129
Aren't you good at puzzles?

144
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,365
Rubik's Cube. I like solving them.

145
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,869
They'll give you 500 won if you solve it
in five minutes. What do you say?

146
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:38,738
LEANING IN

147
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,306
What the hell?

148
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,842
-What's this?
-Isn't this a Rubik's Cube?

149
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,744
This must be some other sort of puzzle.

150
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,514
-Do-yeon, this looks tough to solve.
-What is it?

151
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:49,816
This must be it.

152
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:51,851
-But… Wow.
-Wow.

153
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,354
What are you supposed to do with it?

154
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,223
-You need to form a cube with it.
-I see.

155
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,560
This seems tough, especially because
I didn't get to see it originally.

156
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,095
Five minutes won't do, right?

157
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:03,162
I doubt it.

158
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,031
This isn't like a Rubik's Cube, is it?

159
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,165
This is completely different.

160
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:07,800
I've never seen anything like this before.

161
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,936
Hold on. Maybe I can get it.

162
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:11,270
Are you up for the challenge?

163
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:12,805
-I'll give it a try.
-Sure.

164
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,607
-I'll win the 500 won.
-You do that.

165
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,609
Think about what you can buy
with that 500 won.

166
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,211
-I'll win the money for you.
-Cool.

167
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:20,213
-Si-wan, get ready to be amazed.
-Sure.

168
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,215
-I'll rock Buyeo's world.
-Go for it.

169
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,549
All right.

170
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,485
And… go.

171
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,653
Do-yeon, win the 500 won for us.

172
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,323
-Think about what you can buy with it.
-Got it.

173
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,358
Watch me rock it.

174
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,961
I always accomplish what I put my mind to.

175
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,028
Nothing's impossible.

176
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,230
-Watch.
-I mean it.

177
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:38,331
How do you do this?

178
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:41,534
There's a lot of time left. Four minutes…

179
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,302
It still hasn't been a minute.
Take your time.

180
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,104
Take your time.

181
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,639
Try to figure out its pattern.

182
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,074
I've received higher education, you know.

183
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,610
I did monthly workbooks as well.

184
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:51,677
Tell me about it.

185
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,980
-Just don't give up.
-Is that the secret?

186
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:56,115
-Only quitters give up.
-Exactly.

187
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,518
I think it's coming together.

188
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,653
WILL SHE OR WON'T SHE

189
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,055
-Who even came up with this?
-Tell me about it.

190
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:04,624
It seems doable but…

191
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,826
GRADUALLY GETTING ANNOYED

192
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:07,894
Come on!

193
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,431
My 500 won!

194
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:19,305
Do-yeon, based on
what I learned about you today,

195
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:23,276
you seemed like someone
who views life philosophically.

196
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:24,944
But you broke down over this.

197
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:26,679
-Tragic.
-This broke you.

198
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,182
So much for being
an enlightening interviewer.

199
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,784
There are people who make it easier
for you to talk about yourself.

200
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,519
That's the kind of person I want to be.

201
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,291
I hope to be a good interviewer.

202
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,327
I can't even solve this puzzle.
I can't do it.

203
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,796
SHE FAILS TO WIN 500 WON

204
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,531
-It's difficult.
-It seems like it.

205
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,401
You think you've got it, but you don't,

206
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,269
-and it drives you nuts.
-I know.

207
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,471
Would you like to try?

208
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,005
-Should I?
-Yes.

209
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:54,507
But I'm not good at these things.

210
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,742
-This isn't like a Rubik's Cube.
-I haven't done this before.

211
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,010
I'll give it a try.

212
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,745
And… go.

213
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,614
Let me see.

214
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,618
I think there are roughly
two or three patterns.

215
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,254
Unlike me,
he's trying to see the pattern first.

216
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,857
I can tell there's a pattern. Now what?

217
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,325
You seem really smart.

218
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:14,460
I bet you enjoy activities
that make you think. Right?

219
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,195
-I do.
-Same goes for the Rubik's Cube.

220
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,965
You seem to enjoy things
with a clear finish.

221
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:22,168
That's how it is for people
who enjoy solving Rubik's Cube.

222
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:25,037
Ma'am, has anyone ever solved this?

223
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:26,839
Not under five minutes.

224
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,574
What, really?

225
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:31,043
No one's solved this
in under five minutes?

226
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:32,845
It's not easy.

227
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,181
MUMBLING

228
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:38,784
All I need to get are these three blocks.

229
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,220
Like this and rotate.

230
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,089
-Hey!
-Can I do it?

231
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,857
I'm not quite there yet.

232
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,193
This won't work.

233
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,128
Because this…

234
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,563
-What the hell?
-The time…

235
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:52,899
I think I'll need more time.

236
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:55,434
-Si-wan, I'm impressed.
-Hold on, this isn't…

237
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,271
It's always the same story
with these puzzles.

238
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:01,807
You might think you're done,
but one block is always out of place.

239
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,809
You need more time to solve this.

240
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,445
SUCKING TEETH…

241
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,548
I feel like he might hit me
if I say time's up.

242
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,217
See how focused he is.

243
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:15,488
-I'm scared to tell him it's over.
-Hardly. I…

244
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,690
HIS 5 MINUTES ARE UP

245
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:18,925
You should keep going.

246
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:20,826
Keep going.

247
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,596
Take a shot like this.

248
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,134
Is he kidding me?

249
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,837
Do you want to wait
until I'm actually done with this?

250
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,639
-Or should we fake it?
-Let's put on an act.

251
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,074
-Really? Okay.
-How do we do it?

252
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:38,144
# SCENE
30 SECONDS BEFORE TIME'S UP

253
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,046
Oh, wait. Hey!

254
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:45,251
HE DID IT IN UNDER 5 MINUTES!

255
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:48,254
(DO-YEON FAINTS
FROM OVERWHELMING EMOTIONS)

256
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,424
(I WON. THE BATTLE. AGAINST MYSELF…)

257
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:53,793
Si-wan…

258
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,695
He's so annoying.

259
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,699
Ma'am, he did it.

260
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:00,766
(FLABBERGASTED) NO WAY!!!!!!

261
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,368
Here's your 500 won.

262
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:06,172
Hey, she's actually good at this.

263
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:07,673
With that, we wrap up,

264
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,309
Yim Si-wan, the Genius.

265
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:12,378
There you have it. That was good.

266
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,446
It's all in the editing.

267
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:14,747
What about this cube?

268
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,148
We should disassemble it.

269
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,383
-Sure.
-Let's disassemble it.

270
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,118
We should leave it for the next person.

271
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:21,954
-Okay.
-That was fun.

272
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,322
THE OWNER
BRINGS THEM THEIR DRINKS

273
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,690
Gosh, thanks.

274
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,025
The theme today is manners.

275
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,960
SITTING DOWN

276
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,195
Are you joining us?

277
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,097
I thought I'd join you.

278
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:32,732
-I see.
-I'm quite hungry.

279
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:33,933
Are you hungry?

280
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:37,870
What a fun neighborhood.

281
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,140
-I'm here to explain the drinks to you.
-Oh, okay.

282
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,809
This is the tofu-spänner,
our signature coffee.

283
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:47,146
The cream on top has mashed tofu in it.

284
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,548
The tofu comes from Jeongdong-ri,

285
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:52,652
and is traditionally made in
a cast iron cauldron.

286
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,420
That's been added to the cream.

287
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,956
The garnish on top of the cream

288
00:10:57,023 --> 00:11:00,393
is sesame oil and sesame seeds
from Buyeo Jungang Market.

289
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:02,395
You only use quality ingredients.

290
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,163
-Were you born and raised here?
-Yes.

291
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,732
We make everything
using ingredients sourced from Buyeo.

292
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,800
We'll enjoy.

293
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,035
-Thank you.
-Please enjoy.

294
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:10,803
-Congratulations on assembling the cube.
-Right.

295
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,606
She kept up the act.

296
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,774
That's so sweet of you.

297
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,941
-Thank you.
-No way.

298
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,843
SHE CONGRATULATED HIM
ON BEING THE FIRST(?) TO SUCCEED

299
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,512
My gosh.

300
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:20,780
-Do-yeon.
-Everything looks good.

301
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,748
While you were listening to her explain,

302
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:25,551
didn't something seem off to you?

303
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,019
What was it?

304
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,821
-You didn't sense it, did you?
-No.

305
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,489
She didn't speak in a dialect.

306
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:32,958
-You're right!
-She didn't have the dialect.

307
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,593
That's why I asked if she was from Buyeo.

308
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,696
It seemed like she'd say
she was from Seoul.

309
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:38,631
I came to Buyeo,

310
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,468
but even the young people
walking past me

311
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,103
didn't speak the dialect.

312
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,271
That flustered me.

313
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:47,973
You came to Buyeo
just to learn the dialect.

314
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,475
I was flustered.

315
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,377
You know what's funny?

316
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:55,614
Even the owner here, who's from Buyeo,
doesn't speak the dialect,

317
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,650
but you suddenly did at the pub.

318
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,819
You asked "What's good here?"

319
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,254
I'm still embarrassed for you.

320
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:05,357
It would've been better
if the owner had asked right away

321
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,093
whether I was from Seoul.

322
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,295
-But he saw through you.
-Exactly.

323
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,297
-He probably found you adorable.
-Sure.

324
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:13,866
I'll enjoy this. Here we go.

325
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,202
There's a nuttiness to it.

326
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,007
It's so good!

327
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,610
-Really?
-It's insane.

328
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,347
-That has sesame oil in it?
-Yes, sesame oil.

329
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,949
Everything tasty has sesame oil in it.

330
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,217
That's fascinating.

331
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,853
How is there tofu in this?

332
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,087
It tastes like cream.

333
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:38,657
It's like extremely smooth cream.

334
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:40,626
I should try some of this.

335
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,629
I wouldn't mind just having the cream.

336
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,632
This creamy tofu.

337
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:47,867
WHAT WAS THAT…?

338
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,869
Are you declaring war?

339
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,071
Are we having a reaction battle?

340
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,173
What is it? Is it that good?

341
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,608
Is it delicious?

342
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:56,776
Give and take.

343
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:58,410
Give and take? Got it.

344
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,448
It must be because
I enjoy this kind of drink.

345
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,985
-Anything nutty like tofu and--
-There are bits inside it.

346
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:07,586
That was ice.

347
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,022
OH…

348
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,625
-It's regular ice.
-Yes, ice.

349
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:13,793
Do you

350
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,962
drink hot coffee even during summer?

351
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,365
Do you still drink hot Americano
even when it's scorching hot?

352
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:20,900
If there's no other reason…

353
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,168
-You drink it hot?
-Yes, hot.

354
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,435
Why? Because it's better for you?

355
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:24,503
No.

356
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,006
I wouldn't drink coffee
if I were watching my health.

357
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,240
This is so good!

358
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,042
Sorry about that. What did you say?

359
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,177
What did you just say?

360
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,779
-I'm sorry.
-Don't worry about it, Do-yeon.

361
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:34,914
Sorry.

362
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,081
That was rude, wasn't it?

363
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,917
I'm far from a good interviewer.

364
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,386
-No way.
-The cake was that good.

365
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:41,987
It's really good. So, what did you say?

366
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,557
You just taught me a new way
to react to things.

367
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,458
-Like that, huh?
-It's that good.

368
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,260
I could tell you meant it.

369
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,163
I SEE~

370
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:53,766
I just really like chestnuts.

371
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,468
This is insane.
I wouldn't mind moving here.

372
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,171
-You see, there's a reason…
-This is so good.

373
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,841
…why I drink hot coffee
even in the summer.

374
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:03,375
NOM-WHOA!!

375
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,411
SOAKING UP DO-YEON'S RESPONSE
LIKE A SPONGE

376
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:07,746
Please don't pick up rude habits from me.

377
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,182
You might seem rude.

378
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:11,417
Can we get some tissues?

379
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,720
Do-yeon, stay still.

380
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:15,788
SMACKS LIPS

381
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:18,123
It's gone.

382
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,658
QUICKLY

383
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:23,229
+RE-COATING

384
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:24,296
What is it?

385
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,031
What is it?

386
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:27,333
-Nothing…
-Is something wrong?

387
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,135
I was about to wipe something off.

388
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,470
What, exactly?

389
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:33,405
Well…

390
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,474
Is something on my face?

391
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,312
Is something on my face?
I'm so embarrassed. Where?

392
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,547
-Where on my face?
-Seriously…

393
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,382
I want to wipe it off.

394
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:44,850
Fine.

395
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,585
Here. Let's…

396
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:47,920
Let's film a scene.

397
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,455
We'll do it in slow motion.

398
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:54,193
Oh, no. I can't see where it is.

399
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,464
Stay where you are.

400
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:01,567
WIPE

401
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,303
I'm embarrassed.

402
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,072
It's all right.

403
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:14,013
-What do you usually watch at home?
-Me?

404
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,080
Travel shows.

405
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,583
I travel vicariously.

406
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,184
Do you have a go-to channel?

407
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,053
The YouTube channel Showddary.

408
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,788
It's run by a married couple

409
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:27,126
who started off by traveling around
the world for their honeymoon.

410
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:32,197
They just give off such a happy vibe.

411
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,799
Here's how I found their videos.

412
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,869
Before taking off
to walk the Camino de Santiago,

413
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,738
I looked up things to study online.

414
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,840
That's how I stumbled upon their videos.

415
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:44,443
They filmed their journey
along the Camino de Santiago.

416
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,380
Watching their videos made me realize

417
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:52,251
how warm they were living their lives.

418
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:54,820
That's what I got from them.

419
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,588
You just reminded me of something.

420
00:15:56,655 --> 00:16:00,092
There's a married couple
who write pieces for a newspaper.

421
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,494
They also spend time

422
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,730
-traveling the world.
-Really?

423
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:08,400
What's amusing is that they write
from the wife's perspective first,

424
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,903
and then from the husband's.

425
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,172
They have different experiences
while traveling together.

426
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,407
They're always together
since they're married,

427
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,576
yet it's fun to read
how differently they think,

428
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,111
even when they're together.

429
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,480
It might sound weird,
but reading their pieces

430
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:23,716
made me want to get married.

431
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:26,251
-No way. After reading their work?
-Having a spouse like that…

432
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,654
Because having a spouse like that…

433
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,056
Relationships only work
when the two of you click.

434
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,191
Anyway, that's what I thought.

435
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,693
Now I'm wondering about your marriage.

436
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,729
-My marriage?
-About when you'll marry.

437
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,597
-Do you think I can?
-Absolutely.

438
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,665
-Really?
-Of course.

439
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:44,136
So many people find you charming.

440
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:47,306
-Honestly, I think it's up to you.
-Do you mean that?

441
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,408
Many people already find you
extremely charming,

442
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,745
even in our line of work alone.

443
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,346
-But…
-Yes?

444
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,715
No one's asked me out for real.

445
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,951
-It's like a mirage. No.
-Maybe you have high standards.

446
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,387
-Maybe you're just eager to work more.
-Work more?

447
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,255
No way, I'd rather hang out and have fun.

448
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,557
Maybe you enjoy hanging out too much.

449
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:08,127
I'm too scared to party a lot.

450
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,363
What am I doing?

451
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,965
Why am I being like this?

452
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:14,666
-Beats me.
-Why are you putting up a wall?

453
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:15,801
No, it's not that.

454
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,236
You've put up a wall around you.

455
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:18,303
It's not true.

456
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,441
You've been open and accepting so far,

457
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:23,609
but once marriage came up,

458
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:25,811
-you started disagreeing with me.
-It's not like that.

459
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:27,346
It's not that.

460
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:30,649
See? She did it again.

461
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,950
You're wrong about everything.

462
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:33,685
You're wrong.

463
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,921
Have you ever thought
about getting married?

464
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:39,291
Getting married is one of my life goals.

465
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:40,659
One of my biggest life goals.

466
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,395
Is it bigger than work?

467
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:46,999
If someone asks why I work,
it's because I want to travel…

468
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,067
WHY SI-WAN WORKS

469
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:52,237
…and meet a companion to share it with.

470
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,206
1: TO TRAVEL
2: TO TRAVEL WITH A COMPANION

471
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:55,274
A companion.

472
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,509
What a beautiful word.

473
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,977
For that to be joyful,

474
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:02,181
we need to be able to talk endlessly
like friends,

475
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,682
even when it's just the two of us.

476
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,417
-Yes, and it should be fun.
-That's most important.

477
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:07,252
-It must be fun.
-Exactly.

478
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,620
GOSH…

479
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:10,489
-Marriage?
-That's right.

480
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,893
Maybe you haven't found someone
you enjoy being alone with.

481
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,961
-Me?
-Yes.

482
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,397
Not really. I liked all my boyfriends.

483
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:19,498
-It was always fun.
-Really?

484
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,068
Not really.

485
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,237
-I keep disagreeing with you.
-Not really.

486
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,405
That's not it.

487
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,440
Whatever!

488
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,611
Anyway, reading about people's travels
warms me inside.

489
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:33,946
Is there somewhere you'd like to go?

490
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:35,481
The Galápagos Islands.

491
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:36,615
Really? Why?

492
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:39,284
It's a UNESCO World Heritage site
in the Pacific Ocean,

493
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:42,020
famous for its well-preserved
marine reserve.

494
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:44,223
I'm a die-hard clean water fan, remember?

495
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:49,094
I've never heard anyone say
the Galápagos Islands

496
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,230
when asked where they want to travel.

497
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:56,802
I want to visit places
that aren't easily accessible.

498
00:18:56,869 --> 00:19:00,772
Since those places
are hard for people to reach…

499
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,175
-It's clean.
-Right.

500
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,577
How long have you had this love
for clean water?

501
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,881
Just looking at clean water
makes me feel good.

502
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:11,850
Knowing what you like is important.

503
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,619
Our preferences, to be exact.

504
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:18,257
I make a special effort to do activities
in or on the water.

505
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,993
Jet skiing is one of them.

506
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,028
Do you know the board
attached to a jet ski

507
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,429
-that lifts you into the air?
-I do.

508
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,831
-That…
-Have you tried that too?

509
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,299
I do that as well.

510
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,334
And wake surfing.

511
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:30,802
You're really into recreational sports.

512
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,738
Do you enjoy riding ATVs?

513
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:34,840
ATVs? You mean the four-wheelers?

514
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:37,476
I loved riding them in my 20s.

515
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,879
-Did you ride them on vacations?
-Always.

516
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:43,382
-What about you?
-I haven't been on one before.

517
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:44,483
-Really?
-No.

518
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,053
Is it thrilling to ride
over pebbles and gravel?

519
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,321
I think so.

520
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,657
-It's bumpy.
-Is that what makes it charming?

521
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:54,193
I wonder what it's like. That said,

522
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,728
-let's head out to ride an ATV.
-Let's go.

523
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:01,466
QUICKLY RETURNING THE TRAY
WITH GOOD MANNERS

524
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:06,805
We enjoyed everything.

525
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,507
He went over there in his socks!

526
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,075
I can't believe him.

527
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,810
I wasn't able to carry much.

528
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,512
SHOES ON
AND OFF TO ENJOY THE ACTIVITIES!

529
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,114
ATV RIDING
NEAR THE BAEKMA RIVER

530
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,050
-Come on out.
-Sure.

531
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:21,386
What a gorgeous sight.

532
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:25,257
-The scenery is breathtaking.
-Gorgeous.

533
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:28,093
-Come this way, and I'll go over it.
-Sure.

534
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,262
Both of these control the brakes.

535
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:31,363
-Both brakes.
-Right.

536
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,098
Hold this to speed up.

537
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,633
The accelerator.

538
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,936
The vehicle will start moving
once you gently press it with your thumb.

539
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,572
If you hold it like this,
the vehicle will maintain that speed.

540
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,441
If you're going too slow, press it harder.

541
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,810
-If you're too fast, let go.
-Got it.

542
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:47,145
Do you see the tire marks on the field?

543
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:49,281
-Yes.
-You'll practice as much as you need,

544
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:52,618
then join me on a tour and follow my lead.

545
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:53,685
Take it slow.

546
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:57,923
If you lose patience,
you won't be able to control it. Got it?

547
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,926
Is it okay to be a little nervous?

548
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,195
-You'll be fine.
-My heart is racing.

549
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,899
-Are cowards allowed to ride?
-Sure.

550
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:09,701
It's a first for me.

551
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:11,670
-I--
-Let me extend that.

552
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:13,805
My heart just skipped a beat.

553
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,008
Is it all right for me to crush on you?

554
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:17,709
-I'm married.
-Sorry.

555
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:20,212
LAUGHING

556
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,680
I wish your wife good health.

557
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:23,849
MOANING

558
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:27,419
Will I be okay? I got scared
riding a go-kart on Jeju Island.

559
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,154
-This will be easier.
-Will this be easier?

560
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:30,255
That's a relief.

561
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:33,325
THE RELAXED ONE

562
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:36,261
AND THE ONE WHO'S QUITE SAD

563
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:37,696
I'm so excited.

564
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,232
RELAXED

565
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,535
CACKLING

566
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:46,538
I'm so happy I could fly.

567
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,341
Slowly, press down on the accelerator.

568
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:51,510
Do-yeon, you got this.

569
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,812
PRESSING DOWN

570
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:57,582
Wait, hold on! Oh, no.

571
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:58,950
WAHHHHH

572
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,789
What is this?

573
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:04,990
LAUGHING MANICALLY

574
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,325
GROANING

575
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,093
Do-yeon, you're doing great.

576
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,494
Looking good.

577
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,397
Oh, no. Geez.

578
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,467
Damn, what is this?

579
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,403
MOVING A BIT SLOWER THAN WE THOUGHT

580
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,106
WHOA(?) EEK(?) ARGH(?)
AH(?) BAH(?) UGH(?)

581
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,942
Oh, no. We're turning the corner.

582
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,010
What?

583
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,445
Ah, Mommy!

584
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:29,381
Mom…

585
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,350
SHE'S ASKED FOR HER MOM 100 TIMES

586
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:35,020
NICE~

587
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:37,389
I think I'm going to puke.

588
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:38,790
You're doing great, Do-yeon.

589
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,126
I just want to drive straight.

590
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,627
FUELED BY COMPLIMENTS
SHE GAINS SPEED

591
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:45,430
This part is fun.

592
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,032
Looking good.

593
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:48,266
Oh, yeah.

594
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,703
Oh, yeah. You're doing great, Do-yeon.

595
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,771
THE COMPLIMENTS KEEP COMING

596
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:58,143
THE COMPLIMENTS
MAKE HER SPEED UP SOME MORE

597
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,482
PRACTICE IS OVER

598
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,283
You did better than I thought.

599
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:07,419
Do-yeon, you kept going faster.

600
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,154
-You kept gaining speed.
-Really?

601
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,589
-Yes.
-But I was terrified.

602
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:12,090
Let's head out, then.

603
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:14,459
-Go, team.
-Let's come back in one piece.

604
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:16,027
Off we go.

605
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,095
TIME FOR THE MAIN COURSE!

606
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:18,764
Bye!

607
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:21,666
GRINNING

608
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,168
SHE SEEMS MORE RELAXED NOW

609
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,637
Si-wan, are you on my tail?

610
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:27,372
Do-yeon's feeling more confident now.

611
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,208
LAUGHING

612
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:33,945
FINALLY, THEY RACE OFF

613
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:35,947
It's grown on me.

614
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,027
ENTERING A THICK WOODLAND TRAIL

615
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,162
I'm cutting through tall grass.

616
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,865
QUACKING

617
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,068
Geez, what the hell?
Let's hurry out of here.

618
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:02,507
I am a warrior.

619
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:05,010
I dash across the paddy path.

620
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,579
GASPING

621
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,181
QUITE A STEEP SLOPE

622
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:10,949
Man, this is fun.

623
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,490
EEK!

624
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:21,493
Gosh, this is nice.

625
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,562
CRUISING ALONG THE BAEKMA RIVER

626
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,163
What lovely weather.

627
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,467
Do-yeon, we're heading
to the main road now.

628
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,002
ENTERING A PAVED ROAD

629
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:32,904
Do-yeon, go!

630
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:35,507
Nice. Let's step on it.

631
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:39,478
Do-yeon's picking up speed.
This is the fastest she's gone.

632
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:44,416
Bring it on, world.

633
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,817
Here I come!

634
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,455
OVERCOMING FEAR AND DRIVING OFF

635
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:51,857
This is fun.

636
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:54,726
We're back.

637
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,162
Good job, guys.

638
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:58,296
-Is it over?
-Yes.

639
00:24:58,797 --> 00:24:59,798
THAT'S TOO BAD

640
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,100
-Was that too short?
-That was fun.

641
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:05,537
I was really scared at first,

642
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:08,006
but before I knew it, I was a maniac.

643
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:09,407
I think you've got the hang of it.

644
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:12,210
I got annoyed when the instructor
stopped in front of me.

645
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:15,113
I didn't mean that.

646
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,615
Anyway, I'm left feeling weird.

647
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:18,950
I don't think I can take cabs anymore.

648
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,019
I'd rather drive an ATV instead. Thanks.

649
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,357
It's been a while and--

650
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:26,458
-Was it fun?
-Yes.

651
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:27,959
That was fun.

652
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:30,729
THE TAXI DRIVER GETS OUT TO TAKE A CALL

653
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:32,831
Earlier, when you weren't here,

654
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:35,233
the cab driver said
he didn't know you were a singer.

655
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,302
He knows you only as an actor.

656
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,304
Still, he recognized me.

657
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,505
He did.

658
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,207
On the phone, he could be saying,

659
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,242
"I'm with Yim Si-wan right now."

660
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:46,478
He could be.

661
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:49,514
-"It's Getaway and Go with Jangdobari."
-"Don't you watch the show?"

662
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,149
"I didn't know about it either."

663
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,852
"These two celebrities are chatting away
in the back seat of my cab."

664
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,921
"She said she couldn't ride ATVs,

665
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:58,056
but I just saw her speeding away."

666
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:00,191
-"She kept speeding up."
-"She must be crazy."

667
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:01,960
We can't stop with these skits.

668
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,195
I wouldn't mind doing one for real.

669
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,765
Let's do it, then.

670
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:10,035
Let's do one. We'll do some role-playing
before wrapping this up.

671
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:11,269
-Sounds good.
-At least one.

672
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:13,838
You go along
with everything I throw at you.

673
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,908
That just means
I'm comfortable around you.

674
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:18,810
What's a clear sign you're comfortable?

675
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:19,878
When I show my quirky side.

676
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:22,280
-When you show your quirky side?
-Yes.

677
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:26,251
9-MINUTE DRIVE TO THE PUB

678
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:29,187
I think the pub was around here.

679
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,890
-Do-yeon--
-What restaurant was it back then?

680
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:32,958
It was Hoolala Chicken.

681
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:34,492
-Was it that back then?
-Yes.

682
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,162
-It's now a jokbal place.
-Right.

683
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:39,364
I think it was right here. Yes, it was.

684
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,033
-Which pub are we going to?
-This one.

685
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,668
THEY'RE HEADED TO THE PUB
SI-WAN WENT TO AT NIGHT

686
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:46,338
This is the pub I went to.
That's always been here.

687
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:48,006
(THE HOOLALA CHICKEN PLACE
WAS TWO DOORS DOWN)

688
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:49,240
Did you eat at two pubs that day?

689
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:51,743
-Lunch and then dinner next door?
-I came here for dinner.

690
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,547
You spent your whole day around here,
didn't you?

691
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,916
I hope the same owner
is running the jokbal place.

692
00:26:57,983 --> 00:26:58,984
That'd be nice.

693
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,819
(CAB DRIVER: SHAKING HIS HEAD)

694
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:01,886
Is someone else running it?

695
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,321
A NEW OWNER OPENED
THE JOKBAL RESTAURANT

696
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:04,422
The owners were exhausted.

697
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:06,625
-That's too bad!
-Their age…

698
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:09,260
-They were on the older side.
-Really?

699
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:12,931
That chicken place
now lives only in my memory.

700
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:14,699
TODAY, THEY'LL EAT AT THE PUB
THAT STILL STANDS

701
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,603
We've been joking
that today's a battle of manners,

702
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,505
and even our cab driver
has been really nice.

703
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,741
That's what I got from him.

704
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,010
He kept fidgeting with the buttons

705
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:28,980
so that sounds from the car
wouldn't interfere with our interview.

706
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,682
He's been so sweet today.

707
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:32,450
Looks like we have another contender.

708
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:36,554
Stop it. That's not why I brought him up.

709
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:37,989
HIS DESIRE TO WIN HAS GROWN

710
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:40,625
That's not why I brought him up.

711
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:43,028
-Our cab driver…
-Don't.

712
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:44,229
…is a contender too.

713
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:45,296
Sorry I said that.

714
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:47,065
URGENTLY

715
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:48,767
What now?

716
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,602
POLITELY HANDING HER THE MENU

717
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:51,903
(RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS FACE)

718
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,238
Exhausting, isn't it?

719
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:55,440
"Raw red-banded lobster,
noodles with whelk,

720
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,142
jokbal gambas, parboiled squid, and…"

721
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,343
There's a lot on this menu.

722
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:01,379
How many dishes are on their menu?

723
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:02,814
I'll have the squid tangsuyuk.

724
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:05,984
-Squid tangsuyuk? That sounds good.
-Yeah.

725
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:07,719
-We should order one more.
-Sure.

726
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:09,220
What else?

727
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:11,222
-Let's ask for a recommendation.
-Sounds good.

728
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:12,490
Sir.

729
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:14,659
Sir?

730
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:16,061
Do-yeon, lower your voice.

731
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:17,962
DING~DONG~

732
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,164
MUTE
SIR~

733
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,565
Coming.

734
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:21,633
Thanks.

735
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,867
Always a pleasure.

736
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:24,469
Welcome.

737
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,603
Hello.

738
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,206
Can you give us a recommendation?

739
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:29,274
-A recommendation?
-Yes.

740
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,076
Customers enjoy our kimchi jjigae.

741
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:32,477
Your kimchi jjigae?

742
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,112
How about another dish?

743
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:37,282
We'd appreciate something lighter.

744
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:39,350
-Something we can finish.
-Then,

745
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:41,619
our bingsu is also good to have.

746
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:43,421
-Bingsu?
-It's hot outside, after all.

747
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,223
What do you say?

748
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,358
Could you recommend something else?

749
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,728
I bet we're annoying.

750
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:51,162
How about noodles with whelk?

751
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,530
That's also good.

752
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:54,165
Are you okay with that?

753
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,468
Could you recommend
noodles with whelk for us?

754
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:57,535
People order that a lot.

755
00:28:57,602 --> 00:28:59,571
-Noodles with whelk?
-Do many people order that?

756
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:01,740
There's no way I'm missing that.
That's what I'm having.

757
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:03,675
I've been wanting
noodles with whelk anyway.

758
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,677
I'd like some noodles with whelk.

759
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,745
-Then…
-I'd like that,

760
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:09,114
-even if you don't have any whelk.
-I'll go out and catch some.

761
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,949
-Please make that for us!
-Got it.

762
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:14,018
Noodles with whelk, squid tangsuyuk, and…

763
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,553
-Do you have draft beer?
-We do.

764
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,821
Two glasses or one?

765
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:17,989
One each. That's two.

766
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:19,824
-I'll get you two.
-Thank you.

767
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,392
(OFF TO CATCH WHELK)

768
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:23,128
We should have
noodles with whelk in Buyeo!

769
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:24,195
Sure.

770
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:25,864
See?

771
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,434
The owner here is on the younger side
and doesn't speak the dialect.

772
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:31,936
You're right. He doesn't.

773
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:33,772
Did you pick up any of the dialect?

774
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,673
Did you learn it at all?

775
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:39,711
The old couple running the pub
spoke the dialect.

776
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,212
-Those owners?
-That's right.

777
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,148
What did you have here back then?

778
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:46,351
I think I had kimchi fried rice.

779
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:49,154
-Are you okay eating alone?
-Sure.

780
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,722
I'm even fine grilling meat alone.

781
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:53,091
-At a Korean barbecue place?
-Yes.

782
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,993
I go to a tent bar alone sometimes.

783
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,594
How grown up of you.

784
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:59,531
I haven't done that recently, but still.

785
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:02,867
Here are your drinks.
Let me set the table for you.

786
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:05,570
Sir, I love rice puffs.

787
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,739
-How did you know?
-Thank you.

788
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,440
Did he just tell us to have a good time?

789
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:12,544
Sir, please don't spread any rumors!

790
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:14,946
Si-wan and I aren't dating.

791
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:18,316
-Tell him not to take any photos.
-No photos?

792
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,018
Sir, you can't take any photos.

793
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:22,754
He left without even listening.

794
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:26,591
-Let's enjoy this while it's still cold.
-Sure.

795
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:38,303
Are you kidding me?

796
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:40,405
It's so good!

797
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:42,941
I can feel my blood flowing.

798
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:44,475
Seriously.

799
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:45,376
AMAZED

800
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:46,444
You know what I thought?

801
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:50,014
Maybe beer at 3:00 p.m. was too heavy,

802
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:52,050
and I shouldn't drink.

803
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,353
-I'm wrong. I was right to drink.
-Really?

804
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,388
You should drink
when your body asks for it.

805
00:30:57,989 --> 00:30:59,324
Here's your order.

806
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:01,459
It's squid tangsuyuk.

807
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,161
SQUID TANGSUYUK

808
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:05,797
You can dip them in the sauce
or pour it over.

809
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:06,865
Thank you.

810
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,202
CRUNCHY

811
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:15,406
Is it good?

812
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:17,308
ALSO CRUNCHY

813
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,477
The flavor's very clean,
not greasy at all.

814
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,279
The sauce is really good.

815
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:23,381
It's good.

816
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:27,652
Have you ever had the thought?

817
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,922
And I'm only asking because you're
thinking about having a family one day.

818
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:33,925
What if you could choose where to go

819
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:35,460
on your honeymoon?

820
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:37,228
-On…
-Yes?

821
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:38,596
…my honeymoon?

822
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:41,099
I'd walk the Camino de Santiago
or something like that.

823
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:43,134
That would be really nice.

824
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:45,503
-You said it was challenging.
-Exactly!

825
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,571
I think

826
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:48,406
it'd be

827
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:50,475
even more meaningful

828
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:54,345
to take on a challenge
during the honeymoon.

829
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,948
Rather than a luxurious
and relaxing honeymoon?

830
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:59,517
That would be more memorable.

831
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,319
It could even strengthen our bond…

832
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,187
-Of course.
-…emotionally.

833
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,923
It's not a bad way to start a marriage.

834
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:06,190
EASILY CONVINCED

835
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,358
Do-yeon…

836
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,793
-Go ahead.
-…what about you?

837
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,528
-My honeymoon?
-Can we talk about marriage again?

838
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,596
No way.

839
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,065
Newlyweds? Marriage?

840
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:15,800
-A wedding?
-Forget it.

841
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:17,201
I'll have one of the long legs.

842
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,903
DO-YEON CHANGES THE TOPIC
BY GRABBING A LONG LEG

843
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,372
-No way.
-Here you go.

844
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,341
You told me to catch the whelk earlier.

845
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,311
What was it that I said?

846
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:28,746
-You told me to catch the whelk.
-You caught them for us.

847
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:30,715
Did you go out and catch them?

848
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,150
That's why it took me a while.

849
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:34,118
(SOBBING)

850
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:37,188
These are wild whelks.

851
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:38,289
WHELKS JUST CAUGHT(?)

852
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,791
-Thank you.
-No problem.

853
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:41,592
-Thank you.
-Have a wonderful time together.

854
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:46,597
Did you cast actors
to play the role of owners today?

855
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:48,299
It feels like the producer is back there

856
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:50,601
sending them out to do a skit.

857
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:52,270
ARE THEY ACTORS HIRED BY THE STAFF?

858
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:53,471
Buyeo's such a fun place.

859
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:55,606
Every single one of them
has delivered today.

860
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:57,008
Tell me about it.

861
00:32:57,575 --> 00:33:00,845
All the business owners in Buyeo
must be witty and clever.

862
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:02,680
They serve large portions, don't they?

863
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:05,283
Do they always serve this much?

864
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,552
NOODLES WITH WHELK
A BUYEO SPECIALTY CERTIFIED BY DO-YEON

865
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:09,754
MADE WITH FRESHLY CAUGHT(?) WHELKS
AND NOODLES

866
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,190
I think they were generous
even with the kimchi fried rice.

867
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:13,257
-Did they serve a lot?
-Yes.

868
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,559
THE PORTIONS ARE STILL GENEROUS

869
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:15,893
TRYING A WHELK

870
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,195
That's good. I like it.

871
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,466
TRYING THE VEGETABLES

872
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:26,170
A BOUNCY WHELK ON TOP
OF CRUNCHY VEGETABLES

873
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:29,507
ALL IN ONE MOUTHFUL

874
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:30,742
Isn't it good?

875
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:31,876
Yes, it's good.

876
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,712
Buyeo is definitely worth visiting again.

877
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:38,783
We got a lot done
in a short amount of time.

878
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,052
-It was eventful.
-If you think about it, right?

879
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,688
It feels like we just spent the morning

880
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:45,556
throwing pebbles in a pond,

881
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:48,693
but we actually had lunch and dessert,

882
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,529
tried to solve the cube, and rode ATVs.

883
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,266
I seriously want to ride one home.

884
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,534
(CLICKING)

885
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:59,537
This is what I did
while resting in the van earlier.

886
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:01,672
SERIOUSLY…

887
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:05,109
ARGH!

888
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:09,280
I won't be able to forget that feeling.

889
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:13,351
Were you worried about anything
or looking forward to anything

890
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:15,119
before joining me today?

891
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:18,022
-I was a little worried.
-You were worried? How so?

892
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:21,692
To be entertaining on a variety show,

893
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:25,430
I have to take on a different persona
instead of just being myself.

894
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,799
I feel that burden,
but I didn't want to do that.

895
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,634
-That wouldn't be the real me.
-Exactly.

896
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,469
-That's what I was worried about.
-And now?

897
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:32,637
I feel like

898
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:35,573
you went along with my mood
really well today.

899
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:39,410
I'm glad you feel that way,

900
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:43,781
but I never thought I had to do
anything special for you.

901
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:46,584
We just clicked,

902
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:48,953
and our conversations
flowed really well.

903
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,121
I'm glad to hear that.

904
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:52,223
I'm sad I didn't get to see
your quirky side.

905
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,425
To be honest,

906
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,628
I don't really know
what you mean by quirky,

907
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:00,398
but I've seen you act weird a lot today.

908
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:01,966
You acted weird.

909
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,936
I found myself asking
what was wrong with you.

910
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:07,605
Open parenthesis. In a positive way.
Close parenthesis.

911
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:09,373
I hear that saying it like that
is trending.

912
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,441
-Today?
-Yes.

913
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:12,210
You're hilarious.

914
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,544
I think you're funny.

917
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,484
That was supposed to be a compliment,

918
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:22,019
but I bet it didn't sound like one.
Is my tone the issue?

919
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:23,554
I think

920
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:26,958
being an actor means

921
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:28,893
studying human behavior

922
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,063
and how people present themselves.

923
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,265
-Today, I learned something new.
-Which is what?

924
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:35,766
"I like how you are."

926
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,002
Is that me?

FLATLY

928
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,672
FLATLY AGAIN

929

FLATLY

930
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:47,445
That's not very nice.

931
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:48,513
Is that how I talk?

932
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:50,314
HE'S BEEN COPYING HER EVEN BEFORE THIS

936
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,622
You have a knack

937
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:59,323
for teasing people.

938
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:01,125
SHUDDER

939
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:02,827
Look at him!

LAUGHING

941
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:05,730
Yim Si-wan, you!

942
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:09,066
You obviously have
good observation skills.

943
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:10,701
I feel like

944
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:12,870
you completely roasted me today.

945
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:16,073
I felt humiliated a few times.

946
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,609
That's hardly true.
You're simply a kind soul.

947
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:19,677
-Really?
-Yes.

948
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:22,713
You might be the reason
I lowered my guard.

949
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,916
-Really?
-I feel completely at ease around you.

950
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,386
The day flowed without any trouble,

951
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,588
more than ever before.

952
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:31,956
-Even I was surprised.
-Really?

953
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,491
-Yes.
-I love hearing that.

954
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:35,760
-That might be one of your superpowers.
-Really?

955
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:37,361
Wait, that was off.

956
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:40,831
That might be one of your superpowers!

957
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:43,067
Yim Si-wan's superpower!

958
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,369
You're the best. Double thumbs up.

959
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:48,105
There isn't an interviewer quite like her.

960
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:50,007
She's one of a kind.

961
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:52,376
A good host? That's Jang Do-yeon.

962
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:54,145
-Who's the best actor?
-She's number one.

963
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,447
No actor can compare to Yim Si-wan.

967
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:03,588
Did I stick my tongue out like that?

968
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:06,524
-The best host?
-I hate being mimicked like this.

969
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:07,725
The best host? Jang Do-yeon.

970
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,660
STICKING OUT

971
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:14,899
Did I look like a cockle just now?
Was I sticking my tongue out like that?

972
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:16,901
It's like you're teaching me a lesson.

973

(A PROUD MIRROR)

974
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:21,072
I need to rethink my life
and work on my reactions a little.

975
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:22,440
"Can I continue like this?"

976
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:24,875
Thanks to you, I'm able to reflect.

977
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:26,477
HIS MIRRORING HER
HELPED HER REFLECT ON LIFE…

978
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:29,580
What aspect was most memorable
about the dialect you picked up?

979
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:31,916
How about we do a little role-play?

980
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,119
We've come back to Buyeo in our old age.

981
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:37,054
In old age? How many years later?

982
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:39,090
-Just go with it.
-Just go with it? Sure.

983
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:41,025
-We're each playing ourselves. Okay.
-Sure.

00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,430
-Like this?
-Yes.

988
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:47,732
What happened to you?

989
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:50,334
How come you suddenly
opened a travel agency?

990
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:53,371
I never expected you
to quit acting altogether.

991
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,940
What would you have done
if you hadn't become an actor?

992
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:57,141
I'd be running a travel agency.

993
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:58,209
A LONGTIME DREAM OF HIS

994
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,810
What's there to life?

995
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:01,245
We do whatever we can to be happy.

996
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:03,080
Life itself is a journey, isn't it?

997
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:05,683
Do you know what impressed me the most?

998
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,452
Remember what we said here
a few years ago?

999
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:11,322
You said you'd walk the Camino de Santiago
on your honeymoon.

1000
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:13,024
-Exactly.
-I've never seen anyone

1001
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,359
marry five times just to go on honeymoons.

1002
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:17,595
Good for you, Si-wan.

1003
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:19,497
It's kind of scary, if you ask me.

1004
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:21,432
You were so vocal about wanting

1005
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:23,100
to go there on your honeymoon,

1006
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:25,069
you married five times
for that reason alone.

1007
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,304
That's impressive.

1008
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,172
Don't mention it.

1009
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,407
Honeymoons are the best.

1010
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,842
-Really?
-They're the purpose of life.

1011
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:33,911
-But--
-That's that. By the way…

1012
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:34,979
-Yes?
-So…

1013
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:37,181
-Don't you remember?
-Remember what?

1014
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:41,519
We came here to film an episode
for Getaway and Go with Jangdobari.

1015
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:43,688
Of course, that was fun!

1016
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:45,022
Remember what you said to me?

1017
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:47,391
After the show ended
and we'd swapped pleasantries,

1018
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,427
you came up to me and said this quietly.

1019
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,028
What did I say? I don't remember.

1020
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:52,596
You asked to borrow some money.

1021
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,098
Unbelievable.

1022
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,267
Why would you even bring up
something so meaningless?

1023
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,868
-Why did I bring it up?
-Who…

1024
00:38:57,935 --> 00:38:59,170
Who even remembers that?

1025
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:00,304
How is that meaningless?

1026
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:02,473
You still haven't paid me back.

1027
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,908
When are you going to?

1028
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:05,743
Do you know what's upsetting?

1029
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,746
I only borrowed 100,000 won, you know?

1030
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:10,681
How could you send thugs
to my house to collect?

1031
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:13,184
What? 100,000 won, did you say?

1032
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,418
It was 100,000 dollars!

1033
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:16,320
-Dollars?
-You borrowed 100,000 dollars.

1034
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:18,089
-That's why--
-That 100,000 dollars?

1035
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:19,156
Unbelievable.

1036
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:21,992
That third wife of yours. Elena, was it?

1037
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:24,428
I wired the money to her account.

1038
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:25,996
Her name's Selena, not Elena.

1039
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:27,231
-Anyway…
-Right, of course.

1040
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:31,068
-Gomez or whatnot, wasn't it?
-Anyway, that's not what's important.

1041
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:34,004
You didn't pay me back,
so I had to quit acting

1042
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:37,541
and open a travel agency
because I desperately needed cash.

1043
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:39,243
Is that why?

1044
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,444
That's right.

1045
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:41,579
But whatever.

1046
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:43,914
-It all worked out for the best.
-Did it?

1047
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:46,117
-There's not much to happiness, right?
-I'm glad it worked out.

1048
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:49,587
-It's all good.
-Anyway, there's something

1049
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:51,956
I wanted to tell you.

1050
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:55,159
Remember the makguksu we ate that day?

1051
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,794
-Sure.
-I'm marrying the restaurant owner.

1052

00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:02,533
So…

1055
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,968
(30 YEARS AGO)

1056
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:05,870
SQUINTING

1057
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:08,105
You weren't flirting with me, were you?

1058
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:11,308
Sir, is that how
you usually look at people?

1059
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,277
I almost got misled.

1060
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:16,380
I couldn't tell if you were sending me
a message with your eyes.

1061
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:19,283
I'll sell his gold bracelet
and pay back the 100,000 dollars,

1062
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,786
so don't you worry. He's waiting for me,

1063
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:24,121
smiling like this with his eyes.

1064
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:25,423
He's out there thinking,

1065
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:27,658
-"When will my Do-yeon be back?"
-Hold on a second.

1066
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:31,362
You used to be so shy about marriage.
I'm happy for you.

1067
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,865
Don't get cold feet at the last minute.

1068
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,767
-Just settle down already.
-Right.

1069
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:38,102
That's all you need,

1070
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:39,270
because you're sweet overall.

1071
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:40,871
She's sweet.

1072
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,540
You're sweet.

1073
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,376
I think it's time to end the skit.

1074
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,244
I'm starting to feel irritated.

1075
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:49,079
THEIR ACTING IS SO GOOD,
YOU CAN'T TELL WHAT'S REAL ANYMORE

1076
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:51,615
-It's hard to role-play with an actor.
-For sure.

1077
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:53,217
You're so sweet.

1078
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,052
Jang Do-yeon is
the best show host out there.

1079
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:57,188
No one's as good as her.

1080
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:59,690
-I'm sweet, aren't I?
-There. Let's end it at that.

1081
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:00,825
Whatever. We're good.

1082
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:01,992
What matters is the person.

1083
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:03,227
We'll end the skit.

1084
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,362
GLARE

1085
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:06,864
You're good in an annoying way.

1086
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:09,767
I'm terrible at role-playing.

1087
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:11,435
I find it difficult.

1088
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:13,070
It might've been funnier

1089
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,505
-if I'd done better.
-Don't say that.

1090
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:17,041
You irritated me enough.

1091
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:18,876
TEASING HIM FOR DOING WELL
EVEN THOUGH HE'S BAD AT IT

1092
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,344
You made it work. Good for you.

1093
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:22,847
-Don't worry about it. And now we'll--
-Are we back at it?

1094
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:24,949
No way. Stop it.
I'm switching back to my Seoul accent.

1095
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:26,684
THEY RETURN TO REALITY
TO WRITE IN THE TRAVEL DIARY

1096
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,819
Even though we film our trip,

1097
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:31,622
we write in a diary
to record our final moments.

1098
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:35,693
You can make it either a diary entry
or a message to me.

1099
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:37,161
-Sounds good.
-Okay.

1100
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:54,912
REMEMBERING THE DAY
THAT FELT LIKE 30 YEARS

1101
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:00,217
WORD BY WORD,
THEY FILL THE DIARY…

1102
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:02,086
I have to write on the next page too.

1103
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:03,287
Really?

1104
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:07,291
DO-YEON FINISHES FIRST

1105
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:10,394
-Are you done?
-Yes, I'm done.

1106
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:12,196
THEN…

1107
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:14,131
Who'd like to go first?

1108
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,432
-You go first.
-No, you first.

1109
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:18,102
THE NEVER-ENDING BATTLE
OF MANNERS

1110
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:19,537
Then…

1111
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:21,505
Should I go first?

1112
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:23,307
Sure thing.

1113
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,509
LAUGHING

1114
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,044
Here we go.

1115
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:29,380
"Closing out my trip to Buyeo
with Si-wan.

1116
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:32,550
It feels like the wish I made as I threw
the pebble into the pond came true.

1117
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:36,320
I was worried because I usually need time
to get close and comfortable with people,

1118
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,223
but talking to him was so easy
that my worries felt pointless.

1119
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:42,259
As Si-wan put it,
the things we couldn't share today

1120
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:44,595
will be saved for another day.

1121
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:46,864
I'll return to Seoul,
happily reliving our day.

1122
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:49,199
I'll remember Buyeo as a charming city,

1123
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:50,868
full of witty business owners,

1124
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:52,736
makguksu, tofu-spänner, ATVs,

1125
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:54,939
squid tangsuyuk,
a forced plate of noodles with whelk,

1126
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:56,140
and, of course, Yim Si-wan.

1127
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:57,508
I had a blast. Thanks, Si-wan.

1128
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,944
Until next time. Goodbye, Buyeo."

1129
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,614
APPLAUDING

1130
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:04,982
Hold on.

1131
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:07,785
It felt like reading something
for a recital class.

1132
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,253
The mood fits.

1133
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,622
That's how I wrapped up our time today.

1134
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:13,824
Member Yim Si-wan,
would you like to go next?

1135
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:16,160
Let's listen to what Si-wan wrote.

1136
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:17,227
-Sure.
-Good.

1137
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:19,597
"One day, with clear clouds in the sky

1138
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:22,266
and the summer sun blazing upon us,

1139
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:26,670
I met Do-yeon in a small town in Buyeo."

1140
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:28,372
Nice. That's like the intro to a novel.

1141
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:31,575
"There were days
when we passed by each other,

1142
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:33,844
but we never really had the chance to talk

1143
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:36,013
or connect on an emotional level,

1144
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:39,350
so I left Seoul feeling
both deeply excited

1145
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:40,684
and very anxious.

1146
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:44,555
Maybe I was worried for nothing,

1147
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,925
because it immediately felt like being

1148
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:51,695
with a good friend
or someone even closer.

1149
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,898
Thanks to that,
I feel like I've found someone

1150
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,134
I want to get to know for a long time

1151
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:59,069
and be friends with even longer.

1152
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:02,406
All I hope for is that she agrees.

1153
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:05,776
Lastly, there's no show host
like Jang Do-yeon."

1154
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:07,378
STICKING OUT TONGUE

1155
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:12,016
"Jang Do-yeon is the best show host."

1156
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,952
The writing was exceptional.

1157
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:16,420
-Was it good?
-Yes.

1158
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,322
-I'm touched.
-Did you like the ending?

1159
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:20,424
It's always sad to say goodbye,

1160
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,293
but I like how you said
you wanted me in your life.

1161
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,928
I had a great time.

1162
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,463
I'm glad we both had a blast.

1163
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:27,531
THEY BOTH HAD A GREAT TIME

1164
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:31,001
Closeness with someone isn't measured
by the amount of time you spend together.

1165
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:33,537
Do-yeon, let's…

1166
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,906
-let's exchange numbers.
-Sounds good.

1167
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:37,007
I'd love that.

1168
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,710
Don't you dare give me a fake number.

1169
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:42,813
WERE YOU REALLY
GOING TO DO THAT…?

1170
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,481
Were you teasing me just now?

1171
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:46,717
No, of course not!

1172
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:48,819
I was just checking if you meant it.

1173
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:50,554
No, stop that. Stop mimicking me!

1174
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:52,322
Stop copying me.

1175
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:55,059
Are you seriously going
to keep copying me?

1176
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:56,960
-The end.
-That's a wrap.

1177
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,362
-Good job, guys.
-That's a wrap.

1178
00:44:58,429 --> 00:44:59,463
TIME FOR GOODBYES

1179
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,698
-Can you do the slate?
-Sure.

1180
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:01,765
I'll do the slate.

1181
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:04,334
Do-yeon, please rest.

1182
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:07,004
-I'll do it. You might hurt your hands.
-It's fine.

1183
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:09,006
-Please.
-Are you sure? I should do it.

1184
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:11,041
-Should I cover your ears?
-I'm good.

1185
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:14,778
Unbelievable.

1186
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:16,213
Go home already.

1187
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,581
YOU WIN, OKAY?

1188
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:19,283
I'll do the slate.

1189
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:20,851
I'll do it instead of Si-wan.

1190
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:22,086
Here we go.

1191
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:23,320
One, two, three.

1192
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:29,626
YIM SI-WAN

1193
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:35,699
JANG DO-YEON

1194
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:48,979
Hello, I'm greeting you today

1195
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:50,481
from the city of romance and art.

1196
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:52,449
This is Paris.

1197
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:55,519
A filmmaker with a love for films.

1198
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,221
She's a true mon amie.

1199
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:59,623
-Please introduce yourself.
-Right, hello.

1200
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:02,226
I'm film director Yi Ok-seop.

1201
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:03,460
The theme of this trip

1202
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:07,431
is eating, drinking and friendship.

1203
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:08,766
This looks so good.

1204
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:10,400
It's so good.

1205
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:11,535
It's like a fairy tale.

1206
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,003
Isn't this like a scene from a movie?

1207
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:14,838
THEY EAT THE SECOND THEY WAKE UP

1208
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:16,306
DRINKING FOR LUNCH

1209
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:17,341
LOL

1210
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:19,143
SIGHTSEEING WHILE
ATTACHED AT THE HIP

1211
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:20,744
OK-SEOP'S DREAM TOUR:
FOLLOWING BALZAC'S PATH

1212
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:22,312
DO-YEON'S DREAM TOUR: FOLLOWING MONET

1213
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:23,781
It's so pretty!

1214
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:25,749
This is the moment I've been waiting for.

1215
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:26,817
It's starting!

1216
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:28,485
No way.

1217
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:30,387
LIGHTS IN THE NIGHT,
SPARKLING LIKE FRIENDSHIP

1218
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:31,688
TOUCHED

1219
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:36,160
THEY CAME FILLED WITH ROMANCE

1220
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:38,095
SWEET, COZY, AND COMFORTING

1221
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:40,264
DO-YEON AND OK-SEOP

1222
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,065
JOIN THEM ON THEIR TRIP

1223
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,200
May our friendship last forever.

1224
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:44,468
ROMANTIC AND THERAPEUTIC
BEST FRIENDS

1225
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:46,537
