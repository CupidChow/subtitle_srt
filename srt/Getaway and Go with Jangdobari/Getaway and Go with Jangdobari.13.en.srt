00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,323
-That's fine by me.
-Do-yeon's speaking casually to me.

13
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,559
Yeongam is known for its figs.

14
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:28,828

I'm gonna take pictures.

00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:18,578
There's another one. It has a friend.

00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:19,779
You're right!

44
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,451

54
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,675

58
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:57,884
Doesn't it look like a cat selfie?

59
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,588
You're a great photographer.

60
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:02,822
FAKE SLEEPING FOR A SELFIE

00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,914
CAUGHT A WHIFF OF THE TREATS

71
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:33,920
Want more?

72
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:37,824
I love it when cats do this.
Sitting like chickens.

73
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,159
Don't fight, guys.

74
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:41,561
SHARING IS CARING

75
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,699
SPOTTED A PATIENT GINGER CAT

76
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,601
Oh my, that one's so cute!

77
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,470
You eat this for now.

78
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,306
My gosh, come here!

79
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:54,674
Come here, guys.

80
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,976
That one's a little cautious.
It looks scared.

81
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:58,711
It's okay. Come and eat this.

82
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,680
Don't steal! You have yours.

83
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,116
YES, MA'AM…

84
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,184
Sit.

85
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:05,552
No way.

86
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,488
It's sitting?

87
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,627
They like people.

88
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:17,664
GINGER CAT'S BACK

89
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:19,566
You're here.

90
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,901
I'd been waiting for you.
Just one more for you.

91
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:24,404
This is for your friend. Eat up, you.

92
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:27,507
Hao, do you want one?

93
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,976
I ate a lot of cake earlier, so I'm good.

94
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:32,579
Right, you're a human. Let's go.

95
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,515
They're adorable.

96
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:37,850
It was nice meeting you guys.

97
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:41,354
THANKS FOR THE FUN

98
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:42,655
Next on our itinerary

99
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,190
is climbing a mountain.

100
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:45,625
That's Wolchulsan Mountain.

101
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,397
EVEN AT A GLANCE,
WOLCHULSAN MOUNTAIN IS FAR AND HIGH

102
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:52,699
Let's say we climbed it.

103
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,667
-And not actually go?
-Yeah.

104
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,568
Sounds good.

105
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:58,404
I'm already there in spirit.
In spirit, I'm up there right now.

106
00:03:58,471 --> 00:03:59,305
-There?
-Yeah.

107
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,074
I'm almost at the peak.

108
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,443
Then let's jump here.

109
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:04,777
Okay, sure.

110
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:06,546
Three, two, one!

111
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,183
VARIETY SHOW ROOKIE OUTSMARTING DO-YEON

112
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,551
Man, that hurts my pride.

113
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,555
Let's do it again. I'm sorry.

114
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:16,990
-Let's jump together.
-You'll jump?

115
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:18,091
-I'll trust you.
-Sure.

116
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:19,425
Three, two, one!

117
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,529
LET'S JUST SAY THEY CLIMBED
WOLCHULSAN MOUNTAIN

118
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,466
EPISODE 13:
MY DOPAMINE HIT? YOU!

119
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,735
What's our latest dopamine fix?
I want to know his.

120
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,303
Wait, me?

121
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:34,073
My answer might be a little cliché,
but I'd have to say being on stage.

122
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:39,946
The moment I get on stage,
I feel like a different person.

123
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,581
That's so cool.

124
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,317
-What about you?
-What's my dopamine fix?

125
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:45,251
Me, right?

126
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,222
Nice! We got a clip for the trailer.

127
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:51,658
What excites me?

128
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:54,394
There are so many things that excite me.

129
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,363
Eating tasty food like this
gives me a huge dopamine rush.

130
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,400
If people laugh when I say something,
that gives me a rush too.

131
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,434
Expensive purses?

132
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:04,003
Shut it, you.

133
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,140
He said, "Expensive purses!"

134
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,311
Gosh darn it.

135
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:12,312
Sure.

136
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:15,214
I was told that being made fun of
is great for an entertainer.

137
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,417
They said it was material.

138
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:18,851
You know how

139
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:21,287
short dramas are popular these days.

140
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,389
-I'm totally into them.
-Any good ones?

141
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:26,292
-There's one about a cheating boyfriend.
-Right.

142
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,628
The female character
decides to get revenge.

143
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:33,232
So she goes and marries her ex's dad.

144
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,267
TRASHY PLOT ALERT

145
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,602
She's sitting at home like this.

146
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,371
And when her ex walks in,

147
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,707
she says, "Call me Mom."
That sort of thing.

148
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,510
There's a show like that.

149
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,412
Could I know the account?

150
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:51,417
I've finished binging
all of Love and War, you see.

151
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,020
It keeps popping up on Instagram,

152
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,823
but your feed
is all boneless chicken feet.

153
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,726
VERY DIFFERENT ALGORITHMS

154
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,061
How can I share it with you?

155
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,397
FOUND A CHINESE SHORT-FORM DRAMA

156
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:10,470
Isn't that for sleeping? ASMR?

157
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:13,773
My gosh.

158
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,074
What is it?

159
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:16,909
The first thing I saw

160
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,412
was a lady like this,
like a damsel in distress.

161
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,114
ACTRESS JANG GIVING A DEMONSTRATION

162
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,649
It says she's the fourth lady
of the house.

163
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,118
And behind her

164
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:26,686
is another woman.

165
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:30,623
She was wearing a work uniform like this.

166
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,758
The lady's here.

167
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,660
USING PROPS TO BRING THE STORY TO LIFE

168
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,363
These are the lady's knees.
She's sitting like this.

169
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,264
RIVETTING

170
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:41,200
The woman was watching her like this,

171
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,470
and then suddenly stabbed her.

172
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:45,972
-Really?
-Yeah.

173
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,708
-Is it Chinese?
-It is.

174
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:50,042
Can I have a look?

175
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,147
She got whipped for missing her curfew.

176
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:55,281
FILLING HAO IN

177
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,352
SILENCED FOR COPYRIGHT REASONS

178
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:01,821
I've seen this one.

179
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,657
TRUE SHORT-FORM ADDICT

180
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,092
Well, what happens next?

181
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,727
They're all dead.

182
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:11,164
Their entire family died three years ago.

183
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,064
UNEXPECTED TURN

184
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,833
She's planning her revenge.

185
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,669
Whoa, hey. Easy.

186
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,838
Let me watch this.

187
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,140
She's wearing a nightgown.

188
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,109
You shouldn't see this.

189
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:24,277
I'm 26, you know.

190
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:25,812
You are? No, you're not.

191
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,180
You're a baby. Don't look.

192
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:29,415
I'm going to watch… Hey, they're kissing.

193
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,117
Are you enjoying it alone?

194
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,318
Please leave, everyone.

195
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,120
I've found what makes me feel good.

196
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,388
This is my dopamine fix!

197
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,256
Go on. Keep going. More!

198
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:38,724
DOPAMINE ADDICT OFF THE RAILS

199
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:41,227
Don't change the angle.
Give us a proper view.

200
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:44,530
Can someone… take the phone off her?

201
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,200
At the end of all these shows,

202
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:48,935
there's always a poem in the subtitles.

203
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:51,304
"Women are strong." Like this.

204
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,943
There's always a moral.
They're educational.

205
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,077
They have a message.

206
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,545
-They do.
-That's important.

207
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,247
-A very profound message.
-Sure.

208
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,915
The funny thing is,

209
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,585
they also make period dramas like this.

210
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,686
In the show,

211
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:10,523
they'll have some secret to keep.

212
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,059
Then the king commands, "Confess!"

213
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,130
-And they really die.
-They're dead?

214
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,700
But if you look on their forehead,

215
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:23,302
they have a slight smear of ketchup.

216
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:24,704
But they're dead.

217
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,239
-They're doing that here too.
-Right?

218
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:27,840
In this show…

219
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:30,209
They've been brutally stabbed,
but it's chili sauce.

220
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,812
-Just here.
-It's perfectly scarlet.

221
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,247
CONDIMENTS PULL US BACK TO REALITY

222
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:37,483
I think all they're going for
is to make it clear they're dead.

223
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,985
The moral of this show is

224
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,320
that despite all that,
they still found love.

225
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,256
-They did?
-With the second master.

226
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:44,557
-At the end?
-It's finished.

227
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:45,458
A HAPPY ENDING

228
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,593
Amidst all that, they found true love.

229
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,629
Lives were lost along the way, but hey.

230
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,899
We heard that you tried acting.

231
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:54,967
-Yes.
-I heard you're starring in a series.

232
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,302
It's an MBC series.

233
00:08:57,803 --> 00:08:58,771
When did you film?

234
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,374
We filmed about two weeks ago.

235
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,777
I'm playing a Chinese student

236
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:08,214
who's dating a Korean girl.

237
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,049
Is it your first time acting?

238
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,717
-It is.
-How did you find it?

239
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:14,620
It was fun.
Almost like shooting a music video.

240
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,522
Well, you act in music videos.

241
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,659
Music videos are short,
but in this show, I actually had lines.

242
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,494
It could have been a little awkward,

243
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,462
but I was playing a foreigner,
which was easier.

244
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:24,730
Right.

245
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,900
I thought it was a great opportunity.

246
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,670
When would I ever get to act again?

247
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,338
It's very unlikely for me here

248
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,840
to get the chance to play

249
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,009
a Korean character.

250
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,045
Maybe some day in the future.

251
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:43,049
But because it was a foreign role,
I could take it on easily.

252
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,885
Now you can also act.

253
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:50,856
You do so many different things,
yet why do you worry about the future?

254
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,959
There are a lot of things you can do.

255
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,061
You're so multi-talented.

256
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:57,196
Why do you worry
about your longevity as a celebrity?

257
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:00,132
It's not about longevity.
I just know I can't do it forever.

258
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,033
Forever?

259
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,604
In some ways,
there are a lot of things I can do,

260
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,906
but frankly speaking,
my looks are my greatest weapon.

261
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,977
I can't argue otherwise.

262
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,545
And looks

263
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,547
can't be preserved forever.

264
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,083
INCREDIBLY PRACTICAL DESPITE HIS AGE

265
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:18,451
So naturally, I worry.

266
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:19,986
How many years do you have?

267
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:21,887
Until thirty… five?

268
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,556
-That's too early.
-You think?

269
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,091
Thirty-five is way too early.

270
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:28,060
These days,
35 is still considered "prime."

271
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,362
But to eat…

272
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:31,430
To eat a living with your looks…

273
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,065
-Earn a living?
-Yes.

274
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,233
Oh, earn a living.

275
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,568
Earning a living.

276
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,237
A single word
makes a world of a difference.

277
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,106
Eating a living and earning a living.

278
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,240
But I get you.

279
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,242
You're right. Looks aren't everything.

280
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,111
Still, you have so much more.

281
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,213
And your whole attitude.

282
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,314
You're so humble.

283
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,082
-Am I?
-You have a very healthy mindset.

284
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:50,983
Thank you.

285
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,754
Does someone guide you,
or is that just how you've come to feel?

286
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,688
I picked it up

287
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:57,189
from Han-bin.

288
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:58,891
-Your halmeoni?
-Han-bin.

289
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,159
Oh, so not your granny.

290
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:04,363
I was trying to naturally segue
to a heartwarming talk about your family.

291
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,866
I was going to ask,
"What did your grandma teach you?"

292
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:10,302
That's okay. Talking about my group
is also heartwarming.

293
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,405
Well, what did Han-bin tell you?

294
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,775
In Chinese culture,
we tend not to say "thank you,"

295
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,878
especially to those we're close to.

296
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:24,216
Saying thanks makes it feel like
they're not as close to you.

297
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:26,419
So we tend not to express our gratitude.

298
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,587
But when I came to Korea,

299
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:32,925
I saw people thanking one another,
and I started to pick it up.

300
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:36,896
Han-bin really taught me
how to impress elders and higher-ups.

301
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:39,131
Expressing gratitude is really important.

302
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,500
I did feel a cultural difference,

303
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,502
but I'm adapting more and more.

304
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,071
-And being humble?
-Yes.

305
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:47,406
-I'm not all that humble, really.
-No way.

306
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:50,209
A truly humble person
doesn't know they're humble.

307
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,644
-Really?
-Yes.

308
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,412
Honestly. I'm learning a lot from you.

309
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,947
I should be more humble.

310
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,649
-Have you seen this?
-What?

311
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,151
-They're cute. I saw them earlier.
-They're stickers.

312
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,453
Can I put them on you?

313
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,221
Really? Do you have them with you?

314
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:03,923
-I do.
-Then yes, I want to!

315
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:05,858
My nails aren't trimmed at all.

316
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:06,859
Wait here.

317
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,295
He's so cute.

318
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,564
Let's go.

319
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,032
Time to go now.

320
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,102
Go before he gets back.

321
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,270
-Take a nap.
-Sure thing.

322
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,176
Finally, this Gucci bag is mine!

323
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,981
A Gucci bag, no less!

324
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,217
YouTube folks, use this as a thumbnail!

325
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:36,155
DID JANG DO-YEON ACTUALLY STEAL?
NO, MY BAG!

326
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,624
He doesn't seem to tire.

327
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,294
He didn't just go home, did he?

328
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,664
Then I guess his Gucci bag is mine.

329
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,870
I have a new hobby these days.

330
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,271
THANKFULLY, HE DIDN'T RUN AWAY

331
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:53,506
I stuck them like this.

332
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,908
NAIL STICKERS HAO APPLIED HIMSELF

333
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,042
You have a good collection.

334
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,979
They're actually my nail tech's.

335
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,383
OH, YOU CAUGHT ME

336
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,152
I thought you'd gone home.

337
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:09,355
I was going to, but they came…
They caught me.

338
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:10,623
-They did?
-Yeah.

339
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:13,692
I thought you'd wake me if I slept there,
so I slept in the bathroom.

340
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,797
-Because you can't enter the ladies' room.
-Did you sleep well?

341
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,565
Yeah, I feel so refreshed.

342
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,738
(RUSTLING)

343
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,473
-Are they all yours?
-My nail tech's.

344
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,242
-There are so many.
-Right?

345
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,710
(THICK)

346
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,345
When I was filming

347
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:36,916
an ad campaign for a makeup product,

348
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,185
I had to wear these nail stickers.

349
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:41,887
They looked so pretty on camera,

350
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,022
and I fell in love.

351
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:44,790
You've worn them ever since?

352
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,458
Yes, for three days now.

353
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:47,426
Three days?

354
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,695
I'm wearing one that says "angry"
to fit my mood.

355
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,831
Why would you be angry?

356
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:54,466
You're right.

357
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,402
Did you mean to say the angle isn't right?

358
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:57,970
THAT'S A STRETCH…

359
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,206
Come on, you don't have to look
so disgusted.

360
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,275
It's all about the attitude.

361
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,311
If you tell people you're angry,

362
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,479
they won't mess with you.

363
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,181
-So they're for the charisma?
-Exactly.

364
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,184
Do you wear these on stage? No, right?

365
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:14,186
We can, but I've never tried.

366
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:18,023
I haven't been on stage in the three days
since I started wearing them.

367
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,160
You've only worn them for three days?

368
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:23,929
That's why…

369
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:26,332
-I guess you'd want to show them off.
-Yes.

370
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,300
I like stars.

371
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,603
-Stars?
-I like stars.

372
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:33,005
The silver ones look more bougie.

373
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:34,907
Hey, my bag's still here.

374
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,211
I thought you'd taken it.

375
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:40,846
DUMBFOUNDED

376
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:44,483
Going to the car to grab these
wasn't an excuse to see

377
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,951
whether I'd take your bag, was it?

378
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:47,786
A character test.

379
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,323
GETTING INTO THIS NAIL STICKER THING

380
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,325
The hearts are cute.
Let me try one of these.

381
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,494
-How is it?
-It's fun.

382
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,996
It feels like I'm playing dress-up.

383
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:05,437
How about these ones?

384
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:07,106
-I'm wearing this one.
-This one's cute!

385
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:08,741
-A smiley face!
-Yeah, a smiley.

386
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,278
-It's right up my alley.
-Right?

387
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,150
I didn't mean to do that!

388
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:19,618
IT WASN'T MEANT LIKE THAT

389
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,787
I should have shown it like this.

390
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,490
It's a little risky,
so I'll show you like this.

391
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:26,959
Can I see?

392
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,030
I love this.

393
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,165
TA-DA

394
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:38,103
(DO-YEON,
WE CAN'T ACTUALLY SEE YOUR NAILS…)

395
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,674
Such a small thing,
but they're a great pick-me-up.

396
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:43,842
HAO'S TIME TO SHOW OFF

397
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:48,981
CHARISMATIC "ANGRY" SPOTTED

398
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,784
NOW SHOWING OFF HER CHICKEN FEET

399
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:53,285
Chicken feet.

400
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,088
When you use your hands,

401
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,223
try to show them off as much as you can.

402
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,992
LIKE THIS

403
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,694
Do I have to open my mouth?

404
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,662
-Whatever you feel like.
-Whatever? Okay.

405
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:04,763
Just show your nails.

406
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,932
-Okay.
-But we can't see them like this.

407
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:07,833
What should I do?

408
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,337
MODEL ANSWER
LIKE THIS

409
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,006
Then I'll pose.

410
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,581
Am I at the dentist?

411
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,116
Then I'll do something else.

412
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,651
-Maybe more aloof.
-Sure.

413
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,286
-Act coy.
-Okay.

414
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:28,721
COY TO THE MAX

415
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:33,125
NOONA'S ENTHUSIASTIC PHOTOGRAPHER

416
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,226
I've got it.

417
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:36,862
As long as you got the nails.

418
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,230
-It looks good.
-It does? Great.

419
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:39,264
PHOTOGRAPHER IS SATISFIED

420
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,334
WE'LL LET YOU BE THE JUDGES

421
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,069
Now, we're going to head somewhere else.

422
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:47,573
We're going to eat seafood
that's really famous in Yeongam.

423
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,908
Shall we do 50 jumping jacks?

424
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:50,976
To digest the food?

425
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,945
But we won't film that.

426
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,980
It's on our honor.

427
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:55,948
Sounds good.

428
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,883
-I'm really going to do them.
-Me too.

429
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,691
We've done them now, so let's go.

430
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,260
You really did them.
I didn't think you would.

431
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:11,163
-Me too. You were really going for it.
-I know, right?

432
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,865
UNDENIABLE ACTORS

433
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:14,600
I can't win you.

434
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,001
Let's go.

435
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:17,369
Wow, I'm sweating.

436
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,772
I'm sweaty. I'm covered in sweat.

437
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:22,975
-Wow.
-Let's compose ourselves and head off.

438
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,411
Let's go. This was lovely.

439
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:26,745
Thank you for the food.

440
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,147
FULLY RECHARGED AFTER COFFEE

441
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,915
Do-yeon, can I have your number?

442
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:30,849
Sure.

443
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:34,553
-The number of a true celebrity.
-Zero, two…

444
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,889
-Zero, two?
-Yeah, then six, four, three.

445
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:38,057
DAGGERS

446
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,591
JUST KIDDING

447
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,827
Just the zero two was strange.

448
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,030
-Is it really zero two?
-No.

449
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,001
EXCHANGED NUMBERS

450
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:53,839
Hao wants to ask you for advice
on appearing on variety shows.

451
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:55,741
-You do?
-Yeah.

452
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,143
You know those sayings of wisdom?

453
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,846
"The essence of comedy is repetition."

454
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:03,682
What is comedy to you?

455
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,084
Comedy to me?

456
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,252
It's a complex problem

457
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,288
that I still don't know the answer to.

458
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,223
I haven't found the solution.

459
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,193
I'm still searching for the solution.

460
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,262
Who came up with that?
"Comedy is repetition."

461
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,265
That's not a true saying.

462
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:23,202
It's all about improving the probability.

463
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:27,005
There's a higher probability
a joke will land if you repeat it,

464
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,875
so it's like a safety mechanism.

465
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,777
It's difficult, though.

466
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,046
Even comedians struggle with it.

467
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,949
Do you have a thirst for variety shows?

468
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:39,151
I do. A lot.

469
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:44,223
I want to do well,
and eventually, I'd like to host.

470
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,426
Right now,

471
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:50,863
I need someone who can hold the fort

472
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:52,965
and someone I can bounce my energy off.

473
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:57,269
But I'm curious how I'd fare as a host.

474
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,072
For starters,

475
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,242
wit isn't something that you can learn,

476
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,310
but you're a natural.

477
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,246
I am? Do you see potential?

478
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:10,549
Well, I'm in no position to judge anyone,

479
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,551
but from where I stand,

480
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:14,553
I find you hilarious.

481
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:19,057
Wherever you are,
I think you'll pull your weight.

482
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:20,792
What you bring to the table

483
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:23,529
is irreplaceable, like a durian fruit.

484
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:26,598
You have something that's unique to you.

485
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,901
A very distinct charm.

486
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,937
That's just my impression.

487
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:36,608
-I appreciate your sincerity.
-Honestly.

488
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,746
This place is really famous
for their galnak-tang.

489
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:44,383
I guess it's a soup
made from beef ribs and octopus.

490
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,485
-Sounds good.
-I've heard of it before.

491
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:48,053
They're like Jack and Rose.

492
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,688
WELCOMING COW AND OCTOPUS

493
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:50,689
Octopus!

494
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,858
Do you like octopus?

495
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,893
I do, but I can't eat it raw.

496
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,062
I like grilled octopus.

497
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:58,897
Why don't you like it raw?
Is it the texture?

498
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,365
The way it moves…

499
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:01,300
You feel bad?

500
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,202
Yeah, I feel bad. It's a little…

501
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,405
But even the grilled ones
were alive and kicking once.

502
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,373
But they can't tell you it's hot.

503
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,374
That's true.

504
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:12,878
I don't think
I'll ever win you in an argument.

505
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:16,281
You're Chinese,
and I still can't beat you in Korean.

506
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,418
I'm seeing a lot of octopuses.

507
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:22,588
DOKCHEON OCTOPUS STREET
A FOOD ALLEY KNOWN FOR OCTOPUS DISHES

508
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:24,523
All I see are octopuses.

509
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:26,925
Octopus tangtangi.

510
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,294
So you can't eat tangtangi?

511
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:30,762
They wriggle.

512
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:34,099
What's the difference
between raw octopus and tangtangi?

513
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,503
Raw octopuses are served whole.

514
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,405
But with tangtangi, it's all…

515
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:44,443
-They're chopped alive.
-So they're moving?

516
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:46,378
The chopped pieces wriggle.

517
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:49,414
I was thinking of chopped up raw octopus.

518
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:51,183
Right, then that's tangtangi.

519
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,384
I can't eat that.

520
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:55,354
But I do want to try it.

521
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,255
You do?

522
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,657
Just wait. I'm going to eat you.

523
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:01,493
ARRIVED AT THE OCTOPUS RESTAURANT

524
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,564
-Hello.
-Yes, welcome.

525
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,402
They have galnak-tang.

526
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,504
Wow, let's do one of everything.

527
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:13,538
It's octopuses galore.

528
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,274
Wow.

529
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,442
Shall we order this?
It's a bit of everything.

530
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:18,477
That sounds good.

531
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,245
-Then I'll order this.
-Okay.

532
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,214
These stickers make me feel good.

533
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:24,449
Ding-dong.

534
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:27,386
I feel like pointing.
Do you want this? Or this?

535
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,588
USING ALL HER FINGERS TO POINT

536
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:31,123
I'll have this.

537
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:32,424
HAO'S USING HIS PINKY

538
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:33,625
-This one here?
-Yeah.

539
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,662
These are great. They make me feel good.

540
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:40,365
(CAN'T STOP ADMIRING MY NAILS)

541
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:41,366
What can I get you?

542
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,602
-One of these.
-The course for three?

543
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,103
I'll eat for two people.

544
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,706
-I'll get that ready for you now.
-Thank you.

545
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,010
Why are there so many sides?

546
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:52,911
There's more.

547
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,346
She says there's more.

548
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:55,881
What's this, ma'am?

549
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:57,616
It's baendaengi jeotgal.

550
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:59,251
-Fermented herring?
-Yes.

551
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,220
I get the feeling you really like fish.

552
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:03,555
I do.

553
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:04,756
I also like jeotgal.

554
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,224
FIRST MENU OF THE OCTOPUS COURSE

555
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:10,562
1ST COURSE
CHOPPED UP OCTOPUS (NAKJI TANGTANGI)

556
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:12,497
First time trying it, right?

557
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:13,732
It smells so nutty!

558
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:16,034
"Hello, Hao!"

559
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,805
-Why's it a guy?
-"Please enjoy me."

560
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:21,206
This is really good.

561
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:22,541
It's moving too much.

562
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:23,475
Is it too much?

563
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,744
I'll try it first.

564
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,145
I love this dish.

565
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,114
NOM

566
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:30,982
-Without any sauce?
-Yeah.

567
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:32,718
It's all seasoned.

568
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:35,787
It's so good.

569
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,090
Don't they smack your mouth?

570
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:42,227
Occasionally, the suckers
will stick to the inside of your mouth.

571
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:43,762
But it's not bad.

572
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:46,598
We came to the right place.

573
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:49,368
Don't eat it if it's too much.
Don't force yourself.

574
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,339
-I want to try it.
-You don't have to.

575
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:55,774
Just don't look at me like that.

576
00:22:58,276 --> 00:22:59,478
I'm impressed.

577
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,481
I guess it's like when people tell me

578
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:05,550
to stop talking about eating frogs.

579
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:07,119
It could be, yes.

580
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:09,988
But it's all down to preference
and different food cultures.

581
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,089
SQUIRM

582
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,091
EEK

583
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,192
FLINCH

584
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,529
I want to try one that's not moving,

585
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,231
but if I touch it, it moves.

586
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:23,835
You're spot on.

587
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,837
It's a pretty hardcore dish.

588
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,839
A lot of Koreans can't eat it either.

589
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:32,711
STRETCH

590
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:38,717
STARE

591
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,222
CHEWCHEWCHEW

592
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:47,993
It's good.

593
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:51,930
Are you sure about that?

594
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:54,466
Yes, I think it's okay

595
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:57,369
because I chewed the octopus up

596
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,371
before it could realize
it was being eaten.

597
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,806
I want to try some more.

598
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:03,375
This isn't your first time
seeing this, is it?

599
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,278
-I've never seen it in the flesh.
-Really?

600
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:07,546
Face to face.

601
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:12,651
I'll help you out.

602
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,488
CHEWCHEWCHEW

603
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,695
I think I get why people eat this.

604
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:24,663
Why?

605
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:26,765
The texture's great.

606
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:27,833
You're right.

607
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:31,403
But even if you chew,
it doesn't break down.

608
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,871
So you just swallow it?

609
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:35,774
When you think you've chewed enough,
just swallow it.

610
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,175
At first, it can be scary

611
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:39,744
when the suckers stick to your mouth.

612
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,080
But you grow to enjoy it.

613
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,849
Is that the fun of eating it?

614
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:45,550
Yeah, the texture's fun.

615
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,452
I'll try and experience the fun.

616
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:54,426
CHEWING SLOWLY TO SAVOR THE TEXTURE

617
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,028
It didn't stick to my mouth.

618
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:58,363
-It didn't?
-It didn't.

619
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,198
ENTER SECOND OCTOPUS DISH

620
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:02,467
Wow, how pretty.

621
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,536
2ND COURSE
BLANCHED OCTOPUS

622
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:06,838
-Ma'am, what's this?
-It's just water.

623
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:10,275
REMEMBER TO STAY HYDRATED

624
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,143
I thought it was a dish.

625
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,279
It looked pretty fascinating.

626
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,915
I forgot to give it to you earlier.

627
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:18,917
Oh, thank you.

628
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:22,554
In Japanese restaurants,
they give you soup in these pots.

629
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:25,457
-You thought it was like that?
-Yes.

630
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,426
This will be easier for you to eat
since it's blanched.

631
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:29,494
Thank you.

632
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:30,395
Try it.

633
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:31,563
The funny thing is,

634
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,933
I'm fine with looking it in the eye
as long as it's cooked.

635
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,501
-Cooked is fine?
-Yeah.

636
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,504
This is so good.

637
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:40,405
SLURP

638
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,575
It's so tender.

639
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:45,010
And seasoned perfectly.

640
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:48,213
It's not the texture I imagined.

641
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:49,948
Yummy!

642
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,219
How is it so tender?
Maybe they only blanched it for a second.

643
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:56,655
We came to the right place.

644
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:02,394
CHOPSTICKS REACH FOR TANGTANGI

645
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,062
Hey, you're going back to it.

646
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,031
It's surprisingly fun.

647
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:08,099
That's how you get addicted.

648
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,703
SLOWLY GETTING USED TO THE MOVING OCTOPUS

649
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:15,974
And so, I've converted you.

650
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,008
I'm a fan.

651
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:20,045
-How is it now?
-Good.

652
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:22,347
I want to try a lively one.

653
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,615
That's a step up.

654
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:25,650
It's no fun if it's not moving.

655
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:31,189
Maybe you'll end up eating a whole one
like Choi Min-sik in Oldboy.

656
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,857
DOUBLE TAKE

657
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:34,526
Thin-legged octopus?

658
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:37,362
This is just

659
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,297
straight from the tank.

660
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:40,465
You're right.

661
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:42,434
They're all together.

662
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,769
I want to see what the dish looks like.

663
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:47,572
ORDERED THE THIN-LEGGED OCTOPUS

664
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:49,941
Did you order this?

665
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,743
-Yes.
-Here you are.

666
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,545
They're pretty small.

667
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,213
-Is this it?
-Do you know how to eat them?

668
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,815
No, please tell us. I've never had it.

669
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:58,049
Hello.

670
00:26:59,084 --> 00:26:59,985
Hello.

671
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:04,289
(GET AWAY)

672
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:05,190
(PEEKING)

673
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:06,791
I am kinda curious.

674
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:08,660
Me too. I'm watching like this.

675
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:10,729
You can't stop chewing.

676
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,731
It'll get caught in your throat.

677
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,368
It gets nuttier the more you chew.

678
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:18,003
How long do I need to chew?

679
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:18,903
Until it's dead.

680
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:20,472
(FROZEN)

681
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:21,706
The octopus or me?

682
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,175
The octopus, right?

683
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:25,777
We can't have you dying, Do-yeon.

684
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:27,579
-Will you be trying it?
-Yes.

685
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,147
Chew starting with the head.

686
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:30,248
DIP IN CHOJANG

687
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,083
Don't you need…

688
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,952
You need to chew until it's dead?

689
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:34,853
In one bite?

690
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,856
You just need to chew.
Hold it here. You'll be fine.

691
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:39,658
I'm sorry. Let's shake hands.

692
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:40,592
I'm sorry.

693
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:41,593
I really am.

694
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,694
Hold this here.

695
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:45,196
You're doing great. Don't let go.

696
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:46,564
Just keep chewing,

697
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:50,402
and when you think it's dead,
chew more and more.

698
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:52,971
Just keep chewing.

699
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:56,374
Do-yeon, you don't have to work so hard.

700
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:01,980
She can't talk right now.

701
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:06,851
If any of you guys have any complaints
about Do-yeon, air them out now.

702
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:08,453
(NO, DON'T)

703
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:10,655
It's dead.

704
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:11,890
It is, right?

705
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:13,825
SLURP

706
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:16,394
-Did you swallow it?
-Yes.

707
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:19,698
-That was interesting.
-It was your first time, right?

708
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:21,433
First time. It was a battle.

709
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:22,567
Did you want to give up?

710
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:23,802
-Halfway?
-No.

711
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,637
I couldn't give up

712
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:28,106
because he said one of us must die.

713
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,209
My dream is to live a long life.

714
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,011
I'm too young to die.

715
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:34,846
You should have danced.

716
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:37,749
Oh yeah, I forgot about that.

717
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,718
The tangtangi was child's play.

718
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,256
SLURP

719
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:48,526
SLURPING WITH NEWFOUND CONFIDENCE

720
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:50,428
LOOK AT ME, I ATE A WHOLE MOUTHFUL

721
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,263
I see that was a worthwhile demonstration.

722
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:54,799
Great.

723
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:57,502
-I've been looking forward to this most.
-What?

724
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,803
Here's the grilled octopus.

725
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:00,905
Make way for the main dish.

726
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,609
3RD COURSE
GRILLED OCTOPUS

727
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,244
Do you know how to eat this?

728
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:09,347
Oh, so we're meant to unravel them?

729
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:12,050
Wow, it smells smoky.

730
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:13,518
The head's the best part.

731
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:16,054
It smells great.

732
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:19,057
I want to enjoy it as is
and eat it on the stick.

733
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:20,191
Can I eat this one?

734
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:21,392
Of course.

735
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:23,728
The sauce looks yummy.

736
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:25,363
(GOING IN FOR THE HEAD)

737
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:29,667
Did you eat the head first?

738
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:32,203
-The head's so good.
-It is?

739
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:35,740
Is it good?

740
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:38,042
No way it smells like this and tastes bad.

741
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:43,782
BIG BITE

742
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,719
-It's so tender.
-Right?

743
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,686
Delicious.

744
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:50,355
I need scissors.

745
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,625
You seem to be enjoying this.

746
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,995
-Are my eyes sparkling with excitement?
-Yeah.

747
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:00,031
You're scaring me.

748
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:06,971
Do you think you could eat
raw octopus again?

749
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:08,006
I mean tangtangi.

750
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:09,307
I think I can.

751
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:11,442
Can I eat the head?

752
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,178
-Of course you can.
-Thank you.

753
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:15,613
I'm so happy you're enjoying the food.

754
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,681
Thank you.

755
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:19,784
(YUMMY)

756
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:21,386
Here's the stir-fry.

757
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:25,089
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

758
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,926
4TH COURSE
STIR-FRIED OCTOPUS

759
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:31,963
This looks really good.

760
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:34,532
Please mix it with rice.

761
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,168
RICE

762
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:38,803
STIR-FRIED OCTOPUS

763
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:42,740
-What's this?
-It's sesame oil and seaweed flakes.

764
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:44,509
SESAME OIL

765
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:46,511
SEAWEED FLAKES

766
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:47,846
You like seaweed, huh?

767
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:49,013
Looks great!

768
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,516
GIVE IT ALL A GOOD MIX

769
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:55,887
-The smell's very distinct.
-It's insane.

770
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:57,555
The sesame oil is so fragrant.

771
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,459
My nickname

772
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,461
is Foodie Zhang Hao.

773
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:09,133
Right. I heard that foodies like durian.

774
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,870
-I heard it's a delicacy.
-It is.

775
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:19,944
It's time to dance!

776
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:23,581
It's so good.

777
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:29,087
The texture of the stir-fried octopus

778
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:32,190
makes me think
they only briefly cooked this too.

779
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,692
This is also super tender.

780
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:36,928
Their course meal is great.

781
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,563
I could move here for this.

782
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,464
What?

783
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,568
-Are you serious?
-Honestly.

784
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:44,569
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

785
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,804
-Jeollanam-do…
-In Yeongam?

786
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:48,239
FOODIE APPROVES OF THE MEAL

787
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:49,908
Then, whenever you have a performance,

788
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:52,243
you'd need to leave at 2 a.m.
the day before. Is that okay?

789
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:55,847
"Hao's late. Where is he?"
"He's eating octopus."

790
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:58,549
Is that okay?

791
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:00,618
If you want to see me perform,
you need to come here.

792
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:04,122
I love the confidence.

793
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:05,423
Here's your main meal.

794
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:08,359
-What is it?
-This is galnak-tang.

795
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,028
5TH COURSE
BEEF SHORT RIB AND OCTOPUS SOUP

796
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,196
This looks really good.

797
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,435
Food for the soul.

798
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:18,703
Who are you?

799
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:23,641
(A BITE OF OCTOPUS)

800
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:27,345
It tastes like galbi-tang
but feels lighter and super nutty.

801
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:29,247
(A BIT OF BEEF)

802
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:32,150
The meat's delicious too.

803
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:34,585
DIPS HIS BIBIMBAP IN THE SOUP

804
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:37,689
-I think this will be good.
-Dipping it in the soup? You are a foodie.

805
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:44,963
NO SPOONS NEEDED

806
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:46,097
This is so good.

807
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:49,767
I really want to take this
directly to China

808
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:51,402
for my mom to try.

809
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,204
You think of your mom
when you have good food?

810
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:54,605
You're so sweet.

811
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:56,908
You can say whatever you want to.

812
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:59,510
Don't regret it later, on the ride home.

813
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:02,180
I think I will.

814
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:05,616
I'll be thinking to myself,
"I should have done better."

815
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:07,719
When I watch today's footage back,

816
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:10,088
I'll think,
"We should have gotten up to more fun…"

817
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,489
We should've climbed the mountain.

818
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:15,259
You said, "Let's not," right?

819
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,595
Now you're just way off-topic.

820
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:21,766
Anyways…

821
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,002
I told you to say everything,

822
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:26,738
but it was also a reminder to myself.

823
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:30,975
You know when you're sure
you'll look back and wish you'd done more?

824
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:33,544
But a touch of lingering regret

825
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:35,747
is what will bring us together again.

826
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:38,149
That was smooth.

827
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:40,351
I'd quite like to have said that myself.

828
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:44,455
But a touch of lingering regret
is what will bring us together again.

829
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,423
Wow.

830
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:51,963
You looked at me
like I'm a fraud just now.

831
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,865
No, just wow.

832
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:56,234
You have a way with words.

833
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:58,770
I'm so full.

834
00:33:58,836 --> 00:33:59,804
-Let's go.
-Okay.

835
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,372
NIGHT FALLS AFTER A GREAT MEAL

836
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:02,940
-Are you full now?
-Yes.

837
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:04,475
We still have one place to go.

838
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,411
-I think it's all gone down.
-It has?

839
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:07,745
This is a scary place.

840
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:12,150
We'll be a little short on time
if we walk,

841
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,651
so we're going to teleport there.

842
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,920
Three, two, one, go!

843
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:20,758
FLEW THROUGH THE NIGHT TO A PARK

844
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:22,493
-Do-yeon.
-Yeah?

845
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:24,062
My bag's gone.

846
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,029
-It has?
-Yeah.

847
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:26,864
I'm sorry. It's in my car.

848
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,600
When did you steal it?

849
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,135
Never let your guard down.

850
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,171
I'll give it back to you later.

851
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,106
Now, it's the last step of our trip.

852
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,874
This looks cute.

853
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:41,412
-It's like we're in a fairytale.
-Right?

854
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,081
The sculptures…

855
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:46,050
This display is so cute.

856
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:49,454
Who are you… Oh?

857
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,522
You're great at spotting cameras.

858
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:55,460
Fruit flies!

859
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:58,796
These fruit flies
are having a fruit punch party.

860
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:00,298
-You got that?
-Jangdo-party-party.

861
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:01,799
Exactly, yes!

862
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:06,471
-I think you're ready to fly solo now.
-Really?

863
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:08,439
This brings us

864
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,975
to the end of our trip.

865
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:12,310
Okay.

866
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:14,278
Is this the jeongja?

867
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:15,580
It is.

868
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,014
Let's go.

869
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:20,251
What is this?

870
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:21,619
These here

871
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:24,589
are our travel journals,
and it's time to write our entries.

872
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:26,257
-We'll be writing entries?
-Yes.

873
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:28,359
-However you like.
-Sure.

874
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:30,895
WRITING IN THEIR TRAVEL JOURNALS

875
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:38,970
REFLECTING ON THEIR TIME IN YEONGAM

876
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:45,176
HOW WILL THE PAIR REMEMBER THEIR TRIP?

877
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,116
DO-YEON'S FINISHED WRITING FIRST

878
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:55,253
GLANCE

879
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:56,721
I'm sorry.

880
00:35:57,855 --> 00:35:59,624
-I'm a sensitive guy.
-You are?

881
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:05,730
They say you shouldn't annoy
a baby brother going through puberty.

882
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,799
I'll just leisurely gaze out at the water.

883
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:11,903
What an awesome view.

884
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:20,978
TEEHEE

885
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:22,480
Now I think about it,

886
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:25,316
it was a little gloomy,
but we saw rainy Yeongam this morning,

887
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:28,319
then clear Yeongam, and now,
Yeongam enveloped by darkness.

888
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:32,323
I'm glad that we got to see Yeongam
in all of its glory.

889
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:37,595
PEEKING

890
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:39,530
He's writing an essay.

891
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:42,600
GLARE

892
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,105
We're going to be reading
our entries anyway.

893
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:50,575
You don't need to act so protective.

894
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:53,277
This feels like taking an exam.

895
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:54,879
No, this isn't an exam.

896
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:57,548
I think you've set a record
for the longest entry.

897
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:58,683
I have.

898
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:00,885
-I'm done.
-You are?

899
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:02,853
We're going to read them out loud.

900
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,655
You can't add any flourishes now.

901
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:05,756
Of course not.

902
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:09,026
-I won't.
-You can't freestyle it.

903
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:11,028
-I won't.
-Don't try and make it emotional.

904
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:13,864
"From Jeollanam-do, Yeongam."

905
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:15,900
"After meeting you on Salon Drip,

906
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:18,436
I thought I'd love to meet you again
on another show."

907
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:21,872
"I still can't quite believe
that my wish came true."

908
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:25,643
"On our trip together, I learned
just how charming and lovable you are."

909
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,412
"You'll be loved wherever you go."

910
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:30,314
In brackets, "I'm sure of it."

911
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:32,250
"I said this earlier,

912
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:34,518
but it's been a meaningful day for me

913
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:37,288
because I learned from your humility
in the way you approach work."

914
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:38,956
"This was lovely, so let's meet again."

915
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:40,625
"Maybe my wish will come true again."

916
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:43,761
"Thinking about it,
your name, Hao, is so fitting."

917
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:47,265
"Zhang Hao. Hen hao.
I don't know any more hanja."

918
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:49,500
That's my entry.

919
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:51,802
-It's so touching.
-Not really.

920
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:54,205
I thought I'd write
my plain, honest truth.

921
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,173
Could you read us your entry?

922
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,708
Just after yours?

923
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:58,609
Yes, go on.

924
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:05,716
"I finally finished the Jangdobari shoot,
which I'd been looking forward to,

925
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,452
and learned that wise sayings
are always right."

926
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:11,589
"It's not where you travel to
or what you do

927
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:14,025
but who you travel with that matters."

928
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:19,563
"I got to live as Do-yeon's baby brother,
Master Zhang, for a day,

929
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,633
and talking to her the entire day,

930
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,468
I learned so much from her."

931
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:26,837
"I'm happy to know we're a little closer."

932
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:28,873
"But, more than Jang Do-yeon,

933
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:31,709
the octopus we ate for dinner
is what truly moved me."

934
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:33,544
"Congratulations, octopus."

935
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:39,550
"Here, being at this final location

936
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:43,721
and walking these beautiful paths…
It all feels like a dream."

937
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:46,457
"I hate the thought of us
becoming strangers again in Seoul."

938
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:51,295
"Then again,
I have faith we'll meet again soon,

939
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:52,330
so I'll save goodbye

940
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:54,565
for the far, far future."

941
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:58,069
Lovely.

942
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:00,604
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

943
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,839
Now, give it back to me.

944
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:02,740
Okay, returned.

945
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:05,543
It was a great, sincere entry.

946
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:08,012
Aren't I good at writing in Korean too?

947
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,648
Yeah, you're good.
I think you're very expressive.

948
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:13,851
To wrap up, let's hear
your final thoughts on the trip.

949
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:15,019
Are we getting serious?

950
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:16,487
Yes, we are.

951
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:19,523
There's something I want to ask you.

952
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:22,793
You filmed with five different guests.

953
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,863
How would you rank today's trip?

954
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,733
I can't possibly rank that.

955
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,368
No? Come on.

956
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,236
There are no ranks.

957
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:33,137
Then…

958
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,005
-No ranks.
-No, still rank me.

959
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:37,975
Why? You're so stuck on audition shows.

960
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,444
Why do you always have to be first?

961
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:41,345
It's not that.

962
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:43,914
We're not filming Boys Planet here.

963
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:45,649
This isn't about survival.

964
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,718
Then, if you…

965
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:50,321
Will we meet again?

966
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:51,889
Of course.

967
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,924
You're so cute.

968
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:55,559
I'm still at a point

969
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:57,528
where I don't have complete confidence

970
00:39:57,595 --> 00:40:00,431
in whether I did a good job.

971
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:03,701
I'm still at a stage where,

972
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:07,138
to me, evaluation is very important.

973
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:10,841
Of course, I don't know much myself,

974
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:14,712
but just because you've asked me
a lot of questions today…

975
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:16,647
After spending the day with you,

976
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:19,917
I think you shouldn't worry too much
about being judged on everything.

977
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,986
I think you could

978
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:24,188
loosen up a little in that regard.

979
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,724
I get why that mindset's important

980
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:30,094
when delivering a flawless performance,
for example,

981
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:32,229
in your job as a musician.

982
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:34,965
But when you're showing yourself
on other variety shows,

983
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:36,834
don't be too anxious.

984
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:41,071
Don't stress yourself out too much,
thinking you should study up

985
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,174
and do everything to a T.

986
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,775
You're more than charming enough.

987
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,178
-Honestly.
-Thank you.

988
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:49,079
On variety shows,

989
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:51,615
just think of being in it for the ride.

990
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:53,350
Here,

991
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:55,953
you're the host,

992
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:59,824
and you're a TV personality
that anyone would trust.

993
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:02,359
I hope to be like you.

994
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:04,195
-I really do.
-You do?

995
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:06,130
At first,

996
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,632
I just thought of you

997
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:10,601
as someone who's famous.

998
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:14,071
But after meeting you twice,
you've become my role model.

999
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,474
-Really?
-Yeah.

1000
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,243
Thank you. I had such a fun day.

1001
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,011
Really? Thanks for saying that.

1002
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:22,546
That's so moving.

1003
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,582
In terms of moving me, you're first.

1004
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,183
-More than the octopus?
-Yeah.

1005
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,985
-Wait, octopus?
-I meant your other guests.

1006
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:31,889
I had four other guests, and you want me
to compare you to the octopus?

1007
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:34,191
They were dead! Come on.

1008
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:38,362
To elaborate, every trip was fun,
I'd love to see each guest again,

1009
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:41,398
and each trip left me feeling
I could have done better.

1010
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:43,334
But in terms of ending the trip

1011
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,871
on such a moving moment,
I think this trip with you takes the cake.

1012
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:49,907
Really?
That's more than good enough for me.

1013
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:54,445
When you're going home tonight,
tell yourself, "Zhang Hao, you did great."

1014
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,180
Have a restful trip back to Seoul.

1015
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:58,549
And, if I feel like I should,

1016
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:00,351
I'll message you.

1017
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:01,886
Can I leave you on read?

1018
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:06,390
Actually, at the end of my journal entry,

1019
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:08,025
I wanted to say,

1020
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:10,961
"If I message you on KakaoTalk,
please reply to me."

1021
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,863
But I didn't, in case it'd be too forward.

1022
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,798
-No, it's fine.
-Then I'll message you.

1023
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,200
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

1024
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:18,469
Remember my number? Zero, one, seven…

1025
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,503
Zero, two…

1026
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:22,473
Zero, two.

1027
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,041
You've learned everything.

1028
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,477
You're ready to leave the nest.

1029
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,712
Thank you. I had such a great time,
so let's meet again.

1030
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:29,613
Okay.

1031
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:31,415
Is this a verbal contract?

1032
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:34,051
It's not a verbal contract.

1033
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:36,554
You know when the directors slate
at the end of a shoot?

1034
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:40,224
Once, they only had one free hand
while holding the cameras.

1035
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:41,692
Do you know how they did the slate?

1036
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:43,060
Put your palm out like this.

1037
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:44,395
They did this.

1038
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:46,463
-Isn't that awesome?
-Teamwork.

1039
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:47,831
-Teamwork.
-Then I'll try it.

1040
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:48,799
Go ahead.

1041
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,168
This is the end of the trip!
Time for the slate.

1042
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:55,306
Exit.

1043
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,842
Finished! That was lovely.

1044
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:01,545
-Thanks for your hard work, everyone.
-Great work.

1045
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:08,118
ZHANG HAO

1046
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:14,525

ZHANG HAO AND DO-YEON

1048
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:23,734
'TWAS SUMMER IN GANGNEUNG
WITH SHIMMERING WAVES

1049
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:25,536
I'm the 22nd Ok-sun.

1050
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,004
OK-SUN
LADY WITH BUNDLES OF STORIES

1051
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:28,939
I'm so nervous right now.

1052
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:31,241
I'm feeling a little embarrassed.

1053
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:32,810
YEONG-SU
SOFT-SPOKEN SHY BOY

1054
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:33,978
Ok-sun!

1055
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:37,114
It's me, Yeong-su…

1056
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:41,352
THIS AWKWARD DUO

1057
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:43,354
HAVE COME TO GANGNEUNG?

1058
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,556
They say Gangneung
is the capital of coffee.

1059
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,891
I was told you're a coffee lover.

1060
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,094
AN ELEGANT COFFEE TOUR

1061
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:52,563
SPEECHLESS

1062
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,597
This is delicious.

1063
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:56,000
TAE-GOO'S EYES SAY IT ALL

1064
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:58,936
A VARIETY OF COFFEE FLAVORS,
LIVING UP TO ITS REPUTATION

1065
00:43:59,003 --> 00:44:00,504
Wait. Are you okay?

1066
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:02,840
-You seem a little drowsy.
-No, I'm good.

1067
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:04,041
A SUDDEN MEDICAL ISSUE?

1068
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:06,543
Don't you remember last night?
You said you liked me.

1069
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:07,711
ALL OF A SUDDEN…?

1070
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:09,847
-What did you do yesterday?
-There you go again.

1071
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:11,515
Can we do a skit?

1072
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:12,816
Another skit…

1073
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:14,151
TAE-GOO'S STUCK ON SKITS

1074
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:15,185
NO, PLEASE STOP

1075
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:16,353
We're good.

1076
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,255
IF YOU'RE CURIOUS TO SEE

1077
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,791
TAE-GOO'S BOLD TRANSFORMATION

1078
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:22,059
Shall we start over?

1079
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:24,061
God, please, no.

1080
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:25,195
I'm tired now!

1081
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:28,065
