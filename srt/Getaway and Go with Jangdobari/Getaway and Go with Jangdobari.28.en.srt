1
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:05,839
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

2
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:14,814
Hello. Bound for a breezy break
with bundles of stories in my bag.

3
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:16,649
I'm Jang Do-yeon
of Getaway and Go with Jangdobari.

4
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:19,619
Where am I now, you ask?

5
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,354
A city filled to the brim
with clear water.

6
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:22,722
It's Pocheon, Gyeonggi Province.

7
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:30,630
CLEAR WATERS AND GREEN FORESTS

8
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:35,101
A TRAVEL DESTINATION NESTLED IN NATURE
POCHEON, GYEONGGI PROVINCE

9
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:39,672
WHAT KIND OF EXCITING ADVENTURE
AWAITS US IN POCHEON?

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,408
Take a look.

11
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:43,843
I'm here at the famous Sanjeong Lake.

12
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,479
"San" means mountain,
while "jeong" means a well.

13
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,947
Together, it's a lake
embraced by a forest.

14
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:50,283
I don't know if the camera
can get the whole lake in frame,

15
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,585
but my gosh… It's huge.

16
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:54,754
We have fine, clear weather today,

17
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:55,989
the best kind.

18
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,757
It's a great day for walks.

19
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:00,493
So let me think about the best way

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,796
to introduce today's travel buddy.

21
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:07,700
PEEKABOO

22
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:10,703
CHUCKLING

23
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,640
I'm extremely nervous today.

24
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:16,976
Should I even be allowed to have
this one-on-one time with her?

25
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:20,647
I'd love to get to know Do-yeon better.

26
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:22,449
I'll make my move on her today.

27
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,718
WISH ME LUCK!

28
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,121
No way.

29
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:31,091
I've been a fan since season one.

30
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:34,828
The second episode
with Director Yi drops today,

31
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:36,629
and I'm looking forward to it.

32
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:37,697
Impressive, right?

33
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:41,167
I've watched all the episodes
since the pilot with Byun Yo-han.

34
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:43,470
Not bad, right?

35
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,472
Sweet.

36
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:49,742
I'm 26 now, but this is still fun.

37
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,478
It's beautiful here.

38
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:52,812
I see you even launched a drone.

39
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,915
WAITING FOR DO-YEON,
ENJOYING THE PLEASANT VIEW

40
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:59,586
THEIR OPENING SHOOTS TOOK PLACE
FAIRLY CLOSE BY

41
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:03,089
LAUGHING

42
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,058
OH NO…

43
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,926
I'm Jang Do-yeon
of Getaway and Go with Jangdobari.

44
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:09,362
CLAPPING

45
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,763
It's Pocheon, Gyeonggi Province.

46
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,066
COPYING DO-YEON IN SECRET

47
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,768
The show, Getaway and Go with Jangdobari,

48
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:19,839
came about
because of this celebrity's words.

49
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:23,042
She's like a mother to the show.

50
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,478
Hong Seok-cheon is known
for having a box of gems,

51
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:28,314
so it's only reasonable
that I have one of my own.

52
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:31,718
Out of all the gems in my gem box,
she sits in the very middle.

53
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:33,520
SITTING IN THE CENTER OF DO-YEON'S GEM BOX

54
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:34,787
The center?

55
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:37,157
Now, where's my travel buddy?

56
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,696
THE MOTHER APPEARS FROM RIGHT NEXT TO HER

57
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:48,234
-Goodness.
-Gosh, it's so good to see you!

58
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,203
A WARM EMBRACE

59
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,671
Mom!

60
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,406
No way.

61
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,775
KARINA
SINGER & ONE OF DO-YEON'S GEMS

62
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:56,976
No way.

63
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:58,178
She looks like a doll.

64
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,680
-Do-yeon.
-KARINA.

65
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:03,716
THEY MET FOR THE FIRST TIME
ON SALON DRIP 2

66
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,187
I'm a huge fan.

67
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:08,721
SHE IMMEDIATELY FANGIRLED OVER DO-YEON

68
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,290
I mean that. Treat me however you want.

69
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,624
-Do whatever you want with me.
-What?

70
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,494
-You have such an easygoing personality.
-I'm always playing pranks,

71
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:17,363
making people laugh, and enjoying memes.

72
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,965
People say I'm a lot like Shin-chan.

73
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,135
I bet you're in high demand
on variety shows.

74
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,938
-Is there a show you want to be on?
-A show I want to be on?

75
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:26,839
I want to be on a show
that involves traveling.

76
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,875
-Would you like to join me?
-Me?

77
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,343
SHYLY SUGGESTING A TRIP

78
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,644
Then, get in here.

79
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,012
BEING PUT INTO DO-YEON'S GEM BOX

80
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,480
Will we get the chance?

81
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:36,783
No way!

82
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,251
Are you kidding me?

83
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,786
How did you get even prettier?

84
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:41,287
SCREAMING!

85
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,990
You're too close.

86
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,625
Too soon, I guess.

87
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,293
Should we keep our distance for now?

88
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,828
It feels like
I'm at your fan meet-and-greet.

89
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,331
-How so?
-Because I'm a huge fan.

90
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:55,201
-Aren't you cold dressed like that?
-I'm bundled up pretty well.

91
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,736
Look, we're both in gray.

92
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,538
-Right?
-It's like we planned this.

93
00:03:58,605 --> 00:03:59,606
Even the shoes.

94
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,441
The shoes? You're right.

95
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:05,545
I'm sure you're very busy these days.

96
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,547
How did you make time for this show?

97
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:08,915
Of course I should be here.

98
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,851
I heard you mention that I gave birth
to the show or something like that.

99
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,186
Sorry. I was loud, wasn't I?

100
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,589
You even referred to me as the mother,
so of course I should be here.

101
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,192
It's one of my favorite shows,
and I've watched every episode.

102
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,028
Really?
The staff told me about it earlier.

103
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,764
Normally, since everyone's busy,

104
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,399
people just watch short clips

105
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:29,068
or learn about the show
through quick searches,

106
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:30,503
but you actually watched
the full episodes.

107
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,904
Yes, every single one of them.

108
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,440
I could show you my Netflix watch history.

109
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:35,908
Really? Thank you so much.

110
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,977
Can I ask which episode was your favorite?

111
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,379
-Well…
-Yes?

112
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,749
Somehow, I enjoyed the ones
where you went abroad.

113
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:45,485
-Byun Yo-han's, Ga-bee's…
-Yo-han's, I see.

114
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,387
…and the recent one
with Director Yi Ok-seop.

115
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,855
-Only part one has aired.
-That's right.

116
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:52,525
-You actually know that?
-Today is November 1, and it airs today.

117
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:55,228
No way.
There's a reason why people love her.

118
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:59,899
What's your style of vacation
when you travel?

119
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,401
What do you want the trip to be like?

120
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,836
I'm the spontaneous type,

121
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:05,038
so I'm open to anything.

122
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:06,973
-Anything?
-I'm down for anything.

123
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,841
Even if the weather is bad

124
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,643
or restaurants are closed?

125
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,945
-I'm happy either way.
-Even if plans change?

126
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:14,213
-You're happy either way?
-Totally.

127
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,417
Just one thing.
I'd like to have a drink in the evening.

128
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,751
-A drink?
-I enjoy drinking.

129
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,120
That… You don't have to ask me twice.

130
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,090
-This isn't too strong, is it?
-Sure.

131
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,759
Drinking is fine by me.
Besides that, everything works for you?

132
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:30,463
I'm terrible at making up my mind.

133
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,631
You can leave that to me.

134
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,967
-So sexy.
-Let's go, then.

135
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,636
-How's that?
-Let's just go.

136
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,004
I love it.

137
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,939
-I go along with whatever.
-Hold on.

138
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,040
Since you're really busy,

139
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:43,776
we weren't sure you'd be able to come

140
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,445
when we first suggested the trip,

141
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,281
but you said you wanted at least

142
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,816
an overnight trip.

143
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,151
-Is that right?
-Yes, I wanted an overnight trip.

144
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:53,519
-Really?
-Yes.

145
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:57,357
I'm pretty skeptical,
so when I heard you liked the show,

146
00:05:57,423 --> 00:06:00,259
I told the producer they had to be lying.

147
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:03,363
I asked if you really said
you wanted an overnight trip.

148
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:04,497
Yes, totally.

149
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,766
It was supposed to be

150
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,468
-a day trip at first.
-That's right.

151
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,003
My immediate response was, "Why?"

152
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,973
"Is it because
I'm not that close to Do-yeon?"

153
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,775
I was like, "That's not fair."

154
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:19,212
"Can you ask Do-yeon
if we can do an overnight trip instead?"

155
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,713
Really?

156
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,915
Thank you so much. We owe it all to you.

157
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:25,284
It's the final trip of the season,

158
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:26,486
so a day trip felt too short,

159
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,755
but we were all planning
to rest the next day.

160
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,591
You made it so we all have
to work tomorrow too,

161
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:32,992
-so we're absolutely thrilled.
-Happy!

162
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,561
Oh, no.

163
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:37,430
I inconvenienced everyone, didn't I?

164
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,098
Gosh, no. Don't say that.

165
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,501
-How rude of me.
-The staff really appreciated it.

166
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,569
We're delighted that you want
to be part of the show.

167
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,838
It's a show I absolutely love.

168
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,974
Thank you so much. No way.

169
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,676
Anyway, there's a theme
to the season three trips.

170
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:54,614
We're experiencing things
we normally wouldn't.

171
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:56,215
I love it.

172
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:59,919
Even though I wouldn't normally do it,

173
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:03,222
I decided to give it a try
because we're on a trip.

174
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,690
I love that. What have you done so far?

175
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:05,892
We went to an indoor climbing gym.

176
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,493
Whoa, isn't that really hard?

177
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,229
It was, but my travel buddy
was good at it.

178
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,765
Thanks to him and his support,

179
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,834
I was able to have fun.

180
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:18,838
SHE WENT GO-KARTING WITH JUN-YOUNG

181
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:24,277
I had the privilege of hearing
about the episodes that haven't aired yet.

182
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:26,779
So tell me. What's something

183
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,247
you normally wouldn't do

184
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,383
but might try on a trip?

185
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,618
-Hiking.
-Hiking?

186
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,522
With a mountain behind me,
that sounds like a nightmare.

187
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:37,857
I wouldn't go.

188
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:39,392
-I wouldn't either.
-Taking a dive?

189
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,027
-There's a lake here.
-I know.

190
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:42,862
I'd rather not disturb the wildlife
in the lake,

191
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,063
so I'd skip that too.

192
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,264
Let's not do those two.

193
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,200
-Fine by me.
-Instead,

194
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:48,434
we'll do something else.

195
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,502
What was it?

196
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,571
Dust suddenly blew my way,

197
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:53,739
startling me.

198
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:58,911
My reactions are a bit exaggerated,

199
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,279
so I might startle you.

200
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:01,814
Hardly. I actually like it.

201
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,149
SMIRKING

202
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,685
What was that?

203
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:06,752
AAARGH

204
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,389
What was that all about?

205
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,325
-I felt awkward, that's all.
-Do you feel awkward?

206
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:13,926
That's pretty normal.

207
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:14,994
Wouldn't it be?

208
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,128
-Of course.
-Of course.

209
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,264
-Of course.
-Let's go, then.

210
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,532
We're off to eat.

211
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,135
-A meal will help ease the awkwardness.
-I love it.

212
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,770
-Shall we?
-Shall we?

213
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:26,405
Let's go.

214
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:27,473
OFF TO AN AWKWARD START

215
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,108
Here. This way.

216
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:31,844
-Thanks.
-In you go.

217
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,779
-Nice.
-Take care!

218
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,015
Sure. Good job today.

219
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,951
I see the driver isn't in his seat.

220
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,256
-That could've gone badly.
-What a relief.

221
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:44,991
Off we go.

222
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:51,531
EPISODE 7
JANG-KA-SEOL, THE STORY BEGINS

223
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:52,798
-When is your movie coming out?
-What?

224
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,200
YOUR COUNTRY
WHEN IS YOUR MOVIE COMING OUT?

225
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,601
Director Yi.

226
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,004
Hurry up with the editing, will you?

227
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,739
Director, did you have fun in Paris?

228
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,141
SAID BY A TRUE FAN
OF GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

229
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,610
-You worked together on "Rich Man."
-That's right.

230
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:07,413
I was struck
by how stunning she was in person.

231
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,915
-You mean, Director Yi?
-Yes.

232
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,683
Are you sure it wasn't someone else?

233
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,352
Of course not. It was her.

234
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:14,787
I recognized her from her photos.

235
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,389
-She's the best.
-She really is.

236
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,590
She's fun and witty.

237
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,492
In Korea, it's more like
three degrees of separation.

238
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,793
That's why you should live honorably.

239
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,094
That's true.

240
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,830
I'm pretty fidgety and all over the place.

241
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,033
-Really? You don't seem that way.
-You startled me.

242
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,167
Fidgety, aren't I?

243
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,369
That was just a reaction.

244
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,972
I'm sensitive to noise,

245
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,107
so everything feels louder to me.

246
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,443
Isn't that actually good for a singer?

247
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,712
Of course.
It's good to be sensitive to sound,

248
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,981
but I can even hear people talking
at the next table.

249
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,249
-Me too.
-Really?

250
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:44,951
Even when I'm chatting with my friends,

251
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,953
-I can hear people at the next table.
-Likewise.

252
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,055
I've never had anyone

253
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,923
-relate to this before.
-The hearing thing?

254
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,860
Wait, is it like this
when you go out to eat?

255
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,531
You probably hear people whispering,
"Hey, it's aespa," or "Hey, it's KARINA."

256
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,100
It's not just because you hear them.
When you hear your name, you…

257
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,369
Exactly. Your name just jumps out at you.

258
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,638
You get hypersensitive.
So how do you handle that?

259
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:06,973
In my case,

260
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,808
I don't do anything special.

261
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:11,444
I just keep eating
and try to show my best angles.

262
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,779
I'm the worst, aren't I?

263
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,449
You're not.
Of course you're self-conscious.

264
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:18,250
What would be your best angle?

265
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:22,021
I look kinder from the left side,

266
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,656
so I try to face that way.

267
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,725
LETTING THEM SEE THE LEFT SIDE OF HER FACE

268
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:27,793
RETCHING

269
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,929
-Don't be like that.
-Can you pull over?

270
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,665
That's understandable.
Of course you're self-conscious.

271
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,600
I naturally dropped honorifics with you,
but can I continue?

272
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:35,935
Yes, totally.

273
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,136
Really? Got it.

274
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,505
Can I call you Ji-min
so it feels like we're closer?

275
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:40,606
SCREAMING!

276
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:42,475
THRILLED

277
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,645
We always decide on a rule for the trip,
and it got me thinking.

278
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:49,181
This is our first time together
after meeting on Salon Drip 2.

279
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:53,085
You said you were afraid of pigeons,
so I told you I'd chase them away.

280
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,854
I'm terrified of birds.

281
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,123
If we travel together,
I'll chase the birds away for you.

282
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,425
Wasn't that sexy?

283
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,694
THE PIGEON COMMENT WON KARINA OVER

284
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:04,096
I can protect you from all the birds.

285
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,765
Is there anything you don't eat?

286
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,733
I don't eat eggplant.

287
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,968
I watched that live stream you did.

288
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,870
You were eating tteokbokki,

289
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,104
-but one of the fritters…
-I remember.

290
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,205
You ordered fritters--

291
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:14,840
There was fried eggplant.

292
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,642
Out of all the things…

293
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:17,977
I'll eat all the eggplant instead.

294
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,311
I actually like eggplant.

295
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,647
-Nice.
-It's delicious.

296
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,115
Anything else… Right, cilantro.

297
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,251
-You don't eat cilantro?
-But I don't mind the smell.

298
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:28,621
But if the leaves get in my mouth…

299
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:32,558
-Aren't you good with exotic spices?
-I like them.

300
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,296
I'm kind of a walking contradiction.

301
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,598
No, everyone's like that.

302
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:42,201
There was a time
when I couldn't eat chocolate.

303
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:46,138
Do you know why? I didn't like
the warm feeling in my throat

304
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,541
-when chocolate went down.
-I know what you mean.

305
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,177
Chocolate buns or cake…

306
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:52,578
-Don't you like them?
-They're not my favorite.

307
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,848
I think there are things
that taste better than chocolate.

308
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:57,917
I prefer sweet potatoes
and things like that.

309
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,318
Chestnuts.

310
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,087
-Do you like chestnuts?
-Sure.

311
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:02,788
My favorite is Mat… Maet…

312
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:05,057
-Matbam. I said Maetbam just now.
-Weren't you too excited just now?

313
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,792
I demolish packs of Matbam.

314
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:07,860
I love chestnuts.

315
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,261
Chestnuts and sweet potatoes.

316
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:12,832
-I love cake with chestnut mousse.
-Me too.

317
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,000
-I bet you love Mont Blanc.
-Totally.

318
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,368
I can't get enough of it.

319
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,938
It seems like we have similar tastes.

320
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:21,574
Nice. The fact
that we have so much in common

321
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,109
tells me our trip will go smoothly.

322
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,811
Do-yeon, what's your MBTI type?

323
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,213
I'm an ISFJ.

324
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,914
Only one of our traits matches.

325
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,483
I bet you're an extrovert.

326
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:33,619
-You're an E, aren't you?
-Take a guess.

327
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,254
I know you're an E and P.

328
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:36,455
You seem like an F.

329
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:37,523
-Yes.
-Are you?

330
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,226
So, are you an ENFP?

331
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,560
-I am.
-An ENFP.

332
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:44,063
Who else do I know that is an ENFP?

333
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,231
Ga-bee, maybe?

334
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:46,632
Is Ga-bee an ENFP?

335
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,736
A TEXTBOOK ENFP

336
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,607
HELP ME…

337
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,509
I wouldn't say I'm soul mates
with an ENFP,

338
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,978
but we can get along.

339
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,348
-Would you call it not bad?
-No, I'd say it's a good fit.

340
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:03,482
That's nice.

341
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,918
I can't say for sure that we get along,

342
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,887
since Ga-bee might think otherwise.

343
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,791
A lot of introverts end up coming my way.

344
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,693
Why do you think that is?

345
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,695
I'm good at small talk,

346
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,398
so there aren't any pauses
in conversations.

347
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,699
WOW…

348
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:21,867
That's the best.

349
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,703
You're not an overwhelming extrovert.

350
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,540
Sure, I'm not a huge extrovert.

351
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,742
I don't like going out
with people that much.

352
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,143
I enjoy being with people

353
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,712
and get energy from it,

354
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,214
but leaving the house is still a hassle.

355
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,882
-You're like an introvert.
-Right?

356
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,250
How do you feel
when something gets canceled?

357
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,318
-I love it.
-Me too.

358
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,320
-I'm happy. I want to be alone.
-I'm thrilled.

359
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:42,888
You still have a good time
when you go out.

360
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,790
Totally. I turn into a host.

361
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,325
I don't want to go home.

362
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,661
-It's time to eat.
-Sounds good.

363
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:49,895
I bet this will be delicious.

364
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,897
We're having Idong galbi.

365
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,500
-Is meat okay for breakfast?
-Totally.

366
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,268
I heard you're a big eater.

367
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,471
It smells incredible.

368
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,443
Right. We're here
at an Idong galbi restaurant in Pocheon.

369
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,845
Have you had Idong galbi before?

370
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:07,646
-I haven't.
-Really?

371
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:11,483
This dish originated here
in Idong-myeon, Pocheon.

372
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:15,221
Back when there was an army base
around here, it was commonly eaten

373
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,656
by soldiers and their visitors.

374
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:19,458
-There's a lot of love in this dish.
-Right.

375
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,260
Anyway, we're having
Pocheon's Idong galbi.

376
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:22,695
It's the best dish in Pocheon.

377
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:23,863
Nice.

378
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,664
-Goodness. Hello.
-Hello.

379
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:27,733
It'll just be the two of us
having barbecue,

380
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,768
so how much galbi should we order?

381
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:30,870
Two portions should do it.

382
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,371
-Just two portions?
-Yes.

383
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:33,439
There's unmarinated…

384
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:35,341
-Oh, you're having Idong galbi.
-Yes, Idong galbi.

385
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:36,909
Is unmarinated galbi better?

386
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,043
Would you like one of each?

387
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,079
-Yes, one and one.
-One unmarinated, one Idong-style, please.

388
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,714
-You're so pretty.
-Gosh, thanks.

389
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,016
-You're pretty too.
-What about me?

390
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,084
CLAPPING

391
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,386
Do you know how she did it just now?

392
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,388
To you, "You're so pretty."
To me, "You're pretty too."

393
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:50,823
I just meant you were stunning.

394
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,957
Right. I'm just kidding.

395
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,459
-One of each, then?
-Yes.

396
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:55,127
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

397
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:57,529
Do you cast actors to play them?

398
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:00,532
-The owners are always…
-The owners are always funny.

399
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:03,135
Our trip has been given
a theme and a title.

400
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,571
-What is it?
-The theme of our trip is…

401
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,173
-Any guesses?
-It's like I'm on Tails of Tales.

402
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,243
Take a guess.
It's three syllables in Korean.

403
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,378
TRIP THEME

404
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,813
It has a lot to do with you.

405
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,749
-aespa.
-aespa? That's not it.

406
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,651
-Jang Do-yeon.
-No.

407
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,152
-It's related to you.
-KARINA.

408
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,320
Am I getting close?

409
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,188
-Give me a hint.
-A hint?

410
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,723
K-pop fans

411
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,160
combined your name with two other artists.

412
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,762
-Is it Jang-Ka-Seol?
-That's the one.

413
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,697
-It's Jang-Ka-Seol.
-How did that become the theme?

414
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,166
TOP 3 VISUAL MEMBERS OF K-POP GROUPS:
JANG WON-YOUNG, KARINA, SULLYOON

415
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,468
-How--
-Any guesses why that's today's theme?

416
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:37,703
PONDERING

417
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,471
Jang Do-yeon…

418
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,041
-That's right.
-…and KARINA, let's go.

419
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,476
-What about S?
-What does S stand for?

420
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,245
Jang Do-yeon, KARINA,

421
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:47,446
-and Sul Woon-do?
-Seriously?

422
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:50,749
Mr. Sul, please come on out!

423
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:52,084
SIR, PLEASE COME ON OUT!

424
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:53,719
HAHA

425
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,387
-Did it work?
-It did.

426
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,789
-The bodyguard outside…
-I'm embarrassed.

427
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:58,257
…had to step back.

428
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,626
That was hilarious.

429
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,761
Jang Do-yeon and KARINA's

430
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,630
thrilling adventure.

431
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:06,565
I love it.

432
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:11,170
Have you ever considered
that some people might hate you?

433
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,538
-They exist.
-Do they?

434
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,940
Of course, I have some haters.

435
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,209
It's impossible not to like you
once they get to know you.

436
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,812
I haven't come across
anyone like that yet, fortunately.

437
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,414
Or maybe I'm oblivious.

438
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,515
Gosh, no.

439
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,718
A lot of people could've blacklisted me.

440
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:29,355
My mouth is watering.

441
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:31,056
This looks delicious.

442
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,059
-Do you like this?
-Are those bellflower roots?

443
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,894
-No, it's deodeok.
-Deodeok?

444
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,129
They're huge.

445
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,964
-I'll put the meat on the grill.
-Sure.

446
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,132
We'd love that.

447
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:43,669
UNMARINATED GALBI IS GRILLED FIRST

448
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:48,941
That looks so good.

449
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,710
-What's delicious is best.
-Of course.

450
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,112
This looks amazing.

451
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,181
Nice.

452
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,784
You may dig in now.

453
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,819
I'll have this one.

454
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:03,088
-Thank you for the meal.
-Thank you for the meal.

455
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:07,960
YUMMY

456
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,094
It's so good.

457
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,896
-Really?
-Yes.

458
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,164
It's absolutely delicious.

459
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,499
Please enjoy.

460
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:15,167
It's really good.

461
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:16,802
-Isn't it juicy?
-It is.

462
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,238
All the juices were locked inside.

463
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,174
It's so good.

464
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,080
NEXT, THEY TRY THE DEODEOK SALAD

465
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,215
The deodeok is nice and crunchy.

466
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,684
No way. And the sauce on it is amazing.

467
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:33,952
WHAT?

468
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:37,189
It's so crunchy.

469
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,724
I've never had deodeok
this crunchy before.

470
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:39,792
It's…

471
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,661
ASMR: HEAR THE CRUNCH

472
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,363
Spicy and sweet. It's delicious.

473
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,532
Do-yeon, do you cook?

474
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,000
Me? What about you?

475
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,701
-I don't cook at all.
-Me neither.

476
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:51,203
IN SYNC

477
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,971
What a stupid thing to ask.

478
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,107
Do you normally order in?

479
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:56,408
I mostly order in.

480
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,812
What do you order?
Is there something you're hooked on?

481
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:01,613
Seaweed soup with perilla seeds.

482
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,916
I found a place that makes it really well.

483
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,651
They don't do delivery,

484
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:07,052
but the soup is delicious.

485
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,855
-Do you have to get it to go?
-Yes. Recently,

486
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:13,358
I got to know Jihyo,

487
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,161
and she made me that soup at home.

488
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:17,963
I asked how it could be that good,

489
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,899
and she said it was from a place
with long lines.

490
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:23,535
Actually, there are two Ji-hyos
in the industry.

491
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,504
Is it Jihyo of TWICE
or actress Song Ji-hyo?

492
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,239
Jihyo of TWICE, right?

493
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:28,507
NODDING

494
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,744
To me, actress Ji-hyo
is the one I'd call unnie.

495
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:36,315
-Did you hang out at her place?
-Yes.

496
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:37,616
We recently got to know each other.

497
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,119
Was it just you two?

498
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,554
Ryujin was there, too.

499
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,289
She's a member of ITZY,
famous for her shoulder dance.

500
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:45,657
Her and

501
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:48,861
actress Han Su-a.

502
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:50,262
-So the four of you?
-Yes.

503
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:51,830
How did you four get together?

504
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:55,200
I only recently got to know Su-a,

505
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:57,503
and they were already friends with Ryujin.

506
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,771
Ryujin and I met in the morning,

507
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:03,342
and Su-a joined us around lunchtime.

508
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:06,078
-The three of us went to the zoo and…
-You went to the zoo?

509
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,047
-We went because I wouldn't stop whining.
-Which zoo?

510
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:10,983
-Seoul Children's Grand Park.
-No way.

511
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:12,918
That's adorable.

512
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,286
What did you do afterward?

513
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:17,189
The three of us went to Jihyo's place.

514
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,958
People joined the group one by one.

515
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,927
Did you part ways
after eating seaweed soup?

516
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,529
We had seaweed soup,

517
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:24,763
jokbal, and…

518
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,699
What do celebrities like you talk about?

519
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,637
Jihyo had a T-shirt.

520
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:35,374
It was a souvenir, and I got it from her
after whining that I wanted it.

521
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,608
You whine a lot, don't you?

522
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:40,245
I've only recently started making friends
who are older than me.

523
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:42,080
Until now,
everyone had been younger than me.

524
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:45,050
I made some older friends recently,
so I got excited.

525
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,552
Are you and Ryujin the same age?

526
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:49,154
No, Ryujin's a year younger than me.

527
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,023
I'm not treated
like the older sister, though.

528
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,726
Jihyo seems very down-to-earth.

529
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,361
-She's the best.
-Really?

530
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:57,896
-So it seems.
-I absolutely adore her.

531
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,199
She works out like crazy, too.

532
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,067
I saw her on Gym Jong-kook once.

533
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,536
They live in a different universe.

534
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:05,804
-Don't you like working out?
-Do you work out?

535
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,105
-I absolutely hate it.
-I hate it.

536
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,408
IN SYNC

537
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,777
REALIZING THEY HAVE MORE AND MORE
IN COMMON

538
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:14,746
What do you think?
I think I'm basically you at 40.

539
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:17,683
I love it.

540
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,519
You don't really need
a separate workout, though.

541
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:23,922
-You already move around a lot.
-That's true.

542
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,191
-Performing is already a workout.
-Exactly.

543
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:27,726
It must be exhausting.

544
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:30,162
-Still, it's a lot of fun.
-Is it?

545
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:31,797
MOVING ON TO MARINATED GALBI

546
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:32,931
This looks amazing.

547
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,101
It has a glossy sheen.

548
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,202
It's sexy.

549
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,737
It's refreshing.

550
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,005
Then…

551
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,040
THEN…

552
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:43,675
Damn, I don't want to lose,

553
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,111
but I can't think of anything!

554
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,814
Mine was totally random.
"Refreshing" doesn't even make sense.

555
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,915
It's elegant.

556
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:52,217
It's classy.

557
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:53,619
Soft and smooth.

558
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,922
-Five…
-Let's take a break.

559
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:01,093
ON-THE-BONE MEAT

560
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:02,794
Is this ready to eat?

561
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:04,763
These bits are the best.

562
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,465
I cut the meat close to the bone
since it's chewy.

563
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,000
-I see.
-That can be chewy, you see.

564
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:09,935
It's nice and chewy.

565
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,739
I love the meat close to the bone.

566
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:17,142
THE MARINATED GALBI IS NOW READY TO EAT

567
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,577
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

568
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:19,645
Thank you.

569
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:22,347
-I'll try a piece.
-Sure.

570
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:27,452
YUMMY

571
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,321
It's so tender.

572
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:32,391
Does the marinade soften the meat more?

573
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,692
-I think so.
-Right?

574
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,127
It's really soft.

575
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:37,229
I thought it's be super sweet but…

576
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,431
-I'm doing a terrible job describing it.
-Same here.

577
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,233
I thought it'd be really sweet,

578
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,168
but it isn't as sweet as I expected.

579
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,336
But then again, it's sweet.

580
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,071
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

581
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,739
It's kind of salty as well,

582
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:48,907
so it's seasoned perfectly.

583
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:52,377
-How should I put it? The galbi…
-It's so good.

584
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:54,513
You might think you'll get tired of it,

585
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:55,881
but you won't.

586
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:57,516
That'll be all.

587
00:21:57,582 --> 00:22:00,185
EVEN HOW THEY DESCRIBE THE TASTE
IS SIMILAR

588
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,720
What do we do?

589
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:03,055
It's really hard, you know.

590
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,290
How do people describe what they eat?

591
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:08,093
I'd love to be able to describe taste
like Jun-hyun for a day.

592
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,394
Have you heard this one?

593
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,363
It's what someone heard.

594
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,532
When Jun-hyun was asked

595
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,834
how much meat he eats,

596
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:18,070
he answered that he eats for three hours.

597
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:20,505
HAHA

598
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:21,573
I was moved.

599
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,443
That's how it should be done.

600
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,510
He's on another level.

601
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:28,680
-I'm full now.
-Where are we going next?

602
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:29,748
Us?

603
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:31,817
Here's what we're doing. Earlier,

604
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:35,153
we said we'd do something special
that we'd only do on trips.

605
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,688
It's a sport where you don't sweat.

606
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:37,756
Nice!

607
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:41,159
-You can do it while standing in one spot.
-Is this 20 Questions?

608
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:43,261
You only need to move your arms.

609
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:44,329
Then…

610
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:46,498
Is it long jump?

611
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,266
No, your feet stay still.

612
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,303
You can walk back and forth
to check how you did.

613
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,774
-Darts?
-You're close.

614
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,111
What do you think it is?

615
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:01,947
Have you tried it before?

616
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,515
Once, a long time ago.

617
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,584
-You've tried archery before?
-Yes, on a show.

618
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,220
I hear the bow's super heavy.

619
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:10,922
It's really heavy,
and the bow you use depends

620
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,858
on your arm length.

621
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:14,860
Oh my god. I'm at a disadvantage.

622
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:15,961
How so?

623
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:17,496
I have really short arms.

624
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,131
-Really?
-They don't look that way, right?

625
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:20,632
I wouldn't have known.

626
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:23,802
Please don't. Don't size me up.

627
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,604
Did someone tell you that,
or is that just how you feel?

628
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:30,709
As a trainee, I was often told
to spread my arms out further.

629
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:33,378
But the truth is,
I had been giving it my all.

630
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,313
That's when the instructor…

631
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,184
I'm 168 centimeters tall. The instructor
compared my arm to the arm of

632
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,187
another girl who under 160 centimeters,
and mine was significantly shorter.

633
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,455
Maybe she had longer arms.

634
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,223
That's actually true.

635
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,927
I knew from a young age that my arms

636
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,095
were shorter than average.

637
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:51,930
That's why my nickname was T-rex.

638
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:53,865
Back in school, I mean. It's true.

639
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,200
For real.

640
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,669
I was so embarrassed by it
that I kept my arms close to my chest

641
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:58,904
and never spread them.

642
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:02,441
And because my arms were always like this…

643
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:03,675
Hence the nickname T-rex.

644
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:07,078
I was aware of my short arms
when I joined SM Entertainment,

645
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:08,547
but constantly being told to spread them

646
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,081
destroyed my confidence.

647
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:11,683
But it got chalked up to a physical flaw.

648
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:13,518
It's a sad story.

649
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:15,454
Are you still conscious of it
and embarrassed?

650
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,521
I don't care anymore.

651
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:20,659
You must dance big, elongating your limbs

652
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:22,360
-and always extending.
-I do.

653
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:23,462
It's to hide my flaw.

654
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:25,630
That's admirable.
It means you've already overcome it.

655
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:28,200
-Anyway, this is what we're off to do.
-Got it.

656
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:30,435
I haven't tried it before.

657
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,771
I mean, the teleportation.

658
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:34,539
-So maybe this once…
-Sure.

659
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:35,941
-How about now?
-Sure thing.

660
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:37,776
Okay. One, two, three.

661
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:39,711
TELEPORTATION IS THE SHOW'S
SIGNATURE WAY OF TRAVEL

662
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:44,349
-What the hell?
-It must've traveled with us.

663
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,985
Do I just jump?

664
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,253
Sure. There's really nothing to it.

665
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,321
GETTING READY TO TELEPORT

666
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:51,056
Sir, would you like to come with us?

667
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:52,324
HE JOINS THEM

668
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,192
Mr. Sul's coming with us.

669
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,261
-Sir, please join us.
-Let's go.

670
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,996
Could you count us in?

671
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:01,032
One, two, three.

672
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:02,100
-Poof.
-Poof.

673
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,268
Sir… Oh, no!

674
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,103
He stumbled. Hold on a second.

675
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,204
Two, three.

676
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,173
-Goodness.
-Up you go.

677
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,041
Sir, would you like to sit down?

678
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:12,344
-Sure, take a seat.
-Have a beverage, sir.

679
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,179
END OF SKIT

680
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:16,748
-Now… We'll now learn archery.
-That could've been worse.

681
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:18,650
-Still, I…
-Do you know how to shoot?

682
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:21,319
I can't really say I know how to do it,

683
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:25,023
and I've only ever done archery once.

684
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,325
Anyway, I just asked the owner
for instructions.

685
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:30,228
-Once you have your bow, grab an arrow.
-Got it.

686
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:31,830
By the way, this…

687
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:33,832
-Am I holding it the wrong way?
-What?

688
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:35,233
Yes, yours is the wrong way.

689
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,801
-Right?
-You'll end up shooting yourself.

690
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,303
YOU'LL SHOOT YOURSELF HOLDING IT LIKE THAT

691
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:40,472
That'd be a disaster.

692
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,606
Hold it the other way.

693
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:43,141
-Like this.
-Yes, that's right.

694
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,976
WAIT!

695
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:49,281
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE
TO PULL THE BOWSTRING TOWARD YOU

696
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:53,018
DO-YEON AND KARINA
ARE HOLDING THE BOWS BACKWARD

697
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:57,088
I'm sorry. You were right.

698
00:25:58,356 --> 00:25:59,991
I had been aiming at myself.

699
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,793
I'm the worst. Anyway, it's this.

700
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:03,728
Like this, right?

701
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:04,896
Hold on a second.

702
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:06,865
Where's the circle?

703
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:08,733
-Is it this?
-Am I holding it wrong?

704
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,169
-This should be aimed at the target.
-Oh, right. I'm sorry.

705
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,270
Let's start over.

706
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:13,605
-This is the target.
-Cut!

707
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:15,607
This is called a target.

708
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,576
-Why don't you have this red thing?
-Mine looks different.

709
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:18,643
Yours is right here.

710
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,278
-Got it.
-This is the target.

711
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:23,315
Hold the bow like this.
Watch the index finger.

712
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:25,584
Hug the bow.
You shouldn't hold it too tight.

713
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,751
The arrow…

714
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:29,521
-Do I put it in here?
-Yes, put it in here.

715
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,123
Then grab it between your fingers

716
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,593
by gently curling about three of them.

717
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,695
Position the aimer

718
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,763
so it's pointing toward
the center of the target.

719
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,732
Draw the arrow to your chin,

720
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,800
then release.

721
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,469
-Damn.
-It's heavier than it looks.

722
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,738
FLUSTERED BY THE BOW'S SURPRISING WEIGHT

723
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:48,773
You look great.

724
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,241
Also, make an 11 with your feet.

725
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,915
That's it.
Now pull it back as hard as you can.

726
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:59,818
LOOK AT YOU BEING ALL SEXY

727
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,922
KARINA, please. Don't do that.

728
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:05,924
DANGEROUSLY SEXY

729
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:07,759
I don't know what I'm doing,
but I'll go for it.

730
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:08,827
Shoot!

731
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:10,862
Where did it go?

732
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,597
-I think you scored two points.
-Really?

733
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:13,698
It's better than zero, right?

734
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:14,966
-Anyway…
-Nice.

735
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:16,301
I don't think I can do this.

736
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:17,869
You look so cool.

737
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:23,074
I don't see my arrow.

738
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,809
THE ARROW MISSED THE TARGET COMPLETELY

739
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:26,945
All you have to do is aim a little lower.

740
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:29,080
Come on.
I want to do something I can show off.

741
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,316
Please, just once.

742
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:34,686
As Koreans, being good at this
is in our blood.

743
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,221
We're all descendants of Jumong.

744
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:38,456
Do-yeon, don't make me laugh.

745
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:40,492
How is that funny if it's a fact?

746
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:42,927
It's the truth.

747
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,031
-We'll have a little wager soon.
-The target… Oh, no.

748
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:49,901
See?

749
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,036
You aimed lower than before.

750
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:52,570
"Prince Jumong."

751
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:57,175
-Whoever wins gets to be the prince.
-Okay.

752
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,810
The loser will be the right-hand man.

753
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:00,879
-I hate that.
-Mo Pal-mo would say this.

754
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:03,748
-I hate it!
-"Prince Jumong."

755
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:04,816
Why?

756
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:08,420
I feel like I'll be doing it.

757
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:10,055
-This is a practice round.
-Okay.

758
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,390
Shoot!

759
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:14,292
A WHOPPING 8 POINTS!

760
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,427
Hold on.

761
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:16,795
-Hold it right there.
-Nice.

762
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,763
You came here early to practice,
didn't you?

763
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,365
What? Of course not.

764
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,067
CLEARING THROAT

765
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:23,201
Feeling guilty, are you?

766
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,204
You look amazing holding the bow.

767
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:27,906
Why won't they have me
on Idol Star Athletics Championships?

768
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:29,274
It's like a scene from a music video.

769
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,376
Why they won't have you
on Idol Star Athletics Championships?

770
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,578
Okay, got it.
Now I know why they won't have me.

771
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:34,713
IMMEDIATELY UNDERSTOOD

772
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,414
I kind of understand why.

773
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:39,284
But how did they know I was bad at it?

774
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,721
-Why are you so good at this?
-Hey.

775
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:44,789
I believe I'll be playing Mo Pal-mo.

776
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:48,059
-I should call you Ka Pal-mo.
-I should get practicing.

777
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:49,127
Ka Pal-mo.

778
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:52,263
Doesn't that sound like an app
that deals in used cars?

779
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:53,798
One that's successful.

780
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,300
Ka Pal-mo.

781
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,869
What could be the issue?

782
00:28:57,936 --> 00:28:58,970
Probably me.

783
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,271
ASKED AND ANSWERED

784
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:03,074
It'd be nice to get a few pointers
from the owner.

785
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:05,176
Right? Can you tell us
what we're doing wrong?

786
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,545
There's a limit
to how much I can teach her.

787
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,280
Grab it here, but not too tightly.

788
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:11,449
-Gently push the bow with this hand.
-Got it.

789
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:13,585
Grab the arrow
with just the ends of your fingers.

790
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,386
-What I told her was all wrong.
-Just the ends?

791
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:16,454
-There you go.
-I'm sorry.

792
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:18,890
-You were the worst instructor.
-Draw your hand back to your chin.

793
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,059
One, two, shoot.

794
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:22,927
Whoa!

795
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,464
DEAD CENTER!

796
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:28,366
-You're now Prince Jumong.
-Goodness.

797
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,834
PURRING COYLY

798
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,904
That's rich coming from someone
who was Ka Pal-mo a second ago.

799
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,907
-Unbelievable.
-Ka Pal-mo.

800
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:37,142
That was great. You looked awesome.

801
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:40,178
Wait. How did the instructor
do that just now?

802
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:42,881
Try it again
while the memory is still fresh.

803
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,149
-But…
-I bet you'll do well.

804
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:45,216
CAN SHE MANAGE IT BY HERSELF?

805
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:47,252
Oh, no!

806
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,820
Oh, no!

807
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,989
AS SOON AS THE OWNER STEPS AWAY,
CHAOS ERUPTS

808
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:52,290
-That's so cool.
-I'm sorry.

809
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:53,992
-Hold on.
-I only saw this on ISAC.

810
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:55,460
-Wait.
-This is what you see on ISAC.

811
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:57,996
On Idol Star Athletics Championships,
the camera is in the center.

812
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:00,565
-Still, you made the same impact.
-Wait.

813
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,733
DIFFERENT POSITION… SAME DAMAGE…

814
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,801
-Still--
-I'm here.

815
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:03,868
THANKFULLY, THE LENS WASN'T CRACKED

816
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:05,270
You didn't crack the lens though.

817
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:07,071
Isn't this better than just good?

818
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:10,942
You landed a cool shot
without damaging the camera lens.

819
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,243
During Idol Star Athletics Championships,

820
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,712
-many artists end up cracking the lens.
-They do.

821
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:16,714
How do they do it?
How do you get it dead center?

822
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,083
STEADYING HERSELF ONCE MORE…

823
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:21,219
Why do I keep…

824
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:23,054
HITTING THE CAMERA TWICE IN A ROW

825
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:25,256
Hold on a second. I'm so sorry.

826
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:28,660
This camera must have
an irresistible charm.

827
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,162
Is that why it keeps drawing you in?

828
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:32,697
It won't stop flirting with me.

829
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:34,632
It's okay.

830
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:36,634
-Are you good?
-I'm so sorry!

831
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:37,969
Are you good?

832
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,504
The lens didn't crack.

833
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:40,839
I didn't even hit the stand.

834
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:41,906
He put it back in place.

835
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:43,308
What is happening?

836
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:49,547
Sir, could you walk her
through the first set?

837
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:52,217
She's good at it when you're coaching her,

838
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:54,319
but loses her touch once you leave.

839
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:56,521
The best way to do it

840
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:59,524
is to adjust your arms
based on where the arrow landed.

841
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:00,925
You probably aimed at the center,

842
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:02,193
-but it hit high on the target.
-Right.

843
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,128
Then lower your arm for the next shot.

844
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:06,331
I SEE…

845
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:07,899
-No one gets it on the first try.
-Of course.

846
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,602
-Good.
-That's how life is.

847
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:12,003
There. Looking good.

848
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,071
Nice.

849
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:14,806
UNDER HIS COACHING, SHE SCORED A 10 AGAIN

850
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,175
-I'm good at it when you coach me.
-I'm a good coach.

851
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:21,279
You both have a good stance.

852
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:22,647
-Goodness.
-You have what it takes.

853
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:25,250
Should we book extra sessions?

854
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:26,951
-But it's in Pocheon.
-Can you make it to Pocheon?

855
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,721
I want to do well.

856
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:30,922
-You should warm your voice up.
-What?

857
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:33,191
-Get ready to say, "Prince Jumong."
-You mean, Mo Pal-mo.

858
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:34,259
GLARING

859
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:35,994
It's Ka Pal-mo I want to see.

860
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,662
I'll be bringing out Jang Pal-mo.

861
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:42,100
Who will be the father of three?

862
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:43,968
I hate the other option.

863
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,503
Who'll be going to Songdo?

864
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:47,972
Damn.

865
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:49,707
What? Damn it.

866
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:52,610
NO ONE IS JUMONG HERE,
THEY'RE BOTH MO PAL-MO

867
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:54,646
She should only be
learning good things from me.

868
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:56,581
How about it, Do-yeon?

869
00:31:57,048 --> 00:32:01,152
JANG DO-YEON VS KARINA

870
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:03,254
Now we'll compete.

871
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,890
Whoever gets the higher score

872
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:08,526
-will be Prince Jumong.
-Okay.

873
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,428
Whoever loses will be Mo Pal-mo.

874
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:14,098
The loser will say,
"Prince Jumong, you're the best,"

875
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:16,367
and pay for what we do next.

876
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:18,102
Nice, right?

877
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:20,505
-Talk about humiliating the guest, right?
-It's twice as embarrassing.

878
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:24,909
It has to be done in front of the employee
while you pay.

879
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:27,278
-In this position.
-Okay, got it.

880
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,380
-Good.
-I'm ready.

881
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,448
All right.

882
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:34,986
How about a best-of-five
with seven arrows each set?

883
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:36,621
A best-of-five with seven arrows each set.

884
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:38,122
Who should go first?

885
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:39,490
Elders first.

886
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:40,758
Elders first? Got it.

887
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:42,694
I, Jang from Jang-Ka-Seol, will go first.

888
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:50,702
WHERE DID THE ARROW
CARRYING HER DETERMINATION LAND?

889
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:53,371
ZEALOUS BUT JUST A MEASLY 3-POINTER

890
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:54,739
You sighed right away.

891
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:58,643
THE OWNER WHO BROUGHT KARINA PEACE IS GONE

892
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:59,978
He's not around. He must've left.

893
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:01,913
A 180

894
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,283
-Look at that.
-What is that? That startled me.

895
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:08,219
SOMETHING DROPPED FROM THE WALL
AFTER THE ARROW HIT IT

896
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:09,487
What is that? Hold on.

897
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:11,089
Oh no. That poor thing.

898
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,525
A PART OF THE WALL FELL OFF
FROM THE FORCE OF THE ARROW

899
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:15,760
It's fine.

900
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,229
-I think we're the same.
-What's the same?

901
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:19,297
Our archery ability.

902
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,099
OUR SKILL LEVELS ARE SIMILAR,
BUT NOT IN A GOOD WAY

903
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,300
-I like that better.
-Likewise.

904
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,370
But it still landed in the red.

905
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:27,138
Oh no. I'm getting nervous now.

906
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,642
Nice. Yours landed in the red too.

907
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:35,046
THE ARCHERY MATCH IS HEATING UP

908
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:37,882
EVENLY MATCHED

909
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:39,917
5 POINTS

910
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:41,386
Whatever.

911
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:45,289
Seven points.

912
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,691
KARINA HAS A SLIGHT LEAD

913
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,961
ONLY TWO SHOTS REMAIN,
DO-YEON TRIES TO CATCH UP

914
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:52,597
That was a satisfying sound.

915
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:53,664
UNFORTUNATELY, IT ONLY HIT A 5

916
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:57,301
IT'S A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR HER
TO EXTEND THE LEAD

917
00:33:58,503 --> 00:33:59,504
6 POINTS

918
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,039
That was sad.

919
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:04,642
SHE IS DOWN BY 6 POINTS,
AND THIS IS HER FINAL SHOT

920
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:08,112
UNFORTUNATELY, SHE ONLY GETS A 6

921
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:10,815
ONE POINT OR MORE, AND SHE TAKES THIS SET

922
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:13,718
9 POINTS

923
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:14,786
Nice.

924
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:19,257
SET 1
JANG DO-YEON: 39 VS KARINA: 48

925
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:21,459
KARINA WINS THE FIRST SET

926
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:22,527
That was good.

927
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:25,496
There are four more sets to go,

928
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,165
so instead of taking turns shot by shot,

929
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,366
we'll keep shooting.

930
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,468
FOR A SPEEDY GAME

931
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,036
-I'll be quick.
-Let's move it along.

932
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,572
-Okay, here I go.
-Sure.

933
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:39,143
8 POINTS

934
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,678
You're good at this.

935
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:45,083
-Yours sounds satisfying.
-Yes!

936
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,717
-What?
-Mine hit the yellow area.

937
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:48,219
I'm keeping you in check.

938
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,555
Wait, seriously?

939
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:51,622
Hey!

940
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,659
That was great.
Oh no, it hit the blue area.

941
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,327
CHUCKLING

942
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,430
Call me Jang Pal-mo.

943
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:01,799
-Call me Jang Pal-mo.
-Hearing Jang Pal-mo threw me off.

944
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:04,502
I went from hitting tens to a five.

945
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:06,304
Jang Pal-mo and Kamong.

946
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:08,573
Kamong is the worst.

947
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,409
KAMONG SOUNDS SO WEIRD

948
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:13,344
I sound like a ham.

949
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:17,048
What? I'm doomed.

950
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,549
I'm slowly losing my touch.

951
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:21,185
Don't say it out loud.
It'll affect your mindset.

952
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,121
8 POINTS

953
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:24,522
6 POINTS

954
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,357
5 POINTS

955
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,094
WHAT WILL KARINA SCORE?

956
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,699
10 POINTS

957
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:36,634
Who knew archery was this fun?

958
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,037
HERE'S ONE PERSON WHO CAN'T SMILE…

959
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:42,540
SHE NEEDS AT LEAST 9 POINTS

960
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,475
So true.

961
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:46,210
10 POINTS

962
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:47,278
Yes!

963
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:52,817
FIRING HER LAST SHOT WITH A 2-POINT LEAD

964
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:55,586
THIS LAST SHOT WILL DECIDE THE WINNER

965
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:59,090
KARINA SCORES A 7 AND TAKES ANOTHER SET

966
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,492
Yours are landing right in the center.

967
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:03,928
-They're in a line.
-Mine are all over the place.

968
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,333
SET 2
JANG DO-YEON: 47 VS KARINA: 52

969
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,471
In archery, you win by sets.

970
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:16,040
KARINA won the first set.

971
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:17,575
Here's how you did in the second set.

972
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:19,343
Do-yeon got 47 points,

973
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,978
while KARINA got 52 points.

974
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:24,148
DO-YEON LOST 2 SETS IN A ROW

975
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:25,650
I should step up my game.

976
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:28,686
SOON-TO-BE PRINCE KAMONG IS RELAXED
BEING 2 SETS AHEAD

977
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:30,755
To be honest,
I don't really deserve to win

978
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:33,257
because I don't even know
how to hold a bow.

979
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:38,529
How do I get by socially
when I'm this slow?

980
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:42,900
8 POINTS

981
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:44,302
-Yes!
-She's got the hang of it now.

982
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,603
CONFIDENCE ON THE RISE

983
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,876
10 POINTS

984
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:53,811
You're only hitting the yellow area.

985
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,346
-Good game.
-You're really good.

986
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:02,386
INTIMIDATED BY KARINA'S UNWAVERING SKILL

987
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:06,057
8 POINTS

988
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:08,292
SHE MISSES A SHOT WHILE ALREADY LOSING

989
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:09,860
I bet your head was somewhere else.

990
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:10,928
It was.

991
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:13,431
-Somehow, it knew.
-I knew it.

992
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:17,501
DON'T BE INTIMIDATED BY YOUR OPPONENT
AND STAY FOCUSED

993
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,005
But my head was in the game this time.

994
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,340
SADLY, SHE SCORES A 6

995
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:25,076
SUDDENLY, A DROP TO A 3

996
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,679
KARINA'S SLIP-UP GIVES DO-YEON A SHOT
AT A COMEBACK

997
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,582
WHO WILL WIN?

998
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:32,984
7 POINTS

999
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,353
4 POINTS

1000
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,756
How do professional archers
keep doing this?

1001
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:39,991
Tell me about it.

1002
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:44,528
THE DESCENDANT OF JUMONG
GIVES IT HER ALL UNTIL THE END

1003
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:46,897
KARINA TAKES THIS SET AS WELL

1004
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:49,066
Did you know

1005
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:52,203
there's a German archer
named Karina Winter?

1006
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,338
-Is Karina Winter her full name?
-Yes, Karina Winter.

1007
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:55,840
-What?
-Wild, isn't it?

1008
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:56,974
Oh my god.

1009
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,342
I should let WINTER know.

1010
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:04,382
SET 3
JANG DO-YEON: 39 VS KARINA: 50

1011
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:06,417
Do-yeon scored 39 points,

1012
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:07,852
and KARINA got 50 points.

1013
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:08,953
My scores are improving.

1014
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,022
THIS IS PRACTICALLY GAME OVER,
WITH 3 LOSSES IN A BEST OF 5

1015
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:13,491
-Pay up.
-What about the remaining sets?

1016
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:14,725
You're right.

1017
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,495
Really? Hold on a second.

1018
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:18,629
-Really?
-What is it?

1019
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,799
I doubt KARINA would like that.
Are you sure?

1020
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:24,135
FLUSTERED
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1021
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:26,837
I see. Was that the plan all along?

1022
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:28,105
PRODUCTION CREW HAS NO IDEA

1023
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:30,975
-The last set is worth ten points.
-Switching targets.

1024
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,109
Switching targets.

1025
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:34,078
I'm switching targets.

1026
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,213
The last set is worth ten points.

1027
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:38,949
Let's do it, then.

1028
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:40,751
-It's for fun.
-Let's do it.

1029
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,453
-It's all for fun.
-Of course.

1030
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:48,059
THEY PLAY THE DECIDING SET,
WORTH 10 POINTS

1031
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:52,830
A ROCKY START WITH 3 POINTS

1032
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:56,067
8 POINTS

1033
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:58,669
Look at you.
You're doing better every time.

1034
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:01,972
It landed in the red.

1035
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,841
I'm going to join the national team.

1036
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:05,242
EXPLODING WITH CONFIDENCE

1037
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:07,445
Really? Just stick to eating
national-level tteokbokki.

1038
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:10,748
SHE BURSTS OUT LAUGHING
AT THE PETTY JEALOUSY

1039
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:12,016
I'm sorry.

1040
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:15,086
I'm sorry. I'm the runner-up,
jealous of the champion.

1041
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:18,389
I'm so sorry.
I'm basically Na Ae-ri, jealous of Ha-ni.

1042
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:22,126
I, JANG AE-RI, WON'T BE DEFEATED LIKE THIS

1043
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,165
I wished you bad luck,
and karma bit me hard.

1044
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:30,835
THE JEALOUSY AIMED AT HER DIDN'T SHAKE HER

1045
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:34,505
-This is so funny.
-I must look like a loser.

1046
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:36,273
Sounds delicious.

1047
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,742
-The tteokbokki?
-Yes.

1048
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:39,610
Of course it's good.

1049
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:44,081
THINKING ABOUT FOOD DISTRACTED HER

1050
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:46,884
ONLY 4 POINTS? WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT

1051
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:51,088
THIS IS HER CHANCE TO CATCH UP

1052
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,358
UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S ONLY A 6

1053
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,596
CAN'T LET HER FLIP THE GAME
AT THE LAST SECOND

1054
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:01,899
KEEPING THE LEAD BY SCORING 7 POINTS

1055
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:09,640
5: 10 DEAD CENTER

1056
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:10,708
You're good.

1057
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:11,776
THE WINNER HAS ALREADY BEEN DECIDED

1058
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:12,943
This is fun.

1059
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,345
Really? I'm glad to hear that.

1060
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:17,748
Yours make such a satisfying sound.

1061
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:21,385
KARINA CLOSES OUT THE SET
WITH ONLY ONE LOWER-SCORE SHOT

1062
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:23,421
No way. You keep getting better at it.

1063
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,158
SET 4
JANG DO-YEON: 41 VS KARINA: 52

1064
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:28,859
DO-YEON FAILS TO MAKE A COMEBACK
IN THE NINTH

1065
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,327
You're really good at this.

1066
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:31,762
-Should we call it a nine?
-What?

1067
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:33,264
-The one on the line.
-It's okay.

1068
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:35,299
Don't pity me.

1069
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:36,700
DON'T PITY ME

1070
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,136
Do you think
you'll be the champion forever?

1071
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:40,671
CHANNELING THE JEALOUS NA AE-RI

1072
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:43,007
I, JANG AE-RI

1073
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:44,475
I WILL SOMEDAY DEFEAT YOU

1074
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:45,910
The score was 41 to 52.

1075
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:47,545
KARINA WON DECISIVELY,
EVEN IN THE FINAL SET

1076
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:49,280
There.

1077
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:53,851
SHE COULDN'T EVEN WIN ONE SET

1078
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,653
-Can I get a clap?
-Sure.

1079
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:01,492
PRINCE KAMONG ACTUALLY APPLAUDED
RATHER THAN CLAPPING THE SLATE

1080
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:06,764
IT WAS MR. SUL WOON-DO'S FAULT

1081
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:08,566
Blame him instead.

1082
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:12,503
That was insane.

1083
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:16,173
I thought he needed
a shot of me applauding.

1084
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,741
Do you know how to clap a slate?

1085
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,243
Don't you do it by clapping?

1086
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,011
Can you just do one clap?

1087
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:22,513
Just one.

1088
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:25,015
I'll clap the slate now.

1089
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:26,917
One, two, three.

1090
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:29,653
NICE

1091
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:33,057
It's nice to get complimented
for just clapping.

1092
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:36,227
-This is the life.
-Tell me about it.

1093
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:37,461
I'm a happy person.

1094
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:40,231
Let's get going, Prince Jumong.

1095
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:42,199
-I'll call you Kamong.
-That's not the appropriate tone.

1096
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:44,568
CHUCKLING

1097
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:46,370
-Prince Kamong!
-No, please don't.

1098
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:49,773
This is us, right? We'll take the cab.

1099
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:51,308
Sure.

1100
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:54,745
We have good weather today,
and it isn't as cold.

1101
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:55,813
I know.

1102
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,615
Do you often get coffee with friends?

1103
00:41:58,115 --> 00:42:00,584
Yes, I do,

1104
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,453
but I don't get recognized as much
these days.

1105
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,289
-It's kind of sad.
-I wonder why? Do you…

1106
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,259
I hide my face well,

1107
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:11,629
but people don't seem as interested in me
as they used to.

1108
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,564
They could recognize you

1109
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,566
-but not acknowledge it.
-So that I'd be comfortable?

1110
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:17,334
That's touching.

1111
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:19,436
How do you go around? Do you wear a mask?

1112
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:22,439
Lately, I've been going out
without hiding my face.

1113
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:24,008
Han Su-a and I

1114
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:26,377
went to Apgujeong
to have our caricatures done.

1115
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:28,579
Did you go to a caricature artist?

1116
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:29,713
I'll show you the drawing.

1117
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,750
How did you and Su-a get close?

1118
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:35,185
We're both friends with Ryujin,

1119
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:36,320
so she introduced us.

1120
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,088
We were able to click and…

1121
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:42,526
-Cute, isn't it?
-Oh my.

1122
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:45,529
-It's so cute. Is Su-a…
-Right?

1123
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:47,331
-…the one with sunglasses?
-That's me.

1124
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,465
Is that you? Of course.

1125
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:49,967
-I see the mole.
-That's right.

1126
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:51,468
-No way.
-Cute, isn't it?

1127
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:52,803
While this was being drawn…

1128
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,371
-People didn't realize it was me.
-Weren't they staring?

1129
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:57,007
They kept asking Su-a
if she was Yuna from ITZY.

1130
00:42:57,675 --> 00:42:58,742
She was like, "I'm not her."

1131
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:01,445
How did you and Ryujin get close?

1132
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:03,647
Ryujin debuted earlier than me.

1133
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:05,716
-Is ITZY your senior?
-They are.

1134
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:06,784
I see.

1135
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:10,087
ITZY is the senior group,
but the members are all about our age.

1136
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:12,556
I thought we were destined to click.

1137
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:15,259
I mean, I knew aespa
would get along with ITZY.

1138
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:18,495
One time, our group's green room
was right next to theirs.

1139
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:23,067
ITZY first reached out
by sending us watermelon juice,

1140
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:26,804
so we yelled "Thanks, we'll enjoy this!"

1141
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:28,639
Later, we exchanged numbers.

1142
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:31,842
A few members from ITZY
and a few from our group met up,

1143
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:34,078
and Ryujin and I hit it off right away

1144
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:35,245
even though she was younger.

1145
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:38,515
I've been hanging out with her ever since.

1146
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:40,718
-That's flirting with watermelon juice.
-Totally.

1147
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:41,885
They won me over instantly.

1148
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,354
Does that happen often?

1149
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:46,357
Is it common for artists to send snacks
to artists in the next room?

1150
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:47,524
Not really.

1151
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:49,727
From then until now,
that was the only time it happened.

1152
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:52,062
Giving us snacks
when we were complete strangers, I mean.

1153
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:55,132
Ryujin's a great dancer,
which makes her so cool.

1154
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:56,700
-Seriously.
-Right.

1155
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:58,569
She doesn't know how good she is though.

1156
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,337
Really? How can she not know that?

1157
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:02,806
She might just be too humble.

1158
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,743
Isn't she considered
one of the best dancers in K-pop?

1159
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,244
She is.

1160
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:09,013
You're great too.

1161
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:12,449
-Was I too late?
-Way too late.

1162
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:16,720
Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.

1163
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:18,756
Tell me about
when you first joined SM Entertainment.

1164
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,824
What would you say your specialty was?

1165
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:23,193
-My specialty?
-Was it singing or dancing?

1166
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,663
I thought my singing gave me an edge,

1167
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:27,564
but that was wishful thinking.

1168
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:30,267
-How so?
-I figured I'd be the main vocalist.

1169
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:33,904
Come on, all the members
are equally good dancers and singers.

1170
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:36,807
Right, but I didn't know
how good they were at the time.

1171
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:38,942
It was just me in front of a camera.

1172
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,611
When the agency picked me up,

1173
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,913
I joined thinking I was a good singer,

1174
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,782
but there were so many talented girls.

1175
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:48,452
Was being a singer
always a dream of yours?

1176
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:51,588
It was a dream of mine,

1177
00:44:51,655 --> 00:44:54,992
but no one in my family had a background
in the industry.

1178
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:59,563
My mom's a nurse,
and my sister got good grades,

1179
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,498
so I felt like I had to go
the academic route as well.

1180
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:03,534
But I watched a lot of TV

1181
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,538
and always thought I'd be on it someday.

1182
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:09,206
When did you first think that?

1183
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:11,175
Elementary school… No, in kindergarten.

1184
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:14,378
I've loved music since I was a kid,

1185
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:15,846
including playing instruments.

1186
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,715
I wasn't very good,

1187
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:19,683
but I picked it up pretty quickly.

1188
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,385
Picking things up quickly
makes everything fun,

1189
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:23,020
which is why I loved playing instruments.

1190
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:25,789
I was playful and energetic,
which is why I chose to dance.

1191
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:28,726
I figured I'd be a K-pop idol.

1192
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:30,928
They say if you really want something,

1193
00:45:30,994 --> 00:45:33,497
-you're drawn to it.
-Exactly.

1194
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:34,832
I kind of agree with that.

1195
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:38,335
Do you like to travel?

1196
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,770
I love it.

1197
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:41,105
How was Paris?

1198
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:42,239
Paris was the best.

1199
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:44,274
Paris is my favorite place to travel.

1200
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:46,643
-You went to Monet's house, right?
-Yes.

1201
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:48,479
I've always wanted to go there.

1202
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:49,747
It's incredible.

1203
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:52,116
I absolutely loved it.

1204
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:54,718
It's so pretty.

1205
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:07,498
-Wasn't it far from the city?
-Since we were filming there,

1206
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:10,467
we flew to Paris
and were driven to that area.

1207
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:12,569
I had this thought on my way there.

1208
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:14,271
Because it was far from the city,

1209
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:17,074
I knew I wouldn't come back,
so I made sure to enjoy it while I could.

1210
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:18,876
However, as I was leaving,

1211
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:21,678
I vowed to myself
that I'd come back someday.

1212
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:23,313
I absolutely love Water Lilies.

1213
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,415
Really? No way!

1214
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:27,751
-They're the best.
-They really are.

1215
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:29,520
At the Orangerie Museum,

1216
00:46:29,586 --> 00:46:32,890
I picked up a lot of Monet souvenirs.

1217
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:35,559
My mom's a huge fan of his work too.

1218
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,594
I'll always regret not buying souvenirs.

1219
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:38,829
I should've gotten everything.

1220
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:40,297
-You really should've.
-Right.

1221
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:42,299
It was great,
especially because it felt short.

1222
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:43,467
I need to go back there someday.

1223
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:47,137
You'll absolutely love it
at Monet's house.

1224
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:48,238
I'd love to go there.

1225
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,340
Being in that neighborhood

1226
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:51,942
feels like stepping into a painting.

1227
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:54,711
GIVERNY WAS A TOWN
THAT WAS A WORK OF ART IN ITSELF

1228
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:58,582
PHOTOS FROM ANY ANGLE
LOOKED LIKE ART PIECES

1229
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,185
-It was the best.
-Lucky you.

1230
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:02,686
We also had plenty of sun.

1231
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:03,754
I know.

1232
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,622
THEY ARRIVE AT A CAFE, TALKING ABOUT
THEIR FAVORITE PLACES TO TRAVEL

1233
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:08,058
This cafe is adorable.

1234
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:12,462
It must be like a phone booth.

1235
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:13,664
Nice.

1236
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:16,266
Is this the place?

1237
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,801
This gives me major fall vibes.

1238
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:20,204
Looks like
there's outdoor seating as well.

1239
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:21,271
Here?

1240
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:24,608
-But we'll be eating indoors.
-All right.

1241
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:27,911
-It looks like a house from a movie.
-Exactly.

1242
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:29,880
They even have crocks.

1243
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:33,083
-Hello. No way!
-It's adorable.

1244
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:34,218
Gosh, hello.

1245
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:35,652
-Welcome.
-Hello.

1246
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:37,588
-It's so pretty.
-The owner

1247
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:40,290
-fits the cafe perfectly.
-Their vibes match.

1248
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:45,262
PLENTY OF HANDMADE ITEMS
FROM THE IN-HOUSE STUDIO

1249
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:49,867
No way.

1250
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:52,202
-Goodness.
-It's so pretty.

1251
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:53,370
This is beautiful.

1252
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:56,173
I love cups and saucers like these.

1253
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,241
Check this out.

1254
00:47:58,141 --> 00:47:59,676
-It's so cute.
-Can we touch them?

1255
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,878
Can we touch this?

1256
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:02,246
Sure. That's actually a thimble.

1257
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:04,748
-No way. There's a thimble on it.
-It's adorable.

1258
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:06,683
A CUTE THIMBLE
THAT FITS THE LID KNOB PERFECTLY

1259
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:07,985
Did she make this?

1260
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:10,087
Do you make these yourself?

1261
00:48:10,153 --> 00:48:11,154
NODDING

1262
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,856
These are adorable.

1263
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:14,324
This one's the cutest.

1264
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:19,830
-These are so pretty.
-What a charming little cafe.

1265
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,265
EVERY SINGLE ITEM IN THE CAFE IS CHARMING

1266
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:22,666
Did she make all of these?

1267
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:26,003
No wonder the cafe earned the nickname
"hand-knitting cafe".

1268
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,473
-This is so pretty.
-She makes the pottery too.

1269
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:30,908
-That was unexpected.
-That's so soft.

1270
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:35,712
I was expecting a chair with a hard seat.

1271
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:37,714
-That startled me.
-I sank into it as soon as I sat down.

1272
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:39,049
THE TWO WERE SURPRISED
BY THE SOFT, CUSHY SEAT

1273
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:40,117
You want to go to sleep.

1274
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:41,852
IT MAKES YOU SLEEPY

1275
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,186
-Hi.
-Here you go.

1276
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:44,721
-Thank you.
-No way.

1277
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:45,856
The menu is made of leather.

1278
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,524
-It's so pretty.
-How charming!

1279
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:50,360
-I might just cry.
-This is so pretty.

1280
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,363
Even the table is charming.

1281
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:56,199
The place feels really warm and cozy.

1282
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:58,602
What a sweet little place.
It's truly unique.

1283
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:01,738
We're at a cafe filled with warmth.

1284
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,642
It's like this place
turns you into a sweet angel.

1285
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:06,877
I should only say nice things.

1286
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,912
You're right.
I should only say nice things too.

1287
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:10,047
What are you having?

1288
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:11,581
How fascinating. Me?

1289
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:13,317
Wait, fresh deodeok latte?

1290
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:15,218
-What?
-Fresh deodeok latte?

1291
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,254
I'll try the fresh deodeok latte.

1292
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:19,389
How about we speak only Korean here?

1293
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:22,092
I'd like that.
In that case, can we use your Korean name?

1294
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:23,827
-It's Ji-min.
-Ji-min? Okay.

1295
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:25,329
-That only seems fitting.
-Right.

1296
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:26,964
Then I'll have…

1297
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:29,866
the milk-based drink with fresh deodeok.

1298
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:31,168
Okay.

1299
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:32,436
Fresh deodeok.

1300
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:34,037
-I just said "okay."
-You lost already.

1301
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:35,105
You're out.

1302
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:36,173
-What about you?
-I'm out.

1303
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:38,141
What will you have? Let's only use Korean.

1304
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:39,543
I'll have the black drink

1305
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:41,912
with lots of ice.

1306
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,449
You called coffee a black drink.

1307
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:47,050
One black drink with lots of ice,

1308
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:48,919
and a milk-based drink with fresh deodeok.

1309
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,587
Ok… Right, sure.

1310
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,556
Weren't you about to say it again?

1311
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:53,623
SHE CAN'T STOP ANSWERING WITH "OKAY"

1312
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:55,459
-Good. Fresh--
-Do-yeon.

1313
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:56,860
-There's something we should do.
-What?

1314
00:49:57,627 --> 00:49:58,729
Oh, of course.

1315
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:03,767
Oh, no.

1316
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,736
-I already feel mortified.
-I can't watch this.

1317
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:07,771
WHAT DO-YEON MUST DO
WILL BE REVEALED NEXT WEEK

1318
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,040
Stay alert, Do-yeon.
You never know when I'll take the shot.

1319
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:12,476
HAHA

1320
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:14,411
This is 120% apple.

1321
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:15,479
WHAT, 120%?

1322
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:16,580
I mean, 100% apple.

1323
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:17,948
You said it was 120% earlier.

1324
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,683
Shut it, will you?

1325
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:20,984
You brat.

1326
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:22,119
What's wrong with you?

1327
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:24,154
THEY'RE OFF TO A FANCY RESTAURANT

1328
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:27,057
It's so tender. There's nothing to chew.

1329
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:28,158
THERE'S NOTHING TO CHEW?

1330
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:30,394
It's that tender. I mean, I did chew but…

1331
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:31,461
HAPPY

1332
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:32,529
Anyway, it's…

1333
00:50:32,596 --> 00:50:33,897
What's the matter with you?

1334
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:36,033
It's really tender.

1335
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:37,567
I think it'll be fun hanging out with you.

1336
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:39,336
Can I read into that?

1337
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:40,504
Jang Do-yeon!

1338
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:41,838
I'm lonely.

1339
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:43,073
Can I come in?

1340
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,474
Of course.

1341
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,642
DELIGHTED

1342
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:46,710
-I had a blast.
-I had a blast.

1343
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:47,778
THEY'LL ACTUALLY TALK NOW, NOT TEASE

1344
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:49,446
OR SO WE THOUGHT

1345
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:51,515
Okay, let's try some fried chicken.

1346
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:53,383
THE REINS HAVE COME OFF!

1347
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:56,520
It tastes divine.
There's still meat on this bone.

1348
00:50:56,586 --> 00:50:57,921
AFTER SEEING HER BRUSH HER TEETH
WITH A CHICKEN BONE

1349
00:50:57,988 --> 00:51:00,357
I'd rather talk less with you.

1350
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:01,491
I'D RATHER TALK LESS WITH YOU

1351
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:02,826
THIS ISN'T THE DO-YEON I REMEMBER

1352
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:06,063
I said I wasn't doing this.
I made that clear.

1353
00:51:06,129 --> 00:51:08,732
JI-MIN IS UNSTOPPABLE

1354
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:10,801
