1
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,872
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

2
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:11,111
EPISODE 2: DECISION TO (NOT) LEAVE
YOU ARE IN MY HEART

3
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:12,746
Hi. Good morning!

4
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:14,114
I'm from Korea.

5
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:17,751
WAKING UP TO A GLOBAL MORNING

6
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:20,487
The second day of the trip has started.

7
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:23,356
You are enjoying our show, aren't you?

8
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:27,527
As you can see,
I layered up like this today,

9
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,662
but it's still so cold I'm shivering!

10
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:30,730
TEMPERATURE: 3°C

11
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:33,099
Wouldn't it be just like a movie

12
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,769
if someone showed up
and handed me something warm?

13
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:36,669
(SOMEONE)

14
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:38,838
This must be a dream!

15
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,608
EMBARRASSED

16
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:42,809
It has to be.

17
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:44,778
Tell me this is real.

18
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:46,246
It's all good. Let's go.

19
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,315
MARRIED YESTERDAY, STRANGERS TODAY

20
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,751
-We're heading to a morning market.
-Yes, of course.

21
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:53,586
-Go?
-Shall we?

22
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,588
I can't wait.

23
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,393
Man.

24
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,262
9-MINUTE DRIVE TO HONGZHUAN MARKET

25
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:04,664
Decision To Leave again?

26
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:08,635
Decision To Leave,
but in a winter setting.

27
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:09,936
How cute!

28
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,739
Isn't that cute?
The green light figure is walking.

29
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:13,773
Yeah, it's cute.

30
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,743
-The red one stands still.
-We don't have that in Korea.

31
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,878
Walk lights in other countries
are so cute.

32
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:22,315
They all look a little different,
which is super cute.

33
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:26,486
I don't think the lights looked like this
the last time I was in Harbin.

34
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:27,620
How was it 20 years ago?

35
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:30,156
-There weren't any lights.
-No traffic lights?

36
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,559
But people must have lived here back then.

37
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,694
They didn't have the walking motion.

38
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,896
This is my first time visiting the place.

39
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:38,465
Hongzhuan Market, is it?

40
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:40,200
"Hongzhuan" means "red brick."

41
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,134
ARRIVED

42
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:42,469
You can drop us here.

43
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:43,870
Thank you.

44
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:45,672
Thank you.

45
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,341
HONGZHUAN MORNING MARKET

46
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,610
Wow, look at the line.

47
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:52,812
A GREAT PLACE TO TRY CHINESE FOODS
AT AFFORDABLE PRICES

48
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:54,581
-This is it.
-Hey!

49
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:57,050
I'm so excited.
I love these kinds of food.

50
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,921
That's so cool!

51
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:03,389
Hey, that's youtiao.

52
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,592
-That's right. Youtiao.
-I love that.

53
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:07,060
FRIED DOUGH WITH A CLEAN, MILD TASTE

54
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,261
-Want some?
-Sure.

55
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:09,929
Two youtiao, please.

56
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,599
-How much?
-Ten yuan.

57
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,744
Thank you. What is this?

58
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:27,480
SOY MILK ENJOYED AS BREAKFAST
OR LIGHT SNACK

59
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,215
-It's doujiang?
-Doujiang.

60
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:30,283
Two, please.

61
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:32,785
Where are you from?

62
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,155
-Korea.
-Korea.

63
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:40,827
TRYING DOUJIANG
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME IN HARBIN

64
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:42,862
Is this doujiang too?

65
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:45,565
-That one's corn juice.
-Looks amazing.

66
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:47,534
YO-HAN ORDERS CORN JUICE

67
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,434
Thanks a lot.

68
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,836
It's delicious.

69
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,037
-Delicious?
-Yes.

70
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,108
Do-yeon, this is the real deal.

71
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,776
-What is it?
-Corn juice.

72
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,212
Crud, this one's better.

73
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,747
-You don't like it?
-No, it's good.

74
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:01,915
-Let's swap.
-I'm okay.

75
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:03,616
IF MY HONEY WANTS IT, IT'S ALL HERS

76
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,085
This tastes like the soup version
of Corn Chips.

77
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:08,221
-Right?
-It's really good.

78
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,591
Is that what I think it is?

79
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:15,161
I think that one's lamb soup.

80
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,197
-Wanna try?
-How about we sit down first?

81
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,431
Sounds good.

82
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:19,766
I wonder what that is.

83
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,701
LAMB SOUP

84
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:22,969
Oh, it's bone soup.

85
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,171
HEARTY BROTH MADE WITH LAMB AND OFFAL

86
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:30,710
DAOXIAOMIAN: WIDE AND CHEWY NOODLES
CUT FROM DOUGH USING A SPECIAL KNIFE

87
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:41,521
Sir, what kind of noodle is this?

88
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:44,257
-Daoxiaomian.
-I'd like two bowls, please.

89
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,162
Let's try these now.

90
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,265
-Smells good.
-Eat them while they are hot.

91
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,133
FINALLY TAKING A BITE OF THE YOUTIAO

92
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,237
-Is it good?
-So good!

93
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:58,638
And it's so warm.

94
00:03:58,705 --> 00:03:59,772
LET ME TRY IT TOO

95
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,408
It's really good.

96
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:03,476
(NOD OF APPROVAL)

97
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,778
-The dough is tasty.
-It's good.

98
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:11,117
SWEET GUY
SHARING WITH ONE OF THE CREW

99
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:12,018
Good, huh?

100
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:16,589
HERE COME THE DAOXIAOMIAN NOODLES
HOT OFF THE POT

101
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,593
It looks like ramyeon.

102
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,732
These look like kal-guksu noodles.

103
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,935
-Is it good?
-Yes. Perfect for a hangover.

104
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,203
-It's good!
-Right?

105
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,271
Tastes like ramyeon.

106
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,740
A BREAKFAST THAT HITS THE SPOT

107
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:34,941
It's really good.

108
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,614
How's that one?

109
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:42,882
I'm still chewing.

110
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,455
-It's delicious.
-It is.

111
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,158
I want to try this.

112
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:53,960
-Can you take the heat?
-I was gonna ask that.

113
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,028
DEEP-RED CHILI OIL SAUCE

114
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:56,696
-Can you?
-Yeah, I love spicy food.

115
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:57,630
Same here.

116
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,236
Too hot?

117
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,772
WAY HOTTER THAN IT LOOKS…

118
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:06,839
Is it too hot?

119
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,642
I can usually handle spicy food,

120
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,110
but that was a surprise.

121
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:15,548
I like this flavor too.

122
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:28,294
DIPPING DOUJIANG IN YOUTIAO LIKE LOCALS DO

123
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:30,630
HEAVENLY COMBO

124
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:31,698
This is too good.

125
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,967
CRUNCH

126
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:35,968
Is it good?

127
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,503
I'm still chewing.

128
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:40,473
It's so good!

129
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,775
I'll tell you how it tastes.

130
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,645
It's like twisted doughnuts.

131
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:50,083
Imagine trying to give one to your friend,
and you drop it in the soy milk.

132
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:53,152
You say, "Sorry!"
and you quickly scoop it out.

133
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:55,455
Then you eat it,
and it's like, "It's not bad."

134
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,957
Technically, this is just salted bread.

135
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,059
It's seasoned with nothing but salt,

136
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,764
but it somehow has this
really nice salty-nutty combo going on.

137
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,099
You have to try it.

138
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:08,201
TASTE REVIEW: JUST TRY IT

139
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,670
There's so much I want to eat,

140
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:13,473
but let's go grab that Harbin beer
we skipped yesterday.

141
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,108
OFF TO TRY THE HARBIN BEER

142
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,247
I'm only now noticing
how beautiful those buildings are.

143
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,816
I didn't see it when I was a student here.

144
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,452
Maybe now you have the time
to take it all in.

145
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,588
I guess so. And I've got the headspace.

146
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:31,524
I think I have more peace of mind
than I did back then.

147
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:32,692
I'm in a better place.

148
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,461
That's great. It means you've done well.

149
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:36,662
Now that I'm back…

150
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,533
Now I understand why they say
travel makes you reflect on yourself.

151
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,269
We went to Central Avenue last night.

152
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:47,106
Back in the day,
that street always felt dark to me.

153
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,175
I could never really see the lights.

154
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,110
I remember it as just a big blur.

155
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:53,513
Harbin was always
a cold and shadowy place to me.

156
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,349
But yesterday, it felt so bright.

157
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,551
-It's surreal.
-Surreal, really.

158
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:01,421
The eyes, the brain, and the heart
must all be connected.

159
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,356
-I agree.
-Which makes me think…

160
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,225
Maybe it really is scientifically true

161
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,361
when people say love makes you blind.

162
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,829
-Totally.
-Yeah.

163
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:12,064
Do you express yourself with words?

164
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,132
-Me?
-Yes.

165
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,067
Do you show your heart through actions

166
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:17,804
or prefer to put it into words?

167
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,607
I used to be a doer and think,
"Actions speak louder."

168
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:24,477
But if you don't say it, they never know.
Especially these days.

169
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:25,678
You're right.

170
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,747
-Do you tell your mom you love her?
-I do.

171
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,081
OH?!

172
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:30,016
-I do.
-Really?

173
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:31,684
I call her every day and tell her.

174
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:32,919
-Wow.
-And my dad too.

175
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,420
What a sweet son.

176
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,355
I started doing that in my thirties.

177
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:37,790
Did something happen?

178
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,759
Not really. I just…

179
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:42,695
-Did you feel like you had to?
-Yeah, it just felt right.

180
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,231
It just hit me that it was now or never.

181
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:48,067
I acted when the timing was right,

182
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,303
and after that, it got easier.

183
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,138
-The first step's the hardest.
-True.

184
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,307
-Do you?
-All the time.

185
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:56,242
I'm an only child, so…

186
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,479
My folks are always happy
when I tell them I love them.

187
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,380
I think it needs to be said.

188
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,083
-Even though it's not easy.
-Yeah.

189
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,551
I have a question.

190
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,855
-You studied engineering, right?
-Yes.

191
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,790
Did your time in university

192
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,326
make you more sure
about becoming an actor?

193
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:16,596
Officially,
I wasn't an engineering student.

194
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,131
I was preparing to become one.

195
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:22,134
I was working on meeting the requirements.

196
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:25,137
I took language courses and tests,

197
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:27,607
doing what I needed to do to qualify.

198
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:30,176
But acting was always on my mind.

199
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,777
It wasn't a secret.

200
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,647
I told everyone I wanted to be an actor.

201
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,249
When did that start?

202
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:38,117
Second grade, middle school.

203
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,920
-Did you watch a movie or something?
-I was in a play.

204
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,455
-Back in middle school?
-Yeah.

205
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:47,326
I was constantly getting scolded
while prepping for the play.

206
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:50,596
I didn't want to get scolded,
so I practiced harder.

207
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,732
I used to be somewhat shy.

208
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,501
But then I started to change.

209
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:58,104
Then came the curtain call,
and under the lights,

210
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,139
I could see my friends smiling.

211
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,741
I thought, "This is fun."

212
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,576
Were you shy as a kid?

213
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:05,011
Yes, a bit.

214
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:07,413
Did acting make you more outgoing?

215
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,315
Or was it like flipping a switch on stage?

216
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,317
Only when I'm on stage, yes.

217
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,820
I was still pretty shy
even into my early thirties,

218
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:18,024
but at some point,
I think that part of me faded away.

219
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,094
I think if you keep trying,
even when it's tough,

220
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,429
things do get better.

221
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:28,534
Would you say you've always been
an introverted person?

222
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,204
Isn't it quite obvious?

223
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:34,440
-Have you always…
-Can't you tell?

224
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:37,543
Well, I am definitely an introvert,

225
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:41,814
but I think I'm someone
who prefers comfort over curiosity.

226
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:46,586
There are people who get excited
when they meet someone new,

227
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,788
and others are more drawn
to their friends.

228
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,923
I'm definitely the second kind.

229
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,961
I guess that's why people think
I'm shy around strangers.

230
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:58,731
-But I meet so many new people at work.
-True.

231
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,066
On top of that,

232
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:03,235
I'm supposed to lift the mood
and keep the energy up.

233
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,171
-That's my job.
-Of course.

234
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:07,039
That clashes with my personality.

235
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,342
So, I think work has made me

236
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,912
a lot more outgoing over time.

237
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:16,248
I mean, you can't expect your work
to fit your personality perfectly.

238
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:17,149
Right.

239
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,985
For this trip, you can…

240
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,221
just be yourself.

241
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,327
-Take your stress out on me.
-You already put me at ease.

242
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,129
Our time as a couple is almost up.

243
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,797
FINAL CHAPTER OF THEIR MARRIAGE

244
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:33,799
Time to make the "decision to leave."

245
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,035
"Decision to break up."

246
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:37,536
I'm sad.

247
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,839
Let's love even louder while we still can.

248
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:40,806
I'd love that.

249
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,141
This is it.

250
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,310
-It's huge.
-Harbin Beer Museum.

251
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,212
A PLACE TO SOOTHE THEIR GOODBYE

252
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,314
-Man.
-What a fun way to end the trip.

253
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,484
MUSEUM DEDICATED TO HARBIN,
CHINA'S FIRST BEER SINCE 1900

254
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,985
-You've never been here?
-No.

255
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,353
Drink like a horse?

256
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,822
HORSE + BOOZE

257
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,090
Look at that.

258
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,160
They've loaded up the wagon
with barrels of booze.

259
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,262
-That horse looks drunk.
-Heavily drunk.

260
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,164
Its eyes look a little glazed over.

261
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,434
-It's my first time here.
-Mine too.

262
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,637
-Freshly brewed beer must taste amazing.
-I bet.

263
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,573
ENTERING THE MUSEUM
WITH SO MUCH EXCITEMENT

264
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,941
Is that a runaway train?

265
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,146
-Some guys run away when they're drunk.
-I know!

266
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:21,047
A runaway train!

267
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:23,783
Runaway train and drunk horse.
The total package.

268
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:24,684
Wow.

269
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,419
FASCINATING RIGHT FROM THE START

270
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,154
-This is amusing.
-Nice.

271
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:33,626
They look like they've been drinking here
for decades.

272
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:37,263
My goodness, that drink must be so good
they just turned to stone.

273
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,465
Snap out of it. Time to head home.

274
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,000
Can I drink this?

275
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:44,003
Is it empty?
I guess this is the old bottle.

276
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,807
Watching them
makes me wanna quit drinking.

277
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,843
I'm scared I'll end up like that
in Seoul somewhere.

278
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,780
-What is this place?
-It's the bottling line.

279
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:56,716
There they go!

280
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,820
-It's cute.
-I can hear the bottles clinking.

281
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,022
BEER BOTTLES MOVING IN ROWS

282
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,623
I'm trippy already.

283
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,696
Is this the dizzy room?

284
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,565
HANGOVER SIMULATION ROOM

285

TILTED FLOOR AND OPTICAL ILLUSIONS
MAKE YOU FEEL DRUNK WITHOUT DRINKING

286
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,371
I feel like throwing up already.

287
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:21,373
What was that?

288
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,274
(STAGGER)

289
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:23,175
What?

290
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,811
I'm going to walk now.

291
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,716
Why am I in the same spot?

292
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,084
Seriously, I'm dizzy.

293
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,520
Wait.

294
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,722
-I feel like throwing up.
-Wait.

295
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,059
Crap. Let's go back to our table.

296
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,460
YOU'VE HAD A BIT TOO MUCH

297
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,229
Hold it together.

298
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:44,897
This is really scary.

299
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:46,799
I mean…

300
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,667
DRUNK ACTING OUT OF NOWHERE

301
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:51,403

303
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,575
Hey. You can't get drunk.

304
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,344
I'm not drunk. You can't say that.

305
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,311
Oh, yeah!

Hey, I'm gonna grab us a taxi.

309
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,851
I'm paying.

310
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,686
-I already paid.
-Okay. Sorry.

311
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,155

I'm shocked.

328
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,938
I have some snacks with me.

329
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,941
-You might have tried these before.
-Have you been to the store?

330
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,343
-You bet.
-Wow, peanuts.

331
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,979
-And this one…
-Wait!

332
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,381
-It's my kind of snack.
-It's super hard to find.

333
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:10,482
Cucumber flavor.

334
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:12,818
-I didn't know you could get them.
-I wanted to try it.

335
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:15,988
This one's called
"Chicken That Needs a Manicure."

336
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:17,423
It's chicken feet.

337
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:21,093
I bought all the fun snacks. This one too!

00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,029
Why are you obsessed with feet?

00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:25,965
I'm into feet, you know.

341
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:26,866

-What is it?
-I've seen this all over Shorts.

-It startled you, didn't it?
-Yeah.

356
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:57,997
NOT YOUR AVERAGE FRUIT SMELL

357
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,799
It's a strange smell,
but that's part of the charm.

358
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,201
POPS IT IN CAUTIOUSLY

359
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,911
It tastes just like it smells, doesn't it?

360
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,879
-Do you know this?
-Yeah.

361
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,347
Like the belly button smell.

362
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,750
It smells nasty, but you keep sniffing.

363
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:18,817
Listen, Yo-han…

364
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:19,852
(INHALE)

365
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:22,154
When I'm low on energy, I might go…

366
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:25,557
You're almost…

367
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,626
Hey! You're addicted!

368
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,261
Get it together, Yo-han.

369
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,462
You wanna act or not?

370
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:35,267
Are you gonna spend the rest of your life
sniffing jackfruit at home?

371
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,835
Shake hands. Thanks for everything.

372
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,639
-I wouldn't dare.
-Are you rejecting me?

373
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,274
You're embarrassing my hand!

374
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,510
You're embarrassing my foot,
or whatever it is.

375
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:47,146
-Let's do rock-paper-scissors.
-All right.

376
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:49,281
Rock-paper-scissors.

377
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,423
-Do it again.
-Okay.

378
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:58,557
Rock-paper-scissors.

379
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,160
Why are we so in sync? We keep drawing.

380
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:02,895
Rock-paper-scissors.

381
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,564
Hey, stop copying me. I'm serious.

382
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,733
-I'm gonna ask the stars.
-Go ahead.

383
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:10,669
It's showing me one thing.

384
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,373
I think I saw three of something.

385
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,475
-Let's play muk-jji-ppa instead.
-Okay.

386
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:17,977
Rock-paper-scissors.

387
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,244
Muk-jji-ppa.

388
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:20,946
Muk-jji-ppa.

389
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,916
THIS COUPLE RUNS ON CHICKEN FEET

390
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:25,884
Do-yeon.

391
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:28,754
This much connection is not good.

392
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,223
-I'm scared now.
-I'm scared too.

393
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,192
I don't wanna go back to Korea.

394
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:34,927
-I'm going to miss you.
-Exactly.

395
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,600
-Wow!
-How is it?

396
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,102
Let me try.

397
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,304
These cucumber chips
might not be for everyone.

398
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:46,438
But I love it.

399
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,340
I should take some home.

400
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,542
I'm definitely stocking up on this.

401
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:52,678
-Do you like it?
-Yeah.

402
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,813
-Do you like sunflower seeds?
-Sunflower seeds?

403
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,015
-Yes.
-I do.

404
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,217
I like sunflower seeds too. It's…

405
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,619
People in China love seed snacks,
don't they?

406
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,388
A NATIONAL FAVORITE IN CHINA

407
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:03,989
Yeah, they love seeds.

408
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,124
Did you enjoy them?

409
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,493
-When you were a student.
-I wasn't a sunflower back then.

410
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,527
I am one now.

411
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,295
What the…

412
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,699
Personality-wise. Why are you laughing?

413
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,834
You face one thing in life
like a sunflower?

414
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,569
-Yes.
-What's that one thing? Acting?

415
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:18,637
Today.

416
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,372
You chase today, nothing else.

417
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,641
My whole mind's on you and this show.

418
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,344
I mean, this trip. Not this show.

419
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,912
It's sweet that you said that.

420
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:27,813
TOUCHED

421
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,650
I can't deny that this is a show,
but I'd like to think I'm on a trip.

422
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,685
I appreciate that. That's what we wanted.

423
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:37,489
In 2026 or 2027, I hope to see you
nominated for Best New Actress…

424
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,892
FOR HER APPEARANCE IN THE MOVIE
&lt;YOUR WORLD&gt;

425
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,027
…at the Blue Dragon Film Awards.

426
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:45,964
What if I do get nominated at the awards,
not for the movie,

427
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:48,233
but for Getaway and Go with Jangdobari?

428
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,870
-You'll be on the screen too.
-I think I'll be nominated instead.

429
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:55,841
I can't argue with that.
Honestly, you're the fun of the show.

430
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,243
You could win the Best New Actress award.

431
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:03,382
Nah, I got everything I wanted
just by being in that film.

432
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:06,485
I didn't dream about it or anything.
It was unexpected.

433
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:09,388
And this is where it ends for me.

434
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:11,690
-So--
-Okay, I respect that.

435
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,427
But I'll keep wishing for it,
like how a sunflower never looks away.

436
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,931
I know it won't happen,
but it already feels like it did.

437
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:20,866
I'm not even allowed to dream it.

438
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,001
You can dream anything you want.

439
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:24,903
No, that's just too…

440
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,307
Get drunk and have yourself
an award show dream tonight.

441
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,444
That was an unsettling good-luck wish.

442
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:33,912
WAS THAT A BLESSING OR A CURSE?

443
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:35,681
-Let's go for a drink now.
-Yes.

444
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,216
To a famous guobaorou place.

445
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:41,620
Harbin is famous for guobaorou, you know.

446
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:44,189
I haven't eaten it in a while.
I'd love to go.

447
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,058
-Have you been to that place?
-Where?

448
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,093
-Laochujia.
-I think I have.

449
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,262
-Yeah? When you were a student?
-Yes.

450
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,732
LAOCHUJIA: A HISTORIC RESTAURANT
THAT OPENED IN 1885

451
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,934
THE BIRTHPLACE OF GUOBAOROU

452
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:06,178
If we take a cab, it would take us
50 minutes to get there.

453
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:10,048
And we can't wait that long.

454
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:11,917
So I want to teleport there.

455
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:16,088
-Let's teleport to Laochujia.
-Sure.

456
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,990
Three, two, one.

457
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,796
I think it came in with me.

458
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,699
Thank you. It's bigger than the cilantro.

459
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,268
It must've followed me inside.

460
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,936
-We're here.
-Laochujia.

461
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,471
ARRIVED IN NO TIME

462
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,640
So many magical things
are happening to us.

463
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:35,874
Just being here is magic.

464
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,343
Let's drink up. Thanks for inviting me.

465
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,717
What is this restaurant famous for?

466
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:48,253
Guobaorou. It says here
that this place opened in…

467
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,389
LAOCHUJIA'S SIGNATURE DISH
CLASSIC GUOBAOROU

468
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,357
One guobaorou.

469
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:54,393
Disanxian.

470
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:58,564
I heard they make
great liangpi or something too.

471
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,066
-Sesame liangpi?
-Yes, sesame liangpi.

472
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,502
-Two binggun.
-Cool.

473
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,704
And pork fried rice, please.

474
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,044
SPEAKING PERFECT CHINESE FOR ORDERING BEER

475
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,881
All the restaurants here are so old.

476
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:18,417
I guess that means they are good.

477
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,719
-This one opened in 1885.
-It's that old?

478
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:21,954
Yes, it says here.

479
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:23,589
Binggun.

480
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,627
BINGGUN: CHINESE-STYLE FRIED ICE CREAM

481
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,896
A CRISPY, WARM SHELL
WITH COLD ICE CREAM INSIDE

482
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:33,665
There's ice cream inside.
It's fried ice cream.

483
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,734
-Really?
-Yeah, it's very famous.

484
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:37,836
CRISP

485
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:42,374
Ice cream.

486
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:46,945
You're spilling it.

487
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:47,846
Do-yeon?

488
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:49,982
Let me help you.

489
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:51,049
Open up.

490
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,188
DO-YEON'S THIRD PCR TEST IN HARBIN

491
00:20:58,056 --> 00:20:59,591
Why did your face turn so red?

492
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:06,932
UTTER CHAOS

493
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:11,670
How does it taste?

494
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,772
It's really good.

495
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,474
But I was in pain for a while.

496
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:19,044
-It's worth the pain though.
-It's good, huh?

497
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,646
The coating is delicious.

498
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:23,048
It's sweet and salty.

499
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,250
They are good at frying things here.

500
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,319
-That's true all over China.
-So tasty.

501
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,759
SWEET GUY
ORDERING MORE FOR THE CREW

502
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:35,327
This is…

503
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,162
killer.

504
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,164
Do you mind if I lick this?

505
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:43,802
DELIGHTFUL DOWN TO THE LAST DROP

506
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,203
Really, it's delicious.

507
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:47,239
Can you…

508
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,644
SECOND DISH
SESAME LIANGPI

509
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:53,979
Oh my!

510
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:58,317
A WHOLE DIFFERENT LOOK
FROM YESTERDAY'S SESAME LIANGPI

511
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,894
-You first.
-May I?

512
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,228
YOU FIRST, HONEY

513
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:13,065
-This looks different from yesterday.
-It does.

514
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:14,433
It has more topping on it.

515
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,500
ZHANGBAOPU/LAOCHUJIA

516
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:20,806
What's it like?

517
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,241
Does it taste any different?

518
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:25,877
Yes, a little bit.

519
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,413
This one's more sour.

520
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:30,916
-There's cucumber.
-Yeah.

521
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:33,118
-It's got more topping.
-Tastes fresher.

522
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,154
Wow, is that fried rice?

523
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,757
DISANXIAN AND PORK FRIED RICE

524
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,425
So this is disanxian. Oh gosh!

525
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:42,294
I actually made a special request.

526
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,262
-Get out of here!
-It's a surprise.

527
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:46,098
FRIED RICE FULL OF YO-HAN'S LOVE

528
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:47,232

529
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,334
A FRAGRANT STIR-FRY
MADE WITH PORK AND FENNEL

530
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:56,842
DISANXIAN: A CLASSIC CHINESE STIR-FRY

531
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:59,111
MADE WITH EGGPLANT, POTATO,
AND BELL PEPPER

532
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:08,854
How is it? It's super tasty, right?

533
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,590
It's so good!

534
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:13,191
It's beyond what I imagined.

535
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:14,926
BLOWN AWAY BY THE PORK FRIED RICE

536
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,329
It's seriously good.

537
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,797
How did my love taste?

538
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:21,900
-I feel sad.
-You feel sad?

539
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,435
We'll be getting a divorce soon.

540
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:26,138
No. Tell me that's not true.

541
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:28,206
I'll dream of you every night.

542
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:30,709
But we might as well
get the divorce over with

543
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,477
and keep seeing each other after that.

544
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,746
-You mean, a clean breakup?
-Yes, that's it.

545
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:35,647
Cool.

546
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:38,049
COOL ABOUT DIVORCE, JUST LIKE MARRIAGE

547
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:39,484
The fried rice is amazing.

548
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:43,088
Was it always this good
when you went to school around here?

549
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,556
Always this good.

550
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:46,158
I didn't see this coming.

551
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:48,693
How does it have this much umami?

552
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,031
Thank you, ma'am!

553
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:57,035
FINAL DISH, TODAY'S MAIN STAR
GUOBAOROU

554
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:59,371
GUOBAOROU: A DISH BORN IN HARBIN

555
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,474
CRISPY FRIED PORK COATED IN TANGY SAUCE

556
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:08,780
HEART-POUNDING FIRST BITE

557
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:10,248
It's too delicious.

558
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:12,684
Almost dangerous.

559
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,220
CRUNCH

560
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:19,224
Are you okay?

561
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,425
It's hot.

562
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:22,561
Cool it down.

563
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:23,695
EMERGENCY BEER TREATMENT

564
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,433
I can taste cilantro in the guobaorou.

565
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,335
-They must've put some in.
-I think so.

566
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,236
It's good.

567
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,205
It's tangier than the ones in Korea.

568
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:34,339
It really is.

569
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:37,075
-What's your favorite dish from here?
-You go first.

570
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,711
(PORK FRIED RICE)

571
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,379
-Really?
-Yeah, your turn.

572
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,048
This is hard.

573
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:44,783
I choose this one.

574
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,051
-Guobaorou?
-Yes.

575
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:47,586
And binggun from earlier.

576
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,822
That one was good too. What's it called?

577
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,492
-Binggun.
-Here we go again.

578
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,561
Byun Loong-han is back!

579
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,297
Can't fight the beer.

580
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:02,501
-Let's drink.
-Binggun was tasty too.

581
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:04,936
Do you feel less awkward now?

582
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,405
No pressure. I feel more at ease now.

583
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:08,807
I feel so relaxed.

584
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:12,010
You know how you tense up
when you're nervous?

585
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:13,545
-Yes.
-I'm totally loose.

586
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:15,380
That's good. You know what?

587
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:18,216
I'm all relaxed now,
so whether you are relaxed or not,

588
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:20,652
I don't really care.

589
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,020
That's a good thing.

590
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,456
-Sorry.
-You're not relaxed.

591
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,992
-That's why you apologized.
-I'm not relaxed.

592
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:28,059
This is fun.

593
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:30,962
I think I had too much beer.

594
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,667
It feels as if someone's punching me.

595
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,807
LOCKED IN A TOUGH FIGHT WITH HIMSELF

596
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,075
I've got a good story.

597
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:46,077
-Did I ever tell you?
-Tell me what?

598
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:48,079
I went to this photo studio.

599
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,582
They said you had
your picture taken there.

600
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,418
That place is quite hard to find,
you know.

601
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:55,353
You're right. It is…

602
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,621
-It's tiny and…
-Yeah.

603
00:25:57,756 --> 00:25:59,558
Wait, is it that tiny?

604
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:01,126
The owner must be devastated.

605
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:03,261
-It's an established shop.
-Right!

606
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,462
(AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED)

607
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,665
You can feel that the owner cherishes it.

608
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:07,732
That's it.

609
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,935
GAS MAKING A COMEBACK

610
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,305
Was getting your photo taken
that depressing?

611
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:15,574
And I heard
that you had already been there.

612
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,976
Yeah. I went there last year.

613
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:20,812
So I was like, "What are the chances?"

614
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:22,681
I'm full. How about you?

615
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:23,882
Me too. That was great.

616
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:25,884
I'm full from the beer, actually.

617
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:27,319
I drank at the museum, too.

618
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:31,723
But you burped it all out.
There's no way you're full.

619
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,092
Nah, there are still
some big ones left in me.

620
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,494
I'm sorry. I need to go to the bathroom.

621
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,831
(WADDLE)

622
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:43,101
He can't even walk properly!

623
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:44,769
A MINUTE LATER

624
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:46,371
What happened, may I ask?

625
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:49,274
The inner me was just too strong.

626
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:52,644
He kept trying to come out.

627
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,112
So I let him escape.

628
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:56,114
You're hilarious.

629
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:57,182
(RIGHT UP HER ALLEY)

630
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:58,850
I gave it a proper send-off.

631
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,986
If he comes back, he's dead.

632
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,687
You're killing me.

633
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,623
I'm working. Don't you dare mess with me.

634
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,660
I hate getting interrupted while working.

635
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,629
Back in elementary school--

636
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:12,464
Hold on. The bastard didn't leave.

637
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:18,103
He's still here.

638
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,170
Come on out!

639
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:23,108
Show yourself. How many of you are there?

640
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:28,546
-They are still here.
-It's more than one?

641
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:30,682
-Actually…
-My stomach hurts from laughing.

642
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:31,950
There's a bunch of them.

643
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,352
I thought it was a scene from The Wailing.

644
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:36,221
My stomach hurts.

645
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:38,757
I can't believe a burp made me
laugh this much.

646
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:47,766
Go now.

647
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:55,573
-Just go already.
-Oh God!

648
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,942
That was the agreement.

649
00:27:58,743 --> 00:27:59,844
What are you saying?

650
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:01,513
You promised me, so go.

651
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:04,115
Oh no. He must be possessed.

652
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,084
Mercy me.

653
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,855
Five guys knocked just now!

654
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:14,325
All at once!

655
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:15,794
That was a close one.

656
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:17,562
Mercy.

657
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:19,431
(WEEPING)

658
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:21,299
I almost couldn't stop it this time.

659
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,601
Man, that was scary.

660
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:25,704
Do we need to do an exorcism or what?

661
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,706
I already did all of that.

662
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:29,107
That was like The Exorcist.

663
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:30,742
I actually want a stronger drink.

664
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,077
Let's go for it, then.

665
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,945
-Why not?
-Like mao-tai?

666
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:35,613
-Yeah. Let's drink that.
-Okay.

667
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,049
-This is our last day, remember?
-Let's do it.

668
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,985
ENDED UP ORDERING 50% BAIJIU

669
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:45,457
-Look at the glasses.
-Cute!

670
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:50,628
AND THE VERDICT?

671
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:51,696
Here we go.

672
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,339
It's good.

673
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:02,974
Love the aroma.

674
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:03,908
It's so good.

675
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:05,310
LUXURIOUS FROM FIRST WHIFF

676
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:06,377
Wait, I think…

677
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:10,315
-The heat's coming down now.
-This is…

678
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,617
-It's burning!
-It's burning.

679
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:20,258
Oh my. It smells incredible.

680
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,060
That, and it goes down easy.

681
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:24,429
That hit me like a bullet.

682
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:29,567
It's like a heat pack.

683
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:31,503
This is why people drink this to warm up.

684
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,605
Do-yeon, I…

685
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:35,373
Well…

686
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,942
-I've been thinking.
-About what?

687
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:42,247
Since I'm here,
I'd like to visit my old school.

688
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:45,316
You never thought of
visiting the school before?

689
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,453
You could've come here on a trip.

690
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,122
I wanted to come back
when I had more time.

691
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:53,291
But I didn't realize 20 years had passed.

692
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:55,927
Because you've been busy.

693
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:59,197
After I went back home,
I got into theater and film.

694
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:01,332
I was busy studying all the time.

695
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:03,968
And after that, work kept me busy.

696
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:08,306
But a few years back,
I started thinking about Harbin

697
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:09,707
every now and then.

698
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:12,744
I kept thinking I should go.

699
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:16,815
A friend I used to study with,
who's a dad now,

700
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:18,817
came here recently with his family.

701
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,020
He said the city's changed so much
and sent me pictures.

702
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:26,224
I wondered how much it had changed.

703
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:28,593
It has changed so much.

704
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:30,895
It must be a strange feeling.

705
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:32,964
Still, I'm just really happy.

706
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:36,534
It's only been a day,
but I didn't even notice time passing.

707
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,504
I got to visit places I missed out on
when I studied here.

708
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,540
I even tried food
I never got around to back then.

709
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,176
Having fun with you was a bonus.

710
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:49,180
I feel like this experience
will give me a lot of strength.

711
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:50,849
When you get back?

712
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,684
Yes, when I return to Seoul.

713
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:57,555
-Having said that, let's have a drink.
-Thanks.

714
00:30:57,622 --> 00:30:59,424
-Thanks.
-Thanks for coming.

715
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,025
GRATEFUL FOR EACH OTHER

716
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:01,926
Thank you.

717
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,202
Anyway, I'm jealous you're in Your World.

718
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,838
-Why didn't you do it, then?
-Wait, listen.

719
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:16,774
When Kyo-hwan and Ok-seop asked me

720
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,811
to join them for Your World…

721
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,413
When is this? After you read the script?

722
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,148
No, before that.

723
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:28,019
But Kyo-hwan told me everything about it.

724
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:28,953
"Hey, Yo-han."

725
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,988
MIMICKING KYO-HWAN

726
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,924
He asked, "What do you say?"
You know what I told him?

727
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:35,193
"Who's the lead?"
He was the lead, so I said…

728
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:37,428
"Can I be the lead?"

729
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,163
-Seriously?
-I said that.

730
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,565
"Hey, I have to do it."

731
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:45,036
I tried hard to convince him.
"Listen, man."

732
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:46,638
I was quite drunk.

733
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:48,172
"You shouldn't do it."

734
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:50,942
"I have to do it.
You've done it many times."

735
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:52,543
"It has to be me."

736
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:55,813
"It's my role! You hear me?"

737
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,019
-You said that?
-I really did.

738
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:05,290
"Hey, this casting is unique.
It's insane!"

739
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:09,027
But Ok-seop wrote it,
and the role was for Kyo-hwan.

740
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,262
I had fun.

741
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,864
It was unreal.

742
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:16,267
I think we've had our fill.

743
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:18,736
Let's go to that special place of yours.

744
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:21,773
Are you sure?
We can't go inside the campus anyway.

745
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,308
It's okay. I want to go.

746
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:24,976
Like you said before,

747
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,345
just breathing the air there
would be meaningful.

748
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:30,848
All I want to do is to take a walk
in front of the campus.

749
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:32,617
-Can we do that?
-Sure.

750
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:36,688
I'm here.

751
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:41,192
I'm actually here with you.
This is unbelievable.

752
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,127
-Take a picture here?
-Sounds good.

753
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:44,162
We're close to Russia.

754
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:45,363
COUPLE DANCE

755
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,598
Here's to Byun Yo-han's future!

756
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:49,300
CAN'T MISS A STREET CHAT

757
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:50,601
I just…

758
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:51,502
Hi there.

759
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:53,671
JUST A LITTLE BIT RAW

760
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,273
Did you eat a lot of lamb skewers?

761
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,042
I did. I basically lived on lamb skewers.

762
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,645
This place is insane.

763
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:03,314
-Cheers.
-This is my favorite place now.

764
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:05,817
A HAPPY TRIP COMES TO AN END

765
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:08,820
OR SO WE THOUGHT…

766
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,222
SOMETHING ABOUT THEM IS DIFFERENT

767
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:15,126
There's only one button. My wig, please.

768
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:17,161
Do-yeon, I think I'm done.

769
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:18,863
I'm done!

770
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,366
A WIDE RANGE OF SKITS

771
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,601
WITH TOP-TIER CHEMISTRY

772
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:24,502
This is the trend.

773
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:25,636
THE LAST CHAPTER OF HARBIN

774
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:30,375
LATE-NIGHT SKIT SHOW OUT OF NOWHERE
BY BARI-DUO

775
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:31,409
COOKIE-BARI

776
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:34,078
If we take a cab, it would take us
50 minutes to get there.

777
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:35,146
But we don't have time.

778
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:36,047
STARRING JANG DO-YEON

779
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:36,948
This is our last day.

780
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:37,849
AND BYUN YO-HAN

781
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,084
So I'm going to teleport there.

782
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:41,019
-You?
-Yeah.

783
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:42,353
That's not possible.

784
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,056
-That's not humanly possible.
-Don't trust me?

785
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:46,324
It's only 2025.

786
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,359
Okay. See you in Laochujia.

787
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:49,260
No way.

788
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:52,463
(DO-YEON VANISHES)

789
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:54,132
Do-yeon…

790
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:57,402
Do-yeon?

791
00:33:58,102 --> 00:33:59,303
Where did she go?

792
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:02,173
Wait a sec.

793
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,210
What's this?

794
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:07,712
Do-yeon!
