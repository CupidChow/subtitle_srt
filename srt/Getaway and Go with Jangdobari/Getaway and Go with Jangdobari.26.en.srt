1
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:05,872
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

2
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:07,140
Can you see where I am?

3
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:09,476
I'm here in Tokyo, Japan.

4
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:11,644
From what I heard, he's a true introvert.

5
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:13,313
Is he dancing?

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,614
Thank you for having me.

7
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:15,515
ONE OF THE BEST INTROVERTED
MULTI-ENTERTAINERS, LEE JUN-YOUNG

8
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:16,850
There's a theme to today's trip.

9
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,718
-Save it in my heart.
-Save.

10
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:20,453
(…SAVING THE MEMORIES)

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,821
WHERE DID THEY GO FIRST?

12
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:23,823
There was a ramen place we went to
for two to three weeks straight.

13
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,258
-Is that where we'll eat today?
-Yes.

14
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:27,260
SLURPING

15
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:30,130
It's so good.

16
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,698
That's awesome!

17
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:33,600
NODDING

18
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,268
THE TWO ENJOYED HIS FAVORITE DISH
FROM YEARS AGO

19
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:36,736
Have you ever tried kart riding before?

20
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:38,104
That will be us in a moment.

21
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:39,939
Oh, no!

22
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:41,441
-That…
-Is that what I have to drive?

23
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,877
This is something we'll never forget.

24
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:45,478
I just can't.

25
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,780
HAHA

26
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:48,715
I'm having fun right now.

27
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:49,983
This is so much fun.

28
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,985
There are more and more people
on the street.

29
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,120
I hope it gets dark soon.

30
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:55,822
This is driving me nuts.

31
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,357
I'm in big trouble.

32
00:00:57,857 --> 00:00:59,392
AFTER AN EXHAUSTING RIDE AROUND TOKYO

33
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,728
THEY SEEM TO BE IN NEED OF SOME HEALING

34
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,963
I feel like I was in an F1 race.

35
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,732
WHAT WILL RECHARGE
THE WORN OUT DO-YEON AND JUN-YOUNG?

36
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:06,933
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

37
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,169
It's dark out now.

38
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,571
My stubble grew back
faster than ever today.

39
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:14,107
You should go-kart
whenever you want to grow a beard.

40
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:17,077
-But ride it only in Japan, not in Korea.
-Absolutely.

41
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:20,480
You also have to make sure
to pass through Shibuya and Shinjuku.

42
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:23,516
Did you see those people in the outfits?

43
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,852
I did. They were ready
for the full experience.

44
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,320
-They looked like game characters.
-I know.

45
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:30,590
They were enjoying the rides,
yelling at the top of their lungs.

46
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:32,325
I give them an A+
on living out the romance.

47
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,494
I still can't forget
how you looked from behind.

48
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,096
-How so?
-The way you did this.

49
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:38,364
It was like you were announcing

50
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,999
that you were getting serious.

51
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,302
It was like
"Hey, Jun-young, watch and learn."

52
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,504
-Oh, please.
-It's true.

53
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,239
All that just to go at 30 km/h.

54
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:51,945
They say that
when you face a critical moment,

55
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:55,448
your life's memorable moments

56
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:58,251
flash before your eyes like a panorama.

57
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:59,652
-This will be one of them.
-Really?

58
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,388
At what moment, exactly?
In Shinjuku or Shibuya?

59
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,457
When we rode from Shibuya to Harajuku.

60
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:06,759
THE KART RIDE OF A LIFETIME

61
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:09,128
Remember when we stopped in Shibuya?

62
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:12,165
Waiting for the green light
was an exhilarating experience.

63
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,500
Don't I know it.

64
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:14,567
I mean…

65
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,070
It was fun.

66
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,406
We only arrived here a few hours ago.

67
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:22,709
But…

68
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:25,011
-we already did a lot.
-Weird, isn't it?

69
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:27,714
It feels like a long time has passed.

70
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,716
But it hasn't been that long.

71
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:31,718
It's only been six hours.

72
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:33,419
Plus, we only arrived today.

73
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,487
Tell me about it.

74
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,556
All we did was eat ramen
and ride go-karts.

75
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,491
That's just how trips are.

76
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,460
Time and space bend in mysterious ways.

77
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:44,364
EPISODE 5
A HEATED CHEER AND SUPPORT

78
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,901
Here's something I've noticed about you.
You're a lot different

79
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:50,837
from the characters you play on screen.

80
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,039
But you also become someone else
when you dance.

81
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,207
Anyway, it's natural for people

82
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:57,310
to be drawn to someone
who has unexpected qualities.

83
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:00,313
To me, you're the perfect example of that.

84
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,115
You're shy,

85
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,384
yet you're an incredible dancer.

86
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,718
You love to compete in dance battles.

87
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,388
But when you act,
you turn into someone else.

88
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,858
Then again, you're not as shy as you seem,

89
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,927
since you're cute with those close to you.

90
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,828
I love you too.

91
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,466
People like that are interesting to me.

92
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,236
You want to get to know them more.

93
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:31,010
It got cold during the kart ride,
so we'll have something warm.

94
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,812
-What will we have to eat?
-Us?

95
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,815
We're having monjayaki,
one of Tokyo's most famous dishes.

96
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:37,317
MONJAYAKI

97
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:40,620
A FLOUR-BATTER PANCAKE WITH VEGETABLES
AND SEAFOOD COOKED ON A GRIDDLE

98
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,021
Do you like monjayaki?

99
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,890
-I haven't had it before.
-No?

100
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,091
Nice.

101
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:48,328
I've only had it a few times myself.

102
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,796
Anyway, this place is known
for its monjayaki.

103
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,402
-Do-yeon, can you stand over there?
-Here?

104
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,471
Jeez.

105
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,741
I should think about it as acting.

106
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,176
COY

107
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,410
-Nice.
-Really?

108
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,347
I love subtle sounds like that.

109
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,016
This is it.

110
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:13,886
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

111
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:14,954
MONJA KATO

112
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,556
Thank you.

113
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,093
Yes, please. Thank you.

114
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:23,529
I didn't know monjayaki
was made like this.

115
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,732
FASCINATED

116
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:28,701
How about we ask for a recommendation?

117
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,537
A recommendation.

118
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,339
May I take the lead on this one?

119
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:34,240
Sir!

120
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:40,213
-A recommendation, please.
-A recommendation?

121
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,016
The monjayaki is absolutely tasty.

122
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:44,951
-Very good? I see.
-Yes.

123
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,187
Monjayaki with pollack roe,
rice cake, and cheese is exceptional.

124
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:49,088
"Mentaiko."

125
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:51,591
-Pollack roe and…
-Pollack roe, rice cake, and cheese.

126
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,192
-Is that okay?
-I'm good with that.

127
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,694
We'll have that, then.

128
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,229
This? Got it. Thank you.

129
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,397
-Right.
-Thank you.

130
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,564
What about beverages?

131
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,999
Would you like something?

132
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,401
How about a glass of beer?

133
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,302
Why not?

134
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:03,403
Do you have draft beer?

135
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,171
-Draft beer? Sure.
-We'll have two, please.

136
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,773
Draft beer? Got it.

137
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,441
Could we start with some draft beer?

138
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,443
-Thank you.
-Good.

139
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,679
-Nice.
-Two glasses of draft beer!

140
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:13,780
SATISFIED

141
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,349
Right. Thank you.

142
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,584
-Your Japanese is good.
-My Japanese is great.

143
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,886
Only when at a Japanese izakaya.

144
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:21,421
Right.

145
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,924
How is it that everyone here
has great smiles?

146
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,194
Did you have any regular spots
back when you lived in Japan?

147
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,262
Sure.

148
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:30,730
It's still around.

149
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,999
I go there
with the staff I worked with back then.

150
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,467
It's a bar

151
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,669
where the owner is the only employee,

152
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:39,405
and he's the coolest.

153
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:42,275
He looks like someone from a comic book.

154
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,144
He makes drinks on request,

155
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:48,448
whether it's a cocktail
or something really strong.

156
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,918
He's like, "I mixed these,
and they'll taste great together."

157
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:53,586
-Excuse me.
-Thank you.

158
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:54,887
-Here's your draft beer.
-That was fast.

159
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:55,955
Thank you.

160
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:56,989
Quickly, please.

161
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:58,858
-That was fast, wasn't it?
-Thank you.

162
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,727
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

163
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:03,096
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

164
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:13,406
That's so good.

165
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:16,476
-It's so good.
-No way.

166
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,045
(IT'S THE BEST, SIR!)

167
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:22,648
That's incredible.

168
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:23,983
It's so good.

169
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,285
Don't you like having snacks?

170
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:27,787
They're not really my thing.

171
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,489
-You just stick to meals.
-Right.

172
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,023
-What about you?
-That's a healthy habit. Me?

173
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,492
I can't get enough of it.

174
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,128
TOYS AND SNACKS
GRAB DO-YEON'S ATTENTION

175
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,497
Do you snack before your meals?

176
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,198
-Or do you eat after?
-I couldn't wait,

177
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:40,466
so my mom always gave me an earful.

178
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:42,769
What's your mom's name?

179
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:44,871
My mom? It's Choi Jin-suk.

180
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:46,773
My mom too.

181
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,241
-Really?
-That's also her name.

182
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:49,509
-Seriously?
-Yes.

183
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,177
-I was shocked.
-For real?

184
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,813
A few days ago, I watched the episode

185
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,815
of Chef & My Fridge you were in,

186
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,618
and you mentioned your mom's name.

187
00:06:58,684 --> 00:06:59,619
Really?

188
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,654
I was shocked to learn
they had the same name.

189
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,256
Really? That's so funny.

190
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:05,358
No way.

191
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,160
Call me your nuna.

192
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:08,561
Wait, you already do call me that.

193
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,430
-What?
-I forgot.

194
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:11,764
You already do.

195
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,199
That's wild.

196
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,267
A FASCINATING COINCIDENCE

197
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,735
I was surprised to find that out.

198
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,470
No way.

199
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,475
I've never heard of anyone
having the same name as her before.

200
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,581
I'll go take a look.

201
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:33,386
PACKED WITH TOYS AND VARIOUS SNACKS

202
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,520
What's this?

203
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,023
Nice.

204
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,027
Oh, I can draw these as a prize.

205
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,464
I'd love to get this watermelon.

206
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,265
He said you should try it.

207
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:47,834
One? Just one?

208
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,236
-How much is it?
-It's 100 yen.

209
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,004
Sure.

210
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,207
Get a good one.

211
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:56,275
The watermelon.
Please let it be number one.

212
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:57,410
HOPING FOR THE WATERMELON

213
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,248
AH…

214
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,216
It's 88.

215
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,383
Number 88.

216
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,085
-Number 88.
-Number 88.

217
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,453
FAILS TO WIN THE WATERMELON

218
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:10,423
Congratulations.

219
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,958
He just congratulated you.

220
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:13,759
Did he? Got it.

221
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,728
Thank you so much.

222
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,666
(WANTING MORE)

223
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:21,734
Let me try again.

224
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:23,936
GETTING UP

225
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,038
Excuse me. Can I try again?

226
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:28,741
SHE GIVES IT ANOTHER TRY

227
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,514
What number did you get?

228
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,982
Damn, number 48.

229
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:37,783
Number 48.

230
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,819
-Here.
-This one?

231
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:40,953
THIS TIME SHE WON THE BLUE BALL

232
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,155
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

233
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,893
Are you collecting
Infinity Stones or something?

234
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,195
I guess this is meaningful.

235
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,363
Good.

236
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,398
(A YOUNG CUSTOMER IS DRAWING A NUMBER)

237
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,433
Let's see what she gets.

238
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:02,108
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

239
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,776
SHE WON THE BIGGEST PRIZE!

240
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,778
I guess being kind is how you win big.

241
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,413
-She got the biggest prize.
-I should play that instead.

242
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:09,782
I'm doing that one instead.

243
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:12,718
Have a good day!

244
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:13,653
Congratulations.

245
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,688
BACK ON HER FEET!

246
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,326
This is way better.
I should play for these too.

247
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,861
-Do-yeon, please sit back down.
-These.

248
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,162
Excuse me.

249
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,697
This one, please.

250
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,132
THIS ONE!

251
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:30,169
Number 17.

252
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,972
SHE FAILS TO WIN A BIG ITEM YET AGAIN

253
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,141
Get back here!

254
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,175
It's so cute.

255
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,510
SO CUTE~

256
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,013
SHE WON A CUTE LITTLE ITEM

257
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,415
What is it?

258
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:44,650
-Excuse me.
-Here's our food.

259
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,819
Thank you for being patient.

260
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:50,089
This is monjayaki
with pollack roe, rice cake, and cheese.

261
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,060
He'll cook it for us

262
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:55,695
-on this griddle.
-I see.

263
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,063
I love it.

264
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,532
Is this shio kombu?

265
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,933
Yes, that's shio kombu.

266
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,036
-Your Japanese is incredible.
-Thank you.

267
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,571
You're very fluent.

268
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:06,839
Please wait a few minutes.

269
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,309
I asked if this was shio kombu.

270
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:11,544
Shio, what?

271
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,179
-Kombu is kelp.
-Kombu?

272
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,513
KOMBU = KELP

273
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,449
-This is eaten a lot.
-I know.

274
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:19,185
-It's eaten a lot in Japan.
-As a beer snack and stuff.

275
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:20,453
This is adorable.

276
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,022
-This is cute.
-Ah, cute.

277
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,357
This is a hagashi.

278
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:25,725
-Hagashi?
-A hagashi.

279
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,094
It's surprisingly small

280
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,829
and that's because

281
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:33,165
this dish used to be eaten by children.

282
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,334
That's why it was made that way.

283
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:36,902
Really?

284
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:40,640
It started off as a dish for children,

285
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:43,976
but adults enjoy it now too.

286
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,381
Okay, let's get cooking.

287
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:53,019
STARTING OFF BY TAPPING AN UPBEAT RHYTHM

288
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:55,888
A performance comes with the dish.

289
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:00,760
GRILLING THE RICE CAKES FIRST

290
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,229
It could splatter, so be careful.

291
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,005
It smells incredible.

292
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,377
What's in this?

293
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,379
For starters, a broth.

294
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,348
MONJAYAKI: SIMILAR TO OKONOMIYAKI

295
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,250
BUT THE BATTER IS RUNNIER
DUE TO THE ADDED BROTH

296
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:28,354
What?

297
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,924
What is this? Hold on.

298
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,025
Seriously?

299
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:36,095
SUDDENLY, A MONKEY COMES OUT
PLAYING CYMBALS

300
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,464
What the hell is this?

301
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,166
No way.

302
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:41,233
ON THIS SIDE, A DRUMMING BEAR

303
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,169
What is this?

304
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:47,306
They're cheering me on
while I cook the monjayaki for you.

305
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,708
Go, me!

306
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:51,844
They're cheering him on
while he makes the monjayaki.

307
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:56,315
GO, GO!

308
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,751
This is hilarious. Are you kidding me?

309
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,421
Check that out.

310
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:03,989
It's so lousy and silly.

311
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,758
This is so silly.

312
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,060
THE OWNER BEGINS HIS PERFORMANCE
TO THE SOUND OF CHEERING

313
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:11,897
Yes, let's go!

314
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:12,998
GO, GO!

315
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,500
GO!

316
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,071
You've got this!

317
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,217
Its eyes are out of focus.

318
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:32,518
It's so scary.

319
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,287
This is absolutely hilarious.

320
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:37,156
This is killing me.

321
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,859
It's actually blowing the whistle.

322
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,460
-Really?
-Yes.

323
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,197
TOOT, TOOT

324
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:48,267
This is so funny.

325
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:53,038
THE WILD PERFORMANCE
DRAINS THE INTROVERTS OF THEIR ENERGY

326
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,406
This is cheese.

327
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:55,508
This is art.

328
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,444
It's a work of art.

329
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:01,347
NOTICES

330
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,250
SUDDENLY BRINGING HIS ENERGY UP

331
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,684
I'd love for that to go-kart riding.

332
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:06,952
May I sprinkle some sesame seeds?

333
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,721
Sure. Are you good with sesame seeds?

334
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,789
I'd love that.

335
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,694
There's a lot to enjoy.

336
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:17,863
-I'm all done.
-Are you done?

337
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,999
All done!

338
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:21,467
I appreciate the support.

339
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,469
Thank you so much.

340
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,070
Finally, peace has been restored.

341
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,306
To be honest, that was eerie.

342
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,376
THE MONJAYAKI IS DONE

343
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,178
My stomach hurts from laughing.

344
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:33,813
This looks delicious.

345
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:36,782
You can eat what's on this side.

346
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,350
That side isn't quite done yet.

347
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:39,819
-This isn't done yet.
-Not yet.

348
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:43,155
You may use the spatula
to scoop as much as you want.

349
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,456
This is adorable.

350
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:45,958
Thank you.

351
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,127
-We'll enjoy.
-Please do.

352
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,628
What a laugh.

353
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,063
I laughed for ages.

354
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,998
I'll remember this
when I go to bed tonight.

355
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:00,706
-Nice.
-Is it good?

356
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,844
I remember it now. This is good.

357
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:07,112
It's the best monjayaki I've ever had.

358
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,516
The batter itself is tasty.

359
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,585
How is it? Is it to your liking?

360
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,220
It's delicious.

361
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:15,521
-Isn't it good?
-It is.

362
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,389
Excuse me. Let me finish cooking the dish.

363
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:18,457
It must be done.

364
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,092
I'll go ahead and finish it up.

365
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:23,629
SCRAPING THE CHEESE
THAT HAS MELTED AND STUCK

366
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,197
That's so cool.

367
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,233
This is a cheese senbei.

368
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,534
-A senbei!
-Yes, a senbei.

369
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,808
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

370
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:37,610
This must be super hot.

371
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:40,813
CRISPY

372
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,083
Is it good?

373
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:47,019
CRISPY + SAVORY + SALTY

374
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,087
It's good.

375
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,589
The saltiness will pair well with beer.

376
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,691
CHEERS

377
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,231
It's so good.

378
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,234
I heard you were good at cooking.

379
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,870
I just cook what I eat, that's all.

380
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:06,338
Like what?

381
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,107
I made ramen at home once.

382
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:10,609
You made ramen? How?

383
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,878
-With chicken,
-Chicken?

384
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:17,483
pork bones, pork trotters,
and chicken feet.

385
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,652
I added all of that.

386
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:21,987
-Did you make your own broth?
-I made a broth.

387
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,890
Using the simple noodle maker I'd bought,

388
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:27,092
I mixed AP and bread flour

389
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,894
with salt and other things.

390
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:32,131
I looked up a recipe in Japanese

391
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,198
and made the noodles.

392
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,234
I did it that one time.

393
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,202
-How was it?
-There won't be a second time.

394
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,838
It was tasty though.

395
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,540
-That's impressive.
-But I don't think

396
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,076
I'll do it a second time.

397
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,511
How long did it take?

398
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:49,515
It took me over a day
just to make the broth.

399
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,551
So…

400
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,421
It's really not worth the time or money.

401
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,823
Of course.
It's not about efficiency, but still.

402
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,859
What happened to the noodle maker?

403
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:01,894
I sold it secondhand.

404
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,195
Did you?

405
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,897
I'm sure it went to a good person.

406
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:08,000
I've never heard of someone
who made ramen at home before.

407
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,835
What else have you cooked at home?

408
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:13,505
I'm fond of Japanese food,

409
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:16,008
-so I made shogayaki once.
-What's that?

410
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,443
It's pork

411
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:22,014
that's braised in a ginger and soy sauce.

412
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:24,616
It's perfect to have with rice.

413
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,252
I've also made katsudon before.

414
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,754
I pounded the meat

415
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,589
and even cut through the tendons.

416
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:35,594
There was a lady who cooked for us
while we lived in Japan.

417
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,230
Since I was the youngest member
and underage,

418
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:41,100
I spent a lot of the time at home alone.

419
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,503
Since I was around her so much,
I started asking questions.

420
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:48,007
If I liked a dish,
I asked how she made it.

421
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:51,310
I wasn't fluent in Japanese back then,
so I used a translator to…

422
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:53,746
You were 18 at the time.

423
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:55,481
(JUN-YOUNG AT 18)

424
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:56,382
She told me how to make them.

425
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,984
She must've adored you.

426
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:01,120
Still, making ramen from scratch…

427
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,921
It didn't take that long.

428
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:03,822
WIPING THE WATER-

429
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,991
Should I not read into this?

430
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,393
I might get the wrong idea.

431
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:10,162
You didn't even respond to that.

432
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,131
Actually, I find that more pleasant.

433
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,465
Let's just eat.

434
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,867
Should I just eat?

435
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,970
"Quit yapping and eat your monjayaki."
Is that it?

436
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:19,471
(YUMMY)

437
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,410
-What's with that cap?
-What?

438
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,678
My hair got wet in the rain earlier.

439
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,113
I mean, tell us about it.

440
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,948
Oh, this? A fan made it for me.

441
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:32,718
My stage name as a dancer is on it.

442
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,086
-Did a fan make that?
-Yes.

443
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,422
I'm good at wearing stuff like this.

444
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:38,724
Your fan must be in tears.

445
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,726
Please don't cry.

446
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,731
HE SENT HER A MESSAGE
EVEN WHEN NO ONE ASKED

447
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:47,766
You connect with your fans really well.

448
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,835
It must be worth it to fangirl over you.

449
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,003
She must be good with her hands.

450
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,038
It's pretty and it fits so nicely.

451
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,307
There's a reason why I asked about it.

452
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,709
I knew that was your dancer name on it,

453
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,978
so I thought it was something
you made as fan goods.

454
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:01,647
No, it was from a fan.

455
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:02,948
How sweet is that?

456
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:05,717
Your fans must adore you.

457
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:09,154
They feel bad when they see you flustered,

458
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,390
but you tend to wear your heart
on your sleeve.

459
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,659
This is nice, Do-yeon.

460
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:19,064
I had no idea we'd become close like this.

461
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:22,367
How do you feel
when people try to get close to you?

462
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,570
-I love it, and I'm grateful.
-Really?

463
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:27,706
-You prefer being chosen over choosing.
-Sure.

464
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:31,610
I imagine thousands of scenarios
where I approach people first.

465
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:32,811
I see. But?

466
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:33,946
I'm just not able to.

467
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:36,715
How are you in real life, then?

468
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,485
-Are you shy?
-How should I put it?

469
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,855
"Maybe I should ask if she's eaten."

470
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,890
"What should I say if she already has?"

471
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,092
I imagine saying things like that a lot.

472
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:48,560
Maybe you overthink things.

473
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,529
I guess I do.

474
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:52,498
Still, thanks to you,

475
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:56,235
I've been challenging myself today,

476
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,870
given how I usually am.

477
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:59,605
That being said,

478
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:02,174
I'd like to play that game one more time.

479
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,543
Sorry. I haven't been fully focused
on our conversation.

480
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,611
That's all right.

481
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:07,880
-It's burning a hole in my head.
-Which one do you want?

482
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:09,047
I'll draw another number.

483
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:13,185
IS THIS A SIGN OF ADDICTION?
SHE GOES BACK TO THE LOTTERY GAME

484
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:14,953
One more.

485
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,723
Do-yeon, what is it that you want to win?

486
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,291
This watermelon is adorable.

487
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,496
Let it be the watermelon!

488
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:32,104
Number 36.

489
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:37,743
-Congratulations to me. Thanks.
-Congratulations.

490
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,379
No way. There's a bear trapped inside!

491
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,148
Look. I'm winning better prizes.

492
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:44,716
SO CUTE

493
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,987
Jun-young, do you have some cash?

494
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,924
I do.

495
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,525
I'll give you some.

496
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:54,493
It's all right.

497
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,495
Now that we've had monjayaki,

498
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,397
we'll go take photo booth pictures.

499
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:01,500
-In photo booths?
-Do you like taking four-cut photos?

500
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,802
I haven't taken them in Japan.

501
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:07,439
-Really?
-I took them twice, but for work.

502
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:08,874
For work?

503
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,176
That's too bad since this is for work too.

504
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,478
-I thought this was a trip.
-Yes, it is.

505
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,214
A camera crew just followed us out here.

506
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,583
-Think of it as being under surveillance.
-What is it?

507
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:18,750
-What?
-Is this work or pleasure?

508
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,385
This? It's a trip.

509
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,588
(RIGHT?)

510
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:23,689
It's a trip.

511
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,696
CLEARLY, SHE LONGS FOR ANOTHER PRIZE

512
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:32,297
Maybe just one more.

513
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:33,732
Okay, fine.

514
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm spending all my money here.

515
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,768
IT'S STILL THE WATERMELON SHE'S AFTER

516
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,505
Can't you choose one for me?

517
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,541
Please choose one for her.

518
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:45,510
DRAWING A NUMBER,
LEANING ON THE OWNER'S LUCK

519
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,146
-Number one, please.
-Here you go.

520
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,849
You'll draw number one no matter what.

521
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:54,586
WILL SHE WIN THE WATERMELON?

522
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,222
Sir!

523
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,123
(MR. OWNER!)

524
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,193
Is it number one?

525
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,094
No, 41.

526
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:04,429
No way.

527
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:05,731
HAHA

528
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:06,798
That one.

529
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,767
Wait, it's the same one.

530
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,202
SHE WINS ANOTHER PINK PLASTIC BALL

531
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,571
I won the same one earlier.

532
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:14,573
Which one was for number 41?

533
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,874
Thank you.

534
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,046
This isn't easy.

535
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,748
Could I try?

536
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:25,584
Please!

537
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:29,921
I'm sorry to ask, but can you use the rest
of your luck for the year on this?

538
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:30,856
HAHA

539
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:33,225
Sorry. That was lousy of me, wasn't it?

540
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:36,495
Number 69.

541
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:37,829
Number 69?

542
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,165
We'll have a whole collection of planets.

543
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:41,500
ANOTHER PINK PLASTIC BALL

544
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:42,601
Thank you.

545
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,169
-It's the same one.
-You got that too.

546
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,570
ALL 3 ARE THE SAME… HAHA

547
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,638
They're identical.

548
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:50,642
Perfect.

549
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,544
-Good job.
-Four more, and they're Dragon Balls.

550
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,479
Don't say that. This is perfect.

551
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:56,081
(READY WITH THE CAMERA)

552
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,115
So cute.

553
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:58,216
One, two, three.

554
00:21:58,817 --> 00:21:59,851
SNAP!

555
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,321
TODAY'S LOTTERY QUEEN

556
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:03,288
Wasn't it tasty?

557
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,524
It was delicious.

558
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,526
Can you give me like 30 minutes?

559
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:09,695
I want to try that about six more times.

560
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,131
That's enough, Do-yeon.

561
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:14,533
I feel like I'm almost there.

562
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:16,268
Let's go.

563
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,903
THEY LEAVE IT BEHIND
TO TAKE PHOTO BOOTH PICTURES

564
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:21,073
Instead of serious characters,

565
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:25,143
do you ever crave playing a comedic role

566
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:28,580
that's really over-the-top silly?

567
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:30,916
I do. Whatever the role is,

568
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:32,117
I want to try it all.

569
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:33,852
-Whatever it may be?
-Yes.

570
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,655
I believe that's something
I have an advantage in

571
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,057
as an actor.

572
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:42,928
I've been told many times that
I can play a wide range of characters.

573
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:46,465
Still, I won't know if I'm good at it
until I play the role.

574
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,366
That's true.

575
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:49,201
I learned
from one of your interviews that,

576
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:50,602
aside from being a sociopath,

577
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:54,806
Geum Seong-je is the most like you
in real life.

578
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,141
Or did you say it was the best fit?

579
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,576
I like being alone,

580
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:00,011
and I'm living my own idea

581
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:03,014
of what's charming and romantic.

582
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:05,817
That's very much me in real life.

583
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,353
Aside from his violent side, I mean.

584
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:14,359
After a project ends, do you usually
keep in contact with your colleagues?

585
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,328
Do you get together in private?

586
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,263
-I think so.
-I see.

587
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:22,167
The actor I hang out with the most

588
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,568
is Park Ji-hoon.

589
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:25,003
We met while filming Weak Hero Class 2.

590
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,405
THEY MET AS CO-STARS
ON WEAK HERO CLASS 2

591
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:28,840
You kept in touch after the series ended?

592
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,276
We talked on the phone the other day.

593
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,078
He called saying he missed me.

594
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:37,149
You and the people around you
easily express your feelings.

595
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,152
Unlike how he seems,

596
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:45,357
he's quite shy
around the people he first meets.

597
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,025
Still, he's very fond of me.

598
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:48,827
It was surprising, actually.

599
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:53,331
At first, I thought he was like me

600
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:55,367
and figured I should leave him alone.

601
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,302
Of course.
We introverts can sense each other.

602
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,137
But then we got to talk and…

603
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,441
That's great. What a nice friendship.

604
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:05,010
He says he's my right-hand man now.

605
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:09,181
I responded by saying I didn't know
he could say things like that.

606
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:10,515
That's so cute.

607
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:12,617
He's the only one

608
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:15,420
whose number I've saved
under a cringey name.

609
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:16,521
What is it?

610
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:17,923
-"My boy."
-No way.

611
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,292
When did that happen?

612
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:22,561
-It was "Park Ji-hoon" at first.
-When did you change it?

613
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,696
He said he was upset

614
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:27,532
since he was my baby brother and my boy.

615
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,001
Your boy! That's adorable.

616
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:32,370
"Really? Sure, then."

617
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:35,106
"I'll save your number
under 'My Boy' from now on."

618
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:36,575
That's how it happened.

619
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:38,877
Do you have any other kids?

620
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:40,812
-No, he's the only one.
-I see.

621
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:41,913
It's just Ji-hoon.

622
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,783
He likes to dance as well,

623
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,185
so we've practiced and competed
in battles together.

624
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:55,827
AS THEY WERE TALKING,
THEY ARRIVED AT THE PHOTO BOOTH SHOP

625
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:59,264
THE STREET IS ALREADY BUSTLING WITH PEOPLE

626
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:02,601
THE INTROVERTED JUN-YOUNG
IS TRYING TO DISAPPEAR INTO A HOLE

627
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:04,970
These are cute.

628
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:09,107
HE TRAILS BEHIND HIS BIG SISTER…

629
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,611
Let's go.

630
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,012
THEY MANAGE TO REUNITE BEYOND THE CROWD

631
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:17,716
AFTER A FEW FLIGHTS OF STAIRS…

632
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:20,719
THE UPPER FLOOR IS FILLED
WITH PHOTO BOOTHS

633
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:22,454
TODAY, THEY'RE HERE FOR PURIKURA PHOTOS

634
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,688
Oh, this.

635
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:24,890
FLUSTERED

636
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:28,627
You want the two of us
to take photos like these?

637
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:30,328
For real?

638
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:31,229
CAN'T BELIEVE IT

639
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:32,964
HAHA

640
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,633
EYES DARTING

641
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,535
HE LOOKS LIKE HE DID
WHEN THEY WERE GO-KARTING

642
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,772
THE TWO INTROVERTS
TRY TO TAKE PURIKURA PHOTOS

643
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,608
Let's go with a high angle.

644
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:46,878
ENTERING THE BOOTH, STIFF AND NERVOUS

645
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,648
This is hilarious.

646
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:52,050
This must be our camera.

647
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:53,952
Oh, that. Hence, the high angle.

648
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:54,953
IT'S A "HIGH ANGLE" SHOT BECAUSE
THE PHOTO IS TAKEN FROM ABOVE

649
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,321
Pressing "start" ought to do it.

650
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,324
Is that how we should pose?

651
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:01,459
(WHAT ON EARTH?)

652
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,529
THE REFERENCE POSES ARE TOO MUCH
FOR INTROVERTS

653
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:05,564
While looking at that?

654
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:09,868
REACHING UP AWKWARDLY…

655
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:13,238
POSING WITH THE CORNERS
OF THEIR MOUTHS PULLED UP

656
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:14,773
When does it take the shot?

657
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:16,207
EMBARRASSED

658
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:17,509
It's done.

659
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,843
Look at us.

660
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,645
SO CUTE THAT IT'S SHOCKING

661
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:21,646
That's hilarious.

662
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,448
Seriously. Come on.

663
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:24,649
WHERE ARE WE? WHO AM I?

664
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:26,685
Let's try this set of poses.

665
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,220
ALTHOUGH THEY'RE EMBARRASSED,
THEY'RE GOOD AT COPYING THE POSES

666
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:32,591
Close your eyes and look annoying.

667
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:34,726
EYES SHUT

668
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:36,328
-Let's do a heart next.
-A heart?

669
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:38,597
SOON, JUN-YOUNG EASES INTO IT
AND SUGGESTS POSES

670
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,633
I did it. Wait, like that?

671
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,734
Do the pose for "save it."

672
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:46,204
HIS INNER JOKESTER COMES OUT

673
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,240
SAVE IT IN MY HEART

674
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:51,009
This is fun.

675
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:54,379
THE TWO ARE ENJOYING IT NOW

676
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,481
THE PURIKURA PHOTOS ARE A HUGE SUCCESS!

677
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:57,482
We're good.

678
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:00,085
LAUGHING HARD

679
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:01,786
(I CAN'T LOOK)

680
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:03,355
HAHAHAHA

681
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,090
Seriously. We both look eerie.

682
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:06,424
TO THE DECORATING BOOTH, GO!

683
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:07,792
That was super eerie.

684
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:13,398
EVEN MORE SHOCKING UP CLOSE

685
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:17,102
No way.

686
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:19,604
First, choose the photo you want.

687
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:20,772
Okay.

688
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,707
This is hilarious.

689
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:24,909
Where did it go? This one's so funny.

690
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,311
THEY EACH CHOOSE THE PHOTO THEY LIKE

691
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:28,480
That was a lot of fun.

692
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:32,083
LAUGHING

693
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:34,419
That one annoys me.

694
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,655
Promise not to throw these away.

695
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:38,189
Why would I?

696
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:39,658
I can't throw away things
with people's faces on them.

697
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:42,227
No running this through the shredder.

698
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:43,228
No way.

699
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:45,664
-Promise.
-I won't do that.

700
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,065
Cherish the memory.

701
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:48,166
Absolutely.

702
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:55,240
DECORATING IT WITH STICKERS
HOWEVER THEY WANT!

703
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:58,176
I don't get why
we're working so hard on this.

704
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,879
LAUGHING

705
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:02,747
Check mine out.

706
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:05,150
HAHA
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

707
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:06,484
This speaks for me.

708
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:08,019
This is hilarious.

709
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,288
(DON'T FORGET YOUR INITIALS)

710
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,825
JANGDOBARI

711
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:16,761
JANGDOBARI

712
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:18,096
Are you done?

713
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,700
AFTER ADDING A SMILE

714
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,335
THEY'RE DONE DECORATING THEIR PHOTOS!

715
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:26,204
Geez. We gave it our all.

716
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:28,673
This could be terrifying.

717
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:30,742
I'm too scared to look.

718
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:32,544
NERVOUS

719
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,813
-I know I'll be embarrassed.
-This will be terrifying.

720
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:35,847
I'm scared.

721
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:37,015
I'm scared to see this in my dreams.

722
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:38,083
HOW WILL THEIR PHOTOS LOOK?

723
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:39,718
THUD

724
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,222
CHUCKLING…

725
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:45,356
Is that ours?

726
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:46,257
Here.

727
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:50,595
-This is terrifying.
-Show us.

728
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:51,796
Is this…

729
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:53,698
Should I keep this to myself?

730
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:55,033
I don't think people should see this.

731
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:55,934
PHOTOS THEY WISH TO KEEP TO THEMSELVES

732
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:59,871
THEY CAUTIOUSLY PRESENT TWO PHOTO STRIPS

733
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,806
I feel like I've seen this on TikTok.

734
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:04,642
I've seen people like them on TikTok.

735
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,278
My eyes are huge.

736
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,347
They make up half of your face.

737
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,750
-This is hilarious.
-This is wild.

738
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:13,284
That was fun, and the photos are cute.

739
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:16,187
-You can't throw these away.
-Promise.

740
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,089
If you do,
you'll end up looking like this.

741
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:19,357
Frightening, isn't it?

742
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,760
-Same for you.
-I know. I look frightening too.

743
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,161
I like the way I am.

744
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:25,296
AFTER A CUTE BUT FRIGHTENING EXPERIENCE…

745
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:29,400
To recharge for another
eventful day in Japan tomorrow,

746
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:32,070
we need to rest and get some sleep.

747
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:35,807
Anyway, you should be excited about
what I have planned tomorrow.

748
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:39,310
Will we spend the day
the way you planned it?

749
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:41,012
Leave everything to me.

750
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,647
Don't run away, and meet me at 9 a.m.

751
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,582
-Got it?
-Sure.

752
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,417
HOLDING TIGHT

753
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:48,953
-That felt soulless.
-Get a good night's rest.

754
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,321
-Sure. See you tomorrow.
-Good job today.

755
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:51,422
Don't you run away.

756
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:53,091
There aren't any flights
available for you anyway.

757
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,365
-Let's go, then.
-Sure.

758
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:02,133
OFF TO THE HOTEL TO REST!

759
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:07,472
Since I've already made
a promise to Jun-young,

760
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:11,176
I need to put together a packed schedule.

761
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:12,243
First of all,

762
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,913
I learned that he lived in Kamiyamacho.

763
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,248
We'll take a walk around the neighborhood.

764
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,684
I don't know if he drinks coffee,

765
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:21,586
but there's a place I went to

766
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,321
that has good coffee

767
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:24,656
and great ambience.

768
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:26,057
We'll go to Fuglen Coffee.

769
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:27,025
DO-YEON TOUR: 2. FUGLEN COFFEE ROASTERS

770
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:28,693
It says it won't rain tomorrow.

771
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,528
I think we'll have another day
of good weather.

772
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:33,131
So, we'll grab some coffee to go

773
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:34,666
and head to a nearby park.

774
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,368
I was surprised to see how big it was.

775
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:38,570
It's Yoyogi Park.

776
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:40,438
At Yoyogi Park,

777
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,507
we'll take a walk around

778
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:43,541
and talk.

779
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:47,245
I feel like Jun-young thrives
in one-on-one situations.

780
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:48,146
Right.

781
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:50,882
He tells stories about himself
in a really engaging way.

782
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:53,651
I enjoyed our conversations today,
and they felt meaningful.

783
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,121
Jun-young, do you feel the same way?

784
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,592
Your auntie figure had fun.

785
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:01,526
How was it for you?

786
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:05,230
That's so dated.

787
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,401
I'm like the immature youngest aunt.

788
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:12,203
This sounds good.

789
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,538
DONE PLANNING FOR TOMORROW

790
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:15,573
"I'll see you tomorrow."

791
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,276
I wonder what that is in Japanese.

792
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,011
See you tomorrow.

793
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:21,279
"See you tomorrow." Is that it?

794
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:22,747
That's easy.

795
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,949
Jun-young, see you tomorrow.

796
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:31,322
I've become addicted
to that owner's smile!

797
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:35,894
A FRESH MORNING GREETS THEM

798
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:38,897
Did you sleep well?

799
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:42,800
I passed out right after showering.

800
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,702
-Really?
-I lay down for a second and…

801
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:45,970
And you woke up to the sun?

802
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:48,706
I woke up at around 5 a.m.,

803
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:50,675
-so I went for a walk.
-You went for a walk?

804
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,343
I also grabbed breakfast by myself.

805
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,746
How productive of you.

806
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,814
What did you have for breakfast?

807
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:59,250
There was a place
serving a breakfast combo,

808
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:01,085
so I went to have that.

809
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:03,922
Is there a place that opens that early?

810
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:06,491
I was surprised by it too.

811
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:07,859
By the way, did you sleep well?

812
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,827
I slept like a log.

813
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:11,696
You must sleep well
even in new environments.

814
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,997
Yes, I'm like that.

815
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:14,832
Are you like that too?

816
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:16,935
-Yes.
-Really?

817
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:18,636
I don't have trouble falling asleep,

818
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:20,338
-but I never sleep deeply.
-That's not good.

819
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:23,007
It's the same even when I'm at home.

820
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:24,375
Do you wake up in the middle of the night?

821
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,010
I wake up during the night,

822
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:28,179
so I get around
three to five hours of sleep.

823
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,916
So, that's why on my days off,

824
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:34,152
I sleep so much that it worries my staff.

825
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,221
What's the longest you've slept

826
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:38,923
without waking up?

827
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,158
Over 20 hours.

828
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:42,660
Maybe 26 to 27 hours.

829
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:45,296
I didn't wake up even once.

830
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:46,364
-For real?
-Yes.

831
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,599
I didn't get thirsty,

832
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:51,703
hungry, or feel like I needed to go
to the bathroom.

833
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:52,637
I just…

834
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,339
I just slept.

835
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:57,575
How tired does one have to be
to sleep for 26 to 27 hours?

836
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:58,576
Is that so?

837
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,011
What were you working on at the time?

838
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:03,681
When Life Gives You Tangerines,
Weak Hero Class 2,

839
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:05,483
and Dreaming of a Freaking Fairy Tale.

840
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,985
I had been working on all three.

841
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:09,687
I cried my eyes out
watching When Life Gives You Tangerines.

842
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:12,557
I bet your parents loved that series.

843
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:16,394
You worked hard on all your roles,
and they must've loved you in each one,

844
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:17,428
but I bet they like that series the most.

845
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,730
It's their favorite.

846
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:22,567
Both my parents cried their eyes out
watching it.

847
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:27,038
I once had sea eel and soju
with my parents in Busan,

848
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:28,940
-and my dad said this.
-What did he say?

849
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:32,110
"I hope your character marries her."

850
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,611
"I'll scoop the sungnyung for you."

851
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:38,683
That was a witty comment from your father.

852
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,719
What about your younger sister?
Does she give you feedback?

853
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:43,154
She's been major supportive lately.

854
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:44,222
Saying what, exactly?

855
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:45,323
She calls me…

856
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:47,258
a cosmic star.

857
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,128
But for some reason,

858
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,196
I'm not too happy to hear it.

859
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:56,534
I get where the compliment is coming from,

860
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:59,404
but it still feels awkward
to be called that.

861
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:02,874
Your sister wants to express her support,
but it's cringey.

862
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,376
Now that she's older,
she's been really supportive

863
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:07,111
of me.

864
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:09,280
When do you feel that the most?

865
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:11,382
There was a time
when I was having a meltdown.

866
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:14,786
She called me often
and took great care of me.

867
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,754
"Have you eaten?"

868
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,023
"How are you feeling?"

869
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:19,991
"You're doing great."

870
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,060
"I don't know much about your work,

871
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:24,762
but I know you'll do amazing."

872
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:29,033
She's become a good friend of yours.

873
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,136
Now, she's been great
at caring for our parents.

874
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:33,337
-Your sister?
-Yes.

875
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:36,274
She still lives with them, you see.

876
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:38,276
That makes you worry less.

877
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:41,145
It's fun hearing about your family.

878
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:42,280
-My family?
-Yes.

879
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:44,449
Remember that malatang incident?

880
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:45,817
The time you ordered malatang.

881
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,052
That was hilarious.

882
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:51,022
There aren't many people
on the streets today.

883
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,657
It's a little early in the day.

884
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:54,625
-Is this considered less?
-Yes.

885
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:55,793
I'd say the streets are empty.

886
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:59,297
We're off to Kamiyamacho today.

887
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:01,999
-Kamiyamacho?
-Kamiyamacho.

888
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:03,101
It's a quiet neighborhood.

889
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:05,703
What do they have?

890
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,138
-Brag about it a little.
-There?

891
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:08,139
HIS FORMER RESIDENCE

892
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:10,208
Shibuya wasn't that far away.

893
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,542
DOWNTOWN SHIBUYA

894
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,879
You could walk in the other direction
to get to Yoyogi Park.

895
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,013
YOYOGI PARK

896
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,582
Yoyogi Park.

897
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:19,183
There were landmarks nearby.

898
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,820
Is this your first time visiting
since you moved away,

899
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:24,222
or have you been back?

900
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:28,226
A while back, I was in Shibuya

901
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,994
with my then manager,

902
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:33,197
and we got completely wasted

903
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:36,167
-and challenged ourselves to walk there.
-Really? Nice.

904
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,269
I actually made it there.

905
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:39,670
It's like muscle memory.

906
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:41,973
I was completely wasted that night,

907
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:44,275
-but I walked there looking like this.
-Yet, you remembered.

908
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:47,211
My manager couldn't tell
where we were going,

909
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:48,279
but I was like, "Here we are!"

910
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,650
What was your favorite spot
in the neighborhood?

911
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:57,155
There's a small park in the neighborhood,

912
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:59,290
and I used to sit there a lot to think.

913
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:01,893
I haven't been there in a long time.

914
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:05,530
IN DOWNTOWN SHIBUYA
NEARBY JUN-YOUNG'S OLD RESIDENCE

915
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:08,266
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

916
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,804
The weather's great.

917
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:15,106
This…

918
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:19,410
is how you get to my old neighborhood.

919
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:21,479
It's nice.

920
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:24,649
There used to be a huge department store,
but it's under construction.

921
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,719
THE NEIGHBORHOOD WENT THROUGH CHANGES
AFTER HE LEFT

922
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:31,355
That Mega Don Quijote…

923
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:34,725
used to be around that corner.

924
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,761
Was the move recent?

925
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:38,963
-I think it's been a while.
-Really?

926
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:41,599
Fascinating.

927
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,401
Isn't this the downtown area?

928
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:44,835
-Right?
-Yes, this is still downtown Shibuya.

929
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:46,270
But after a few blocks…

930
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:47,939
-Will it get quieter?
-It'll be quieter.

931
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:49,807
Check out that crow.

932
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:51,709
CROWS ON THE STREET

933
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:53,244
-They're huge.
-Crows bring good luck.

934
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:55,546
Hi.

935
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:58,549
Do-yeon, be careful.
They might peck at you.

936
00:36:58,616 --> 00:36:59,650
I'm actually a little scared.

937
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,851
UP CLOSE, THE CROWS LOOK SCARY

938
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:03,187
This is where Don Quijote used to be.

939
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,223
Don Quijote.

940
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:07,725
I ate a lot there as well.

941
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:09,860
-What do they serve?
-Ramen.

942
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:12,997
It stayed open until late.

943
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,667
Ramen, again? Geez.

944
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,003
You and your love for ramen.

945
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:23,574
In Japan,
there's something called "shime."

946
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:24,609
-Shime?
-Yes.

947
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:25,710
What's that?

948
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:28,012
Let's say you've wrapped up
a team dinner or gathering.

949
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,480
Instead of going straight home,

950
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:30,848
you go get some ramen.

951
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,483
It's like treating the hangover
before it hits.

952
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:35,586
Is it like having fried rice
after K-barbecue?

953
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:37,388
-Yes, like having naengmyeon.
-Like that?

954
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:38,756
(CHIVALROUS)

955
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,691
WHAT…

956
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:42,660
-Can your auntie read into that?
-Please don't.

957
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:43,761
Got it.

958
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:45,263
When did you become my auntie?

959
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:46,530
You shot me down, looking aghast.

960
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:48,766
When did I look aghast?

961
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,102
We'll be friends
since we're 12 years apart.

962
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,304
-Sure, Do-yeon.
-Good.

963
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:56,140
The production crew asked this morning

964
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:59,143
if we'd be going back
to being awkward again

965
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,212
when we meet in Busan in two weeks.

966
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,714
The worst would be me
addressing you as Mr. Lee.

967
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,250
Then I'll just stand there staring at you
for ten seconds.

968
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:09,120
If I get awkward around you,

969
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:10,721
tell me to snap out of it.

970
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:14,292
That won't happen.

971
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:17,628
Didn't you say
you taught yourself Japanese?

972
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:18,829
-I did.
-Right.

973
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:20,498
It wasn't just studying the language.

974
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:23,501
You had to use it
while promoting with UKISS.

975
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:26,937
For about one or two years,
all I could say was "I'm sorry."

976
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:28,739
That's so sad.

977
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,509
All I knew was, "I'm sorry,"
"Thank you," and "Great work."

978
00:38:31,575 --> 00:38:33,077
-That too?
-My pronunciation

979
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,745
sounded really stiff though.

980
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,280
"Great work, everyone."

981
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:38,349
"Thank you."

982
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:39,750
"I am…"

983
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:43,087
That was my level of Japanese at the time.

984
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,924
But that felt so frustrating,
and quite rude, to be frank.

985
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:51,762
I struggled to host shows because
I couldn't speak Japanese properly.

986
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:52,830
At first,

987
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,967
I was dropped off
at the Tower Records building.

988
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:59,337
We carried around
a pocket Wi-Fi at the time,

989
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:00,604
but they took it from me.

990
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,906
Then I was told to find my way back home.

991
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,308
With just the address.

992
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:07,244
-That's tough love.
-So…

993
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:10,314
I had to ask people on the street
for directions.

994
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:13,017
My Japanese was limited at the time.

995
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:14,585
All I could say was,

996
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:18,656
"I want to go to Kamiyamacho,"

997
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:22,159
but the people here
couldn't understand me.

998
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:26,197
It should've only taken
30 minutes to get back,

999
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:27,898
but it took me three to four hours.

1000
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:29,166
Oh, my god.

1001
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:31,035
I would've cried my eyes out.

1002
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:33,971
You were in an unfamiliar place,
unable to speak the language

1003
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:36,073
-and with no one to lean on.
-Exactly.

1004
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:41,045
How long did it take you
to get comfortable talking to others?

1005
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:42,747
After my third year here.

1006
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:46,250
It became exciting in my fourth year.

1007
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:47,518
I could have normal conversations.

1008
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:48,853
AS HE LEARNED THE LANGUAGE,
HE ADJUSTED TO LIFE IN JAPAN

1009
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:50,888
Your agency back then was no joke.

1010
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:52,723
It was that park over there.

1011
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:54,992
I spent a lot of time there spacing out.

1012
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:57,161
I just loved to sit here

1013
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:01,198
even when it rained or snowed.

1014
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:04,402
WHERE JUN-YOUNG SAT

1015
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:05,836
Those things weren't around though.

1016
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,204
It wasn't a playground for kids.

1017
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:08,305
HIS FAVORITE PARK BECAME A PLAYGROUND

1018
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:10,641
Was it just a park with trees?

1019
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:12,710
There were trees, benches,

1020
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:16,380
and a small pond.

1021
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:19,183
Isn't it quiet here?

1022
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:20,818
I love it.

1023
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:22,319
We're almost there.

1024
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:23,454
You can see it from here.

1025
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:25,189
No way.

1026
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,557
What is it?

1027
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,958
UNSURE

1028
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:30,027
-What is it?
-I can see it from here.

1029
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:32,897
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN?

1030
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:35,266
I wonder who lives there now.

1031
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:36,567
Tell me about it. I'm curious too.

1032
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:39,470
HOW HAS IT CHANGED?

1033
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:40,905
HAVE THEY FINALLY ARRIVED?!

1034
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:43,507
WHERE JUN-YOUNG LIVED
WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS OF UKISS

1035
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:44,875
-Is this also the same?
-Yes.

1036
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,110
Our ride used to be out here.

1037
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:48,012
This is me dragging my suitcase
on my way to Korea.

1038
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:49,313
"I'm exhausted."

1039
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,282
I'd trudge out of the building.

1040
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:52,183
(GETTING IN THE VAN)

1041
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:53,117
I got in and…

1042
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:55,152
-And you immediately fall asleep.
-…went to sleep.

1043
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:56,353
That's how it was.

1044
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,988
What if you had to go back to this time?

1045
00:40:58,055 --> 00:40:59,323
I've never regretted it.

1046
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,491
Look at you reliving the memories.

1047
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:01,625
REMINISCING ABOUT THE FOND MEMORIES…

1048
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:02,693
I'm hungry.

1049
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,029
There's a place where I used to eat often.

1050
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:06,163
We should call you
Lee "Noodles" Jun-young.

1051
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,131
It's soba.

1052
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:08,032
THEY'RE HAVING SOBA THIS TIME!

1053
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:09,099
I'm drooling.

1054
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:10,401
This is insane.

1055
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,769
MIXING RELENTLESSLY

1056
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:13,237
MIXING AND MIXING

1057
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:16,373
LEE "NOODLES" JUN-YOUNG'S EATING SHOW!

1058
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:18,843
A wave of dopamine just hit me.

1059
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:21,011
Lee "Noodles" Jun-young, you're on fire.

1060
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:23,447
FINDING THE BEST SPOT
FOR A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME PHOTO

1061
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:24,348
Here it comes.

1062
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:25,249
ONCE AGAIN, JUN-YOUNG IS DEAD SERIOUS

1063
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,884
AUNTIE DO-YEON HAS DECIDED TO EMBRACE
THE BUTTERFLIES IN HER STOMACH

1064
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:28,619
THE DUO WITH THE SAME ZODIAC SIGN
TAKES PHOTOS AND POSES

1065
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:29,820
That's a pretty tree.

1066
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,755
Come this way.

1067
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,457
Teach me a few dance moves, Jun-young.

1068
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:34,625
LEE JUN-YOUNG'S DANCE CLASS FINALLY OPENS!

1069
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:36,494
Just feel the beat.

1070
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:41,165
