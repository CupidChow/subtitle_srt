1
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,872
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,946
A PEACEFUL MORNING IN CHEONGSANDO

3
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:16,216
EARLY MORNING WORKOUT?

4
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:17,484
Are you working out?

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,552
You said you'd teach Do-yeon how to box.

6
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:24,124
I ran a quick simulation.

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,526
She has long arms,
so I'll keep my distance, and then…

8
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:27,927
MOVE MASTER PREPARING HIS LESSON

9
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:30,463
WHERE IS DO-YEON?

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,534
Do-yeon was supposed to meet with me
at half past seven.

11
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:37,404
-What time is it now?
-7:35.

12
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,571
7:35?

13
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:40,040
She's five minutes late.

14
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:41,508
Hi there.

15
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:43,209
Are you waiting for Do-yeon too?

16
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,080
KNOCK KNOCK

17
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:48,081
Coming.

18
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:49,215
You're late.

19
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:50,283
Sorry?

20
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,685
-Private Jang Do-yeon.
-Wait.

21
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,754
Do you know what time it is?

22
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:57,223
Just a minute. I'm sorry! One second.

23
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:01,094
-Good God.
-I'm sorry.

24
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:02,595
Sorry.

25
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,765
-You didn't leave.
-That's right.

26
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,767
-I didn't leave.
-I mean…

27
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,470
I spent the whole night
worrying you would leave.

28
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,672
-You are up early.
-Did you sleep well?

29
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,840
I slept really well.

30
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,108
Same here.

31
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:16,576
I was watching an MMA fight,

32
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:19,045
then I sort of got knocked out by sleep.

33
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,647
You watched another fight?

34
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:22,248
Let's go.

35
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,417
Can I spar without learning the basics?

36
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:27,087
Without the basics,
it'd just be like a street fight.

37
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:28,021
Right.

38
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,090
EPISODE 6: A CRYING FIST
JAB-JAB-ONE-TWO JANGDOBARI

39
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:32,859
Teacher, is this
where you'll teach me to spar?

40
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,495
We are at a beach, so if I'm bad…

41
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:36,429
Into the water!

42
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:37,997
Well then…

43
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:40,967
-Let's start with the easy stuff.
-The very basics.

44
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:42,168
Are you right-handed?

45
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,203
I am.

46
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,471
Okay, in that case…

47
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:46,840
Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.

48
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:49,876
Step one foot out at a diagonal.

49
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,411
Your right hand by your chin.

50
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,546
Your guard is everything.

51
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,614
KEEP YOUR GUARD UP

52
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,683
Like this. You can guard like this too.

53
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:58,952
You can do this.

54
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:00,687
DIFFERENT GUARD STYLES ON DISPLAY

55
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:01,754
This too.

56
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:04,491
When they swing at you,
you guard with this arm.

57
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:06,626
So, guard comes first.

58
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:07,894
-Guard.
-Guard.

59
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:11,297
When one of your arms goes out,
the other arm must come in.

60
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:12,832
-Always.
-I get it.

61
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:14,367
I must guard my face all the time.

62
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,569
All the time. Even when you throw a hook.

63
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,171
Guard. Again.

64
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,540
Guard. In all situations.

65
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,408
MOVE MASTER'S SKILLED DEMONSTRATION

66
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,277
Cover your face all the time.

67
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:25,812
Or else, you'll get hit.

68
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,380
Does the fist need to be angled?

69
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,115
I recommend the straight punch.

70
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:30,517
PUNCH WITH THE FRONT OF THE FIST

71
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,885
I have to use this part?

72
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:33,620
-Like this.
-This?

73
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:34,754
That's right.

74
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,955
Relax.

75
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:38,892
Relax your torso. Keep it light.

76
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,794
-You have long arms, right?
-Yeah.

77
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:44,664
Use these long arms
to keep your opponent in check.

78
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,966
-Stop them from approaching?
-Yes.

79
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,635
Then they will hesitate…

80
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:50,103
This is fun!

81
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,406
ONE, TWO

82
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:54,908
ONE, TWO, THREE

83
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:57,610
WHAT WAS THAT?

84
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,878
-Nice footwork.
-Yeah?

85
00:02:58,945 --> 00:02:59,812
ONE, TWO, THREE

86
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:03,983
Was that good?

87
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,820
FEELS AMAZING

88
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:10,089
-What you just did isn't easy.
-Really?

89
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:12,559
You've got quick feet. Great footwork.

90
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,494
I should buy some boxing shoes
from Coupang.

91
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,530
-Teach me more.
-I'll gift them to you.

92
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:18,431
Jab.

93
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:19,999
THE BOXING CLASS GOES ON

94
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,701
Take a step forward when you jab.

95
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:22,936
-Jab.
-Good!

96
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,471
-What's going on?
-What?

97
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,472
Jab, two.

98
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,840
YOU GO, GIRL

99
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:30,176
Your straight is spot on.

100
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,144
Do you mean it?

101
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,313
I might as well take over Wando.

102
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,414
YOU ALL ARE DEAD

103
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,951
WANT A PIECE OF ME?

104
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,220
COME AT ME, WORLD!

105
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,388
Come on!

106
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,157
Bring it on.

107
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,125
-Bring it on!
-Stop shooting!

108
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,764
-You are good.
-It's actually quite fun.

109
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:54,133
-Do you need core strength for this?
-Of course.

110
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,903
You need to plant your feet
and snap that punch.

111
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,471
Get used to it, and it's like…

112
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:05,678
SPOOKED

113
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,747
THE MOVE MASTER AWAKENS

114
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:08,815
Stop him.

115
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:10,016
Somebody stop him.

116
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,084
YOU'RE SCARING ME

117
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,119
CLASS ENDS WITH LASTING IMPRESSION

118
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,587
-That was fun.
-But really…

119
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:16,723
You did well. You've got a nice stance.

120
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,925
-Thank you.
-Okay.

121
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:20,460
-Was that useful?
-Yes.

122
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:21,694
-One, two.
-One, two.

123
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,795
All right.

124
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,897
THANK YOU FOR TEACHING ME

125
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:27,533
I mean it. You have potential.

126
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,203
You're a great teacher.
You keep saying I'm good.

127
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,871
No, I'm serious.

128
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,473
Fine, I'll hire you for six months.

129
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,742
You really surprised me.

130
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,745
It's not easy, I'm telling you.

131
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:39,746
I'm so excited.

132
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:41,414
I wanna beat people up.

133
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:46,753
ADDICTED TO BOXING AFTER ONE CLASS

134
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:49,055
Don't nobody mess with me now.

135
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,556
Watch out for these!

136
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,131
I feel like I'm on top of the world.

137
00:04:58,197 --> 00:04:59,465
TIME TO RESTORE ENERGY

138
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,267
The sky is so clear.

139
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:02,335
-Yeah.
-Look at that.

140
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:03,236
ENDLESS BLUE SKY

141
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,338
Better enjoy it.
We don't have that in Seoul.

142
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:06,406
I know, right?

143
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,510
Today, we're taking a stroll
through the barley fields.

144
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,680
When I used to paint watercolors as a kid,

145
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:17,383
I always drew a tree and a house,
just like the view in front of me.

146
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,685
Are you good at drawing?

147
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,154
I wouldn't say that,

148
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,156
but I really liked to draw
back in the day.

149
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,190
-Did you?
-Yes.

150
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,358
Really?

151
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,860
This hill is steeper than I thought.

152
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,697
-Are you feeling okay?
-Yeah.

153
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,765
This is nothing to a boxer.

154
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,634
Shall we drag some tires up the hill?

155
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:37,303
No, that's a terrible idea.

156
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,105
I've hit my limit.

157
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,809
You know what, my Wando friend?

158
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,444
It's always all or nothing for you.

159
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:47,447
Do you think so?

160
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,981
It's a good thing.

161
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,350
It's what makes you charming.

162
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,418
I learned that from you yesterday.

163
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,555
You never let anything slide, do you?

164
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,190
There's a tavern.

165
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,259
It's called "Sopyonje Shelter/Tavern."

166
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,628
FILMING LOCATION OF &lt;SOPYONJE&gt;

167
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,430
IN SPRING, CANOLA FLOWERS COVER THE FIELDS

168
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,999
A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN ENJOY THE VIEW
WITH A SIP OF MAKGEOLLI

169
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:10,636
-The view here is so beautiful.
-It is.

170
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,638
-This is…
-Marvelous.

171
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,374
CERTIFIED BY WANDO'S PROMO AMBASSADOR

172
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,775
This scenery is priceless.

173
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,611
What a nice place.

174
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,346
-Awesome.
-Cute thatched houses.

175
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:21,481
SOPYONJE SHELTER/TAVERN

176
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,015
Hi.

177
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,283
-Are you open?
-Hello.

178
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,052
-Come on in.
-Hi.

179
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,020
OLD-TIME CHARM STILL LINGERS

180
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:29,689
-Nostalgic.
-Anything you want to eat?

181
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,225
Buchimgae. Seafood buchimgae.

182
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,026
One seafood buchimgae and--

183
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,595
We have three kinds of buchimgae.

184
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:39,532
Mugwort, green onion, and minari.

185
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:40,433
Which would you like?

186
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,901
I love all of them.

187
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,837
Cheongsan mugwort is in season right now,
so you could try that.

188
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:45,738
-We'd love to.
-Okay.

189
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:48,074
We'll have one mugwort seafood buchimgae.

190
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,978
-How about abalone vinegar muchim?
-Sure. We'll have that too.

191
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:53,179
No makgeolli?

192
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,614
Makgeolli? Well…

193
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,083
You gotta try the Wando Port makgeolli
while you are here.

194
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,317
We'll have a bottle.

195
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,486
-Wait, there's Wando Port makgeolli?
-Yes.

196
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,689
You're such a good seller, ma'am.

197
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,324
I might walk out of here broke.

198
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:06,959
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

199
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,561
ESCAPES BEFORE SHE GOES BROKE

200
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,563
Ding-dong! We got an order.

201
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,332
She must be a human bell.

202
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,834
Maybe she's a human pager too.

203
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:15,735
She might go…

204
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,170
VERY FIRST HUMAN PAGER IN KOREA

205
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:18,070
She'd come here and…

206
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,106
HUMAN VIBRATION

207
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,841
"Your food's ready."

208
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,611
Do you drink makgeolli too?

209
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:26,579
-Makgeolli?
-Yes.

210
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:29,015
It gets tough if I have too much,
so just a little.

211
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:30,917
-If you have too much…
-Then the next day…

212
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,318
-The headache.
-Yeah.

213
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:33,753
My mom always says…

214
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,888
FOOD READY IN NO TIME

215
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,357
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

216
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,628
-This is a plateful.
-Mugwort seafood buchimgae.

217
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,264
Look at all these abalones.

218
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:46,766
ABALONE VINEGAR MUCHIM

219
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,234
Abalones in Wando are so meaty.

220
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,572
MUGWORT SEAFOOD BUCHIMGAE

221
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,240
Have you tried this makgeolli before?

222
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,508
No, I didn't know about it.

223
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:58,211
I had no idea Wando had its own makgeolli.

224
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:59,278
Me neither.

225
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:02,515
Do you like your makgeolli clear or mixed?

226
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,717
Maybe shake it just a little.
How do you do it?

227
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,118
HA-JUN LIKES HIS MAKGEOLLI MIXED

228
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:07,053
This place

229
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,789
is dangerously good.

230
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,891
THE VIEW CALLS FOR BINGE-DRINKING

231
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,359
I could drink here forever.

232
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,695
-No need for snacks.
-It's almost like a trap.

233
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:17,196
FREE VISUAL SNACKS ALL AROUND

234
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:18,798
Thanks.

235
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,600
NOONA FIRST

236
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,204
HAVE A DRINK, WANDO FRIEND

237
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,205
Thank you.

238
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:29,075
-Can I call you Master?
-Sure.

239
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:32,178
I'm still fired up from boxing.
This is bad.

240
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,413
I need to get back and fight someone
as soon as possible.

241
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:38,551
People who learn a bit of fighting
go around picking fights, you know.

242
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:39,752
That's training gone wrong.

243
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,587
-Yeah, it's dangerous.
-Right.

244
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,256
You have to be humble.

245
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:45,791
A rookie fighter like me
is a pain in the ass.

246
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,326
"My fists are itching!"

247
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,195
"Wanna fight?" Then get knocked out.

248
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,567
-That's why modesty comes first.
-That's right.

249
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,669
Being humble
is the one rule for everything.

250
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,106
TASTING WANDO MAKGEOLLI FOR THE FIRST TIME

251
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,211
-Not bad. Very smooth.
-It doesn't taste like alcohol.

252
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,112
SMOOTH AND LIGHT

253
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,048
It is really smooth. Not heavy at all.

254
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,616
-Right?
-It feels really light.

255
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:11,517
HOW STRONG IS THIS?

256
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:12,552
Try the food.

257
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:13,452
TIME FOR A BITE

258
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,453
Let's dig in.

259
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,623
They say nothing beats food in season.

260
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,663
-Is it good?
-The mugwort is so fragrant.

261
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,798
I wonder if people here pick
their own mugwort.

262
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,600
My mom used to do that a lot.

263
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:28,668
-Really?
-Yeah.

264
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,503
Where did she do that?

265
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,104
In Incheon?

266
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:34,707
Yes, she'd take the bus out to--

267
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:36,976
Delicious.

268
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,344
This is seriously good.

269
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,245
SHOCKED

270
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,980
-Do you like mugwort?
-I love mugwort.

271
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:42,114
PERFECT FOR MUGWORT MANIA

272
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:43,516
Then this is perfect for you.

273
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,819
This mugwort smells
ten times stronger than usual.

274
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:47,720
It's intense.

275
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,855
-It's like the mugwort is alive.
-Exactly.

276
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,194
Everything in Wando is so delicious.

277
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,835
BEAUTIFUL VIEW

278
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,537
AND DELICIOUS FOOD

279
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,772
You are so lucky to have grown up here.

280
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:07,840
I am.

281
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:11,243
When city life in Seoul
gets to be too much

282
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,347
and you need some air or nature,

283
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:15,881
you can just come here.

284
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:16,782
Yes.

285
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,117
It's good to have a hometown.

286
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:20,686
-Totally.
-Especially away from the bustling area.

287
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:24,657
Do you have any upcoming releases?

288
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,593
I've got a shoot lined up in the summer.

289
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,629
A mystery romance, so to speak.

290
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:30,696
A mystery romance?

291
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,766
Who are you going to be working with?

292
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,701
Park Min-young.

293
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,672
You both have
a great vibe going these days.

294
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,273
Your projects are going great.

295
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,343
Yes, her projects are going great.

296
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,646
-Yours too.
-Not at all. I'm just…

297
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,447
I told you to stop being modest.

298
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,616
-Are you ignoring me?
-Modesty comes first.

299
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,652
QUICK CHANGE OF MIND
YES, MASTER

300
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:53,986
-Let's be modest.
-Be modest.

301
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:54,920
JUST BE MODEST

302
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,256
I guess you will be busy for months, then.

303
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,758
I haven't worked in a while.

304
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:02,495
This is my first project
after Squid Game ended,

305
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:03,596
so, like I said yesterday,

306
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,530
I'm scared.

307
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,465
Why? Because you're back at it again?

308
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,200
I'm sure I'll get used to it.

309
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:09,235
Don't be scared.

310
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:11,137
You're Asia's number one sexy star.

311
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:12,538
One of 25 worldwide.

312
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:18,144
You always seem to add something
whenever I say anything.

313
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,146
Especially when it's a compliment.

314
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:22,882
I asked you for one humblebrag yesterday,

315
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:25,151
and you gave me a whole list.

316
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:26,285
My face carries duality.

317
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,521
There's so much in me
I haven't had the chance to show yet.

318
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:30,423
I believe I was the only Asian man.

319
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:31,624
"I'm a sexy guy."

320
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,659
I think I said about 142 things.

321
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,261
You surprised me in many ways.

322
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,797
WI HA-JUN, AN ACTOR
WHO IS SURPRISING IN MANY WAYS

323
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,533
Is there anything you want to try?

324
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:42,601
A certain type of character or a genre?

325
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:46,272
What I really want
is to play a bright character

326
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:49,408
or try something light like a rom-com.

327
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:50,476
A rom-com?

328
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,610
Wait, haven't you…

329
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:53,713
-I haven't done it yet.
-Really?

330
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,147
I mean, I'm from Wando,

331
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,217
and I haven't shown my Jeolla accent
in any of my works yet.

332
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,151
TRUE

333
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,621
I've always been cast
as the cold, cynical type.

334
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:04,957
I know. You've done a lot of heavy roles.

335
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:07,326
I want to show my true vibe.

336
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,528
You mean the Wando vibe?

337
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,498
I haven't been able to do that yet.

338
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,301
Yeah, that's who you are deep down.

339
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,336
-It's your natural self.
-Yes, exactly.

340
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,138
If something set in Jeolla came my way,

341
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,873
I don't think I'd be scared.

342
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,874
For real?

343
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,743
That I can enjoy for sure.

344
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:28,180
I want to take on a role
that's simple and rough around the edges.

345
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,016
I think you're looking for something
like When Life Gives You Tangerines.

346
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,952
Watching that show, I thought,

347
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,353
"This is so well-made."

348
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,155
"What a great piece of work."

349
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,890
And I also felt jealous.

350
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,193
I think you would nail a role
like Yang Gwan-sik.

351
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:42,828
I think so too.

352
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,665
I won't marry an island boy!

353
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,335
Then who else?

354
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,070
GETS RIGHT INTO CHARACTER

355
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,338
I'm all you have.

356
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:53,939
You can't live without me!

357
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,808
Quit talking crazy!

358
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,010
Hey, I think I have no choice
but to marry you.

359
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,712
Don't even think twice.

360
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,613
Listen.

361
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:03,582
I'm sorry, but…

362
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,251
I just can't do the accent.

363
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:07,119
-I can't.
-That was good.

364
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,020
It was?

365
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,922
-That was a quick skit.
-It was fun.

366
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,124
Nice of you to play along.

367
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,959
I almost got indigestion.

368
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,129
That's the beauty of a skit.

369
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:21,066
I don't need to digest.

370
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:24,970
Just go over there and box!

371
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:26,372
Make the food go down.

372
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:27,506
YES, MASTER

373
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:28,841
That's it!

374
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:29,842
AS YOU WISH, MASTER

375
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:30,910
One, two!

376
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,845
NO ONE ESCAPES FROM BOXING HELL

377
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,016
I am in your debt forever.

378
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,621
RESPECT

379
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:44,590
My head hurts.

380
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,325
I can die happy now.

381
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,394
On the way home,

382
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,529
I think it'll all feel like a dream.

383
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,865
"Was I dreaming for two days?"

384
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:53,933
"That's strange."

385
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,902
"Why do I know these dance moves?"

386
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,404
WAS I JENNIE IN MY DREAM?

387
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,305
"Jennie?"

388
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,808
I can see you starring in a movie
like Little Forest.

389
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,977
-Yes, I'd love that.
-You know…

390
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,912
-Making cute dishes and all.
-That'd be awesome.

391
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,180
LOOKING FORWARD TO A NEW HA-JUN

392
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,450
Do you watch films and dramas
like you're studying them?

393
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,587
Is it hard for you
to just watch them casually?

394
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:15,988
I find it hard,

395
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:20,659
as much as I'd love to just enjoy it
from a viewer's perspective.

396
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:21,594
I FEEL YOU

397
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,661
But I keep thinking,

398
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:25,397
"How did they film that?
What was the actor thinking?"

399
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:28,767
So, that's a bit of a shame,
as I'm also a viewer myself.

400
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:31,437
I felt the same thing
when I was watching variety shows.

401
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:32,571
I was laughing so hard,

402
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,641
but then I started wondering,
"What would I have said?"

403
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,409
Exactly. That's only natural.

404
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:38,577
It was suffocating.

405
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,346
-"What joke would I have made?"
-Yeah.

406
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:41,614
BONDING OVER THE SAME STRUGGLE

407
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,886
And when I see someone doing so well,
I get super jealous.

408
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,755
-No one else can do what you do.
-That's not true.

409
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,325
-You worry too much.
-I really do.

410
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,460
But I can't help it.

411
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:55,995
-I agree.
-Yeah.

412
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:59,131
The only way to calm the anxiety
is to work harder.

413
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:00,032
Right.

414
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,201
-The only way.
-That's the only way.

415
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:03,102
Study harder.

416
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:04,370
CONCLUSION: WORK HARDER

417
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:07,306
-Become someone I'm not ashamed of.
-Yes.

418
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,042
That was so relatable. I feel you.

419
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,410
-It's not easy.
-Yeah.

420
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,145
Life isn't easy, ya know.

421
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:16,582
That's why I invited you on this trip,
don't ya know?

422
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,652
-What does that even mean?
-What?

423
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:20,653
No idea.

424
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:21,553
ACCENT FROM NOWHERE

425
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:23,789
-I have no idea.
-Okay.

426
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:27,626
While I'm here,
I'd like to go somewhere and recharge.

427
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:28,527
You in?

428
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,229
Isn't that what we've been doing?

429
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:31,730
Nope.

430
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:33,532
-It's not enough.
-It's not…

431
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,533
It's not enough?

432
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,601
I'm not enough,

433
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,503
and I'm not recharged enough.

434
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:38,404
Got ya.

435
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,006
I'm sorry,

436
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:44,543
and I'm going to take you
to a place to recharge.

437
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,111
So follow me.

438
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:47,246
Let's go, then.

439
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,181
Keep up, slowpoke!

440
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,352
Step out of the frame.

441
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,393
STOMACHS FULL
NOW OFF TO FINISH RECHARGING

442
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,462
10-MINUTE DRIVE
TO CHEONGSAN MARINE HEALING PARK

443
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,097
Denim looks good on you.

444
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,398
I like your outfit.

445
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,334
-It gives off a college freshman vibe.
-Yeah?

446
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,869
I went for a soft and sweet look today.

447
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,006
-I'm actually a fan of this brand.
-This brand?

448
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:18,510
I liked the T-shirt and pants
from this brand, so I went to get them.

449
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:21,013
When I mentioned I'd be on a show,

450
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,681
they asked, "Which one?"

451
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,249
"It's Jang Do-yeon's show."

452
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,651
"Oh, Jangdobari?"

453
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:28,187
I wasn't expecting that.

454
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:31,457
I wore that brand for the teaser shoot.

455
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:32,858
I was like, "That's crazy."

456
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:35,828
Whenever I hear a stranger
calling me Jangdobari…

457
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:37,496
It feels so weird.

458
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,098
STILL NOT USED TO HER NICKNAME

459
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,634
Are the viewers not familiar
with that nickname?

460
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,636
-No.
-Why does it sound familiar?

461
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,505
You're probably thinking of Yangsebari.

462
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,440
He started it.

463
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,509
-"Baribari Yangsebari!"
-That's the one.

464
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,845
But since I'm close with Se-hyung,

465
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:55,981
he and his brother Se-chan
would call me Jangdobari.

466
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:57,049
YANG SE BROTHERS

467
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:00,552
I never imagined it would be used
in the title of a show.

468
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,056
CHEONGSAN MARINE HEALING PARK

469
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,524
"Smart Healing Hall"?

470
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,993
-So cute!
-What's cute?

471
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,295
They must've put them there for kids.

472
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,630
4 ADORABLE CHAIRS FOR CHILDREN

473
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,698
My goodness.

474
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,635
HEALING PARK NESTLED
IN THE HEART OF THE FOREST

475
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,470
-This way.
-Hello.

476
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,172
-Please take off your shoes.
-Okay.

477
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,941
Pull the blanket aside
and sit down on the stone.

478
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:24,343
Are these like stone beds?

479
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,544
They're maekbanseok beds.

480
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,146
-I see.
-Really?

481
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,583
Wow, it's warm.

482
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,853
-These are herb packs.
-All right.

483
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,855
-One on your shoulders.
-Shoulders?

484
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:37,890
One on your stomach.

485
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:40,726
I've seen these packs
in physiotherapy sessions.

486
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,028
Place one on your shoulders.

487
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,696
-Shoulders?
-These are nice.

488
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,632
There. This one goes on your stomach.

489
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,300
CAUGHT OFF GUARD BY THE GENTLE TOUCH

490
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:49,234
Like this.

491
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:53,205
Now tuck yourself in, lie down, and relax.

492
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,441
WARM SERVICE, DOWN TO THE BLANKET

493
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,044
You are the first person
to tuck me in since my mom.

494
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,246
I feel like I'm at a fancy beauty spa.

495
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:04,583
Look at the glass ceiling. It's wonderful!

496
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:06,585
I love that.

497
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,353
CLOUD-FILLED SKY RESTING ON THE CEILING

498
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,488
The clouds are passing.

499
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:11,457
This is heavenly.

500
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:12,357
SATISFIED

501
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,159
Even my eyes feel refreshed.

502
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,030
FATIGUE MELTS AWAY

503
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,199
This is the best trip ever.

504
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,200
I know, right?

505
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,201
I mean it.

506
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,268
HALF-ASLEEP

507
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:24,736
This is so relaxing.

508
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,271
This is lovely.

509
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:41,920
I might fall asleep.

510
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,257
Do you like toasting yourself like this?

511
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:47,860
-Me?
-Yeah.

512
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,696
Yes, I like it now.

513
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:51,630
You like it now?

514
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:54,032
It's growing on me as I get older.

515
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,068
Yeah, the urge gets stronger every year.

516
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,069
SUNLIGHT INTENSIFIES

517
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,204
Oh, it's the sun.

518
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,140
This feels

519
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,042
kind of like I'm in a coffin.

520
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:05,511
It's scary.

521
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:08,614
Have you ever wanted to try that stuff?

522
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,816
You know,
stuff like end-of-life experience.

523
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:11,850
No.

524
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:12,851
-You haven't?
-No.

525
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:15,254
-I once wanted to try it.
-Really?

526
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,922
I wondered

527
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:22,427
if going through it would make me
see everyday life differently.

528
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:26,165
-What would your last words be?
-My last words?

529
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:27,566
"Why didn't I let loose?"

530
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,869
"Why did I get so hung up
on the little things?"

531
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,404
I would think that,

532
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:34,540
but I'm not sure if I'd actually say it.

533
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:35,674
It's not cool enough.

534
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:39,077
I think I would try to look cool
when I die.

535
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:40,412
Did you ever think about that?

536
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:45,217
There was a time when making up
your own epitaph was kind of a trend.

537
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,418
Oh, that?

538
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:49,188
I don't really imagine stuff
or make up what-ifs.

539
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:51,423
MBTI TYPE = ISTJ
VALUES EXPERIENCE OVER IDEAS

540
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,159
I think I would say,
"I lived true to myself."

541
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:01,433
STILL GETTING A LOT OF LOVE FROM THE SUN

542
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:03,402
The sun is…

543
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,003
HIDING FROM THE SUN

544
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,338
Is the sun too bright?

545
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:07,806
It's right in my face.

546
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:10,676
-It's like a spotlight.
-Oh no.

547
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,080
It's so warm in here.

548
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:17,816
Thanks for visiting.

549
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,685
-Is it over?
-Okay.

550
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,153
HEALING MOMENT CUT TOO SHORT

551
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,355
-Did you rest well?
-Ma'am.

552
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,427
Five more minutes.

553
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,095
Five minutes.

554
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:32,464
-Aren't you going to school?
-What?

555
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:33,865
Isn't it Saturday?

556
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,235
You took that well.

557
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,771
-That was nice.
-So nice.

558
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:40,872
That was real healing.

559
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:42,441
-I think…
-Sorry?

560
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,743
-I think we've recharged enough.
-All right.

561
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:49,248
I found a great place to wrap up the trip.

562
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:50,649
Let's head there now.

563
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:52,050
Let's go.

564
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,687
You go ahead. I'm gonna stay a bit more.

565
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,389
You're coming with me, kid.

566
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:58,423
SHE'S SCARY

567
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,391
Not a chance.

568
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:01,193
I don't wanna leave.

569
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:02,995
-Shall we?
-To the great place.

570
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:03,929
TO THE LAST STOP

571
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,933
You must be sad
that this trip's coming to an end.

572
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:10,335
-I'm sad.
-He's laughing.

573
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,504
So sad.

574
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:13,572
NOT BUYING THAT

575
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:14,840
You are sad, aren't you?

576
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,309
Too bad we missed the canola flowers.

577
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:18,777
Yes, I was looking forward to it.

578
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:25,517
CANOLA FLOWERS ARE IN FULL BLOOM
IN CHEONGSANDO COME SPRING

579
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:26,852
The beauty of this place

580
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:29,388
is that you can feel
the changing of the seasons.

581
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,455
That's for sure.

582
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:33,292
I've never seen this much green before.

583
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,627
Exactly. That's why I love it here.

584
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,664
It's beautiful here.

585
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:46,672
If you were asked to be
on another travel show someday,

586
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,273
would you say yes?

587
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,675
Travel show?

588
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:52,744
Please don't answer that.

589
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,279
Getaway and Go with Jangdobari?

590
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:57,115
Not this one.
There is a variety of shows available.

591
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:00,018
Did I close that door for you? I hope not.

592
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,121
It's shut tight now.

593
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:05,357
Don't say that.

594
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:07,626
No, the door is always open.

595
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:09,227
-Even variety shows?
-Yes.

596
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:10,929
Oh my goodness.

597
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:14,066
The view is gorgeous.

598
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:15,667
This is an awesome spot.

599
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:17,936
OCEAN STRETCHING BEYOND THE SILVER GRASS

600
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,738
It's so nicely set up.

601
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,074
I know this will make you sad,

602
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,775
but this trip has come to an end.

603
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,111
Already?

604
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,379
OH BOY, HOW SAD

605
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:31,350
You are supposed to be good at acting.

606
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:34,419
It's like you didn't even try just now.

607
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:35,320
Hold on.

608
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:36,788
Does anyone have eye drops?

609
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:39,491
-We should try that again.
-Should we?

610
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:42,260
Open bracket, Ha-jun's sad that it's over,
close bracket.

611
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:44,262
This trip has come to an end.

612
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:46,631
Has it already?
Are there any more spots to see?

613
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,533
More spots? Okay, then--

614
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,001
No, stop right there.

615
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:53,638
I missed my chance.

616
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:57,175
Fine, then tell me your thoughts
about this trip.

617
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:58,677
-This trip?
-Yes.

618
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,712
I liked that we talked a lot.

619
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,047
That was the best part.

620
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,749
IT WAS?

621
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:04,883
The weather was amazing.

622
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,119
-It really was.
-Wando and Cheongsando.

623
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:09,388
They are very beautiful islands.

624
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:10,389
It was therapeutic.

625
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:11,723
-That's true.
-Really.

626
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,226
I couldn't stop taking in the views
at every place.

627
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:15,127
Yes.

628
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:18,864
I came here thinking it'd feel like work,

629
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:22,100
but it ended up feeling like a real trip.
I really mean this.

630
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:23,935
Now,

631
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:28,440
it's time to summarize
this journey into words.

632
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:31,309
It doesn't have to be a summary.
There are no rules.

633
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:33,578
-You can either write or draw.
-All right.

634
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:35,947
You can write,
"Let's never see each other again."

635
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:37,449
-Really?
-It doesn't matter.

636
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,317
You can use it like a note or diary.

637
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:40,318
A note or diary.

638
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:42,788
-Just write down whatever you want.
-A diary?

639
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:44,322
So, is this a diary?

640
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:46,591
Think of it as a diary with no rules.

641
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:48,727
Or you can write a message to me.

642
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:51,029
Anything's okay.

643
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:52,697
Diary…

644
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:01,540
TIME TO REFLECT ON THE JOURNEY
AS THEY WRITE IN THE DIARY

645
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:07,179
TO EVERYONE'S SURPRISE,
THE WORDS COME FLOWING WITHOUT HESITATION

646
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:16,254
EACH WORD HOLDS THEIR SPECIAL MEMORY

647
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,460
DONE

648
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:25,363
CHIRP

649
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,766
I thought that sound was a recording.

650
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:32,070
If you lived surrounded
by the sounds of nature like this,

651
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,538
would it make you a kind person?

652
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:35,707
I think it would. It'd make you calmer.

653
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,309
The environment really matters.

654
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:44,716
Everything about this place
seems so peaceful.

655
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:47,052
Even the cats and dogs.

656
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:51,056
They say travelers see differently.
It's called "travelers' eyes."

657
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:53,358
When you are traveling,
everything looks nice.

658
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:56,628
People who live here
are just going through their lives,

659
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:58,163
facing their own struggles.

660
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,500
But to a traveler,
everything seems sweet and beautiful.

661
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:04,669
DOING HIS BEST

662
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,540
He's the first person to write
such a long, thoughtful message.

663
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:12,143
FILLING OUT A WHOLE PAGE

664
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,312
You're not trying to cut me off, are you?

665
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,515
Of course not.

666
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:25,190
I'm supposed to be making friends
in this show.

667
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:29,227
Why do I feel like I'm losing friends
on every trip?

668
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,429
-I'm done.
-Are you finished?

669
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:32,964
I took some time.

670
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,567
-Let us read what we have written.
-We have to read it?

671
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:36,968
But it's my diary.

672
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,703
That book isn't even yours.

673
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:40,605
I'm taking this with me.

674
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:41,907
Okay, I'm sorry.

675
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:43,575
This is part of the show.

676
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:45,043
-We have to read it.
-Really?

677
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:46,845
Do you want me to read it?

678
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:48,079
FROWNING

679
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:51,383
Please tell me you just frowned
only because of the sun.

680
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:53,451
Don't make that face!

681
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:55,353
I thought it was The Worst of Evil.

682
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,689
I want The Midnight Romance in Hagwon!

683
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,558
Stop doing that.

684
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:01,693
Don't do that.

685
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,595
That was scary. Master?

686
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:04,496
Master?

687
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,865
Master, please remember me.

688
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:11,670
-Remember the good times we had, okay?
-I will.

689
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,672
Just read the parts you feel like reading.

690
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,141
I just wrote it like a diary.

691
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:17,075
That's nice.

692
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:20,145
"I haven't written a diary
since elementary school."

693
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:23,848
"It feels unfamiliar,
but more than that, it's exciting."

694
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:28,386
"As I write, I find myself looking back
on this two-day trip."

695
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:32,257
"Since it was a variety show, there were
awkward and challenging moments."

696
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:34,125
"But I laughed a lot."

697
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:37,028
"I was able to see just how charming
my hometown, Wando, is."

698
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:42,167
"What stood out the most on this trip
was the sincerity."

699
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:46,871
"Do-yeon, I, and even the production team
were sincere."

700
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:50,075
"I think that's what made this
such a healing, joyful experience."

701
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,677
"Lastly, I've always been
a fan of Do-yeon,

702
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:56,214
and on this trip, I got to see
not just her charm as a comedian,

703
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,882
but also as a person."

704
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:01,486
"I hope she continues to believe
in her own talents and unique charm

705
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:04,255
and enjoys every bit of what she does."

706
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:07,292
"I sincerely thank Do-yeon, once again."

707
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,995
"Baribari Jangdobari.
Jab-jab-one-two. Wish you the best."

708
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,732
Hey!

709
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,133
I'm touched.

710
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,668
-Thank you.
-I meant every word.

711
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,803
This trip touched me
and helped me recharge.

712
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,906
I'm going to take your advice
and try not to doubt myself.

713
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:22,807
All right.

714
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:26,511
I kept mine simple and light.

715
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:28,613
-It's a little letter to you.
-Okay.

716
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,615
"My first-ever travel buddy…"

717
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:31,683
What the hell? Shit.

718
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:33,618
FIRST-EVER TRAVEL BUDDY?

719
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:34,919
WAY TO RUIN THE MOMENT

720
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:38,056
-I can't believe…
-Cut the whole thing out.

721
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:39,891
This can't be happening. No.

722
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,327
No, it was the wind. No!

723
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,362
HOW COULD YOU?

724
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:46,331
Master!

725
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:47,332
KICK OF FURY

726
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:48,967
I'll get down on the ground.

727
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:51,403
Sorry. The wind turned the page.

728
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:52,737
What's wrong with me?

729
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:54,139
What a stupid mistake.

730
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:57,008
But really, it was the wind.

731
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:59,477
-I didn't know I was the first guest.
-It startled me too.

732
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:01,746
My handwriting looks the same every time.

733
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,448
What's wrong with me?

734
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,617
Come on, get ahold of yourself, Do-yeon.

735
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:07,686
Okay, let's try again.

736
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:09,921
"I'm so glad we clicked."

737
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:12,290
"I don't even know
why I was worried at first."

738
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,960
"Share your face-changing acting magic
with the whole world, will you?"

739
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,629
"I'll always be rooting for you."

740
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:21,099
"And those dreams you had
will all come true."

741
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,568
"Like JENNIE…"

742
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:28,840
"Dreams come true"
was what I really wanted to say.

743
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:31,676
"Let's meet again.
From Wando, on a sunny day."

744
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:32,577
There you go.

745
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,345
-Thank you so much.
-Thanks.

746
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:35,780
Thank you.

747
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:38,183
HEARTFELT TRIP RECAP IS NOW OVER

748
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:40,051
Please remember only the good stuff.

749
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,353
Sift through your memories, okay?

750
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,321
Sure.

751
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:47,125
What should I do? He still scares me.

752
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:49,260
-You got his last name wrong.
-No, I didn't!

753
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:52,130
-She messed up the start and finish.
-I did not!

754
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:54,265
We have Mr. Seo Ha-jun here…

755
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:55,333
No, Mr. Wi…

756
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,735
MISTAKE 1: GOT HIS NAME WRONG

757
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:58,737
"My first-ever travel buddy…"

758
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:00,004
What the hell? Shit.

759
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,373
MISTAKE 2: READ THE WRONG LETTER

760
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,442
No! I can't believe…

761
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,145
I THINK I'M LOSING IT

762
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:08,513
Story of my life.

763
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,714
THE TORTURE NEVER ENDS

764
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:12,016
Should I get down on the ground?

765
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,085
That will make me feel a bit better.

766
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:15,687
No, don't do it.

767
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,588
DON'T BE MAD

768
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:18,523
Please don't.

769
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,424
NO HESITATION

770
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:20,692
DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING

771
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,761
Why are you doing this? Stop it.

772
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:23,762
It's all good.

773
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:25,630
-Remember the good stuff.
-I will!

774
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:27,165
You will do that, won't you?

775
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:28,800
I've seen you shadowbox.

776
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:30,301
-Forgive me.
-It's okay.

777
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:31,503
MIND-BLOWING APOLOGY

778
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:33,171
Your head will hurt for a while.

779
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:34,739
No, it helped with circulation.

780
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:35,640
You startled me.

781
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,375
I did it all the time in high school.

782
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:39,711
It's nothing, really.

783
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,579
You gotta be careful. That was shocking.

784
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:43,515
-It was fun, Do-yeon.
-Do you mean it?

785
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:46,384
-Stop doubting yourself.
-That's right. Okay.

786
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,552
To be honest…

787
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,220
HABITS CAN BE SCARY

788
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,422
It's become a habit.
I have to do something about it.

789
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:53,992
You are so right. Thanks.
I'll believe in myself.

790
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:55,660
I had so much fun.

791
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,829
-I enjoyed it.
-Everything worked out well.

792
00:29:58,396 --> 00:29:59,764
-Thanks.
-Thanks for everything.

793
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:01,599
Hey, your frown is quite terrifying.

794
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,635
Is it? The sun is too strong.

795
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:05,303
You were like this earlier.

796
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,605
"Jang Do-yeon is a charming person."

797
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:08,673
"Now die!"

798
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:13,845
I'm looking right at the sun again.

799
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:17,382
Even the sun knows
that you're Wando's pride.

800
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:18,917
Give me a break.

801
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,952
It's been annoying me all day.

802
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:22,754
-Anyway, thank you again.
-Sure.

803
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:23,822
It's a relief.

804
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:26,224
Those are my final words for this trip.

805
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:29,127
I'll get up first
so I don't have to watch you walk away.

806
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:30,028
Okay.

807
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,499
Take care.

808
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:35,667
Bye.

809
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:37,502
HOPING OUR PATHS CROSS AGAIN SOMEDAY

810
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:38,970
-I hope we meet again.
-Yeah.

811
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,839
I'm going to walk away with no regrets.

812
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:41,840
Me too.

813
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:57,655
WITH A TOUCH OF SADNESS,
WE EACH SET OFF ON OUR OWN PATH

814
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:05,396
OUR TIME IN WANDO WAS LONG YET SHORT

815
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:09,801
THE WAY BACK FEELS EVEN LONGER
THAN THE ONE THAT BROUGHT US HERE

816
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,239
BUT MAYBE THIS GOODBYE
IS JUST ANOTHER HELLO

817
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:28,186
What's going on?

818
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,388
No!

819
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:33,358
NO ONE CAN ESCAPE THE LOOP OF FATE

820
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:34,259
No!

821
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:35,960
You are trapped here.

822
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:39,597
The contract said
you had to appear on the show.

823
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:40,999
It didn't say how many episodes.

824
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,533
DON'T FORGET TO READ THE FINE PRINT

825
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:44,802
You must be joking.

826
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:46,537
Scared, huh?
We're starting all over again.

827
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:47,672
We're starting again?

828
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,140
Our next stop is…

829
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:51,309
Wando High School.

830
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:56,848
-Hilarious.
-I'm moving abroad tomorrow.

831
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,049
Are you?

832
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:01,119
Then wherever you are going
is our next stop.

833
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:03,454
This is too funny.

834
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:05,523
We are following Ha-jun abroad!

835
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:14,532
WI HA-JUN

836
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:21,606
JANG DO-YEON, WI HA-JUN

837
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:30,882
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

838
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:35,219
ON THE DAY PINK PETALS DANCED IN THE AIR

839
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,489
MY HEART FLUTTERED SWEETLY

840
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:40,625
I'm a bit nervous.

841
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,226
Nice to meet you.

842
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:44,929
AS YOU CAME TO ME

843
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:46,864
I'm Kentaro Sakaguchi.

844
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:48,766
One, two, three.

845
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:49,934
YOUR HOBBY

846
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:51,636
BECOMES MY OWN

847
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:53,104
I'm so happy.

848
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:54,505
JUST LIKE THAT

849
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:59,177
COULD THEY BE GROWING CLOSER?

850
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:00,345
SHY ONE MOMENT

851
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:01,879
I'm okay. Help yourself.

852
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:02,780
Do you like me?

853
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:03,715
BOLD THE NEXT

854
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:04,983
Cute!

855
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:06,551
AN UNFORGETTABLE DAY AWAITS

856
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:07,719
-Nok.
-Nok.

857
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:08,886
-Du.
-Du.

858
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:10,388
-Jeon.
-Jeon.

859
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:11,356
Nokdu-jeon.

860
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:13,124
CUTE!

861
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:15,059
HE SHOWS MAGIC FOR DO-YEON

862
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:16,260
What was that?

863
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,997
SHE SWIPES HER CARD FOR KENTARO

864
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:20,398
She's awesome.

865
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:23,935
YOU ARE INVITED

866
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,903
Your dimples are cute as well.

867
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:28,072
TO A DAY FULL OF LIGHT AND CHARM

868
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:29,140
It was the best moment.
