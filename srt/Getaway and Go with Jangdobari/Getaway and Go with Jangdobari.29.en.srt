1
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:05,839
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

2
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:07,407
Where am I now, you ask?

3
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:08,942
<i>A city filled to the brim</i>
<i>with clear water.</i>

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,577
<i>It's Pocheon, Gyeonggi Province.</i>

5
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:13,113
Today's travel buddy…

6
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,647
Out of all the gems in my gem box,

7
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:16,750
she sits in the very middle.

8
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:18,952
Gosh, it's so good to see you!

9
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,255
<i>I'd love to get to know Do-yeon better.</i>

10
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:24,724
Our trip has been given
a theme and a title.

11
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:28,728
Jang Do-yeon and KARINA's
thrilling adventure.

12
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,330
I love it.

13
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,366
Can I call you Ji-min
so it feels like we're closer?

14
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:34,634
SCREAMING!

15
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,803
-I bet you love Mont Blanc.
-Totally.

16
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,338
-Do you like chestnuts?
-Sure.

17
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:39,439
-Don't you like working out?
-Do you work out?

18
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,107
-I absolutely hate it.
-I hate it.

19
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:43,743
I think I'm basically you at 40.

20
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,578
DO-YEON AND KARINA
ARE SO SIMILAR IT'S CRAZY

21
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:48,715
We said we'd do something special
that we'd only do on trips.

22
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,651
-Whoever wins gets to be the prince.
-Okay.

23
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,119
The loser will be the right-hand man.

24
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:54,821
…and pay for what we do next.

25
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:56,689
AND SO, AN ARCHERY COMPETITION BEGINS!

26
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:58,992
KARINA FLEXES A HIDDEN TALENT

27
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,461
DO-YEON HAD THE PASSION,
BUT NOT THE SKILLS

28
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:06,099
IT EVENTUALLY ENDED IN KARINA'S VICTORY

29
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,001
There's something we should do.

30
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:10,570
I already feel mortified.

31
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:11,471
I can't watch this.

32
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:12,772
HOW WILL JANG PAL-MO ORDER THE DRINKS?

33
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:14,007
GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

34
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,508
Ma'am, can we order?

35
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,509
My gosh.

36
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,410
-Fresh--
-Do-yeon.

37
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:18,845
-There's something we should do.
-What?

38
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:21,181
Oh, of course.

39
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:26,719
I already feel mortified.

40
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:27,654
I can't watch this.

41
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,888
A PENALTY TOO MORTIFYING
TO EVEN THINK ABOUT

42
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:31,024
Oh no.

43
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,759
Ma'am, there's going to be a show.

44
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,729
-I mean, a short act.
-More like an act or performance.

45
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:37,931
Please pretend like
you didn't see anything.

46
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:40,133
-Don't be alarmed.
-Please don't be alarmed.

47
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,768
Remember she's a nice person.

48
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,705
HAH HAH HAH

49
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,540
Prince Kamong.

50
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,008
You're an incredible marksman.

51
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,478
OH DEAR…

52
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:52,912
She was like…

53
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:55,615
She's shocked.

54
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:56,950
I saw her expression just now.

55
00:01:58,518 --> 00:01:59,886
Ma'am.

56
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,088
A milk-based drink with fresh <i>deodeok</i>

57
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,257
and two black drinks
with lots of ice, please.

58
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:06,693
BACK ON HER FEET

59
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:08,495
That'll be all.

60
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:09,696
GENTLE AND QUIET

61
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:11,631
Talk about a rare experience.

62
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,600
A RARE, EMBARRASSING MOMENT
THAT SHOULD BE RECORDED

63
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,436
And with that… Yes?

64
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,004
Don't you want jujube tea?

65
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,105
The jujube tea here must be good.

66
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,874
We'd like a cup of jujube tea too.

67
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,876
There are a lot of books here.

68
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,177
-Can I take a look?
-Sure.

69
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,646
She must love poetry.
A lot of these are poetry books.

70
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:27,847
It fits the vibe perfectly.

71
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,415
Isn't it serene?

72
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,717
A SERENE, POETRY-FILLED CAFE

73
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:31,918
This is so nice.

74
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,988
What sort of books are you into?

75
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:36,556
I used to read

76
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,758
a lot of novels.

77
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,727
Keigo Higashino is one of my favorites.

78
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,028
-No way!
-I…

79
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:46,032
-His writing is so compelling.
-It's so engaging.

80
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:49,702
I got into reading through mystery novels

81
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:51,271
and grew to love books by Choi Eun-young.

82
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,605
-Choi Eun-young?
-Yes.

83
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,441
-Any recommendations?
-Have you read

84
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,843
-<i>Someone Harmless to Me</i>?
-No.

85
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,779
It's so good. <i>The Secret </i>too.

86
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:00,713
Add to cart.

87
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,750
Have you read <i>Fire Salamander </i>by Han Kang?

88
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:05,351
-No.
-That's really enjoyable.

89
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:07,353
I already have it in my cart.

90
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,555
It's really good.

91
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:11,291
-How beautiful!
-What is?

92
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,460
This is <i>deodeok</i> latte.

93
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,995
-Thank you.
-And this is

94
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:17,363
your Americano.

95
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,665
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

96
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:19,899
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

97
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:22,635
-Goodness.
-They're beautiful.

98
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,970
They're so pretty.

99
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,139
FRESH DEODEOK LATTE

100
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:30,944
FRESH DEODEOK LATTE SERVED
WITH CINNAMON POWDER ON TOP

101
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,981
She's going to bake you
some sweet potatoes.

102
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:35,882
Really?

103
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:36,950
Could you take a look at this?

104
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:38,318
-Me?
-Look at what?

105
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,653
THE SUBSISTENCE CROP LOVER IS EXCITED
TO HEAR ABOUT SWEET POTATOES

106
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,522
Really? Can we eat these?

107
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,792
I heard that you loved sweet potatoes.

108
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:46,960
-Really?
-Yes.

109
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:48,861
Gosh, how sweet of you.

110
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,797
-It's like a scene from a movie.
-Right?

111
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:52,665
-Like <i>Little Forest</i>.
-I might tear up.

112
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,401
A BASKET FULL OF SWEET POTATOES
BAKED IN A WOOD STOVE

113
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:56,803
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

114
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,171
-We'll enjoy this.
-We'll enjoy this.

115
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,239
SINCERELY TOUCHED, THANK YOU SO MUCH

116
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,609
-No way.
-The warmth of the place

117
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,245
makes the owner seem familiar,
even though we just met her.

118
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,546
I want to call her Mom.

119
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,182
Here are some napkins.

120
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,683
-How adorable!
-No way!

121
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,819
-Do you make these yourself?
-Yes.

122
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,821
Did you make your hat as well?

123
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:16,422
Of course.

124
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:17,991
How much of your outfit is handmade?

125
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:18,958
Did you make your own clothes?

126
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:19,993
-What's that?
-What's that?

127
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,729
It feels really nice to talk
while holding these.

128
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:23,930
-They wish for longevity.
-Are they tactile toys?

129
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:24,931
Longevity?

130
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:25,898
SOFT HANDMADE TURTLE TOYS
THAT SYMBOLIZE LONGEVITY

131
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:27,734
-Feel them.
-Gosh, thank you.

132
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,702
This is adorable.

133
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,304
My gosh!

134
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:34,073
This is crazy.
I'm so glad we ordered this.

135
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,975
I love that there are pine nuts
floating in it.

136
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:36,943
JUJUBE TEA

137
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,645
It's a classic cup of jujube tea.

138
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,546
Is this a wash basin or what?

139
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,382
What a generous portion.

140
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,684
Everything about this place is lovely.

141
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,286
-Just look.
-My digital camera.

142
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,154
Thanks.

143
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,522
What's with the digital camera?

144
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,658
It's the digital camera
I can't live without.

145
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,926
-I bought it secondhand.
-Did you buy it?

146
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,296
Let me take a photo of you.

147
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,498
-Every photo comes out stunning.
-Really?

148
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:00,933
-I get shy when people take my photo.
-Then,

149
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,802
-I'll give you an idea for the photo.
-I'd like that.

150
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:05,471
Hold that pose, but look out the window,

151
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:06,973
like it's for a commercial.

152
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,441
Looking good.

153
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:09,876
-How's this?
-Good.

154
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,878
-Look out the window.
-The window?

155
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,381
No way.

156
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:16,316
What is it?

157
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:17,950
Hold on.

158
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,352
-Here's how I'd describe it.
-Yes?

159
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:20,820
You look like the only colored flower

160
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:24,057
in a world of achromatic tones.

161
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:26,225
-That sounds poetic.
-Nice, right?

162
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,327
A POETIC EXPRESSION SUITED TO THE CAFE

163
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,295
Doesn't it have a certain vibe?

164
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,130
Hello, I'm KARINA.

165
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,633
I think…

166
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:38,204
I think I lost my digital camera.

167
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,542
I thought it was in my suitcase,

168
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,677
but it wasn't.

169
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,447
I was planning to send
the photo to Do-yeon

170
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,614
and share it

171
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:52,185
with the Jangdobari team too,

172
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:55,054
but I can't find
my digital camera anywhere.

173
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,356
I think I lost it,

174
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:57,857
and I'm so sorry.

175
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:58,758
There's a certain mood to it.

176
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,626
-It looks like I live here.
-I think your eyes are closed.

177
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:03,062
That's true,

178
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,497
but it looks fine from a distance.

179
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:05,698
-Isn't it pretty?
-I love it.

180
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,066
I love digital cameras.

181
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,268
-My gosh.
-I just wanted to give you these.

182
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:12,839
-Maybe next time you wear a mini skirt…
-No way.

183
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,775
Should I change into one?

184
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,009
That must be a gift.

185
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,511
What am I getting?

186
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:19,812
-It's a tape measure.
-My gosh!

187
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,881
What's the meaning behind her gift?

188
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,249
What should I be wearing for this?

189
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:24,484
-What is this for?
-It's not that.

190
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,420
Carry it in your purse,
and it'll come in handy one day.

191
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,522
-Is it a tape measure?
-Yes, you can pull on this.

192
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,190
-That's so cute.
-How charming.

193
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:32,291
-It's so pretty.
-And this.

194
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:33,726
You can use it as a key chain.

195
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,363
-How do I…
-Press the button.

196
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,664
Oh, the button.

197
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:39,932
-I made that.
-It looks like a paprika.

198
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,300
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

199
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,769
Thank you.

200
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,071
-I'll make good use of it.
-I love this shade of green.

201
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,473
THE OWNER IS DELIGHTED
BY KARINA'S CUTE REACTION

202
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,709
That was such a cute reaction.

203
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,277
-I could cry.
-My gosh.

204
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,780
-You can't buy this anywhere.
-Exactly.

205
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,815
-No way.
-These are precious.

206
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,617
There's nothing but warmth here.

207
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,085
Let's try the drinks.

208
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,019
I'll enjoy it.

209
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:01,587
-I'll enjoy it.
-The sweet potatoes…

210
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:04,424
-Nice.
-I smell cinnamon.

211
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,093
I love cinnamon powder too.

212
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:14,901
It's really good.

213
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:16,469
-Is that the <i>deodeok</i> latte?
-Try some.

214
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:17,537
Can I have a sip?

215
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,406
You can taste little chunks of <i>deodeok</i>.

216
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:21,808
-Really?
-Yes.

217
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:23,376
I also love that it's slightly sweet.

218
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,549
The Americano isn't overly bitter.

219
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:33,386
I think we prefer each other's drinks.

220
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:37,089
We'll order more later,
about 16 more cups.

221
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:38,558
HAVE ABOUT 16 MORE CUPS

222
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:40,960
It's delicious.

223
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,262
The steamed milk feels so smooth.

224
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:44,897
A DELICIOUS COMBO OF CREAMY STEAMED MILK
AND LITTLE CHUNKS OF DEODEOK

225
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,132
I haven't had anything like it before.

226
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,401
Same here. She probably grinds
the <i>deodeok </i>for this drink.

227
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,304
A BIG SPOONFUL OF STEAMED MILK AND DEODEOK

228
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:54,707
This is delicious.
No wonder it's served with a spoon.

229
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,810
How do we eat this?

230
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:58,878
With a spoon?

231
00:07:58,945 --> 00:07:59,779
Have it as is.

232
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:02,915
The cup has a wide brim,
so lots of people can take a sip.

233
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,151
It's as generous as the owner herself.

234
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:07,653
I'll have a sip.

235
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,654
Have as much as you want.

236
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,159
Gosh, this is so pretty.

237
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,561
-Is it good?
-It's so good.

238
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,396
I mean… Just wow.

239
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:18,664
Don't you like jujube tea?

240
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:19,699
I'm a big fan of jujube.

241
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:20,900
It's delicious.

242
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,402
What a generous serving.

243
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,174
Isn't it delicious?

244
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,141
GASP!

245
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,844
-It's very rich.
-I know.

246
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,246
Can we eat these?

247
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,313
Yes, let's eat them.

248
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,815
Gosh, no way.

249
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,718
-It's…
-Sweet potatoes.

250
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:41,754
I haven't had traditionally
baked sweet potatoes in a while.

251
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,990
How is it this bright yellow?

252
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:45,525
GOLDEN, WELL-COOKED SWEET POTATOES

253
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,360
Check that out.

254
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,395
It looks so good!

255
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,832
This would be amazing
with milk and kimchi.

256
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:53,933
That'd be insane.

257
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,034
It looks so good.

258
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,702
I absolutely love sweet potatoes.

259
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,139
Which do you like better,
orange or dry sweet potatoes?

260
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,207
I like dry sweet potatoes.

261
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,608
Me too. But these days,

262
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,777
it's not easy to find
true dry sweet potatoes.

263
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:05,778
-I know.
-Right?

264
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:06,913
It wasn't a challenge before.

265
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,682
THEY FINALLY GET TO TASTE
THE SWEET POTATO PROPERLY

266
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:12,718
It's so good!

267
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,421
I wonder if she…
Oh, she's been listening in.

268
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:17,990
She…

269
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,459
Do you know

270
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,728
what the owner was doing?

271
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:25,031
-She was peeking between the mugs.
-Between the mugs.

272
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,033
I was hoping she could hear us,

273
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,634
and since I thought she couldn't see us,

274
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,369
I tried looking for her.

275
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:31,270
Right when I turned my head…

276
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,506
SHE TURNED HER HEAD
TO SEE THE OWNER BEAMING

277
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,141
That was so nice!

278
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,910
We just met her,
but she seems really sweet.

279
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,179
-Thank you.
-What's this?

280
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,081
I hope you don't catch a cold this winter.

281
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,649
-Gosh, thank you.
-Thank you.

282
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,385
-Is this apple tea?
-Yes.

283
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:48,988
I think she tops everything off
with cinnamon powder.

284
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:56,696
IS IT GOOD?

285
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,165
This is 120% apple, not 100.

286
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,669
I mean, it's all apples, nothing else.

287
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:08,274
Also, the warm drink was topped

288
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,408
with cinnamon powder.

289
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,011
I'LL TRY A SIP TOO

290
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:14,447
-Of course.
-It's so good.

291
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:15,514
Isn't the apple tea amazing?

292
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,984
I only used apples.

293
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,719
-Right? You can taste it.
-I can see that.

294
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:21,420
It's 100% apple.

295
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:22,855
You said it was 120% earlier.

296
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,624
Shut it, will you?

297
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,593
I threw in an extra 20%
for sentimental reasons.

298
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,494
You brat.

299
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:29,395
READ THE ROOM, WILL YOU?

300
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,263
What's wrong with you?

301
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,832
Please feel free to ask for more.

302
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,834
Could I have another cup

303
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:36,302
of <i>deodeok </i>latte?

304
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:39,038
THANKS TO THE GENEROUS OWNER,
THEY'RE ON THEIR 5TH DRINK

305
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,206
She's so elegant.

306
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:42,174
This is why you must always
be kind and generous.

307
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,509
Tell me about it.

308
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,678
Oh no, this makes me want to live here.

309
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,447
Why does that rose strike me as so lovely?

310
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:52,018
A LONE ROSE SITS OUTSIDE THE WINDOW

311
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:55,054
I can't believe
how old-fashioned I sounded just now.

312
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,890
-"Strike me as so lovely."
-I said it struck me as so lovely.

313
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,326
STIFFENING UP THE MOMENT
THE CAMERA IS POINTED AT HER

314
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,462
THE MOST AWKWARD CELEBRITY
IN FRONT OF A CAMERA

315
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,231
-It's like a mode just switched on.
-Tell me about it.

316
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,066
It was a reflex.

317
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,334
Better stay on your toes today.

318
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,269
-You never know when I'll take your photo.
-Got it.

319
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,838
I checked the online bookstore,
and they don't carry this.

320
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,407
I should take a photo of this.

321
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:16,275
I'm taking a photo of it.

322
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,980
EPISODE 8
CAN I TAKE THAT AS A SIGN?

323
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,182
Have you ever wondered

324
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,484
what you might be doing
if you hadn't become a singer?

325
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:28,254
WELL…

326
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,656
I was going to be a flight attendant.

327
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:32,425
-Were you preparing for the test?
-Yes.

328
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,093
It wasn't the career I wanted,

329
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,795
but my mom wanted frequent flier miles.

330
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:37,730
TRYING NOT TO LAUGH

331
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,099
I started studying Chinese at a young age.

332
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,401
It was my second foreign language.

333
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,103
I picked it up faster than English.

334
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:49,308
I spoke basic English and Chinese,

335
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,377
and since I knew multiple languages
and was tall,

336
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,746
she recommended
I become a flight attendant.

337
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,481
How serious did you get about it?

338
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,018
I wouldn't say I studied it
all that seriously.

339
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,153
It was mostly about watching my weight

340
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,223
and studying languages.

341
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,358
Around that time,
I was picked up by a talent agency.

342
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:07,960
How old were you when it happened?

343
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,595
I was picked up twice.

344
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:13,199
The first time was in middle school,
but the agent who cast me left the agency,

345
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,034
so it fell through.

346
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:18,504
Then another casting agent at SM
picked me up in high school.

347
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,940
-Was it SM both times?
-Yes.

348
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,143
-That's wild.
-I was officially cast in tenth grade.

349
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:26,345
Goodness.

350
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:27,680
My gosh.

351
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:28,781
This is apple tea.

352
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,087
It's so good.

353
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:38,491
-It's way better warm.
-It's really good.

354
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,693
Who knew this could taste even better?

355
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,195
You need to put your bladder on lockdown
to enjoy your time here.

356
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,366
FRESH DEODEOK LATTE, APPLE TEA, JUJUBE TEA

357
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,802
THE OWNER HAS MORE TO GIVE
LIKE THE GIVING TREE

358
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,537
-Goodness.
-How adorable!

359
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,639
-Thank you.
-It's a brooch!

360
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:55,141
A brooch.

361
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,643
-It's so cute.
-How adorable is that?

362
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,211
-What do we do?
-No, I'm okay.

363
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,813
I can't believe she made these.

364
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,215
This will give off a holiday vibe.

365
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,784
-Right?
-Yes.

366
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,986
-You could pin it on a <i>hanbok</i> too.
-Goodness.

367
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,020
SHE'S LIKE A CAMELLIA FLOWER

368
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:11,157
THEY REACTED IN AWE AT KARINA'S BEAUTY

369
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:12,057
You look like a fair lady.

370
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:13,859
CHUCKLING

371
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,594
The brooch went to the right person.

372
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,797
Even the owner was pleased.

373
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:19,532
Thank you.

374
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:20,866
THANK YOU

375
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,469
Thank you so much.
I've never gotten a gift like this before.

376
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:26,205
-Exactly. They're all made with love.
-I know.

377
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,506
I knew from the turtles.

378
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,008
-We should live long lives.
-Absolutely.

379
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,743
She told us to pat these
as a wish for longevity.

380
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,645
PATTING THE TURTLES
THEY HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT

381
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:34,446
It seems as though

382
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:37,016
we drank about 16 cups of tea.

383
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,586
I might make a fool of myself
if I stay any longer,

384
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,455
so it's time for us to head out.

385
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:45,491
We'll now grab a bite to eat.

386
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,627
The best part about this trip is that

387
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,963
we'll continue doing what we enjoy.

388
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,631
Just like we kept drinking
the delicious tea,

389
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:54,300
we'll go for more meat

390
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,468
-since the <i>galbi</i> was so good.
-I love it.

391
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:57,703
I'm a total meat lover.

392
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:58,871
Really? That's great.

393
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,039
The meat we'll be having

394
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:03,209
might not be easy to come by in Seoul.

395
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,377
-How so?
-It's something special

396
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,680
that has been customized for you.

397
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:08,814
-Excited, right?
-Totally.

398
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:09,715
Nice.

399
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:11,750
Did she pack sweet potatoes for us?

400
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:13,919
-Thank you!
-Thank you. They're still warm.

401
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,188
-We'll enjoy them.
-Please do.

402
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,290
Thank you. Take care.

403
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,759
-Bye.
-Take care.

404
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:22,695
It's refreshing out here.

405
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:23,863
This was amazing.

406
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:25,931
Thank you.

407
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,032
It's cold. Please head back inside.

408
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,167
She's walking us out.

409
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,569
She walked us out.

410
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,872
She's as warm as these sweet potatoes.

411
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,273
-Tell me about it.
-This place is amazing.

412
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,674
That warmed my heart.

413
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,110
POOR TIMING

414
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,745
What is it?

415
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,881
-I was going to get the door.
-Really? That's okay.

416
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,049
I couldn't get to it fast enough.

417
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:45,851
Oh gosh.

418
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,355
-What a cozy little place.
-It was like having warm soup.

419
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,257
You're right. It was like warm soup.

420
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:52,324
This…

421
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,727
I'll cherish this.

422
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,963
-It did wonders for my peace of mind.
-Same here.

423
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,765
HEE-HEE
HEH-HEH

424
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,335
-Won't the sweet potato be good?
-Totally.

425
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,403
This is our dinner today.

426
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,939
You seemed to enjoy it so much

427
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,274
that we canceled our dinner reservation.

428
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,243
It smells so good.

429
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,311
I like that it's warm.

430
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:13,412
I should stay here.

431
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,683
Are you good?

432
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,719
SWEET POTATO SKIN CARE THERAPY

433
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,622
It smells really good.

434
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,959
If only you were less good

435
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,494
at singing or dancing.

436
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:30,462
You have…

437
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,599
You have all the makings
of a natural comedian.

438
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,902
-If only…
-I'd be the next good-looking comedian.

439
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:38,971
A COMEDIAN LOST TO THE K-POP INDUSTRY

440
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,306
We definitely missed out.

441
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:41,640
No way.

442
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,342
I've never seen

443
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,611
-such a heartfelt sign before.
-Where?

444
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,246
"Filming in progress. Our apologies."

445
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:48,580
That's so cute!

446
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,015
FILMING IN PROGRESS, OUR APOLOGIES

447
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,517
I want a photo of that.

448
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,053
The words feel so warm.

449
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,655
Look how neat her handwriting is.

450
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:57,790
She has great handwriting.

451
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,024
A NICELY HANDWRITTEN MESSAGE

452
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:02,094
-What's your favorite thing to eat?
-Me?

453
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,429
I like steamed buns with sweet red beans.

454
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,798
I wasn't expecting that.

455
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,232
I also like <i>tteokbokki</i>.

456
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,402
Then there are sweet potatoes

457
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:11,937
and chestnuts.

458
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,306
You seem to enjoy healthy food.

459
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,342
Not really. What if I had them with beer?

460
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,512
That looks pretty hip.

461
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,450
You should try BBQ's
golden fried chicken drumstick

462
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:27,519
dipped in Baedduck's
rosé <i>tteokbokki </i>sauce sometime.

463
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:28,887
Really?

464
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:29,888
You'll be in paradise.

465
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,491
-I love their golden fried chicken.
-Me too.

466
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,227
That's the best fried chicken ever.

467
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,462
-Absolutely.
-Right.

468
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,230
That's adorable.

469
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:39,331
What is? What did you see?

470
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,233
Cherry Tree by the Well.

471
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,769
-That's the restaurant's name.
-Is that the name?

472
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,837
It's cute.

473
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,205
There's a drawing of a well.

474
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:47,873
How adorable.

475
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,442
FROM HOMIGA

476
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,211
TO FROM ITALY

477
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:56,315
When you travel,
do you prefer nature or city vibes?

478
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:57,383
Nature.

479
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,785
-Like Australia?
-I honestly don't mind either,

480
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:03,455
but I tend to have more fun in nature.

481
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:05,624
That's unexpected.

482
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,993
You seem more like a city girl.

483
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,196
I have more fun when I'm out in nature.

484
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:15,467
When you travel, is it usually
with family, friends, or alone?

485
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:17,636
I haven't been anywhere alone.

486
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:19,371
-Not even once?
-Maybe Jongno?

487
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:20,906
Jongno?

488
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,674
You traveled far.

489
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,177
I don't have a driver's license yet.

490
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,813
Once you can drive,

491
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,148
the places you can go

492
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,683
-will expand exponentially.
-I know.

493
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,452
No way.

494
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,887
It's called From Italy.

495
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,588
THEY ARRIVE AT THEIR DINNER SPOT
WHILE CHATTING

496
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:37,689
I love Italy.

497
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,225
It says From Italy Restaurant.

498
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:41,126
That's so cute.

499
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:44,596
-The whole neighborhood is so charming.
-Tell me about it.

500
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,833
How many Blue Ribbons
did this place receive?

501
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,036
No way. Can one place have this many?
I count six.

502
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,505
-Hello.
-I counted six too. Hello.

503
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,309
-My gosh. This place is nice.
-Wow.

504
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,511
-It's so cool.
-Tell me about it.

505
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,013
This must also be a famous painting.

506
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:03,916
-That's <i>Girl with a Pearl Earring</i>.
-Right.

507
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:05,918
Yes, that girl.

508
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,053
-There's one by Van Gogh.
-That's Van Gogh.

509
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,622
There are so many famous paintings here.

510
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:11,790
IT MAKES YOU WONDER
IF YOU'RE IN AN ART GALLERY

511
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,992
First the cafe, and now this place.

512
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,196
Isn't it funny that we showed up
with sweet potatoes?

513
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,832
-It's still warm.
-I know.

514
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,333
-It won't cool down.
-Wait.

515
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,802
It's like the old comics I used to read.

516
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,305
I can picture the owner smiling.

517
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,273
THE OWNER'S SMILE IS STILL VIVID
IN THEIR MINDS

518
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:30,442
HEH HEH

519
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,978
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

520
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:33,979
From Italy.

521
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,948
What should we get as our main?

522
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:38,484
We're going to have either

523
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,019
the gem box tenderloin
or the New York strip.

524
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,821
Which of the two would you like?

525
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,690
Do you prefer tenderloin
or New York strip?

526
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,225
Tenderloin. What about you?

527
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,160
-Tenderloin.
-Tenderloin.

528
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,162
-I prefer tenderloin too.
-That's a bit pricier.

529
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:53,198
-Since that's a bit pricier,
-It is slightly pricier.

530
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:54,333
I'll choose that.

531
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:57,169
Then, that'll be our main dish.

532
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,471
-We should get a salad.
-Sure.

533
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:02,908
-We should eat our greens.
-To help regulate our blood sugar.

534
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,810
To regulate our blood sugar,

535
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,778
-should we have salad with beef brisket?
-I love it.

536
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,848
This sounds delicious too.

537
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,116
Basil scallop pasta.

538
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:14,086
Crabs on a rock. What's that?

539
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:15,954
They have lots of pasta options.

540
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,423
-Should we ask for a recommendation?
-Sounds good.

541
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,359
We'll ask for a dish that suits us.

542
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:21,860
THEY'LL ASK FOR A RECOMMENDED PASTA DISH
THAT SUITS THEM

543
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,829
-Nice.
-Ma'am?

544
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:27,032
-We'll have the gem box tenderloin,
-The tenderloin.

545
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:30,669
-and the salad with beef brisket.
-And salad with beef brisket.

546
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:33,272
We'd like to order a pasta
that goes well with everything.

547
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,140
Could you recommend one?

548
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,075
I recommend crabs on a rock.

549
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,211
So that's your top recommendation.
Should we go with that?

550
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:40,646
-Are you okay with that?
-Yes.

551
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:43,148
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

552
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:44,550
They all sound delicious.

553
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:45,984
-My mouth is already watering.
-Crabs on a rock?

554
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:47,853
What's in it other than crab meat?

555
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:52,324
I'm posing the same way
as the woman in the painting!

556
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,960
THE LADY ACROSS THE ROOM MATCHES HER POSE

557
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,962
-I should've done this instead.
-Like this.

558
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,964
-That was surprising.
-Look like you're spacing out.

559
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:03,068
-<i>Girl with a Pearl Earring.</i>
-Yes?

560
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:07,039
I did a parody of it back in school.

561
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,273
How?

562
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,509
It was an art class assignment.

563
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,344
-Did you paint it?
-No, I dressed up as her.

564
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:13,845
Seriously?

565
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,847
-Yes.
-Did you wear a pearl earring?

566
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:18,550
No way. Do you have any photos?

567
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:19,818
I don't.

568
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,988
One of us acted as the model,
while the others

569
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,424
made the items from the painting
mimicking their texture.

570
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,858
The final step was taking a photo,

571
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:27,960
done by one of us.

572
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:28,894
Were you the model?

573
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:29,795
Yes.

574
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,663
SHE DOES RESEMBLE THE GIRL
IN THE PAINTING…

575
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,731
I bet you looked great.

576
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:34,833
It wasn't cool at all.

577
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,435
How so? It sounds like
you would've done well.

578
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:39,238
The movie based on the painting
is also really good.

579
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:41,273
-I wanted to, but I never got to see it.
-It's good.

580
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,609
-You absolutely love movies, right?
-Me?

581
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,310
I guess you can say that.

582
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,678
That's pretty much my only hobby.

583
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,514
Movies have never been my thing.

584
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,515
How so?

585
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:56,121
I want to know
every character's life story,

586
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,757
down to the smallest,
most meaningless details.

587
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:00,158
-Movies end way too fast.
-Exactly.

588
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:01,627
Movies are too short for me.

589
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,596
That's why you prefer
long-running TV series.

590
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:06,331
-Do you watch <i>EXchange</i>?
-What?

591
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:07,966
-Do you watch <i>EXchange</i>?
-Not really.

592
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,268
Is it fun?

593
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,470
-You mean the current season, right?
-Yes.

594
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:12,638
You must only watch <i>I'm SOLO</i>.

595
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,240
Do you know the show <i>Stirring Journey</i>?

596
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:16,208
I don't.

597
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,746
On <i>I'm SOLO</i>, the father figure is known
as the village chief.

598
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:21,680
The village chief.

599
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:22,848
Village Chief Entertainment, to be exact.

600
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,983
Do you have any idea how big
the <i>I'm SOLO </i>universe is now?

601
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,552
<i>I'm SOLO: Love Continues</i>.

602
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,920
In short, it's ISLC.

603
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,255
I know that one.

604
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:33,859
There's even a spin-off of that spin-off

605
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,828
called <i>Stirring Journey</i>, or SJ for short.

606
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:37,863
Goodness.

607
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,698
It's the best.

608
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:42,000
Is that the real deal?

609
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,003
On <i>Stirring Journey</i>,

610
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,874
the relationships are explored
more deeply.

611
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,742
-As deep as the abyss?
-Exactly.

612
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,311
They're traveling in a place

613
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:54,279
that's completely unfamiliar to them.

614
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,148
On top of that, they have to travel

615
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:57,816
with someone they barely know.

616
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,251
Is it just the two of them?

617
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,452
That's kind of like our show.

618
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,353
STIRRING JOURNEY
= GETAWAY AND GO WITH JANGDOBARI

619
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,454
Hold on a second.

620
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:04,389
This feels like the perfect moment

621
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:06,291
for you to cry a little.

622
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:08,860
I'll go like this.

623
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:10,362
TENSIONS BETWEEN THE TWO OK-SUNS
FINALLY EXPLODE

624
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:11,563
I said I wasn't doing this.

625
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:13,699
I made that clear.

626
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,235
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THEM?

627
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:19,271
You see that all the time on the show,

628
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,872
-and you can't get enough of it.
-The dopamine rush.

629
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,208
-Yes, dopamine.
-I just felt it surge.

630
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:24,576
Do you watch any other dating shows?

631
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:27,746
Other shows? I used to watch <i>I'm SOLO</i> too.

632
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:29,381
Which episode did you watch?

633
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:31,083
<i>I like you…</i>

634
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:33,852
ALL BECAUSE I LIKE YOU SO MUCH

635
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:34,853
What's that?

636
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,555
"Sang-cheol, you punk!"

637
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:39,958
-Did she sing while doing ballet?
-Yes!

638
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,360
She didn't sing but turned the music on.

639
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:42,928
Like this.

640
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,664
She turned on the music
and danced in a ballet costume on a field.

641
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:49,401
I COULDN'T WALK AWAY
BECAUSE YOU KEPT COMING TO MIND

642
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,204
A TOP-QUALITY REENACTMENT

643
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:55,974
She danced to win him over.

644
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,876
It's been so long that I can't remember.

645
00:22:58,343 --> 00:22:59,845
-Gosh.
-When did she get here?

646
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,012
FOOD IS SERVED
AS THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT I'M SOLO

647
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,614
Nice. Wait, what's that?

648
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,015
Are these dried persimmons?

649
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:08,320
It's the squid ink ciabatta
that we bake every day at the restaurant.

650
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,721
Is this bread an appetizer?

651
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:10,856
I thought they were dried persimmons too.

652
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:12,324
They take 14 hours to make.

653
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,926
-Gosh, thank you.
-Thank you.

654
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:17,295
-And that's your salad with beef brisket.
-Thank you.

655
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:20,932
This looks so good.

656
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,167
Very, very.

657
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,068
SALAD WITH BEEF BRISKET

658
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:24,669
"Very, very."

659
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,438
-Here you go for now.
-Thanks.

660
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:27,639
-Just in case.
-Sure.

661
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,141
I can't wait to taste this.

662
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:31,176
It's the ciabatta
they spent 14 hours making.

663
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:35,547
I'll try it.

664
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,649
I'll have some of this.

665
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,284
-Do you like bread?
-Yes.

666
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:40,752
YUMMY

667
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:41,853
-Is it good?
-Yes.

668
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,089
-It's warm.
-Those must be raisins.

669
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,792
-Those sticking out?
-It's really good.

670
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:52,197
YUMMY!

671
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:54,766
It's super soft.

672
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,768
I thought it'd be hard.

673
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:00,138
That's nice.

674
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:01,106
SQUID INK CIABATTA, FIVE STARS

675
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,175
-What's this?
-Here you go.

676
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:04,676
-Look!
-Is this the gem box?

677
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:08,280
Wow.

678
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:09,481
That's our sweet potato.

679
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:10,382
No way!

680
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,717
Wait. Hold on.

681
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,619
This can't be real.

682
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:15,787
WHAT'S INSIDE THE GEM BOX
THAT SHOCKED THEM BOTH?

683
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,423
JANG DO-YEON'S GEM BOX

684
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,058
GEM BOX TENDERLOIN STEAK

685
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,895
A SURPRISE MEANT ONLY FOR GEM NO. 1

686
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,465
IT'S… BLINDING

687
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,633
THE GEM BOX OWNER IS EMBARRASSED

688
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,669
GEM NO. 1

689
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:38,577
What does this mean?

690
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:41,813
Can I read into it?

691
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,216
-This is hilarious.
-Seriously.

692
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:46,651
What's annoying is that
our cheeks are flushed.

693
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:48,420
-Hold on.
-This is hilarious.

694
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,589
Doesn't this mother-of-pearl box
annoy you too?

695
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,657
THE FLASHIEST BOX EVER

696
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:54,659
Why did you make things awkward
between us?

697
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:56,328
This is hilarious.

698
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,764
How funny is this?

699
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:00,899
It's super annoying.

700
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:03,802
This is so funny.

701
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:06,137
FREEZE

702
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:08,340
OUT COMES THE CAMERA-SHY CELEBRITY

703
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:09,508
Isn't the steak too good for this?

704
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:10,942
SHE FREEZES AGAIN

705
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,245
This premium steak…

706
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:14,212
FREEZING FOR THE 3RD TIME

707
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:18,350
THE PHOTOS TAKEN BY THE NO. 1 GEM

708
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:21,253
Look at this cherry
next to this premium steak.

709
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:23,755
-It's so cute.
-This annoys me so much.

710
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:26,424
-It saying "tenderloin" gets me too.
-I know.

711
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:28,360
This is so cute.

712
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:29,561
Gosh, hold on.

713
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,363
How hilarious is that?

714
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:33,932
I feel like someone just proposed to me.

715
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:36,902
-Seok Cheon's gem boxes use the same font.
-I know.

716
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:37,836
Seriously.

717
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:39,671
That's what makes it annoying!

718
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,540
Jeez, I hate its guts!

719
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,810
It's been getting really hot today.

720
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,346
What an event. It's the best.

721
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:50,749
I'll try this beef brisket salad now.

722
00:25:58,189 --> 00:25:59,224
It's so good.

723
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,259
CAN'T HELP HUMMING AT THE TASTE

724
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:04,963
Hey, this must be our pasta.

725
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,699
I'm getting Halloween vibes.

726
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:09,234
This is crabs on a rock.

727
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:13,004
The pasta tastes best
if you chop up the balloon bread

728
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,907
with these scissors
and mix it all together.

729
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:18,476
As for the steak,
take it out using the tongs.

730
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:20,078
Hold on. Let me just…

731
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:21,680
-There.
-You may eat everything in there.

732
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,381
Everything's edible,

733
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:25,850
-so you can even eat the flowers.
-Thank you.

734
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:27,919
-Even the flowers?
-Are these edible?

735
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:28,853
THE GARNISH IS COMPLETELY EDIBLE

736
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,921
No way.

737
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:31,690
-This…
-Try some of that.

738
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,125
-Should I eat what's on top?
-Sounds good.

739
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:38,129
I ALMOST FORGOT

740
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,631
Are you doing ASMR for us?

741
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,342
SUPER CRISPY

742
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:55,914
CRUNCHY

743
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:56,982
It's like a snack.

744
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,290
This is new. I guess it explains
why it's called crabs on a rock.

745
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:07,692
Crabs on a rock, is it?

746
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:08,827
That must be it.

747
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:12,464
Are you someone
who orders the same thing every time,

748
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,865
or do you try new things?

749
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:15,667
I try new things.

750
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,103
-Even things you haven't tried?
-Yes.

751
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,237
I love trying new things,

752
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,906
and I can't resist ordering
whatever has a peculiar name.

753
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,076
-It's a good thing we ordered this.
-Right.

754
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,178
I think it'll be fun hanging out with you.

755
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,481
It's like this.

756
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:30,749
Can I read into that?

757
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,785
-No, just take it as it is.
-Okay.

758
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:36,354
PFFT…

759
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,824
The way you react so enthusiastically

760
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:43,294
makes me feel like I'm having a good time,

761
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:48,199
even though we're not doing
anything special.

762
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:51,569
Earlier, for example, you kept reacting
to the things you were seeing.

763
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:52,771
That's so cute.

764
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,239
How cute is that?

765
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:55,473
Yes, of course.

766
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,108
It made me feel good as well.

767
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:00,111
I usually express how I'm feeling.

768
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:03,248
-That's great.
-That includes what I don't like as well.

769
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:04,783
How?

770
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,252
I don't think you'd be
very direct about it.

771
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:08,286
I am direct.

772
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,121
Do you say you hate it?

773
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,222
"No!" Like this.

774
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,558
SHE'S DIRECT ABOUT THE THINGS SHE HATES

775
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:16,428
Still, I try to be non-offensive
when I say it.

776
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:18,697
"I can't say I like this right now."

777
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:20,498
Do you get it?

778
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:23,134
If it were written down,
it would have flower drawings all over it.

779
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,036
-I get that.
-Even if the words are harsh.

780
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:30,041
I also try to be nice about it
when I'm saying something bad.

781
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:34,079
Exactly. That might be why the way I speak
sounds more elegant now.

782
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:35,213
"I'm not really into that."

783
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,215
That does sound elegant.

784
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:38,883
Isn't that less offensive?

785
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,419
That's true. Actually, it feels odd.

786
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:43,188
-Really?
-It's like I can't be angry with you.

787
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:44,889
How should we eat this steak?

788
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:46,324
-Why don't we take it out?
-Sure.

789
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,927
My gosh. Look at what was under it.

790
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:49,828
Pebbles.

791
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:53,665
They probably put them on the bottom
to keep the food warm.

792
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,200
-No way.
-Like the <i>ondol</i> system.

793
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,268
Do you think there's a ring inside it?

794
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,206
What kind of ring are we talking about?

795
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:02,107
Just mine.

796
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:03,541
HAHA

797
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:05,477
Why would you have put that there
of all places?

798
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:08,246
-I'll cut this for us.
-Thanks.

799
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:11,549
-It's been cooked perfectly.
-Dig in.

800
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:13,017
This is great. Join me.

801
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:15,787
Let's eat the steak while it's warm.

802
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:17,589
I'm starving.

803
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,259
I'll try the steak.

804
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,196
Thanks for the meal.

805
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,297
Thanks for the meal.

806
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,338
HEY!

807
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:42,313
It's so tender.

808
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:44,215
There's nothing to chew.

809
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:45,717
THERE'S NOTHING TO CHEW?

810
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,019
It's that tender. I mean, I did chew but…

811
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:49,788
HAHA

812
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:53,792
I only chewed to be polite.

813
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:55,860
I mean, it's that tender.

814
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,362
I could even chew on it with my tongue.

815
00:29:58,096 --> 00:29:59,197
Anyway, it's…

816
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:00,598
What's the matter with you?

817
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:02,600
It's really tender.

818
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:04,803
It's so tender.

819
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:07,372
Try it
and see if you don't say the same thing.

820
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:10,942
UHM!

821
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:12,343
Right?

822
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:14,579
Isn't it good?

823
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,715
-It's really tender.
-It melts in your mouth.

824
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:19,050
How is this even possible?

825
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:20,285
Sorry I doubted you.

826
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:22,654
-The pasta is really good too.
-Really?

827
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,289
-It's spicy but…
-Nice.

828
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,462
It's packed with ingredients.

829
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,399
-Does that mean it's tasty?
-It's really good.

830
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:38,603
This is so good.

831
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,671
-Isn't it good?
-It is.

832
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,176
There's a reason
she recommended it right away.

833
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:47,045
What if you had the chance

834
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:48,746
to host a show like this,

835
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:52,083
where there's only ever
one guest at a time?

836
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,685
Would you be open to it?

837
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:55,486
HMMM

838
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:57,021
Sounds like fun.

839
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:58,923
-Would we travel like this?
-Yes.

840
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,425
Then I think it'll be fun.

841
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:02,160
Let's say you got to host that show.

842
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:03,561
Who would you invite as your first guest?

843
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:06,798
Really?

844
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,266
Oh my.

845
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,068
Just make sure the offer
goes through my agency.

846
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:11,269
Sorry about that.

847
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:12,470
Who else?

848
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:13,838
Additionally,

849
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:15,907
Jonathan would be a good choice.

850
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:17,175
-Jonathan?
-Yes.

851
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,111
Did working on shows together
bring you two closer?

852
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:21,412
It did.

853
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:22,914
We're only in contact to a certain extent.

854
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,783
What do you mean by that?

855
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:29,621
After the quota is met,
there is no more contact.

856
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:31,389
-On my side.
-On your side?

857
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,826
KARINA, TEXT ME BACK, WILL YOU?

858
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,227
I don't want us to get too close.

859
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:37,662
I kind of saw that coming but…

860
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,999
If you want to date him…
Sorry, travel with him--

861
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,100
Date him?

862
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,534
No, not dating. Sorry about that.

863
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,136
Wanting to travel with him

864
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:46,871
-must mean you two click.
-We do.

865
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:48,673
He's so sweet

866
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:50,775
and exceptionally funny.

867
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:51,910
He's good on shows too.

868
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:53,444
I know. He can entertain.

869
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:56,047
He has a way
of making anyone feel comfortable.

870
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:58,349
And after Jonathan?

871
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,486
I'd love to travel with Ryujin.

872
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:04,856
If you agree to host the show,

873
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,026
everyone will want to be on it.

874
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,094
-Really?
-Of course!

875
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:12,297
I don't really come across

876
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:14,299
-as that kind or sweet.
-You?

877
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:16,534
That's insane. What are you talking about?

878
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,102
What do you consider kind?

879
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:20,505
-I meant, the way I look.
-Exactly.

880
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:22,607
-Puppy-faced, maybe?
-Yes, puppy-faced.

881
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,409
-Like a softie?
-Someone cheerful.

882
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,477
Someone who looks like this.

883
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,547
Are there any celebrities
you are close to?

884
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:32,317
Not many.

885
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:34,285
I guess I'm still close

886
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,355
to the people I did comedy shows with.

887
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:39,357
I have thought this at times.

888
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,225
After a brief interaction with someone,

889
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:44,963
I wonder if I missed my chance
to get closer to them.

890
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:46,431
That thought hits me sometimes.

891
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:48,866
If I don't want to end up regretting it,

892
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,769
I should express myself a bit more.

893
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:53,972
I've always admired
how open you are with people.

894
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:57,008
I'm only open and honest
with certain people.

895
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:58,710
Really?

896
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:00,244
LOVE YA

897
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,083
That's not a wink you see every day.

898
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,819
A Y2K-VIBE WINK WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN A WHILE

899
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:11,422
You were born in the 2000s, right?

900
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:13,791
Yes, on the nose.

901
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:15,393
-It doesn't seem that way.
-I was born in 2000.

902
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,761
-You seem about my age.
-I'm not.

903
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,796
What year were you born in?

904
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:20,398
Me? 1985.

905
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:21,966
We're 15 years apart.

906
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:23,201
A 15-YEAR AGE GAP!

907
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,204
No way.

908
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:29,874
It's fun to realize
our conversations don't feel weird,

909
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:31,909
even though
you're 15 years younger than me.

910
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:33,344
HEH HEH

911
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,247
What did I just see?

912
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,683
What was that just now?

913
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,617
-I'm just happy.
-Were you posing for a photo?

914
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,885
You were happy? Sorry about that.

915
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:43,454
Anyway, hearing that KARINA is happy

916
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,522
makes me feel at ease.

917
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:48,359
FAINTING

918
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:50,495
The only "Ri-na" in my life
used to be Chae Ri-na.

919
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:52,363
I love it.

920
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:55,099
Now that we've finished dinner,

921
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,601
we'll head to our hotel.

922
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:58,136
CLAPPING

923
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,104
When we get to the hotel,

924
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:03,074
something surprising
will be waiting for us.

925
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,276
-Good.
-Great.

926
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,145
Why don't we close it?

927
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:08,713
Sounds good to me.

928
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,714
SQUEAK

929
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:11,949
Seal it.

930
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,918
Bury it in the ground.

931
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,053
Burn it.

932
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,421
GEM NO. 1 HAS BEEN SEALED
INSIDE THE GEM BOX

933
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:17,989
It's gotten chillier.

934
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:20,024
This is my favorite kind of weather.

935
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:21,292
OFF TO THE HOTEL!

936
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,496
Now that you mentioned it,
I'm noticing how cute all the signs are.

937
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,999
-Right?
-They're all so adorable.

938
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,500
They're super cute.

939
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,437
You seem to think
almost everything is cute.

940
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:34,872
People have told me
I find odd things cute.

941
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,141
-You're similar in that way.
-Exactly.

942
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,210
-"Butchered for You."
-"Butchered for You."

943
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:41,546
IT FITS THEIR TASTE

944
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:43,815
That's so cute. It's called Gomo.

945
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:45,316
-Gomo!
-Yimo!

946
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:46,417
Gomo!

947
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:49,554
What other than Idong <i>galbi</i>
is famous in Pocheon, sir?

948
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,255
Our <i>makgeolli</i>.

949
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:52,356
-<i>Makgeolli</i>?
-<i>Makgeolli</i>?

950
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:54,425
Sounds delicious.

951
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:56,427
-That sounds good.
-They say unrefined <i>makgeolli</i>

952
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:59,263
mixed with honey is good for digestion.

953
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:02,633
-Unrefined <i>makgeolli</i> mixed with honey?
-Unrefined <i>makgeolli</i> mixed with honey.

954
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,702
-<i>Makgeolli </i>mixed with honey.
-That sounds delicious.

955
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:07,505
They're already selling <i>bungeoppang</i>.

956
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:09,607
No way. <i>Bungeoppang </i>is the best.

957
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:11,209
Do you like it with custard cream
or red bean paste?

958
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,344
Red bean paste all the way.
What about you?

959
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:17,115
I can't choose. I'm always torn.

960
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:18,483
Custard cream is tasty too.

961
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:20,051
We're here.

962
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,221
Nice.

963
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,255
A HOTEL WHERE THEY WILL REST

964
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:25,389
I'll see you in a bit.

965
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:28,059
Jang Do-yeon!

966
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,393
I'm lonely.

967
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,262
What do you say to a girls' night with me?

968
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:33,731
THE YOUNGER ONE IS WAITING
FOR THE OLDER ONE

969
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,000
WHEN IS SHE GETTING HERE?

970
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,870
PLAYING WITH THE CAMERA

971
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,676
I'm excited.

972
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:47,111
Knock, knock.

973
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:48,479
Can I come in?

974
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,414
Of course.

975
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:52,650
Excuse me, then.

976
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:56,854
TA-DA

977
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:58,523
I see you changed.

978
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:00,825
Wow!

979
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:02,160
SHE CAME PREPARED FOR THEIR GIRLS' NIGHT

980
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:03,895
This is a lot.

981
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:06,364
ECSTATIC

982
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,766
All right. Try to guess what I have here.

983
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:11,869
It seems easy to me.

984
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:13,004
-What is it?
-Or maybe not.

985
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,672
-Isn't it BBQ's golden fried chicken?
-It is.

986
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,775
A DISTINCTIVE SCENT

987
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,177
Nice!

988
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,213
BBQ's golden fried chicken
is one of the best.

989
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,814
Sweet.

990
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:25,416
And this is…

991
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:26,817
DAZZLING

992
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:30,054
No way. This is…

993
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:33,257
If it were the end of the world

994
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:37,461
and I could only eat or drink one thing,
it'd be this.

995
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:40,097
We got you some beer.

996
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:41,766
-Wow!
-Also…

997
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:42,900
IT'S BEER!

998
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:44,468
There's also this.

999
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,904
-This has been trending.
-It's been trending these days.

1000
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:48,606
-Let's find some names.
-The Kancho hunt.

1001
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:52,210
Next, we'll try the recipe
the taxi driver shared with us.

1002
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:55,813
-Pocheon <i>makgeolli </i>and honey.
-How did you get this? No way.

1003
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,914
I can't believe it.

1004
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,817
-You guys are the best.
-They are.

1005
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,719
-It's what we mentioned earlier.
-What's that?

1006
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:04,889
The king of all street foods, <i>bungeoppang</i>.

1007
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:07,892
-Is it from the stand we saw?
-Yes.

1008
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,460
There you go.

1009
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:10,795
Thank you so much.

1010
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:12,530
-It's a feast.
-Right?

1011
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,832
-Why don't I… Just a second.
-What is it?

1012
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,400
I have a gift for you.

1013
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:19,570
-Stop it.
-But…

1014
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:20,638
Thanks.

1015
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,506
-Sorry.
-It says KARINA on it.

1016
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,542
-Isn't it cute?
-Was it customized just for you?

1017
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:26,377
-It was a gift.
-Was it?

1018
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:28,246
Let me see.

1019
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:29,680
HEH HEH

1020
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,183
-Close your eyes.
-Got it.

1021
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:34,819
I can see you in the mirror.

1022
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:35,753
Where? Oh no!

1023
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:39,690
Please close your eyes.

1024
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:40,658
Got it.

1025
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:42,927
QUIETLY

1026
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:43,828
SHE SPOILED IT BY MAKING A NOISE

1027
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:44,862
-What?
-Damn.

1028
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:47,965
Any hints?

1029
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:52,036
THE SOUND SHE MAKES WITH THEM
IS A DEAD GIVEAWAY

1030
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:55,106
"Can you spare some change?"

1031
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:57,675
-Can I open my eyes?
-Sure.

1032
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,678
They're adorable!

1033
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:02,079
No way.

1034
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:04,215
-They're <i>makgeolli</i> bowls.
-Did you know we'd be drinking <i>makgeolli</i>?

1035
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,516
I had no idea.

1036
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:06,484
How did you know to bring them?

1037
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:10,388
I saw these at Young-ji's place
and thought they were great.

1038
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,790
They turned out to be perfect
as mini bowls

1039
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:14,292
or for drinks.

1040
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:15,226
Really?

1041
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,362
So I brought these for you.

1042
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:20,431
What would you like first?

1043
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:22,466
-Let's drink first,
-Sounds good to me.

1044
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:24,802
-and then have that.
-Sure thing.

1045
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:27,271
This is how a lot of cans open these days.

1046
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:28,806
This is like draft beer.

1047
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:30,441
Apparently, this stays fizzier longer
than most beer.

1048
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:34,045
-I had a blast.
-I had a blast.

1049
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:40,384
RECHARGING WITH FRESHNESS

1050
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:43,954
RECHARGING WITH FRESHNESS

1051
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,656
I couldn't be happier.

1052
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:48,793
-Let's have some chicken while it's warm.
-Sounds good.

1053
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,762
I'll enjoy this.
Do you have a favorite chicken cut?

1054
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:53,597
Drumsticks and wings, for sure.

1055
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,001
We're in for a huge battle.

1056
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:00,271
Since there are two drumsticks
and two wings,

1057
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,139
-we'll start with those.
-We'll share evenly.

1058
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:05,009
THEY EACH GRAB A DRUMSTICK

1059
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:07,912
It's actually more polite
to let the guest have both drumsticks,

1060
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:12,216
but I figured you'd let me have one
since you're sweet.

1061
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:13,317
Would you like another one?

1062
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:14,752
-No, go ahead.
-Thanks.

1063
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:15,820
Let's just have one each.

1064
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:17,588
LET'S JUST HAVE ONE EACH

1065
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:19,223
-We'll each have one.
-What a relief.

1066
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,124
Phew.

1067
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:27,264
YUMMY!

1068
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:30,801
I love it.
The seasoning tastes just right.

1069
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,603
It's not too salty.

1070
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,172
-But it's not bland either.
-It's not bland.

1071
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,441
I usually have radish
when the chicken is underseasoned,

1072
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,076
but not with this.

1073
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:40,811
-Are you their brand ambassador?
-What?

1074
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:43,280
No, but I wish I were.

1075
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:46,884
SHE'S NOT THEIR BRAND AMBASSADOR,
BUT SHE WANTS TO BE

1076
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:48,185
Do you think I'd get an offer
if I keep promoting it?

1077
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:49,186
It sounded rehearsed.

1078
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:51,322
It wasn't. There's nothing like that.

1079
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,423
I wish I were the brand ambassador.

1080
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:54,492
I'm open to negotiations.

1081
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:56,861
Are you getting this?

1082
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:58,596
Can you hear her?

1083
00:39:58,662 --> 00:39:59,830
-You fit the brand well.
-Really?

1084
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,132
I could totally dress up as a chicken.

1085
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:05,302
Let me show you

1086
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:07,438
just how neatly
Do-yeon eats fried chicken.

1087
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,441
Okay, let's try some fried chicken.

1088
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:12,243
I love fried chicken
more than anything else.

1089
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:13,778
What brand?

1090
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:16,247
Fried chicken? It's BBQ all the way.

1091
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:17,882
BBQ, Captain Q.

1092
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:21,585
-That would put people off.
-That makes no sense.

1093
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:23,421
Doesn't Captain Q mean
something else entirely?

1094
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:24,655
I don't know.
I just said what came to mind.

1095
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:29,760
It tastes divine.

1096
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:33,497
Just forget it.

1097
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:34,632
It won't happen for me.

1098
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,600
Come on, it's not impossible.

1099
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:39,437
It is.
Is there anything you'd like to advertise?

1100
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:41,205
Fried chicken?

1101
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:46,710
Little sis.

1102
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:48,646
Little sis, come on!

1103
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:51,182
Since you're already
the brand ambassador for this beer,

1104
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:53,384
you should let me have this one.

1105
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,820
I won't stand a chance

1106
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:58,689
if you try to snag the deal yourself.

1107
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:03,027
KARINA can be the main brand ambassador,

1108
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:04,395
and I'll join her

1109
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,230
at half my usual rate.

1110
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:09,233
Dressed up as a chicken?

1111
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,802
I'll sit in the back,
happily eating fried chicken

1112
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:14,238
like on a home shopping channel.

1113
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,873
Just think about it, okay?

1114
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,542
Ad folks, doesn't that sound
like a good idea?

1115
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:20,144
-It'll work.
-Exactly.

1116
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,312
Do-yeon can really eat.

1117
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,115
There's still meat on this bone.
I'll brush my teeth with it.

1118
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:26,116
What the…

1119
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,285
A FRANTIC ACT OF BRUSHING HER TEETH

1120
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:32,022
That's… I'd rather talk less with you.

1121
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:34,158
Little sis.

1122
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:37,094
This might lead to something,

1123
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,963
so I'm doing everything I can.

1124
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:41,499
Anyway…

1125
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:46,070
Here, have this too.
It's <i>bungeoppang</i> and walnut cakes.

1126
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:50,841
I heard that KARINA
often does AMAs with her family.

1127
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:53,611
-What's that?
-Why don't you try it with Do-yeon?

1128
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,412
Do you need an app?

1129
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:57,781
No, just the notes I saved.

1130
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:58,682
Here it is.

1131
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:00,951
It's like this.

1132
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,987
I found this list of questions,

1133
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:05,389
and I asked my family to answer them.

1134
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:06,924
-Did you…
-It was more fun than I expected.

1135
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:08,459
-Do you keep that on your phone?
-Yes.

1136
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,728
I update the list every year.

1137
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:12,029
FAMILY AMA GETS UPDATED EVERY YEAR

1138
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:14,064
Do you use it to get to know each other?

1139
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:17,935
I'll start with
what I'm most curious about.

1140
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:19,303
Favorite scent?

1141
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:20,938
-Scent?
-Scent.

1142
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:22,640
Something that isn't too sweet.

1143
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,809
Oh, here's one.
If I had to choose a well-known scent,

1144
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,145
-I'd go with something woody.
-I see.

1145
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:30,748
-It suits you.
-I think that's what I prefer.

1146
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:33,918
If not that,
I usually go for natural scents.

1147
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:35,920
Like the smell of fabric softener?

1148
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:36,987
I love that.

1149
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,056
The smell of fresh laundry.
What about you?

1150
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:40,591
I like the smell of grass.

1151
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:43,561
I think I prefer scents

1152
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:46,297
that aren't overly sweet or heavy.

1153
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,065
This is fun.

1154
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:53,103
-This is hypothetical.
-I love those.

1155
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:55,539
-What if you were reborn?
-Reborn?

1156
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:57,775
What are you asking?

1157
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:59,410
What do I want to be reborn as?

1158
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:01,011
Yes, what do you want to be reborn as?

1159
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:02,780
Have you ever thought about it?

1160
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,583
I'd like to live as a man.

1161
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:09,019
-Why?
-Because it'd be completely different.

1162
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,322
-You never experienced it.
-Exactly.

1163
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:13,991
My mom said

1164
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:17,695
she'd like to be our mom again.

1165
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,029
SHE WANTED TO BE REBORN
AS THEIR MOM AGAIN

1166
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,298
My sister

1167
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:23,200
wants to be reborn in a country
with great welfare.

1168
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:29,640
You might end up with a sister
from Northern Europe.

1169
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:31,809
My dad wants to be an athlete.

1170
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:34,545
MY DAD WANTS TO BE AN ATHLETE

1171
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,547
I'm not interested in being a man,

1172
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:40,451
but if I were born a woman again,
I'd want a strong build.

1173
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:43,988
-The world is a scary place.
-It is.

1174
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:45,856
That's one of the reasons.

1175
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:49,960
I'll be a strong-built woman
who's a gifted athlete.

1176
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:51,962
That's so cool.

1177
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,966
What if you had a time machine?

1178
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,701
A time machine?

1179
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:59,336
I don't want to go back
to any time in my life.

1180
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:00,971
I also said that I didn't want
to go back in time.

1181
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:02,473
Same here. I don't need a time machine.

1182
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:03,707
My mom said she'd go back

1183
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:05,075
to when Tesla's stock price skyrocketed.

1184
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:07,878
HAHA

1185
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:10,581
Could we perhaps invite her over?

1186
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:12,416
What else?

1187
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:15,352
If you were a writer,
what would you want to write about?

1188
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:16,620
If I were a writer?

1189
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:19,289
I'd write a bizarre, unorthodox novel.

1190
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:20,991
I wouldn't write about myself at all.

1191
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:23,193
-So, total fiction?
-Yes. What about you?

1192
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,095
I want to write poetry.

1193
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,232
Have you tried writing any?

1194
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:29,767
I love to write,

1195
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:33,604
but more in terms of handwriting
than creative writing.

1196
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,206
-Do you like copying text by hand?
-Yes.

1197
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:37,474
I have a notebook.

1198
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:38,709
FROM UNAIRED FOOTAGE
ON THE YOUTUBE CHANNEL TEO

1199
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:40,177
That's so cool.

1200
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:42,713
I love the analog feel,

1201
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,116
and I'm already on my fourth notebook.

1202
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:49,286
Once I got into it,
I realized it was so much fun.

1203
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,488
I'd love to read it sometime.

1204
00:44:51,555 --> 00:44:52,823
Your poems, I mean.

1205
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:54,692
WE MAY ONE DAY BE GREETED
BY POET YOO JI-MIN

1206
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:57,761
If you were a movie director,
what kind of movie would you make?

1207
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:02,299
A story about a couple

1208
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,168
that is petty

1209
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:05,969
and filled with desperation.

1210
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:08,072
-Then…
-Like…

1211
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:10,174
-A bar?
-No.

1212
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:11,809
-A bar?
-What?

1213
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:14,344
-I thought you said "bar."
-I see.

1214
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:16,647
-Oh, a bar?
-You didn't mean anything.

1215
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:19,349
I thought you wanted it set in a bar.

1216
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:21,385
-Me too.
-And I figured that was possible.

1217
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,287
Has that been entertaining so far?

1218
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:24,421
It's fun.

1219
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:26,957
-You don't really talk about these things.
-Right?

1220
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:29,059
They can be pretty embarrassing to answer.

1221
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:32,196
The question about what kind of movie
I want to make came out of nowhere.

1222
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:34,832
This has also been trending.

1223
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:36,133
What's that?

1224
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,570
We're like a group of 40-somethings

1225
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:41,004
-trying to act young.
-It's like this.

1226
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:43,006
"This is what kids do these days."

1227
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,608
"Guys, let's try what's trending."

1228
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:46,310
-What's that?
-Oh, this.

1229
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:47,978
<i>The Book of Answers</i>.

1230
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:52,216
"It's best to ask
one fully-formed question at a time."

1231
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:55,853
"Stop moving your finger
when you're ready for the answer."

1232
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:59,089
"Open to the page
where your finger stopped,

1233
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:01,892
and you'll have your answer."

1234
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:05,629
Want to try it?

1235
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:09,800
Here goes.

1236
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:13,604
Will there be a second date with Do-yeon
after we wrap up this trip?

1237
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:18,008
WHAT WILL THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION BE?

1238
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:23,714
WHAT WAS IT?

1239
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:25,549
<i>Do-yeon, this is shocking.</i>

1240
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:26,917
DO-YEON, THIS IS SHOCKING

1241
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:30,254
<i>Everything we did was for nothing.</i>

1242
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,421
<i>Do-yeon!</i>

1243
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:33,457
WHAT SHATTERED THEIR PEACE?

1244
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:36,226
AND NOW!

1245
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:37,694
YOUNG KARINA

1246
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:39,363
AND SEMI-YOUNG MILLENNIAL DO-YEON

1247
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:41,398
STUDY THE RECENT TRENDS WITH JANGDOBARI

1248
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,200
THEY TAKE ON THE KANCHO NAME HUNT

1249
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:46,470
BUT THEY GET TOO BUSY EATING SNACKS

1250
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:47,805
Who's worse to travel with?

1251
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:50,374
A minimalist who packs nothing
and borrows everything from me.

1252
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,376
Oh no, do you have a foaming cleanser?

1253
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:53,710
-Can I borrow yours?
-Sure, go ahead.

1254
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:54,611
Thanks.

1255
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:56,013
Do you have fresh underwear I can borrow?

1256
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,515
DO-YEON, THAT'S GOING WAY TOO FAR

1257
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:00,017
<i>Wait, where are we?</i>

1258
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:01,118
THE COMEDY SKITS CONTINUE, EVEN OUTDOORS

1259
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:03,887
Year 1925?

1260
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:04,955
Is anyone here?

1261
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:06,256
Today, at the marketplace…

1262
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,392
Do-yeon's too good at this.

1263
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:10,527
How am I supposed to match her level?

1264
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:14,398
How will KARINA enter the door
to the secret garden?

1265
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:18,502
I can't go out there!

1266
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:21,171
-It's okay.
-I can't do it.

1267
00:47:21,238 --> 00:47:22,372
It's all right.

1268
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:24,274
This is the series finale, you see.

1269
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,643
What will my final day look like tomorrow?

1270
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:29,146
THROUGHOUT THE TRIP

1271
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:31,548
DO-YEON SEEMED SAD
AT THE THOUGHT OF SAYING GOODBYE

1272
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:33,884
I'm glad my last trip on this show
was with you.

1273
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:35,285
SHE TRIED HARD
TO HOLD BACK THE TEARS BUT…

1274
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,920
Oh no, she's crying for real.

1275
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:38,121
I'm being silly.

1276
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,458
-You did great, Do-yeon.
-I'm so sorry about this.

1277
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:45,128
If only this had taken off
like <i>Squid Game</i>.

1278
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,998
I'm so sorry I'm not like Lee Jung-jae.

1279
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:49,066
GOODBYE, JANGDOBARI

1280
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:51,134
