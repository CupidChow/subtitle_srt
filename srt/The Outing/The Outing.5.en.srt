1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,280
- Which one?
- Is it good?

2
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:12,800
- Nalin.
- What?

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,960
Can I borrow your power bank?

4
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:16,440
Did you forget to bring it again?

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,800
Okay. I'll get it.

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,719
Hang on. I need to talk to you.

7
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,039
Are you enjoying the trip?

8
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:39,840
I guess so.

9
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:41,679
And have you been

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,799
talking to Sky and Atra?

11
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,320
A bit. Why?

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,159
Nothing really. It's good

13
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:52,719
you guys are good friends.

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,840
Dad, what's the matter?
Just tell me.

15
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:02,759
Sky already has a girlfriend.

16
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,519
Be careful with what you're doing.

17
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:08,519
I don't want Mesa
to overthink things, understand?

18
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,519
Besides, it'll make you look bad.

19
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:12,599
Look bad?

20
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,959
You slept
with a married woman before.

21
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:17,239
Didn't you go
to their wedding as well?

22
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:19,400
It's you who should
be careful, not me.

23
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,080
(The Outing)

24
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:33,000
Are we taking all of them?

25
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,319
Leave it for the staff.

26
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:37,879
Hello.

27
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,159
Hello.

28
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,919
- Do you mind helping us?
- Not at all.

29
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,039
Here's the key.

30
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,439
It's beautiful here.

31
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,439
- Whoa.
- Hello, everyone.

32
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:53,599
- Oh?
- Oh?

33
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:54,719
- Hi.
- Hi.

34
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,560
You're here too?

35
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,919
- Hey!
- Here so soon!

36
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,039
- I just got here.
- Hi.

37
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,879
Thank you very much.

38
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,879
Do you have any tips
on how to handle teenagers?

39
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,680
What's wrong?

40
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,120
I don't know.

41
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,680
It took me ages
to drag her out of the house.

42
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,000
Come on. That's how teenagers are.

43
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,759
Why would you be stressed?

44
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,920
Let's check out the golf course.
Don't overthink it.

45
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,480
- The course here is beautiful.
- Really?

46
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,800
Quite so.

47
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,560
Oh, hi!

48
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,000
- Hi.
- Hey.

49
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,360
- We'll go up to our rooms.
- Come on.

50
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,800
See you at the stable.

51
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,480
Hey, Jane.

52
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:53,920
Here you go.
Three keys for your family.

53
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,680
For Lin and Apa too.

54
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,800
How is Apa getting here?

55
00:04:58,759 --> 00:04:59,920
She's driving herself.

56
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,319
Okay, okay.

57
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Uh...

58
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:06,240
Oh, have you received
the new work brief?

59
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,560
I sent an email to you last...

60
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,879
Work?

61
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,319
No,

62
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,680
I'm here to relax.

63
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,240
I'm taking a break from everything.

64
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,519
Is that really possible?

65
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,680
Of course.

66
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,639
Okay. Sure.

67
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:25,879
Just don't accuse me of rushing
when we're back.

68
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:28,079
Your whinging gives me a headache.

69
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,560
It's like talking to a man-child.

70
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,759
You're already starting?

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,439
Japanese tea. Try it.

72
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:44,439
- Is it good?
- Yes, it's nice.

73
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,759
Do you want it? I'll give you some.

74
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,959
I'm too lazy to brew it.

75
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,079
I'll brew some and bring it to you.

76
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,240
I'll pass.

77
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,639
Hello.

78
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,120
When did you get here?

79
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,639
I arrived a while ago.

80
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,959
Where's Pupha?

81
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,759
He's probably parking the car.

82
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:35,439
Mm.

83
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,079
Oh, Jane has the keys.

84
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,120
Mm.

85
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:03,199
Excuse me, Jane.

86
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,759
- Okay.
- Okay.

87
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
- Okay.
- Okay.

88
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,000
Is that everything from the car?

89
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,560
I checked. There's nothing left.

90
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,120
Is something missing?
I didn't take anything.

91
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,240
And why would you deflect the blame?

92
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:23,879
This was everything
Mesa left us at the company.

93
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:24,959
There's nothing more.

94
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,759
Okay.

95
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:28,959
That's fine.
Thank you very much, everyone.

96
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,639
If you want to drink beer or have
a cocktail, order with the hotel.

97
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,958
But you have to wait for the wine.

98
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,759
I have to keep it
for the execs first.

99
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,439
I'll let you know
once I've sorted everything out.

100
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,680
- Okay?
- Okay.

101
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:41,079
- Awesome.
- Okay.

102
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,319
Do you serve martinis?

103
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,639
What's the hurry?

104
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,399
One for me.

105
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,199
- Make it two, please.
- Of course.

106
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,000
Hey, scoot. I'm sitting with you.

107
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:06,839
Go and sit on that one.

108
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,759
No, it's too warm.

109
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,680
Have you been here awhile?

110
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:11,879
Mm.

111
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,680
Hm.

112
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,439
When are you going?

113
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:30,480
I don't know.
My dad keeps postponing.

114
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,440
Now I'm wondering
if we're out of money.

115
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,200
Right. I don't think so though.

116
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,799
The family probably misses
their daughter. She's pretty.

117
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,840
Stop talking nonsense.

118
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,799
Have the three sisters arrived?

119
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,840
Two are here. The other one's
coming with her boyfriend.

120
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,959
- Mm. That's quite a shock.
- Mm.

121
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,600
Who would've thought Ami would be
the first to find a boyfriend?

122
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,559
I thought it'd be Xena.

123
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,480
How did you find out it's Ami?

124
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,080
Mesa told me.

125
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,679
Oh. Haven't you guys broken up?

126
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,960
I'll give you a good kick. What are
you talking about? We're in love.

127
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,559
Mm.

128
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,679
Haven't you thought
about getting a boyfriend?

129
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,200
Your life might be
a little more colorful.

130
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,559
No.

131
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,799
Okay. Just don't complain.

132
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,320
Mesa, can I have a word with you?

133
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:41,559
Did you prepare a list?

134
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,080
I did.

135
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,960
Did you check it carefully?

136
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:49,320
Well, I did.
That's all of the stuff.

137
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,080
Huh? Is that your girlfriend?

138
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:57,840
That's the old version
before we added more days.

139
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:01,080
But I thought it'd be enough.

140
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,440
A lot of people would be
driving home on the final night.

141
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,320
I don't think
there will be much drinking.

142
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,480
You can't think like that.

143
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:10,079
You have to be prepared.

144
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,320
If there are some leftovers,
they can be saved for later.

145
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,799
But what if it's not enough?
Where are you going to find more?

146
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,240
Mesa, pay attention.
You're working on salary.

147
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,559
Jane's so strict.

148
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,200
And does your girlfriend
make mistakes often?

149
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:41,919
I don't know.

150
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,840
Are you okay?

151
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,360
I'll be fine.

152
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:53,480
I just didn't order enough wine.

153
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
Mm.

154
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,960
So what are you going to do?

155
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,440
I don't have to do anything.

156
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:02,559
Jane's handled everything.

157
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,440
She called me over
just to tell me off.

158
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,159
Mm.

159
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:09,240
So does that mean you're free now?

160
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,240
Why?

161
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,960
Let's go for a swim.

162
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,039
Sky!

163
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,159
It's soaking wet.

164
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,840
Well, you don't have
to use it anymore!

165
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,240
We're just going for a swim!

166
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,720
Why are you smacking me?

167
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:29,120
You and your pranks!

168
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,759
Peng, are you okay?

169
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,200
Will the guys
from the company be okay with it?

170
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,919
I haven't even started
the internship, and here I am.

171
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,159
No one's going to complain.

172
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,399
The people at
this company are lovely.

173
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:11,080
And you're a lovely kid.

174
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,360
You'll get along with everyone.

175
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:15,720
Trust me. I know it.

176
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:19,399
What is that? It's so outdated.

177
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,159
Should we do it this way?

178
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,200
You can wait for me here.

179
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,799
I'll text you
after the meeting's over

180
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,120
so we can go to the pool together.

181
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:35,559
It's okay. I'll go with you.

182
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,200
- No worries.
- Really?

183
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,639
I'm not nervous or anything.

184
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,840
I'll be fine.

185
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,440
- Sure.
- Mm.

186
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,559
You're the best.

187
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,639
Hey!

188
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,799
- You got it all over me.
- What? It's fine. Just a little.

189
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,080
One, two, three.

190
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,360
Another one? One, two, three.

191
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,000
All right. Take a look.

192
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
What do you think?

193
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,000
- I think so.
- Can I have a look too?

194
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:06,639
Let's go.

195
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,559
- Wisanu.
- Yes?

196
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,200
The guys are ready
for the meeting. Let's go.

197
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:11,279
Sure.

198
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,480
See you. Bye.

199
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,080
Hm?

200
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,559
- Oh? Hi.
- Hi.

201
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,840
- Hello.
- They're ready for the meeting.

202
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,360
- Okay. We'll catch up with you.
- Sure.

203
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:32,799
Let's go.

204
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,440
- Hi.
- Hello.

205
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,039
Guys, this is Peng.

206
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:40,960
He's going to do
an internship at our company.

207
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,600
- I thought it'd be wetter.
- Hi.

208
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,720
- Anyway, I'll be at the meeting.
- Sure.

209
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,840
- I have to go.
- Okay.

210
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,159
You don't look wet.

211
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,039
Come here.

212
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:52,879
- Me?
- Yes, you.

213
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yes? What's the matter?

214
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,559
What are you
going to say to him, Chess?

215
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,159
Do you want to be on the same team?

216
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,120
Bring us a crate of beer then.

217
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:03,720
- Of course.
- Don't bully him.

218
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,159
All right. I'll be right back.

219
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,559
Poor him.

220
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,679
A crate, right? Okay, okay.

221
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,720
Chess!

222
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:12,559
Why is there water in your mouth?

223
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,440
Hi.

224
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:24,759
About the lipstick storyboard,
do you want to revise it yourself?

225
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,120
The client gave us some comments.

226
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,000
But I can tell the creative director
to do the first revision

227
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,879
because you said you wanted
to revise the end of the concept.

228
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,159
Seriously,

229
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,320
do you have time to relax?

230
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,320
It's not like that.

231
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,240
The company's in-between phases.

232
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,279
If I don't do it and there's
a problem, I'll be in trouble.

233
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,759
Or if you're not up to the job,

234
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:47,000
I can find a replacement director.

235
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,519
Whoa.

236
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,759
That's such an insult.

237
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,879
Exactly. Didn't I see you through?

238
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,398
I can't even imagine
the mess we'd be in

239
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,840
if you ended up working for O-Brief.

240
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:01,159
Yes, I am the best.

241
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,279
But it's not certain. Highly paid
jobs are always interesting.

242
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,279
Stay with us. Don't leave yet.

243
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:08,679
You're buying my whole life
with that measly salary?

244
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,679
We've been talking

245
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,320
about the company's growth.

246
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,600
The salaries will increase,

247
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,960
plus extra leave.

248
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,600
Besides,

249
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,399
I don't want to lose
my top employee.

250
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:29,039
So Mesa didn't order
more of the stuff?

251
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:31,559
No, she didn't.

252
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,759
Give her some time. It's her
first time organizing a big event.

253
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,600
This is actually the worst.

254
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,159
She's totally neglectful.

255
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,840
She always makes mistakes.

256
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,440
She went even more off the rails
since she got a boyfriend.

257
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:47,879
It's probably not that bad.

258
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,399
Should we make a bet?

259
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,639
A bet?

260
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:52,840
If she makes a mistake
because of personal matters,

261
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,279
you'll give me a three-month bonus.

262
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:00,720
That bad, huh?

263
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,879
Ugh.

264
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:09,759
- Hey, Chess.
- What?

265
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:13,080
- I'm hungry. I'm getting out.
- Sure. Get lost.

266
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,320
- Go on.
- Get lost!

267
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:17,320
Do you want to come with us?

268
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,960
I'll wait for Apa.

269
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:23,720
Have you and Apa been together long?

270
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,840
It's been a while now.

271
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:30,159
That's right.

272
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,879
And do you think...

273
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,639
What?

274
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,080
You're...

275
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:39,200
Just stay out of it!

276
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,960
You jerk, it's just a question!
What's wrong with that?

277
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,759
You're such a busybody
in everything, Uma.

278
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,879
Moron.

279
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,320
Get out of here.

280
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,039
Did you come?

281
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,079
I might go and have some wine
with Pupha and the others.

282
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:27,799
Do you want to come?

283
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,680
I'll go and drink
with the employees then.

284
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,079
Sure.

285
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,960
But don't get too drunk, okay?

286
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,720
I don't really mind kids.

287
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,200
Do you want to dip it?

288
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,920
Did you watch it?

289
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:12,680
Guys.

290
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,640
This is Peng. He's a newcomer
at our department.

291
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,400
And this is Wisanu from marketing.

292
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:22,359
And these guys probably
already know each other.

293
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:26,480
Hey, chill out. Why did you do that?
It's all casual here.

294
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:28,200
You don't have to be too respectful.

295
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,480
We're friends here.

296
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,359
Isn't that a little too much, Chess?

297
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:33,599
Who raised him?

298
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:35,319
I ordered it.

299
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,200
Hey, you're almost out.

300
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,079
I'll pass.

301
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,480
You've had a lot. Aren't you drunk?

302
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:40,799
No, I don't think so.

303
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,799
I asked
because I'm going to drink it.

304
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:47,680
Mm. Hey.

305
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,799
That's a lot.
Drink water if you're thirsty.

306
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,199
- A little bit more.
- That's enough.

307
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,519
- Just a little sip.
- Enough.

308
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:54,519
One sip.

309
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,480
Okay. That's refreshing.

310
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:04,759
Are you crazy?

311
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:07,400
- What is this? Pork?
- Give me some.

312
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,079
Try it.

313
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:10,079
Oh?

314
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,680
You can just ask nicely.

315
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,519
- And you'll give it to me if I do?
- Hey.

316
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,319
Give me another piece then.

317
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,519
Great.

318
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:19,519
Here.

319
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,079
Shake first.

320
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,920
Shake. Come on, doggy.

321
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,400
Aw!

322
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:32,880
Aw, little doggy!

323
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,079
Hey, I'm older than you.

324
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:37,079
Is he?

325
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,960
No idea. I forgot.

326
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,400
That one.

327
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:44,640
That's it. Great.

328
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,680
- Help yourself.
- Thank you.

329
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,920
Would you like a drink?

330
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,079
Oh, I'll pass.

331
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,519
Eat up. I'll serve you.

332
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:03,079
Can I have some?

333
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,200
- Nice.
- I want to get drunk too.

334
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,000
Thanks.

335
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,680
Is it good? You keep eating it.

336
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:22,319
- No one else is.
- Try it.

337
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,440
- I'm full.
- I want to know

338
00:21:23,441 --> 00:21:24,559
if you think it's good. Let me know.

339
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,640
Oh, Mesa.

340
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,000
Have you finished
dealing with tomorrow?

341
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,319
I haven't.
I plan to do it tomorrow morning.

342
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,680
What if there's an accident
and you can't do it in time?

343
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:40,000
I've checked with the resort.

344
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,759
There shouldn't be a problem.

345
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,799
Okay. And have you prepared
mosquito repellant for everyone?

346
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,880
I've put it on the main table.

347
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,559
And I've already posted
a photo of it in the group.

348
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,759
Hey, I'm bored. I want to
go swimming. Do you want to come?

349
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,000
No, I'm sick of your face.

350
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:04,559
Useless.

351
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,759
- I'll come with you.
- Useful.

352
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:11,519
- Aren't you coming?
- Go ahead. We'll catch up.

353
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:13,200
Okay. After you.

354
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:17,559
I have to go to the bathroom.

355
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:21,240
Bangkok?

356
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:22,359
Have you gotten it?

357
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,920
But tomorrow, I...

358
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,440
Do you want this one?

359
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:26,640
Not fair.

360
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,319
Can I join you?

361
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,319
Come on in.

362
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:39,519
- Ah.
- Let's have fun.

363
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:41,319
Water polo, anyone?

364
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,319
Good idea. Get more people.
Then we can make teams.

365
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,440
Sure thing.

366
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:49,119
Peng, can you text the group?

367
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,240
Okay.

368
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,119
I need to get the ball first.

369
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,880
It's nice and cool.

370
00:22:58,359 --> 00:22:59,640
I guess he's enjoying himself.

371
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,559
Oh? Mesa,

372
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:07,799
come and play in the pool with us.

373
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,519
No, I don't feel like it right now.

374
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,880
Did you get
into an argument with Jane?

375
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,119
She was being so harsh.
I don't know what's wrong with her.

376
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,079
I'm here for a vacation too.

377
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,440
It's okay.

378
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,359
Should I keep you company?

379
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,359
It's okay. You should go.

380
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,079
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

381
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:35,119
Okay.

382
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,319
I'll get going now.
I have to keep working.

383
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,880
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

384
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,880
- Bye.
- Make sure you rest.

385
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,319
Bye.

386
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,880
Sky.

387
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:49,119
Yes?

388
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,319
Go!

389
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:52,440
Quickly!

390
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:54,359
Keep swimming!

391
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,440
Peng!

392
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,680
Catch!

393
00:23:56,681 --> 00:23:57,880
- Over there!
- Hey, Sky!

394
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,359
- Here it comes.
- Hey!

395
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,680
Catch it!

396
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,240
Catch it!

397
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:06,240
Go and grab it!

398
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,319
Don't touch me!

399
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,799
Don't touch me! Catch!

400
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,440
Argh!

401
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:11,680
Keep going!

402
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:14,359
Hey, come on!

403
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,440
Go long!

404
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:16,559
- Goal?
- Yes!

405
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:19,200
Throw it!

406
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,759
Throw it over!

407
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,559
Watch out!

408
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,440
Catch the ball!

409
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,440
Catch it!

410
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:27,519
Hey!

411
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,240
Peng!

412
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:03,680
Hey, come and drink with us.

413
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:05,559
Can I?

414
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,799
For sure. Why?

415
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,880
I don't want to be a bother.

416
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,319
What bother?

417
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:14,000
It's free booze
paid for by the company.

418
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:15,640
Where is it?

419
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
The main tent. Just come along.

420
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:20,119
Okay.

421
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,000
- See you there.
- See you.

422
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,279
There you go.

423
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:49,359
These are nice.

424
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,839
I know, right?

425
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,000
Here.

426
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:57,759
Oh?

427
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,519
What's the hurry?

428
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:02,240
Your clothes are wet.

429
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:03,960
I thought you guys were
going into the pool again.

430
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,640
What? No.

431
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,000
It's freezing.

432
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,599
I'll get you a change of clothes.

433
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:13,359
What a good guy.

434
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,359
- Do you mind if I sit down?
- Not at all.

435
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,640
Where is everyone?

436
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:24,720
Peng,

437
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:26,640
no need to be nervous.

438
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,519
Just have fun.

439
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,599
I'm only asking for one thing.

440
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,599
Don't talk about the company
somewhere else.

441
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,400
Especially not about
the products or presenters.

442
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:37,359
You can't leak the info, understand?

443
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,480
I do.

444
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,119
- Do you want some?
- Just a small one, please.

445
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,720
Here.

446
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,039
These will fit.
You can change in my tent.

447
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,640
But don't forget to close the tent.
There's a lot of mosquitoes around.

448
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,240
Understood.

449
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,000
This is comfy, Nu.

450
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,039
Jane, can you call Uma
and the others over?

451
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:04,000
- Sure.
- Mm.

452
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,759
We don't have to wait anymore.
Isn't that right, Jane?

453
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,000
- Sure.
- Here's your glass.

454
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:14,240
Double nines!

455
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,400
Four.

456
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:17,359
- Hurry up.
- Come on, slowpoke.

457
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,359
Two!

458
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,599
There! Attaboy!

459
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,960
Awesome.

460
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,039
You're fixing the cards again.

461
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,519
- Cream, drink up.
- Did you guys have a deal?

462
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:28,359
He always gets to drink.

463
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:29,839
For sure.

464
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,240
- Hang on.
- Peng,

465
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:36,400
have you ever auditioned
for a commercial at my company?

466
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,279
Yes.

467
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:43,480
I knew it.
I thought you looked familiar.

468
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,000
But I didn't get the job.

469
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:49,519
You got through quite a bit though.
I saw it in the PPM file.

470
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,119
There's no need to be alarmed.

471
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,960
She's crazy.
She remembers nonsensical stuff

472
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:57,759
but nothing she's supposed to.

473
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:00,000
Hey, calm down. Get me some soda.

474
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:03,000
But we don't have an opener.

475
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:04,880
Open it with your eye.

476
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,880
That's wild.

477
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,640
Here we are.

478
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,039
I brought her over.

479
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,759
Oh, Xena?

480
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:15,839
Did your dad allow you to come?

481
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:17,839
Of course.

482
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,240
He's not going to
deduct your salary.

483
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:22,960
Right on.

484
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,240
Hey.

485
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,440
- All right. Have a seat.
- Sit here. I'll scoot over.

486
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,359
(Apa)

487
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:54,119
Hello?

488
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,119
I'm sorry.

489
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,440
I'm in Chess's tent.

490
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:10,440
Sure. I'm really sorry.

491
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:14,880
Okay.

492
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,200
Be careful.

493
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:00,279
- Do you want a photo, Sky?
- Sure.

494
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,200
- Come on.
- Mm.

495
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,480
Oh?

496
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,559
Are you done getting ready?

497
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,119
- Just about.
- What took you so long?

498
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,799
It's difficult to put on.

499
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:12,559
Wear it properly.

500
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:14,920
So you won't get hurt
if the horse kicks you.

501
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,559
It's going to kick you.

502
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,279
What? I'm actually
worried about you.

503
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,920
And now you're sulking?

504
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,920
Sulking?

505
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:27,559
I'm your friend.

506
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,640
Okay.

507
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:35,640
Oh?

508
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:37,480
Are you done packing up?

509
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,480
Mm.

510
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,599
Do you want to ride a horse?

511
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:43,880
I'm worried we might be late.

512
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,799
We won't be. One lap around.

513
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,920
I'll pass. You go ahead.

514
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,359
Okay. Let's go.

515
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,920
Come on.

516
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:56,599
- Come on!
- Hey!

517
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,039
Take one for the team.

518
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,480
Don't tense up.

519
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:07,039
- It's a bit scary.
- Watch your feet.

520
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:09,079
Just keep yourself steady.

521
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,799
Giddyup.

522
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:12,640
Awesome.

523
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:13,799
It's so cute.

524
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,200
Put your hands here.

525
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:16,960
Okay, okay.

526
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:18,160
It's quite fun.

527
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,200
- Was it okay?
- Yes, it was nice.

528
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:21,599
Hey.

529
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,319
Just a second.
I'll take a photo of you.

530
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,799
Don't bite.

531
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,480
- Is this all right?
- Very pretty.

532
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:28,920
- Don't bite.
- That's so beautiful.

533
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,680
You're really not
going to give it a go?

534
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,319
No, you keep going.

535
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,240
Another round?

536
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,880
Sure.

537
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,480
Ugh.

538
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,359
Your shoes look like
they were made for hiking, Chess.

539
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,359
- Oh, shoot!
- Hey, hey!

540
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,640
You moron.

541
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,079
What are you hauling?
Tell Uma to help share the load.

542
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,039
- Uma!
- It's okay. I can carry it.

543
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,200
No problem.

544
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,640
Hand it over.

545
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:29,519
Come on. Give it to me.

546
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:32,079
- Give it to me.
- Okay.

547
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,640
I'll help you.

548
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,880
Wow, how kind of you.

549
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,160
- Care to carry mine too?
- Shut it, Nu.

550
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,960
If you can't carry it,
put it down here.

551
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,359
You can pick it up on the way back.

552
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,759
That's a double standard.

553
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:48,279
You didn't wake me up this morning.

554
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,039
Says who?

555
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:51,399
You hogged my bed
and wouldn't wake up

556
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,160
no matter how hard I tried, you brat.

557
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:56,920
You guys are tough.
How could you still go for a run?

558
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,960
Aren't you hungover?

559
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,839
I didn't have
too much to drink, did I?

560
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,400
How so? You always
had a glass in your hand.

561
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:06,519
There's actually a trick to it.

562
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,640
Try booze mixed with water

563
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,519
or alternate drinking the two.

564
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,160
It works for me.

565
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:15,079
Understand that, kid?

566
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,839
I see. Sure.

567
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,839
I'll try that.

568
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:20,799
And...

569
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,160
sorry about last night.

570
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,400
No worries.

571
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,720
Just watch my back if I'm drunk.

572
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,200
Sure.

573
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,960
What did you bring?
It's so freaking heavy.

574
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,519
Are you crazy?

575
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,599
It's much harder
to talk to Sky than it used to.

576
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:49,400
Is there a problem
in your family too, Sirin?

577
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,720
No, there's no problem.

578
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:55,160
Except for Ami. It's hard
to know what she's thinking.

579
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,720
Tara, stay single.

580
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:01,920
Solitude is the best.

581
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,920
You only have stepchildren.

582
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:06,200
That's enough headaches as it is.

583
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,599
Tons of women out there, but he
ended up falling for his employee.

584
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,280
You too, Apa. Be careful.

585
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,280
You'll go crazy
if Peng strays out of line.

586
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:27,360
Are you leaving now?

587
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:32,159
Yes. I have an online call in a bit.
I need to be on standby.

588
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,400
Mm. Good luck. I hope you get it.

589
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:36,519
Thanks.

590
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,480
- Taking a break?
- Yes, Let's go first.

591
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,599
You've got stamina.

592
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,599
- Here.
- Thank you.

593
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:41,159
Are you okay?

594
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:42,719
Of course.

595
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,360
Good.

596
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,599
Can I ask you something?

597
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,400
Tara?

598
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,719
Are you okay?

599
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,039
I'm okay.

600
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:46,039
How's Tara?

601
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,599
What do you mean by that?

602
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:52,719
I don't know.

603
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:54,280
She looked stern.

604
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:55,960
It's as if she doesn't like me much.

605
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,119
You know Apa is trans, don't you?

606
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:11,159
Of course.

607
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,119
Those two nearly got married.

608
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,119
Stay still. Don't get up yet.
I'll go and get help.

609
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:48,039
Wait.

610
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,679
Don't tell anyone just yet.

611
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:50,880
Let me know if you need my help.

612
00:41:53,604 --> 00:41:54,483
Apa,

613
00:41:55,443 --> 00:41:57,244
you almost married Tara, didn't you?

614
00:41:57,923 --> 00:42:01,204
I didn't know she was coming
to the outing as well.

615
00:42:01,724 --> 00:42:03,604
I don't have a problem with her,

616
00:42:04,244 --> 00:42:05,604
but I don't know
how to act around her.

617
00:42:05,724 --> 00:42:07,204
I'll probably quit my internship too.

618
00:42:10,124 --> 00:42:11,403
Are you mad at me?
