1
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,839
I think I'm going to resign.

2
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:19,480
Don't tell anyone just yet.

3
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:23,800
Why not?

4
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,000
Hm...

5
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:28,839
Well,

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,560
because I think

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,320
Cholly had a point.

8
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:41,159
It's true I got to work here

9
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:44,560
because of your help, Ami.

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,840
But it has nothing to do with
whether you're doing a good job.

11
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:55,039
I guess not.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,399
But in the end,

13
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,520
I still can't get away
from the gossip

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,599
about me seeing the boss's daughter.

15
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,719
So what should I do then?

16
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,879
I'm not asking you to do anything.

17
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,719
I'm just telling you

18
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,480
I think I'd feel better

19
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:27,439
if I got a job somewhere instead.

20
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:33,560
By the look of things,
you're probably right.

21
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,599
I guess you don't want
to be with me anymore.

22
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,640
What's wrong?

23
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,400
Hm?

24
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,879
Who did you kiss last night?

25
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,800
Why the silence?

26
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,639
Who did you kiss last night?

27
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,919
Answer me.

28
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,800
Why are you treating me like this?

29
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:13,800
When did I upset you
or make you angry?

30
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,000
Why don't you just
be direct and tell me?

31
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,800
Do you know

32
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:24,919
how much I love you?

33
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,080
I never thought of cheating on you.

34
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,439
And you know

35
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,000
I really hate people like that.

36
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,360
Well...

37
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,319
I...

38
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,280
Is it because I wouldn't
let you sleep with me?

39
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,159
We can go and do that now then.

40
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,960
It's not like that, Ami. Calm down.

41
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,039
Huh. Calm down?

42
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,199
How can I calm down?

43
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,439
Do you know what's so funny about it?

44
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,480
You still haven't

45
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:25,319
even apologized.

46
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,720
Here's a refill.

47
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,759
Okay.

48
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,160
Thank you.

49
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:58,480
The food is the same
as when we were in Spain.

50
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,879
Sure.

51
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,600
Isn't Wisanu coming for dinner?

52
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,519
Excuse me.

53
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,800
I need to talk to you.

54
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,079
Right now?

55
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,800
Mm.

56
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:48,840
What's the matter?

57
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:53,679
It was super uncomfortable just now.

58
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,440
Have you gotten it on with Wiz?

59
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:00,279
I saw you guys kissing last night.

60
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:05,519
What?

61
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,519
Why are you making that face?

62
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,000
Tell me. I'm just curious.

63
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,840
I don't really mind either way.

64
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:18,440
Well, didn't you tell me back then

65
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,159
you didn't have feelings for Wiz?

66
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,919
But you ended up
keeping him for yourself...

67
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Xena.

68
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,600
And has Ami

69
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,799
found out...

70
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:37,000
her sister secretly slept
with her boyfriend?

71
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:38,519
Can you shut up now?

72
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:43,000
Shut up?

73
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:45,679
Now you're asking me to shut up.

74
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:48,879
Watch your mouth.

75
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,519
I asked if you liked him back then,
and you insisted you didn't.

76
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,120
I told you all my secrets
about how crazy I was for him,

77
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,759
so is this what I deserve?

78
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,519
You're so...

79
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,159
Xena,

80
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,759
you have to stop thinking
you're the center of the universe.

81
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,759
And you have to stop
being so full of yourself.

82
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,879
Even if you're going to seduce him...

83
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,840
No.

84
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,360
You already have.

85
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,039
Then you probably know full well

86
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,279
he doesn't want you.

87
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,080
And that's right.

88
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:33,039
I got it on with him.

89
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:35,000
Is that what you want to hear?

90
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:48,440
Oh, it's you two.

91
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:59,039
Did you have a lot of fun?

92
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:05,799
What's wrong with you?

93
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,840
You're my sisters.

94
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,159
You know that,

95
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,799
but you did it anyway.

96
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,080
Atra.

97
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:45,039
You should've known this
more than anyone.

98
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:50,399
How could you do this to me?

99
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:54,639
You're my sister.

100
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:56,519
You are.

101
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,039
And have you two forgotten?

102
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,399
Mom left us

103
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:06,240
because of something
disgusting like this.

104
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,000
Dad never had enough
and always slept around.

105
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,320
That's why our family is so broken.

106
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:46,720
Are you okay, Ami?

107
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,360
I heard everything.

108
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:06,759
There, there.

109
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,000
It's okay.

110
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,519
It's okay.

111
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,080
How come

112
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,000
you're still putting up with my dad?

113
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,840
There are a lot of things

114
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,320
that can make two people
who are in love hurt each other.

115
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,159
You think you know them.

116
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:54,480
But they become
someone else in the end anyway.

117
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,960
It probably depends on luck too.

118
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,200
You're lucky
if you find a decent person.

119
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:03,200
But it's not like that
most of the time.

120
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,758
But I don't want you to think
so negatively that

121
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,200
close yourself off.

122
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:14,879
Wasn't it nice when you were happy?

123
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:27,559
I'm not so sure anymore
which part of the past was true.

124
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:33,519
If it really depends on luck,

125
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,159
then I must be so unlucky.

126
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,279
I can't even trust my family.

127
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,120
I know you're angry right now.

128
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,879
But family is still
important no matter what.

129
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,600
What's the point of having

130
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,080
this kind of family?

131
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:00,080
Shouldn't we try

132
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:02,960
to give them a chance?

133
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,000
In the end, apart from yourself,

134
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,759
it's your family
who knows you the best.

135
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,279
And if it ends up
being too much to handle,

136
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,759
then we'll figure it out.

137
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,000
In any case, love yourself a lot.

138
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,559
This too shall pass.

139
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,920
And you'll be even stronger.

140
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:49,640
Pupha,

141
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,319
what do you think love feels like?

142
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,240
You'll feel it if you're in love.

143
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,759
Why haven't I felt it?

144
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,359
Let's do it this way.

145
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,079
How do you feel about your family?

146
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,920
About your dad,
Sirin, or your sisters?

147
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,519
Hey.

148
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,519
Don't you love anyone?

149
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:31,160
It's not like that.

150
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,680
There are many different forms
of love, aren't there?

151
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,480
Like if I love you, then I do.

152
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,279
But I want to find out

153
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,920
what romantic love is.

154
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:53,960
Romantic love?

155
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,960
My answer still stands.

156
00:18:57,799 --> 00:18:59,400
You'll feel it if you're in love.

157
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,480
You'd want to treat someone nicely

158
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,200
and take care of them.

159
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,119
Is sex relevant?

160
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,119
It is.

161
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:20,720
Love comes first.

162
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,799
Then everything will follow.

163
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:30,319
But people don't have
to be in love to have sex.

164
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,680
That's true.

165
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,640
I won't argue.

166
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:41,799
But making love
and just having sex is different.

167
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,039
And what if right now,

168
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,200
you were in love with someone

169
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:53,839
but stopped loving them.

170
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:56,200
Would sex be any different?

171
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,960
I don't know.

172
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:05,680
Are you in love
with Cholly as always?

173
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,319
And she's still
in love with you, isn't she?

174
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:21,279
No idea.

175
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,759
How come?

176
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:31,359
Things probably changed

177
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,119
after being together for a while.

178
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,079
But you were quick to say

179
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,000
you're still in love with her.

180
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,279
You're such a good person.

181
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,039
If I want to have
a boyfriend someday,

182
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,599
I want him to be like you.

183
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:16,079
Dad?

184
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,759
Xena, come here.

185
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,720
- Come on!
- Sky?

186
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:33,799
It's time to go!

187
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:36,720
Let go of me!

188
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:39,640
- Let go! You're hurting me!
- Keep it down!

189
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:42,160
- Can you leave me alone?
- Xena!

190
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,720
Just stop acting so crazy!

191
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:47,279
Do you realize what you've done?

192
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,720
It's serious.

193
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,960
What's going to happen to our family

194
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:55,200
if other people find out?

195
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,759
Did you think about that?

196
00:23:58,759 --> 00:23:59,759
What's going on?

197
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,680
Do you still care
about our stupid family?

198
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:07,799
What's going on?

199
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,680
Huh?

200
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:37,039
Anan.

201
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,200
How could you do this to me?

202
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:47,240
That was my daughter.

203
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,839
Darn it.

204
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,960
That was my daughter!

205
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:04,319
Everything...

206
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:10,240
All of this is your fault.

207
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,279
You have to take responsibility.

208
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:23,119
Have you talked to Xena?

209
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:28,519
I've asked her.

210
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,240
She said she was fine,
but we know how she is.

211
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:37,960
But shouldn't the adult know

212
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,000
what's appropriate?

213
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:50,079
Who else knows about this?

214
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:56,119
Atra said

215
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,000
she and Sky saw Xena.

216
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,079
And what did Pupha say?

217
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,839
He's not making sense.

218
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,279
What are you going to do?

219
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,799
What do you think?

220
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,119
I think we should
take Xena to a doctor.

221
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:23,839
Everyone's in counseling nowadays.

222
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,759
As for Pupha, we'll probably
have to take action.

223
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,000
I wanted to accost him at first.

224
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:33,119
But if I did that,

225
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,519
Xena's reputation would be tarnished.

226
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:37,680
So I think

227
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:42,839
we should let things quiet down
before dealing with it ourselves.

228
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,279
So you're just going
to let things die down?

229
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,039
And what else do you want me to do?

230
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,000
If things die down,

231
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:55,519
Xena won't be seen negatively,

232
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,519
and the company will
be able to move forward.

233
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,759
It's up to you then.

234
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,720
Let me know if you need my help.

235
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,079
Can I say something?

236
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:24,079
It's not just Xena who has a problem.

237
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:53,519
I heard

238
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,160
a huge commotion just now.

239
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,640
Did something happen?

240
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,000
It was nothing.

241
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:13,200
Ami found out.

242
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:20,839
I'm sorry

243
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,519
for putting you through this.

244
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:27,880
It's not your fault, Atra.

245
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,519
It's mine.

246
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:36,519
Don't blame yourself.

247
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,960
And...

248
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,000
what are you going to do about Ami?

249
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,319
I still don't know.

250
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,839
We'll probably hate
each other's guts for a while.

251
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:10,519
Wiz,

252
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,480
if Ami wasn't in the picture,

253
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:19,680
could we date each other?

254
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,200
Well, I...

255
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:37,720
I have feelings for you.

256
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:46,119
But I don't think
a relationship is possible for us.

257
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,200
Love doesn't make
what we've done right.

258
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:55,359
Even now,

259
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:00,599
I don't know

260
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,720
how I should apologize
to you and Ami.

261
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,799
I really...

262
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:15,319
hate myself right now.

263
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,680
Then I guess you should hate me too.

264
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,279
Because I don't think

265
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,000
what we've done is wrong.

266
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,240
It's late.

267
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,319
Let's go to bed.

268
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:47,599
Mm.

269
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,359
How is Xena doing?

270
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:23,160
So,

271
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,319
what are you going to do about her?

272
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,480
I still don't know.

273
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,799
I guess

274
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,839
I'll have to talk to her first.

275
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:47,279
I'm actually worried about her.

276
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,839
- So I want to...
- Honestly,

277
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:52,480
I don't think
you have to do anything.

278
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,759
Xena probably didn't
give it much thought.

279
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:05,559
And you? How are you doing?

280
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,440
I'm okay.

281
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,079
I heard about you and...

282
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,440
Ami?

283
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,400
You don't have to worry about it.

284
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,840
She and I will figure things out.

285
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,840
We can't quit being sisters anyway.

286
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:42,599
I just want to talk.
I'm worried about all of you.

287
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,679
Do you understand? So I'm...

288
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,760
Dad,

289
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,519
I don't think...

290
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,800
you should be teaching us anything.

291
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,119
Shouldn't you spend your time

292
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,320
paying attention to Sirin instead?

293
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:00,559
I don't think

294
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:03,000
she'll be able to put up
with it much longer.

295
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,840
(The Cow - Are you free?
Come meet me.)

296
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:22,679
What do you want from Anan?

297
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,480
Nothing.

298
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,679
Do you love him?

299
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,599
I believe so.

300
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:36,800
For someone like you, I don't think
that's all you're looking for.

301
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,559
Everyone knows.

302
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,440
What are you going
to use as leverage?

303
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,719
Perhaps there are
other personal issues.

304
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:50,599
Something like Xena and Pupha?

305
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,719
What do you want?

306
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:58,480
I guess I want to be like you.

307
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,000
You can't be like me.

308
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:08,960
And you can stop thinking
about blackmailing my family.

309
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,719
But I know that
if you just speak out,

310
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,719
it's going to destroy my family.

311
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:24,639
That's why I came here
to ask you what you want

312
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:25,880
from what you're doing.

313
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:29,840
I know you're clever,

314
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,559
and I hope you're clever enough
to know what's good for you.

315
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:45,800
With connections that
someone at your level doesn't have,

316
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:50,159
I can destroy you in every way
wherever you go.

317
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,360
It's not simply about your desire
for Anan, is it?

318
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,039
Think about it.

319
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:23,400
The company has
to go on no matter what.

320
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,800
I can't let everything I built
be destroyed because of this.

321
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,039
So everything that's happened here

322
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,400
must be forgotten.

323
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:44,239
And what about your daughter?

324
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:48,880
I'll handle

325
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,199
my family.

326
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,599
About the company,

327
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:39,639
I'm okay if you want funding
from my family

328
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:41,599
because everything
is moving smoothly.

329
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:45,599
I'll step in and run the place
according to my duty.

330
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:48,000
There's no need to worry.

331
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,960
Can we talk about this later?

332
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,719
Let's not hurt each other again.

333
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,840
Should I tell the girls,
or are you going to tell them?

334
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,440
I'll do it.

335
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:53,199
I'll hire a lawyer after we get back.

336
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,679
Can I ride with you?

337
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:30,000
I don't want to go home
in the other car.

338
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,440
I was the one
who initiated things with Pupha.

339
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:49,159
But there's nothing bad about it.

340
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,039
It was just sex.

341
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,679
You probably understand.

342
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:06,519
So Mesa didn't order
more of the stuff?

343
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:09,119
No, she didn't.

344
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,480
Mesa, can I have a word with you?

345
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,559
Huh? Isn't that your girlfriend?

346
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:19,360
Give her some time. It's her
first time organizing a big event.

347
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,400
Come on. This is too much.

348
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,760
She's totally neglectful.

349
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,000
She's gone even more off the rails
since she got a boyfriend.

350
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:29,760
Mesa, pay attention.
You're on salary.
