1
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,440
Aren't you happy?

2
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,960
Of course, I am.

3
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:23,039
Why would you ask that?

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,079
Well, you don't look happy.

5
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:30,280
And how long

6
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,359
have you known about it?

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,200
I took a test.

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,200
But I wasn't sure,
so I took another one.

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,840
Are these test kits

10
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:47,920
accurate?

11
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,119
They are. Why?

12
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,799
Nothing. It's just...

13
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,320
You've already told people.
Things might get chaotic

14
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,399
if something happens.

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,320
So what do you want me to do?

16
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,400
This is between the two of us.

17
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,280
You should've told me first.

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,480
Got checked at a hospital
and then told the others.

19
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,120
Tee.

20
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,480
You're always avoiding the topic

21
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,400
whenever I mention it.

22
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,200
So what do you expect me to feel?

23
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,200
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:35,400
It's okay.

25
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,680
I'm sorry too.

26
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,519
But let's just forget it.

27
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,200
We've been waiting
for it for so long.

28
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,120
There's no need to care
about other people.

29
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,400
Mm.

30
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,800
(The Outing)

31
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,439
Sirin,

32
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,039
why did you let her
play golf with Anan?

33
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,319
You didn't know,
or are you pretending to be stupid?

34
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,599
Cholly!

35
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,800
Thanks so much
for worrying about me.

36
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,360
But you have to deal
with certain things

37
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:14,120
using your brain.

38
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,480
Let me handle
my private matters myself, Cholly.

39
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,560
I'm going up to my room.

40
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,800
Cholly,

41
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,680
what's wrong with you?

42
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,240
I'm fine.

43
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,000
So why would you mention that?

44
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,680
And was what I said wrong?

45
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,600
It's obvious Neree's
trying to steal Anan.

46
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,000
And I also know why Sirin
let her go and play golf with him.

47
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,800
But she can't use that method
to deal with those two.

48
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,240
If a fight broke out
between her and Anan,

49
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,000
what's going to happen
to our company?

50
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,240
But it's still none of our business.

51
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,160
We have to do what's best
for our family.

52
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:12,319
It has to be me
if no one else dares to speak up.

53
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,000
No one seems to like me anyway.

54
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,240
I don't care.

55
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,160
Don't overthink about it.

56
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,120
I'm not.

57
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,920
Just let it go.

58
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:26,319
We're on holiday. Let's go all in.

59
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,800
Grab the glass.
The bottle of wine is ready.

60
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Just a little.

61
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,120
- No.
- Only for a bit.

62
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,920
I should go.

63
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,680
Tara?

64
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,920
Are you okay?

65
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,160
I'm okay.

66
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,199
Hey, you're back.

67
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,399
Hey.

68
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,399
How was the golf course?

69
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,240
It's nice. The view's beautiful.

70
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,079
What about you? How was the trek?

71
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:12,120
Uh, it was beautiful.

72
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,480
But also exhausting.

73
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,279
I was going to come with you,

74
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,600
but Sirin asked me
to go in her place.

75
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,839
I wouldn't have gone
if she didn't ask.

76
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,759
I'd rather go with you guys.

77
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,079
And...

78
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,360
are you and Anan close?

79
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,600
I don't know if we are.

80
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,519
It's probably like you and Pupha.

81
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,959
Do you consider that close?

82
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,199
Is something the matter?

83
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,000
Nothing. I just wanted to tell you

84
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,399
to be a bit careful.

85
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,639
Be careful with what?

86
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,279
Well, Anan's a womanizer.

87
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,600
Don't worry, Uma.
I never get sloppy drunk.

88
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,879
But thank you for worrying about me.

89
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm going to shower.
Are you going to the party now?

90
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:16,000
Oh, I'm going to shower too.

91
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:17,959
I'll see you at the party.

92
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,079
Okay. See you.

93
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:38,000
Uh...

94
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,879
Can I have
two glasses of gin, please?

95
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,960
No problem.

96
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,639
Excuse me.

97
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,000
Has all of the wine
been sent to the party?

98
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,600
Oh, there's still some.
How would you like it?

99
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,480
I'll have a bottle.

100
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,879
Just a moment, please.

101
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,240
So? Are you enjoying it, Cream?

102
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,600
It's okay.

103
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,399
Just okay?

104
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,600
Yes.

105
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:18,600
Pupha's going to be sad
if he hears you say that.

106
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,200
He chose this place.

107
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,399
Here you are.

108
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,879
Two glasses for one?

109
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,759
One for Uma.

110
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,879
Good. So you won't get drunk.

111
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,480
Then you can stay up late.

112
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,759
I don't usually get drunk
that easily, not like that day.

113
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,000
I can remember what I've done
even if I'm drunk.

114
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,120
Here's your wine, sir.

115
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,159
(Pregnancy Test)

116
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,440
(Positive)

117
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:06,919
Tara?

118
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,559
- Who's there?
- It's me.

119
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:10,919
Come on in.

120
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,440
Hey, have you heard
the news about Ari?

121
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,720
What news?

122
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:19,039
Oh? We're about to have
an additional member to the family.

123
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,200
Ari's pregnant.

124
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:22,799
Huh?

125
00:10:23,135 --> 00:10:25,135
Have you told your parents?

126
00:10:26,255 --> 00:10:28,535
Not yet. I'll wait until
she sees the doctor.

127
00:10:28,655 --> 00:10:30,135
Then she can tell them herself.

128
00:10:33,614 --> 00:10:35,494
You're keen
on this baby, aren't you?

129
00:10:35,614 --> 00:10:37,734
Oh? Of course, I am.

130
00:10:37,854 --> 00:10:39,374
I'm keen on all of them.

131
00:10:39,535 --> 00:10:41,974
I'd be keen if
you were pregnant too.

132
00:10:42,854 --> 00:10:45,775
I should dig out Sky's cot
for the baby when I get back.

133
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,734
Anyway, I'm going.
I won't bother you anymore.

134
00:10:48,255 --> 00:10:49,255
Bye.

135
00:11:19,614 --> 00:11:21,255
Don't drink too much.

136
00:11:21,574 --> 00:11:22,935
You've been drinking all day.

137
00:11:25,214 --> 00:11:26,614
By the way, Pupha.

138
00:11:26,974 --> 00:11:28,494
Have you talked to Anan for me?

139
00:11:30,214 --> 00:11:31,454
I haven't.

140
00:11:31,574 --> 00:11:34,094
When are you going to?

141
00:11:34,734 --> 00:11:36,614
Why? Isn't the amount you've
been getting enough?

142
00:11:37,854 --> 00:11:39,135
No, it's not.

143
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,734
I'll give you more. It doesn't
have to involve the company.

144
00:11:44,734 --> 00:11:46,734
It's not just about the money.

145
00:11:47,214 --> 00:11:49,614
I want to have my own account too.

146
00:11:49,734 --> 00:11:52,974
Many of the clients you currently
have come from my contacts.

147
00:11:53,574 --> 00:11:56,974
I'm sick of being
the company's mascot.

148
00:11:58,374 --> 00:11:59,935
It's a difficult topic to discuss.

149
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:02,494
It won't be appropriate
if you just move.

150
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,494
I'm just a shareholder.

151
00:12:04,614 --> 00:12:06,374
I don't own the entire company.

152
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,694
Sirin doesn't seem to think so.

153
00:12:10,214 --> 00:12:13,614
Oh? She came in to invest.
It's not the same.

154
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:14,974
If you're not going to talk,

155
00:12:15,574 --> 00:12:17,694
I'll tell Anan myself.

156
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:19,935
You can try,

157
00:12:20,055 --> 00:12:21,854
but I don't think
Anan's going to be okay.

158
00:12:22,454 --> 00:12:23,454
Why not?

159
00:12:23,455 --> 00:12:26,854
He's not even okay with Sirin
coming in to run the business.

160
00:12:26,935 --> 00:12:30,094
And who are you?
Why would he care about you?

161
00:12:33,135 --> 00:12:34,135
Pupha,

162
00:12:34,974 --> 00:12:37,255
I'm not any stupider than Sirin.

163
00:12:38,094 --> 00:12:39,854
I'm also educated like she is.

164
00:12:40,614 --> 00:12:42,334
Can you stop using her
to make me feel inferior?

165
00:12:42,454 --> 00:12:44,454
Hang on. That's not my implication.

166
00:12:44,494 --> 00:12:46,334
You've always implied so.

167
00:12:46,454 --> 00:12:47,815
Have you ever realized

168
00:12:47,854 --> 00:12:49,694
that you always use her
to make me feel inferior?

169
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,854
Why? Is she your wife?

170
00:12:51,935 --> 00:12:53,854
Enough. That's going too far.

171
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:55,454
Do you have feelings for her?

172
00:12:56,614 --> 00:12:57,734
Hey.

173
00:12:58,255 --> 00:12:59,574
Take it easy.

174
00:13:00,574 --> 00:13:01,574
Huh?

175
00:13:02,094 --> 00:13:03,094
Why?

176
00:13:04,454 --> 00:13:05,454
Just say it.

177
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:08,694
How is she any better than me?

178
00:13:09,734 --> 00:13:11,214
Do you really want me to?
Will it be over if I say it?

179
00:13:11,334 --> 00:13:12,854
- Go ahead.
- Are you sure?

180
00:13:12,935 --> 00:13:14,214
Spit it out.

181
00:13:16,334 --> 00:13:18,974
If you'd behaved
appropriately like she does,

182
00:13:19,214 --> 00:13:20,935
we wouldn't be having this argument.

183
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:26,535
Thank You.

184
00:14:27,175 --> 00:14:30,734
As for the female category,
the award goes to...

185
00:14:31,055 --> 00:14:33,535
Cream!

186
00:14:34,775 --> 00:14:35,775
Excuse me.

187
00:14:36,454 --> 00:14:37,775
Is it okay if I say something?

188
00:14:37,895 --> 00:14:39,015
Uh...

189
00:14:39,055 --> 00:14:40,214
Sure.

190
00:14:41,015 --> 00:14:43,295
First of all,
congratulations to both of you.

191
00:14:43,374 --> 00:14:45,895
But I have a question.

192
00:14:46,374 --> 00:14:47,895
What are the selection criteria

193
00:14:48,895 --> 00:14:50,175
for Employee of the Year?

194
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:54,055
Work performance.

195
00:14:54,175 --> 00:14:56,775
Was the decision only made by you,

196
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:59,175
or were Pupha
and Taurus involved too?

197
00:14:59,214 --> 00:15:01,175
We discussed it among ourselves.

198
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:05,895
I understand we treat
each other like friends.

199
00:15:06,295 --> 00:15:07,655
Or family members.

200
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,895
But all of a sudden,

201
00:15:11,295 --> 00:15:12,614
I started to wonder
about the selection criteria.

202
00:15:13,734 --> 00:15:14,734
The thing is

203
00:15:15,295 --> 00:15:18,574
if the criteria are
to have slept with an executive,

204
00:15:19,055 --> 00:15:20,614
shouldn't Neree get it too?

205
00:15:20,734 --> 00:15:21,935
Chol.

206
00:15:24,895 --> 00:15:26,334
Mesa should get it too, right?

207
00:15:26,895 --> 00:15:28,655
She's dating someone in our family.

208
00:15:28,935 --> 00:15:29,935
Your son.

209
00:15:30,494 --> 00:15:31,734
Cholly.

210
00:15:36,454 --> 00:15:39,895
Shouldn't there be an Intern
of the Year award for Peng too?

211
00:15:43,895 --> 00:15:45,734
Oh, I forgot.

212
00:15:46,295 --> 00:15:47,295
Natee,

213
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:50,895
there should be an Executive
of the Year award as well.

214
00:15:52,454 --> 00:15:53,454
Cholly,

215
00:15:53,935 --> 00:15:55,374
go to your room. You're drunk.

216
00:15:56,614 --> 00:15:58,015
Hey!

217
00:15:58,614 --> 00:16:01,214
Don't stress, guys.

218
00:16:02,614 --> 00:16:03,734
Don't stress.

219
00:16:04,374 --> 00:16:05,614
Like I said,

220
00:16:05,655 --> 00:16:07,895
we're like a family here.

221
00:16:09,214 --> 00:16:11,574
We can be frank with each other.
Isn't that right?

222
00:16:26,175 --> 00:16:27,734
What on earth were you doing?

223
00:16:29,574 --> 00:16:31,135
I couldn't help it.

224
00:16:31,935 --> 00:16:33,255
Stop drinking already.

225
00:16:36,614 --> 00:16:38,135
- You're drunk, aren't you?
- What?

226
00:16:38,175 --> 00:16:39,815
Do I have to be drunk
to tell the truth?

227
00:16:40,614 --> 00:16:42,135
It doesn't affect you.

228
00:16:42,574 --> 00:16:43,574
Why would you be mad?

229
00:16:50,694 --> 00:16:52,295
You're back on drugs, aren't you?

230
00:16:55,935 --> 00:16:56,935
What are you doing?

231
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,815
What's this?

232
00:17:10,055 --> 00:17:11,934
Huh? What is this?

233
00:17:20,574 --> 00:17:22,374
You're going to rehab
when we get back.

234
00:17:31,735 --> 00:17:34,134
Do you think I did it
because I was high?

235
00:17:34,614 --> 00:17:35,614
Huh?

236
00:17:36,815 --> 00:17:38,055
Get out of here.

237
00:17:38,574 --> 00:17:39,614
What's the problem?

238
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,374
Let me tell you something.

239
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:46,455
Your rotten company has
nothing to do with my drugs.

240
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,495
You treat me like I'm an outsider.

241
00:17:48,574 --> 00:17:50,374
I don't care about the others.

242
00:17:50,455 --> 00:17:52,495
But it breaks my heart
when it's you.

243
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:53,614
Why?

244
00:17:53,815 --> 00:17:55,455
Aren't I family?

245
00:17:55,614 --> 00:17:57,295
I'm part of the company as well.

246
00:17:57,455 --> 00:18:00,574
Taurus brought Apa in to work
in a high-ranking position.

247
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:03,735
You also brought in Tara and Natee.

248
00:18:03,934 --> 00:18:06,015
But can't you even
give me an opportunity?

249
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:10,055
When you were
about to make an investment,

250
00:18:10,134 --> 00:18:13,374
I actually gave you
my family's money.

251
00:18:14,455 --> 00:18:15,695
Don't you remember?

252
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,934
Are you demanding gratitude from me?

253
00:18:19,735 --> 00:18:21,295
I didn't want any gratitude.

254
00:18:21,455 --> 00:18:24,495
I'm just asking
why you're treating me like this.

255
00:18:24,614 --> 00:18:25,614
Huh?

256
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,815
Let's not talk while you're drunk.

257
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:34,695
It's a waste of time.

258
00:18:36,134 --> 00:18:38,614
- Let go of me.
- I said I wasn't drunk.

259
00:18:40,894 --> 00:18:42,055
Come back here.

260
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:07,055
(Are you free? Let's meet.)

261
00:19:20,055 --> 00:19:21,055
Here.

262
00:19:25,295 --> 00:19:26,495
This is a disaster.

263
00:19:27,614 --> 00:19:29,894
How am I going to face
the others now?

264
00:19:32,815 --> 00:19:34,614
Don't overthink it, Cream.

265
00:19:34,735 --> 00:19:36,934
If nothing happened,
then that's the truth.

266
00:19:37,934 --> 00:19:40,614
It's easy for you to say.
But ultimately...

267
00:19:41,295 --> 00:19:43,455
I somehow ended up
as someone's mistress.

268
00:19:45,055 --> 00:19:47,495
I wouldn't mind
if he'd slept with me.

269
00:19:47,574 --> 00:19:49,015
But no.

270
00:19:49,174 --> 00:19:50,695
Did you see his face?

271
00:19:53,134 --> 00:19:54,374
So what are you going to do?

272
00:19:59,134 --> 00:20:00,614
I want to talk to him.

273
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:04,055
It's no use.

274
00:20:04,134 --> 00:20:05,735
Someone like Anan will

275
00:20:05,815 --> 00:20:09,574
always feign ignorance to get away
with things. You've seen it.

276
00:20:13,134 --> 00:20:14,815
I want to get back at him.

277
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:16,934
I'm so mad.

278
00:20:17,374 --> 00:20:18,735
It's no use.

279
00:20:19,015 --> 00:20:20,934
We're just ordinary employees.

280
00:20:21,374 --> 00:20:24,055
Besides, it's not really a big deal.

281
00:20:24,134 --> 00:20:25,134
It's just a rumor.

282
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:27,815
People will forget
if you do your job well.

283
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:30,055
But I can't forget it, Uma.

284
00:20:33,055 --> 00:20:34,374
I understand.

285
00:20:36,295 --> 00:20:37,815
But if you take action

286
00:20:37,934 --> 00:20:39,934
and there's a problem,

287
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:43,255
would you be able to handle
something catastrophic?

288
00:20:46,614 --> 00:20:48,775
Whose side are you on? His or mine?

289
00:20:48,894 --> 00:20:51,255
You say that
as if you don't know me.

290
00:20:51,735 --> 00:20:54,015
I'm telling you this
because I'm worried about you.

291
00:21:03,015 --> 00:21:04,134
So what are you going to do?

292
00:21:04,735 --> 00:21:06,374
I should go and talk to him.

293
00:21:32,614 --> 00:21:33,735
Spill the beans.

294
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,215
Aren't you going to do anything?

295
00:21:39,495 --> 00:21:40,654
And what do you want me to do?

296
00:21:40,894 --> 00:21:42,495
We did sleep together.

297
00:21:43,255 --> 00:21:45,255
It's normal.
There's nothing strange about it.

298
00:21:45,374 --> 00:21:47,374
The thing is, we didn't.

299
00:21:47,414 --> 00:21:48,414
That's right.

300
00:21:48,535 --> 00:21:50,975
If you insist. So what do you want?

301
00:21:51,854 --> 00:21:53,374
I'm not okay with everyone

302
00:21:53,735 --> 00:21:56,614
thinking I won the award
because I slept with you.

303
00:21:59,614 --> 00:22:01,374
Okay. Let's do it this way.

304
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:05,215
What if I did everything
as you asked?

305
00:22:06,255 --> 00:22:09,735
I tell everyone
we didn't sleep together.

306
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,735
The question is,

307
00:22:13,134 --> 00:22:15,255
who'd believe it?

308
00:22:16,374 --> 00:22:18,535
Isn't it better to just
let things quiet down?

309
00:22:20,094 --> 00:22:21,094
Okay?

310
00:22:21,854 --> 00:22:22,854
Great.

311
00:22:39,735 --> 00:22:40,894
Neree.

312
00:22:41,495 --> 00:22:43,334
- Yes?
- Are you going to Chess's tent?

313
00:22:43,735 --> 00:22:44,775
Oh, yes.

314
00:22:45,215 --> 00:22:46,535
I'm going too.

315
00:22:47,894 --> 00:22:49,614
And is Cream feeling okay?

316
00:22:50,134 --> 00:22:51,134
She is.

317
00:22:51,535 --> 00:22:52,614
You?

318
00:22:53,134 --> 00:22:54,134
Hm...

319
00:22:55,255 --> 00:22:56,775
So-so.

320
00:22:59,735 --> 00:23:03,015
Is what Cholly said true?

321
00:23:04,975 --> 00:23:06,374
What do you think?

322
00:23:10,495 --> 00:23:11,614
I don't know.

323
00:23:14,255 --> 00:23:16,735
Would you believe me
if I said it's true?

324
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,975
It's up to what each person thinks.

325
00:23:26,374 --> 00:23:28,854
I don't care what people might say.

326
00:23:29,654 --> 00:23:31,735
When something like this happens,

327
00:23:32,215 --> 00:23:35,495
I just think about
how I can benefit from it.

328
00:23:36,094 --> 00:23:39,255
Besides, I'm still on probation.

329
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:42,894
If I pass and people thought
it was because I slept with Anan,

330
00:23:43,374 --> 00:23:44,775
I wouldn't care.

331
00:23:45,015 --> 00:23:46,735
It's just gossip.

332
00:23:47,854 --> 00:23:49,134
But if I failed,

333
00:23:49,334 --> 00:23:51,735
I could use it as leverage.

334
00:23:52,894 --> 00:23:54,015
It's a win-win for me.

335
00:23:56,015 --> 00:23:57,414
How is that win-win?

336
00:23:58,495 --> 00:24:00,614
Don't you care
about your own dignity at all?

337
00:24:00,654 --> 00:24:02,255
No, I don't.

338
00:24:02,735 --> 00:24:04,015
Dignity can't feed me,

339
00:24:04,334 --> 00:24:05,775
and it can't be sold either.

340
00:24:06,735 --> 00:24:08,735
We're all here together

341
00:24:09,015 --> 00:24:10,735
because of work.

342
00:24:10,775 --> 00:24:12,735
There's no need
to be friends with anyone.

343
00:24:13,894 --> 00:24:16,134
Everyone has their own circle.

344
00:24:17,134 --> 00:24:21,094
I'm just choosing not to care
about my work circle. That's all.

345
00:24:24,775 --> 00:24:26,735
Tell Cream

346
00:24:27,735 --> 00:24:28,854
not to stress about the whole thing.

347
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,374
Just let it go.
People will eventually forget it.

348
00:24:34,535 --> 00:24:37,495
And you're just going
to let Anan get away with it?

349
00:24:38,975 --> 00:24:41,854
You don't have to mention
the money or the power he has.

350
00:24:42,134 --> 00:24:45,735
He's a man in our circle.
He's already gotten away with it.

351
00:24:46,374 --> 00:24:48,374
No one can do anything to him.

352
00:24:49,015 --> 00:24:50,815
He didn't rape me.

353
00:25:27,975 --> 00:25:29,735
You should go back to Apa.

354
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:37,174
I'm going to bed.

355
00:25:38,574 --> 00:25:39,854
See you later.

356
00:25:40,055 --> 00:25:41,055
See you.

357
00:26:56,975 --> 00:26:59,695
(Cholly)

358
00:27:02,134 --> 00:27:07,055
(Pupha)

359
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:19,495
(Pupha)

360
00:27:57,775 --> 00:28:00,374
Should we find time
to travel overseas together?

361
00:28:01,654 --> 00:28:02,894
I'll pay for everything.

362
00:28:05,495 --> 00:28:06,815
Your call.

363
00:28:08,535 --> 00:28:10,055
Don't you want to travel somewhere?

364
00:28:14,455 --> 00:28:15,495
Actually,

365
00:28:16,215 --> 00:28:18,055
I want to go to lots of places.

366
00:28:20,215 --> 00:28:21,735
But I'll let you choose.

367
00:28:23,614 --> 00:28:25,215
You'll be happier that way.

368
00:28:35,455 --> 00:28:38,455
You had a fight with Pupha
before the party, didn't you?

369
00:28:40,374 --> 00:28:41,775
Was it that obvious?

370
00:28:43,334 --> 00:28:45,174
You're a reasonable person.

371
00:28:45,735 --> 00:28:47,495
I'm sure you thought about it

372
00:28:48,174 --> 00:28:50,174
before causing a scene like that.

373
00:28:53,094 --> 00:28:55,015
But many people deserve an apology.

374
00:28:59,535 --> 00:29:01,094
Forget those people.

375
00:29:03,094 --> 00:29:05,055
Just do what's okay for you.

376
00:29:09,894 --> 00:29:11,215
Your feelings are

377
00:29:12,215 --> 00:29:13,614
the most important.

378
00:29:18,295 --> 00:29:20,295
It'd be nice if there was
someone who listened to me

379
00:29:20,414 --> 00:29:22,295
and understood me like you do.

380
00:29:24,735 --> 00:29:26,174
That's life.

381
00:29:27,174 --> 00:29:28,975
Not everything will turn out
the way you want.

382
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:30,535
Right?

383
00:29:48,934 --> 00:29:50,414
We haven't done it in ages.

384
00:29:53,654 --> 00:29:54,654
So?

385
00:29:55,735 --> 00:29:57,414
Am I still as good as always?

386
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:58,975
Yes.

387
00:29:59,775 --> 00:30:02,295
It even reminded me why we broke up.

388
00:30:02,854 --> 00:30:04,094
Biatch.

389
00:30:07,654 --> 00:30:08,735
Cream,

390
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:11,735
do you think
we can get back together?

391
00:30:11,775 --> 00:30:12,975
Impossible.

392
00:30:13,055 --> 00:30:14,934
- Aren't you going to stop to think?
- No.

393
00:30:14,975 --> 00:30:16,975
- Are you sure?
- Very.

394
00:30:17,735 --> 00:30:19,414
Right. I agree.

395
00:30:19,495 --> 00:30:21,854
I'd go crazy if I stayed with you.

396
00:30:22,414 --> 00:30:23,975
You're too prone to jealousy.

397
00:30:24,735 --> 00:30:27,094
I'd go crazy if I was with you too.

398
00:30:27,174 --> 00:30:31,174
Okay, you progressive,

399
00:30:31,735 --> 00:30:34,174
liberal lady who loves freedom.

400
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:36,215
You really love your freedom.

401
00:30:36,854 --> 00:30:39,735
We'll keep things this way.
A relationship's unnecessary.

402
00:30:40,414 --> 00:30:41,414
Mm.

403
00:30:42,295 --> 00:30:46,414
By "this way", do you mean
we'll keep sleeping together?

404
00:30:46,975 --> 00:30:47,975
Yes.

405
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:50,174
Sheesh.

406
00:30:50,735 --> 00:30:51,934
That's wild.

407
00:30:53,934 --> 00:30:54,975
You said it.

408
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,735
What? I know.

409
00:31:31,414 --> 00:31:32,414
Pupha?

410
00:31:33,094 --> 00:31:35,614
Why are you all alone?
Is something bothering you?

411
00:31:36,614 --> 00:31:37,614
Mm!

412
00:31:39,174 --> 00:31:41,535
It's nothing. I got bored,
so I came out for some beer.

413
00:31:44,414 --> 00:31:45,735
Where were you?

414
00:31:46,854 --> 00:31:48,414
I went for a toke.

415
00:31:49,414 --> 00:31:52,295
I didn't want to disturb Wisanu,
so I went a little further away.

416
00:31:56,535 --> 00:31:57,654
Right.

417
00:31:58,174 --> 00:31:59,775
- Yes?
- Have you seen Cholly?

418
00:32:01,174 --> 00:32:02,414
Hm.

419
00:32:03,055 --> 00:32:04,215
I don't think so.

420
00:32:07,735 --> 00:32:08,735
Is something the matter?

421
00:32:10,174 --> 00:32:11,174
No.

422
00:32:15,535 --> 00:32:17,614
All right. Drink with me.

423
00:32:18,735 --> 00:32:19,854
Thank you.

424
00:32:38,975 --> 00:32:40,295
Can I ask you something?

425
00:32:41,775 --> 00:32:42,975
Is it true

426
00:32:43,934 --> 00:32:45,295
about Cream?

427
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:49,775
Honestly,

428
00:32:50,654 --> 00:32:52,055
I don't think it is.

429
00:32:53,174 --> 00:32:54,174
Besides,

430
00:32:54,614 --> 00:32:57,735
she tells me everything.

431
00:33:01,975 --> 00:33:03,414
And how is she doing?

432
00:33:05,614 --> 00:33:07,775
She was fine
when we were drinking just now.

433
00:33:09,055 --> 00:33:10,055
I think

434
00:33:11,174 --> 00:33:12,614
she's tough to begin with.

435
00:33:14,735 --> 00:33:16,174
That's good.

436
00:33:16,735 --> 00:33:18,334
It's nothing.
I'm just worried about her.

437
00:33:19,295 --> 00:33:21,215
I feel sorry
she has to go through all this.

438
00:33:27,174 --> 00:33:28,174
Pupha,

439
00:33:28,414 --> 00:33:32,414
your team's hardcore. Don't worry.

440
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:35,455
- Mm.
- Cheers.

441
00:34:04,215 --> 00:34:06,055
There's a bit of white?

442
00:34:06,134 --> 00:34:07,854
All right. Here it is.

443
00:34:07,974 --> 00:34:09,854
(How did the Hor Mok get here?)

444
00:34:09,974 --> 00:34:12,054
Hor Mok?

445
00:34:12,615 --> 00:34:14,854
I've looked up
prenatal classes for you.

446
00:34:15,215 --> 00:34:16,534
Pick one.

447
00:34:18,334 --> 00:34:20,775
I've ordered a bunch
of parenting books too.

448
00:34:20,815 --> 00:34:21,974
Let's read them later.

449
00:34:25,255 --> 00:34:26,255
Mm.

450
00:34:41,815 --> 00:34:44,934
Natee, can you take me
to this shop tomorrow?

451
00:34:46,815 --> 00:34:49,295
They just renovated it.
It looks so lovely.

452
00:34:49,414 --> 00:34:50,735
I want to go and take photos.

453
00:34:50,815 --> 00:34:52,255
It's boring here.

454
00:34:53,615 --> 00:34:55,695
I'll ask Sirin and Cholly too.

455
00:34:56,615 --> 00:34:57,615
Mm.

456
00:35:06,255 --> 00:35:07,374
I think that's enough.

457
00:35:08,255 --> 00:35:09,255
Let's go to sleep.

458
00:35:09,815 --> 00:35:11,534
You have to drive tomorrow.

459
00:35:14,095 --> 00:35:15,374
Let me finish this one first.

460
00:35:24,894 --> 00:35:26,974
Should I ask Pupha and Tara too?

461
00:35:31,655 --> 00:35:32,815
Your call.

462
00:35:44,815 --> 00:35:46,534
Maybe it's time to stop smoking.

463
00:35:47,095 --> 00:35:48,534
It's not good for the baby.

464
00:35:52,095 --> 00:35:53,735
I'll quit after this pack.

465
00:36:47,695 --> 00:36:48,974
Did you go out for a drink?

466
00:36:50,494 --> 00:36:51,494
No.

467
00:36:51,934 --> 00:36:54,534
I couldn't sleep,
so I went for a walk.

468
00:37:00,255 --> 00:37:01,575
Pupha,

469
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:03,695
I'm sorry.

470
00:37:15,815 --> 00:37:17,775
Have you been back on drugs long?

471
00:37:19,775 --> 00:37:22,255
I only do it socially
when there's a party.

472
00:37:26,695 --> 00:37:29,775
Is it for fun,
or are you stressed about something?

473
00:37:32,974 --> 00:37:34,255
Pupha,

474
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:37,775
I can't be like everyone else.

475
00:37:39,414 --> 00:37:41,575
Can I ask you a favor?

476
00:37:42,815 --> 00:37:45,255
Please don't compare me to Sirin.

477
00:37:53,255 --> 00:37:55,255
I'm sorry
for making you uncomfortable.

478
00:38:03,334 --> 00:38:05,815
Right. How were the others?

479
00:38:09,054 --> 00:38:10,534
They were pretty bummed out.

480
00:38:11,695 --> 00:38:12,775
But just forget it.

481
00:38:14,534 --> 00:38:16,095
I ran into Chess last night.

482
00:38:18,894 --> 00:38:20,695
The kids picked up
where we left off.

483
00:38:22,894 --> 00:38:25,014
And how did you know about Cream?

484
00:38:25,575 --> 00:38:27,454
Honestly, I wasn't sure either.

485
00:38:27,575 --> 00:38:29,454
I heard the maids gossiping
a while back.

486
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:33,215
Do you want me to apologize to her?

487
00:38:33,255 --> 00:38:34,815
No need.

488
00:38:34,894 --> 00:38:36,334
It's all in the past now.

489
00:38:37,255 --> 00:38:39,775
Besides, we don't know
if it's true or not.

490
00:38:40,334 --> 00:38:42,695
Let them sort it out
among themselves. Just leave it be.

491
00:38:43,215 --> 00:38:44,215
Mm.

492
00:38:58,534 --> 00:39:00,095
Your brother and sister
didn't want to come.

493
00:39:00,135 --> 00:39:01,135
How does it have anything
to do with me?

494
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:03,095
Can you stop looking
like you're about to die?

495
00:39:03,135 --> 00:39:05,334
- Who'd want to come with you?
- What's up with you?

496
00:39:05,454 --> 00:39:06,534
Can you stop being unreasonable?

497
00:39:06,575 --> 00:39:07,775
Who's actually being unreasonable?

498
00:39:07,894 --> 00:39:09,454
Are you going
to keep being like this?

499
00:39:09,575 --> 00:39:11,454
Just say it if you're not
happy about something!

500
00:39:19,695 --> 00:39:21,695
Then stop pestering me
about work already.

501
00:39:23,775 --> 00:39:25,334
How many times have I told you

502
00:39:25,894 --> 00:39:27,775
I'll find a way to say it?

503
00:39:32,014 --> 00:39:33,695
I've been thinking
of stopping as well.

504
00:39:34,215 --> 00:39:35,575
It's exhausting for me too,

505
00:39:36,014 --> 00:39:37,815
trying to prolong
everything on my own.

506
00:39:41,974 --> 00:39:42,974
Good.

507
00:39:46,894 --> 00:39:48,454
I mean well for you.

508
00:39:49,894 --> 00:39:53,775
I just want you to have everything
before the baby arrives.

509
00:40:17,215 --> 00:40:18,695
How can you be pregnant?

510
00:40:22,695 --> 00:40:24,974
What do you mean by that?

511
00:40:41,894 --> 00:40:43,014
I'm sterile.

512
00:40:45,894 --> 00:40:46,894
Huh?

513
00:40:49,974 --> 00:40:51,135
I'm sterile.

514
00:40:51,894 --> 00:40:53,334
I can't procreate.

515
00:40:57,014 --> 00:40:58,534
If you're actually pregnant,

516
00:41:01,575 --> 00:41:02,894
then who's the father?

517
00:45:38,815 --> 00:45:39,854
Cholly.

518
00:45:40,575 --> 00:45:43,854
Don't do this to someone
close to you again. I'm begging you.

519
00:45:46,575 --> 00:45:48,454
You know I have
to keep working here.

520
00:45:49,095 --> 00:45:50,974
Why are you being so serious?

521
00:45:53,815 --> 00:45:54,934
Chess?

522
00:45:56,934 --> 00:45:58,255
Can you kiss me goodbye?
