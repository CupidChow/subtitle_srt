1
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,920
Hm?

2
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,640
Are you stressed
about what Cholly said?

3
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:34,280
Well...

4
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,000
maybe a little.

5
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,880
I think you won the award

6
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,320
not because of me at all.

7
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:56,799
Do you know

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,399
how good you are at your job?

9
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,560
Thank you.

10
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,159
Right.

11
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:29,959
Chess and Jane asked if I want
to join them for drinks.

12
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,280
Come with me.

13
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,000
I'll pass.

14
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,280
Hm? How come?

15
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:40,120
Sometimes, I don't know how to act.

16
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,680
I don't know
what to talk about with them.

17
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,200
Should we find a place to drink,
just the two of us?

18
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,560
It's okay.

19
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,840
It's better if you hang out
with your friends anyway.

20
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:07,719
People will gossip again
if we both disappear.

21
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,159
I'm giving this back to you.

22
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:19,000
Oh? Don't you need it anymore?

23
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,680
I'm not cold anymore.

24
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,800
(The Outing)

25
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:06,240
Jane, if I won with you,
there wouldn't be a problem.

26
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,759
Are you sure?

27
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,199
Of course.

28
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,520
Is Cholly always like that?

29
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:19,560
No.

30
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,399
What's going on with her and Pupha?

31
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,560
No idea.

32
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,680
Neree,

33
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,279
are you okay?

34
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,920
Of course. Why wouldn't I be?

35
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,600
I did nothing.

36
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,680
Oh? Where were you?
What took you so long?

37
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,839
The bathroom.

38
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,279
Cream,

39
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,279
you're not stressed, are you?

40
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,240
I don't think so.
Stressed about what?

41
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,959
Come on. Let's get drunk.

42
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,800
It's stressful talking about it.

43
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,240
Hey.

44
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,480
Move this over.

45
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,800
Sure.

46
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,759
Take this one away too.

47
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,720
All right. Stop.

48
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,680
Okay. Everyone's here.

49
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,000
This glass means

50
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:42,160
we're going to get messed up tonight

51
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:44,560
and forget everything
that happened today.

52
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,160
Ready?

53
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,240
Okay. Let's go. Cheers.

54
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,720
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

55
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,519
- Cheers!
- Let's forget!

56
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:01,560
Durians, Durians... go!

57
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,959
Bananas, bananas, bananas

58
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,920
Have you ever seen a banana?

59
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Don't ask.

60
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:09,079
A banana is quite huge

61
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,439
There's a huge nose
that's called a wiener

62
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,680
- Oh?
- You moron!

63
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,160
Right. A banana?

64
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,720
Bananas, bananas...

65
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,079
What is it again?

66
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,759
Go.

67
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,680
A duck is
washing itself in the canal

68
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,399
- Hey.
- Watching with its eyes

69
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm going outside
to get some fresh air.

70
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,319
You can keep going.

71
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:05,680
Quack, quack, quack

72
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,680
Why are you sitting here?

73
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,240
It's crowded and noisy in there,

74
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,959
so I came outside
to give my ears a rest.

75
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,959
You deserved to win.

76
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,160
Everyone knows
you're good at your job.

77
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,160
But it's not surprising
you're upset about it.

78
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,759
If I was the winner

79
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,440
and someone said

80
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,960
I won it because of my dad,

81
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,000
I wouldn't be okay either.

82
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:48,919
Hey.

83
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Hm?

84
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,799
If there's anything
you can't say to Ami about,

85
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,600
you can come and talk to me instead.

86
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:57,759
Hm?

87
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:03,120
Ami's hard to understand sometimes.

88
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,840
I'm her sister, and sometimes
I can't even keep up with her.

89
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,320
- Really?
- Mm.

90
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,840
Aren't you going to gossip
among yourselves later?

91
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,240
No.

92
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:22,000
Only the two of us will know, okay?

93
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Okay.

94
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,279
I might not have something
to talk about right now.

95
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,679
But if something comes up,

96
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,159
you'll hear me whispering.

97
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,440
Okay?

98
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:36,919
Mm.

99
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:48,799
Hm?

100
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,600
Are you cold? You're rubbing
your hands like crazy.

101
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:56,039
Of course. Why are we even out here?

102
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,039
Don't forget to give it back,
or there'll be trouble again.

103
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:15,159
Mm. I know.

104
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,519
Apart from Neree and Cream,

105
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:29,080
is there anyone else?

106
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,600
You know Cholly got drunk
and started blathering.

107
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,519
It's nothing.

108
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,480
I'm very surprised

109
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,159
that you're still insisting
it's nothing.

110
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,039
And what do you want me to say?

111
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:50,399
There's really nothing.

112
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,159
How can that be?

113
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,279
Do you think everyone's stupid?

114
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,159
No matter how drunk Cholly is,

115
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:09,879
she's not crazy or unhinged.

116
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,799
She wouldn't say
such a thing in front of everyone.

117
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,759
Didn't you see
everyone's expressions

118
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,840
and how they reacted
to what Cholly said?

119
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,320
Okay.

120
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,240
Okay. I'll admit it.

121
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,960
That's what you want
to hear, isn't it?

122
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,320
But it happened a long time ago.

123
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,639
Cholly said all that
because she's jealous...

124
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,679
It has nothing to do with her.

125
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:48,120
Do you understand?

126
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,679
It has nothing to do
with anyone else.

127
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,879
I don't care if Cholly's jealous.

128
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,720
Because this has nothing
to do with anyone else.

129
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:03,200
Are you even aware
of what's going on?

130
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:09,600
So what do you want to do?

131
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:12,080
- What do I want to do?
- Mm.

132
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:18,039
Why are you asking

133
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:21,159
as if it all depends on my decision?

134
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
Huh?

135
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,279
Your question

136
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:30,080
makes me feel like I'm self-centered

137
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,840
and annoying.

138
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:35,360
I can't say or think about anything.

139
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,039
Why do I have to feel pressured
with the question

140
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,080
even though all this insanity

141
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,440
stemmed from
the problems you created?

142
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
What do you expect me to answer?

143
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:48,600
"Oh, well. We'll just break up."
That's it?

144
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,399
Why don't you
ever consider my feelings?

145
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,360
And has it ever crossed your mind

146
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,159
how the others
in the company think of me?

147
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,320
It's not easy

148
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,319
to pretend it's nothing,

149
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,279
even though
I'm dying to scream at you.

150
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,639
But I don't act on it

151
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,919
because I don't want anyone
to think negatively of you.

152
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,879
But it's not like you didn't know
what kind of person I was

153
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:25,120
before we got married.

154
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:28,639
We've discussed this before.

155
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,480
Aren't you ashamed
of what you just said at all?

156
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:37,200
Do you think it's just a joke
you can just say without a thought?

157
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,240
That's right. I knew what kind
of person you were before marriage.

158
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:45,279
But isn't it time you came
to a realization?

159
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,200
Don't you want
to better yourself at all?

160
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:52,519
Do you think being a womanizer
and sleeping around is fun?

161
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,559
And that once caught,
you'd listen to me complain

162
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:56,840
and hope I'd eventually forget?

163
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,519
Have you ever thought of anyone else

164
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,039
apart from yourself?

165
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:08,720
Have you ever thought
about how our daughters feel?

166
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,320
And how does this involve them?

167
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,279
This involves
every single one of them.

168
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,720
So why would we start a family

169
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,200
if you're still this selfish?

170
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,120
If you don't care about anyone else,

171
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,039
then how are we going to live?

172
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,000
Is this really what you want?

173
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,320
I might be able to put up
with some things,

174
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,440
but it doesn't mean
I'll be able to forever.

175
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:55,519
Sirin.

176
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:12,759
It's okay if you don't
consider me family anymore.

177
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:16,519
But please be
considerate of the girls.

178
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,359
Wiz!

179
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,319
Oh? Xena?

180
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,200
Hey, stop right there.

181
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,200
Are you taking a photo?

182
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:50,000
Yes, just stand there.

183
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:52,039
Right.

184
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,359
So? Are they good?

185
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:57,119
For sure.

186
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,519
You're actually quite good at this.

187
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,680
Wiz.

188
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:04,319
Hm?

189
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,160
Why do you like Ami?

190
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,720
Did she ask you to find out?

191
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,240
No, she didn't.

192
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,920
I'm just curious.

193
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,000
Seriously.

194
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:32,440
Enough. That's a lot already.

195
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,200
Here.

196
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,680
Wiz,

197
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,720
I have feelings for you.

198
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,440
I want to sleep with you.

199
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:41,200
You really don't
have feelings for me?

200
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:46,119
Honestly,

201
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,759
if you're not in love
with Ami anymore,

202
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,519
you don't have
to keep putting up with her.

203
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,119
I can tell.

204
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,960
Xena!

205
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:27,119
Have you seen Nu?

206
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:30,400
I don't know.

207
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,279
Maybe he's with Atra.

208
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:39,359
They hang out
a lot together these days.

209
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:41,920
They drink and run together.

210
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,519
You really had no clue?

211
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:49,480
By the way, last night,

212
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,720
about you kissing Wiz.

213
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,559
Be careful when you do something.

214
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:58,119
Wiz might get in trouble
if Dad catches you.

215
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:01,920
What kiss?

216
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,400
Did you have fun last night?

217
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,599
Mm. It was quite nice.

218
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,000
But I still feel sleepy.

219
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:02,920
We stayed up late drinking.

220
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,359
Was Atra with you too?

221
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:12,920
Of course.

222
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,400
But she left early.

223
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,200
So it was me, Uma, and Cream.

224
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,440
Did you go straight back
to your room last night?

225
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:41,680
Here.

226
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,119
I'm allergic to shrimp.

227
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:49,519
Uh...

228
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:52,960
I'm sorry. I forgot.

229
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,200
It was a big one,
so I wanted you to have it.

230
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,920
Sirin, I'm sorry.

231
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,519
I admit I was drunk.

232
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,240
But you were telling the truth.

233
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,880
So what is it about Cream?

234
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,919
People are gossiping
that she slept with Anan at

235
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,240
the party for the Japanese clients.

236
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,160
But I'm not so sure.

237
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,200
That seems to happen a lot.

238
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,039
And how are you doing? Are you okay?

239
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,400
You've changed a lot too.

240
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,720
You have a motherly air about you.

241
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:21,440
I don't know. It just happened.

242
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,599
I probably just want
my family to live harmoniously.

243
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,559
That's such a mom thing to say.

244
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,920
Have I changed that much?

245
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:37,640
Very. You're not like the old Sirin
who just started dating Anan.

246
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,880
You were
such a party girl back then.

247
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,880
Honestly,

248
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,279
Pupha always compares me to you.

249
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,519
But I'm like,

250
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:56,880
I'm me. How can I be
like someone else? Get it?

251
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:00,400
Pupha looks
like he's in love with you.

252
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,279
Are you guys still doing okay?

253
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,720
He doesn't love me.

254
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,680
We're just stuck with each other.

255
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,640
Let's toast.

256
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,039
Sirin,

257
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,880
can I ask you something?

258
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:37,799
Don't you want
to get back at Anan at all?

259
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:55,599
I didn't expect us to come this far.

260
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,680
Mm.

261
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,119
I thought it'd be closer,

262
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,079
but we ended up walking so far.

263
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,279
I knew it.

264
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,359
- I meant the company.
- Oh, really?

265
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,078
About the company,

266
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:08,799
I feel like I don't want
Sirin's family to meddle.

267
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:10,880
I'm worried

268
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,920
what we've built will crumble.

269
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,720
Maybe

270
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,079
we should stay this way?

271
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,599
I understand how you feel.

272
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:24,920
But the company's growth
is a good thing too.

273
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,640
Besides, I want to earn
more money right now.

274
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:33,200
I don't know what Cholly's
been spending so much on.

275
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,759
You guys are lucky. You get
to complain about your families.

276
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:38,920
That's dramatic.

277
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,400
- Come on, toast.
- Sure.

278
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,000
The old Sirin is back!

279
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,680
Don't you want
to get back at him at all?

280
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,400
It's not just men who can
use money and power on sex.

281
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,640
You can do it too.

282
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,319
So what do you say?

283
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,160
Are you still in love with Anan?

284
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:12,440
I don't know.

285
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,200
I'm angry.

286
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:18,400
I can't really explain it.

287
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,799
But I feel like doing
something else is better

288
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:29,279
to get back at someone like him.

289
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,680
But you were right as well.

290
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,599
Money and power are
the most important for men.

291
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,240
If they simply feel

292
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,799
either of them is missing,

293
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,680
they probably wouldn't be
able to stand it, would they?

294
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,559
No more.

295
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,440
Hmph.

296
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:00,400
You're letting me drink alone again.

297
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:23,799
Oh?

298
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,799
What are you doing in here?

299
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:33,319
Is something the matter?

300
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,119
I like you.

301
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:49,240
I've liked you since uni.

302
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,720
I don't know what you think.

303
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,599
But right now,

304
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:07,279
I just want you to know

305
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:11,000
that I really like you.

306
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,240
And I don't want
to keep it a secret anymore.

307
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,319
It might sound horrible,

308
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,839
but every time I see you with Ami,

309
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:41,319
I absolutely hate it.

310
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,319
Aren't you going to say anything?

311
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,360
All right.

312
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,880
I'm sorry for making you feel uneasy.

313
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,239
Then why did you say
you didn't like me back during uni?

314
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:35,599
Nu.

315
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,719
What do you want from Anan?

316
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:20,239
Nothing.

317
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,320
I know you're clever.

318
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,199
And I hope you're clever enough
to know what's good for your life.

319
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:32,320
Who did you kiss last night?

320
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:35,719
Why are you treating me like this?

321
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:38,159
I...

322
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,239
Is it because I wouldn't
let you sleep with me?

323
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,038
We can go and do that now then.

324
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:45,960
It's not like that, Ami. Calm down.
