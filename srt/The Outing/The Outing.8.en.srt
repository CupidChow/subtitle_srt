1
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,280
(Pregnancy Test - Positive)

2
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,840
(The Outing)

3
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,120
Do you need something, Jane?

4
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,319
You asked Sky to talk to Pupha
about the product, didn't you?

5
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,680
This isn't how work
should be carried out.

6
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,960
You need to talk to me first.

7
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,159
Jane, hang on.

8
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,439
I haven't even told
anyone about this.

9
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,719
So how did he know?

10
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,400
Even if you didn't say it,

11
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:25,400
it affects work once he knows.

12
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,879
It negatively impacts your job.

13
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,159
I can understand
if you don't want to talk to me.

14
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,279
But you can't do this to Taurus.

15
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,319
I swear I haven't
talked to anyone about this.

16
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,119
But if you don't believe me,
I'll bring Sky and Pupha here.

17
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,400
Sure. Go and get them.

18
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,599
I don't have a problem
with that anyway.

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The thing is,

20
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,560
I've been working
for the past two years.

21
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,000
Have I ever asked for Sky's help?

22
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,560
Can you give me
an example if I have?

23
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,719
Mesa, you know it in your heart.

24
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,159
Even if you didn't say anything,

25
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,400
Sky has your back.

26
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,400
The thing is, everyone at work feels
obligated to be thoughtful to you.

27
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:02,240
Hang on.
If that's what you're saying,

28
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,000
it means you have a problem
with me at a personal level.

29
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,120
No, that's not it.

30
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,840
It's nothing personal.

31
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,599
I'll be honest with you.

32
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:14,080
I've always felt you never tried
hard enough right from the start.

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,719
What makes you think I'm not trying?

34
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,960
Mesa,

35
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,839
you've been working
with us for two years,

36
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,520
yet you're constantly
making mistakes.

37
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,159
Do you think it's actually okay?

38
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,439
So what do you want to do?

39
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,319
I can't do anything.

40
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,280
You have to figure it out yourself.

41
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,560
What's the matter?

42
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,519
I bought it for you.

43
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,319
We've been together for a year now.

44
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,199
Happy anniversary.

45
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:35,959
Don't you like it?

46
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:39,519
It's beautiful.

47
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,199
Sky.

48
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:45,959
Hm?

49
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,399
Did you talk to your dad about me?

50
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,319
Who told you then?

51
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,720
Nalin told me.

52
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,279
Why did you do it?

53
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:08,959
Well, I...

54
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,519
I noticed you were in trouble.

55
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,079
So I just wanted to help.

56
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,199
Do I look that useless?

57
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,959
Of course not.
Why do you think that?

58
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,439
You're very talented.

59
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,399
How?

60
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,759
Other people think I suck at work.

61
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,519
I even look like a fool.

62
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:37,199
If you thought I was talented
in the first place,

63
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:40,519
you wouldn't have helped me so much.

64
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,639
I've asked you
countless times not to,

65
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,720
but you never listened.

66
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,639
You only listen to other people.

67
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:49,759
No.

68
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,879
It's not like that. I...

69
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,079
I just wanted to help you.

70
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,519
I'm exhausted.

71
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,639
Hey, Mesa.

72
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,519
We should discuss this first.

73
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,560
Sky,

74
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,560
I'm not mad at you.

75
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,879
But I'm just disappointed

76
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,959
you think of me like the others do.

77
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,199
I don't.

78
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,639
I'm just worried about you.

79
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,199
That's it.

80
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:29,439
It makes me feel absolutely useless.

81
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,639
Can you try to understand me?

82
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:37,560
I can't do anything
when you run into trouble.

83
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,199
The only thing I can do is stay put.

84
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:45,120
If I can't help
when you're in trouble,

85
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,199
then why bother
being in a relationship?

86
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,399
Then we should break up.

87
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,199
Mesa,

88
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,759
why are you acting like this again?

89
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,519
Mesa,

90
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:18,879
is this really what you want?

91
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:36,000
What should we have?

92
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,639
What's the signature dish here?

93
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,079
I had the chili burger yesterday.
It was quite good.

94
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,720
All right. I'll have that.

95
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,959
Okay.

96
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,319
And you?

97
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,959
I'll just have some cocoa.

98
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,639
- Are you sure?
- Nothing else?

99
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,439
I only feel like...

100
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,639
- Jane.
- Yes?

101
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,879
Can I talk to you for a second?

102
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,639
The thing is,

103
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,839
Mesa didn't ask for my help.

104
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,639
I just told Dad to help her.

105
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,959
Please give her a chance.

106
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,199
She's very determined.

107
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,720
Have some of this,

108
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,080
or you might get drunk.

109
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,960
Mesa broke up with me.

110
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,559
Shoot.

111
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,080
She did that?

112
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,320
If it's because of work, I'm sorry.

113
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,559
I didn't think
things would escalate.

114
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
No,

115
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,559
it has nothing to do with you.

116
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:33,840
Actually,

117
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,440
I didn't have
to follow your suggestion.

118
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,440
That's enough. You'll get drunk.

119
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,080
Shoot.

120
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,960
It'd be a shame
if we really had to break up.

121
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,080
But I'm not sure either

122
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,840
if we'll get back together.

123
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,440
It's like I'm always
an inconvenience for her

124
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,200
when I'm around.

125
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,200
This is so corny.

126
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,840
And what makes you feel better?

127
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,720
I don't know.

128
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,360
Whatever makes her happy
makes me happy too.

129
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,960
And you're not going
to think of yourself at all?

130
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,440
Of course I am.

131
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,440
Anything that's going
to make her feel okay.

132
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,440
Forget the rest.

133
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,200
But it's not like

134
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:47,840
there isn't a solution to this.

135
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:53,440
If she quit her job
and got a job somewhere else,

136
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,200
and I...

137
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,600
keep my nose out
of her business most of the time,

138
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:00,799
it should be okay, shouldn't it?

139
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:05,480
Well, I'll try and talk to her.

140
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,039
But if she still insists

141
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:11,759
on breaking up with me,
then so be it.

142
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:39,080
(Aunt Apa)

143
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,279
(Aunt Apa)

144
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:50,759
Nalin, have you gone to bed?

145
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,919
Can I have a word with you?

146
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,519
What's wrong?

147
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,279
Are you bored?

148
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,799
Put up with it for a bit longer.
We'll be back tomorrow.

149
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:26,600
Ugh, just the thought of sitting
in a car with him bores me to death.

150
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,720
Do you want to carpool
with me tomorrow instead?

151
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,519
I'll give you a ride home.

152
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,360
It's okay.

153
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,279
I might get into a fight
with him again if I do that.

154
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,600
How's your arm?

155
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:51,080
It's just red,
but it doesn't hurt anymore.

156
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,720
What did you
fight about this afternoon?

157
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,799
Was it Sky?

158
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,440
Your dad told me.

159
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,600
He thinks you probably
have feelings for Sky.

160
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:15,360
It's not wrong.

161
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:19,600
People have
the right to fall for anyone.

162
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,279
But for Sky's case, I think...

163
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,879
No, Apa.

164
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:26,159
What right does Dad have
to teach me anything?

165
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,919
It's not like he's perfect.

166
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:33,240
What I wanted to tell you is

167
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:37,600
that if you love Sky very much,

168
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:42,200
shouldn't you work hard
to stay friends instead?

169
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,879
I want you to take me
and Tara as an example.

170
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,840
We were friends

171
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:54,879
and very close ones at that.

172
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:57,840
We decided
to go out together in the end.

173
00:13:58,759 --> 00:13:59,759
But look at us.

174
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,879
Once there was a problem,

175
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:06,600
not only was I heartbroken,
but I also felt

176
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,440
like I'd lost a friend.

177
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:12,279
It's worse than losing a boyfriend.

178
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,440
You can't stop yourself

179
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,279
from feeling something.

180
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,159
I understand that.

181
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,720
I want you to try taking a step back

182
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,679
and think about what you prefer

183
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,159
between a friendship

184
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,399
and something more.

185
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:51,720
I never felt like
I belonged to a family.

186
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,600
But with Sky,

187
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:58,000
he's the only one who makes me feel
like I'm in the right place.

188
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,879
It's only him who can do that.

189
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,559
Then maybe

190
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:15,159
you should keep him
and let him stay that way forever?

191
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,159
Stop crying.
There's no need to cry anymore.

192
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,960
(Tara)

193
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
(Tara)

194
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,399
Oh? I thought you said
you weren't going to drink.

195
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,279
Just for a bit.

196
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:27,960
Why didn't you ask me?

197
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,960
- Cheers.
- Hmph.

198
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:46,960
The weather's nice.

199
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:52,639
It was piping hot in the afternoon,
but then it got cold at night.

200
00:16:58,519 --> 00:16:59,639
Why do you look so tense?

201
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,639
It's a lot of things.

202
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,720
That's all.

203
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:06,640
True that.

204
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,839
We need to hire
an organizer for the next outing.

205
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,400
We didn't get to relax at all.

206
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,400
Sure.

207
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,640
But I don't think

208
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,880
you have to be
that serious about it.

209
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:26,519
- I just want it to turn out well.
- Mm.

210
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,160
Taurus,

211
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,880
Mesa talked to Pupha
to help with the client's product.

212
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,400
Unbelievable.

213
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:42,759
I told her to discuss it
within the department first.

214
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:45,440
She never listens to me.

215
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,200
I'm super mad about it.

216
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,839
Come on. Don't be so serious.

217
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,880
Let it go sometimes.
We're on vacation.

218
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,640
Cheers.

219
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,999
I realized I'm old
because people here

220
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,319
- address me as "ma'am."
- Right.

221
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,640
Someone who obviously is
older than me calls me that.

222
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,639
All right. Another round.

223
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,519
Come on.

224
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:30,200
- Bottoms up.
- Indeed.

225
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,279
I knew it.

226
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,960
You have to answer this question.

227
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:46,640
If you could turn back time,
what advice would you give yourself?

228
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,640
Hello?

229
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,960
Taurus?

230
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,759
- Taurus?
- Huh?

231
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,400
- Are you listening?
- I am.

232
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:56,160
I really need to pee!
I'm about to burst!

233
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,639
- Hold it in. Talk to me first...
- If...

234
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,200
Do you know if you hold
in your pee too often...

235
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,079
All right.

236
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:05,720
It's okay.

237
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,640
Okay. Watch your step.

238
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:13,279
Gently.

239
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,839
Here. Okay. One, two, three.

240
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,519
Okay.

241
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
All right.

242
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:26,839
Keep me company.

243
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:31,839
Okay. Sure.

244
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:40,400
- Jane.
- Hm?

245
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,640
Nothing.

246
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:53,279
You know I like you,
don't you, Jane?

247
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,519
What is this?

248
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:59,000
Don't you like me as well?

249
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,960
You're drunk.

250
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,839
Go to sleep.

251
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,440
I'm not drunk. I'm serious.

252
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:14,680
We slept together. That's all.

253
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:17,559
We talked about this. We agreed
we wouldn't overthink it.

254
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,200
But I'm not thinking
what you're thinking.

255
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:26,240
It was just a one-night stand.
Just for fun.

256
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,240
We talked about this.

257
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,680
Taurus.

258
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,440
You're hurting me.

259
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:42,359
Let go.

260
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:44,839
Let go.

261
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,039
If you refuse to let me go,

262
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,200
I'll quit my job.

263
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:55,960
What do you mean?

264
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,079
I meant what I said.

265
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,200
Why doesn't anyone think
about my feelings at all?

266
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:10,599
Wait.

267
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,839
Don't.

268
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:26,440
Let me go!

269
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:15,920
Are you really
going to do this to me?

270
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:02,440
I'm sorry.

271
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,039
You should take a shower.

272
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:36,960
It'll sober you up.

273
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:38,959
You'll get a headache
if you go to sleep now,

274
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,359
and you might not be able
to drive tomorrow.

275
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,960
Tara?

276
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,160
Tara?

277
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:36,440
Hey, Tara!

278
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,680
Tara.

279
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,079
Tara, look at my face.

280
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:49,319
Tara.

281
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,039
Tara.

282
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,160
Does your stomach still hurt?

283
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,359
Are you sure you're not
going to see the doctor?

284
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,559
It's not anything serious.

285
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,160
The doctor told me from the start
there might be bleeding.

286
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:27,799
I just have to be careful
for the time being.

287
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,559
Do you want me to stay with you?

288
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,160
I'm not sure

289
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:39,359
how I should feel right now either.

290
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,960
From not seeing

291
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,079
and talking to each other,

292
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,680
it somehow turned out

293
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:51,920
that you're the only person
who knows my secret.

294
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:54,680
And now you have to
look after me too.

295
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,160
Don't think about it too much.

296
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,559
Forget everything else for now.

297
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,799
You have to look
after yourself first.

298
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,559
Do you know

299
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:14,440
I used to really want
to have a baby?

300
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:17,960
I planned it all out,

301
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:21,200
what the name would be

302
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:24,319
if I had a baby,

303
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:26,440
and what school I'd send them to.

304
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,960
But this child,

305
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,279
I want to see their face.

306
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:44,440
But I don't think I can keep them.

307
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,440
Aren't you going
to tell the father first?

308
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:01,359
I can't.

309
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,920
Because Natee is the father.

310
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,720
I'm not going to do
an internship here anymore.

311
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,440
I'm just telling you now,
but don't tell anyone else yet.

312
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:44,839
How come?

313
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,599
I've broken up with Apa.

314
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,519
It feels better this way.

315
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,880
Sure.

316
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,960
Whatever.

317
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:57,759
It's your life. Do what you want.

318
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:03,440
If I'm not going
to do an internship here,

319
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,559
will we get to see each other again?

320
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,200
Get in touch if you want to see me.

321
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,200
We'll pay you a visit.

322
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:14,200
Mm.

323
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:16,839
Okay.

324
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,039
Then can I ask you something?

325
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,440
If I want to be more
to you than I am now,

326
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:27,799
is it possible?

327
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,079
Peng, didn't I tell you?

328
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:35,160
I'm not into commitment.

329
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:38,400
Why?

330
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,880
A relationship is...

331
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,240
full of nonsense.

332
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,599
Nonsense?

333
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,599
And what isn't nonsense to you?

334
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:58,599
Money?

335
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,039
I can buy you if you want.

336
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,640
Are you pretending to be
in a sad music video?

337
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:46,519
Oh, hey.

338
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,119
Sorry for asking you
to come such a long way.

339
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,079
I'm quitting.

340
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,680
Same here.

341
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,680
You too?

342
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,279
How come?

343
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:24,960
It's a lot of things.

344
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,240
But you probably
understand me, don't you?

345
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,920
We shouldn't have gotten
involved with them.

346
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,960
And I'm...

347
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,680
I'm going to break up
with Ami as well.

348
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,119
What about you?

349
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,359
Are you going to break up with Sky?

350
00:30:58,079 --> 00:30:59,240
I don't know.

351
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,920
Does he love you?

352
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:05,559
I think so.

353
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,960
And you?

354
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,079
Do you love him?

355
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,720
Then there's nothing much
to think about.

356
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:20,480
You should keep seeing him.

357
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,680
You're going to change jobs anyway.

358
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:25,359
Well,

359
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,799
I couldn't help thinking

360
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,480
there's nothing about us
that's compatible.

361
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,240
My wealth, my social status...

362
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:35,559
I don't know.

363
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:39,559
Mesa,

364
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,999
you were in a music video before.

365
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,559
Are you going to be
in a TV drama too?

366
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,640
What? Incompatible statuses?

367
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:49,680
All right.

368
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,160
Then I'd like to say
something clich矇 as well.

369
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,920
He loves you,

370
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,680
and you love him.

371
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,599
Isn't that enough already?

372
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,720
There's no need to care
about what other people say.

373
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,920
Just cherish him.

374
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:11,920
Hm?

375
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,680
Okay.

376
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:21,599
But you don't

377
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,839
have to listen to everything I said.

378
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,799
I can barely look after myself.

379
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,599
- Nu.
- Hm?

380
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,039
Uma asked if I wanted to join her
for drinks. Do you want to come?

381
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:49,240
- Uma?
- Mm.

382
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:53,240
You go ahead. I'll catch up.

383
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:57,039
I want to sit here and star
in a music video for a bit.

384
00:32:58,599 --> 00:32:59,599
Right.

385
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:01,920
Before going to meet them,

386
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:04,599
you should go and talk to Sky first.

387
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:11,119
Okay.

388
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:16,160
Well then.
Catch up with me, Mr. Superstar.

389
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,720
Oh.

390
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,240
Don't tell anyone

391
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,039
what I told you just yet,

392
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,519
or things might get messy.

393
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,599
Okay.

394
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,480
Sky?

395
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,240
Sky?

396
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,480
What's wrong?

397
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,400
Are you still mad at me?

398
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,160
Mesa, go and wait in the room, okay?

399
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,720
We'll talk later.

400
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:11,039
- Sky...
- What on earth did you do?

401
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,159
I'm sorry.

402
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,400
I can't really control myself

403
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:50,480
when I'm drunk.

404
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:54,280
And are you like this often?

405
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:58,519
It was worse before.

406
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,599
I had to go to rehab
before I got better.

407
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,159
Has Nalin seen it?

408
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,039
If you can sort yourself out,
then I'm okay with it.

409
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:18,599
Because you're the only one
Nalin has.

410
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,920
Are you still going to resign?

411
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,920
Train someone new for me first

412
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:35,719
if you insist on resigning.

413
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,679
How could I resign?

414
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:44,400
We only have each other.

415
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,480
Taurus,

416
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:07,239
you can always talk to me
if you're stressed about something.

417
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,480
You don't have
to keep it to yourself.

418
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,239
I like you, Taurus.

419
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,719
But it might not be enough
for us to be together.

420
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,840
You can't cross the line.

421
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,840
I'll let you know
if you can one day.

422
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:34,719
Mm.

423
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:12,719
Oh? Have you finished packing?

424
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,960
Yes.

425
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,239
I think I'm going to take a shower.

426
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,360
You can go ahead and get
something to eat if you're hungry.

427
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,480
Oh, it's okay.

428
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,960
I'm not hungry.

429
00:37:23,961 --> 00:37:25,360
I'll wait for you.

430
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,480
Mm.

431
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,719
- Apa.
- Hm?

432
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:33,760
Can I carpool with you?

433
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,760
I don't want to ride
in the employee's vehicle anymore.

434
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:39,119
I'm not going to do
an internship here anyway.

435
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,119
Sure, you can.

436
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,360
If you go somewhere
without me again,

437
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,119
lock the door next time.

438
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,280
Do you still want to know
why I adopted you?

439
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:46,960
Your grandparents
couldn't have children.

440
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,159
Grandma was unwell,

441
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:52,440
so they decided to adopt me.

442
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,360
But after they adopted me,

443
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,519
Grandma got pregnant with Apa.

444
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,639
But they loved me as always.

445
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,079
They took care of me
and supported me financially.

446
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,360
But for me,

447
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,440
I still felt like I was an outsider.

448
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,559
One day,

449
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,639
I met your mother.

450
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:24,078
The first thing that came
to my mind was that I wanted

451
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,920
to start my own family.

452
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,000
But your mother wasn't well

453
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,079
and couldn't conceive.

454
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,199
We'd been trying for many years

455
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,519
until I decided to go
to an adoption agency.

456
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:46,000
Do you know I went around
to see you so many times?

457
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:52,920
In the end, I decided to adopt you.

458
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:58,880
But after that,

459
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,360
your mother died.

460
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,480
Ever since you came into my life,

461
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,320
you've been my everything.

462
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,079
You're my family.

463
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:31,960
I don't want you
to feel like an outsider.

464
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,320
I'm sorry I can't set
a good example for you.

465
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,880
I just want you to be able

466
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:53,039
to look after yourself
when I'm not there anymore.

467
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:58,960
You've done a good job raising me.

468
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,360
We're so alike.

469
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,360
I love you, Dad.

470
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:17,360
I'm sorry I said that
to you yesterday.

471
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,800
I love you, Dad!

472
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:36,960
Isn't it great?

473
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,400
Unbelievable.

474
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,480
These are mine and Uma's.

475
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:43,079
I'll wait for you in the car.

476
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:44,320
Okay.

477
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:48,360
The cars are parked
right next to the resort.

478
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:53,800
All good?

479
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,320
Well, almost.

480
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,119
Okay.

481
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,519
The cars are ready.

482
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:02,079
Jane.

483
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,320
I'm resigning after this project.

484
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,119
But I can stay and help
if you haven't found a replacement.

485
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,639
Okay.

486
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:17,119
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

487
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,119
No.

488
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,360
See you at work then.

489
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,119
What are you doing?

490
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:50,480
Taking photos.

491
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:02,800
Nalin,

492
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:10,119
I heard you told Sky to talk
about my work with Pupha.

493
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,119
Thanks for worrying about me.

494
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,239
Sky's lovely, isn't he?

495
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,320
He's always worried
about other people.

496
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:30,239
You have feelings
for Sky, don't you?

497
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,440
What are you talking about?

498
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,239
I can tell.

499
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:40,880
But don't worry.

500
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,199
I probably won't tell him.

501
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:44,679
You can rest assured.

502
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,320
But if you plan to wait for him,
it might take a while

503
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,760
because I probably won't
break up with him that easily.

504
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,719
Doesn't Ari hate
the smell of cigarettes?

505
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:38,280
You might end up fighting again.

506
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,639
We constantly get
into fights anyway.

507
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:46,960
It's okay.

508
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:00,719
Do you think Ari's having an affair?

509
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,079
She told me everything.

510
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:07,719
I think

511
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:10,840
you should think about it carefully.

512
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,840
Ari isn't someone
who'd do such a thing.

513
00:46:20,199 --> 00:46:21,199
Sure.

514
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:46,599
- Oh?
- I have a hangover. Can you drive?

515
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:48,960
I promise I won't complain.

516
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:08,079
What are you mad about now?

517
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:10,519
I'm not.

518
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:14,199
- Be quiet and go to sleep.
- Okay.

519
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,719
Just fasten your seatbelt.

520
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,800
Where did you meet Peng?

521
00:52:17,159 --> 00:52:18,280
He's quite lovely.

522
00:52:19,159 --> 00:52:21,519
He got through his audition
and landed a gig.

523
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:24,159
Then we met again somewhere else

524
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:25,480
so we got to talk to each other.

525
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,280
It hasn't been long,
yet you're already going public.

526
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,360
Are you going to marry him?
