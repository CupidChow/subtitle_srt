1
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:16,239
(Pregnancy Test)

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,160
(Positive)

3
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,159
(The Outing)

4
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,919
I'm sterile.

5
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,639
I can't procreate.

6
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,639
If you're actually pregnant,

7
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,800
then who's the father?

8
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,000
When did you find out?

9
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,719
Tell me

10
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,680
how you got pregnant first.

11
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,159
I'm not sure, Tee.

12
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,120
The tests aren't always accurate.

13
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,680
So you told the others
despite not being sure?

14
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,680
Shouldn't you have
discussed it with me first?

15
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,520
I was angry at the time.

16
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,960
Is this why you wouldn't go

17
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,960
see the doctor with me?

18
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,560
Sterility is a big deal.

19
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,718
Why didn't you tell me?

20
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:20,639
- Could I possibly even tell you?
- Of course.

21
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,120
Why wouldn't you?

22
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:24,919
Your life has
to be perfect in every way.

23
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,560
Would you be able to accept it
if I'd told you from the start?

24
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,800
Would you marry someone
who's sterile?

25
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,439
Wouldn't you be embarrassed?

26
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,280
It has nothing to do with anything.

27
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,560
- Don't take it out on me.
- I'm not.

28
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,080
It's because you're always
embarrassed about everything.

29
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,599
You want me to open up that unit

30
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,120
just for the sake of your own image.

31
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,719
I thought it was a possibility,

32
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,240
so I helped you brainstorm.

33
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:52,000
I understand you rushing me
into becoming an executive.

34
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,840
But I'm still not ready.

35
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:07,360
Stop talking about this already.

36
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:10,800
Just forget it.

37
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,840
I understand now
that I was a busybody.

38
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,000
But what I don't understand is

39
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,240
why you didn't tell me something
as serious as being sterile.

40
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,680
I'm your family.

41
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,800
You know having a baby is

42
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,279
the thing I desire most.

43
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,800
I want to build a family with you.

44
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,959
You should've told me

45
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,360
so we can find a solution.

46
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,839
If I didn't think I was pregnant,

47
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,639
would you just keep me waiting?

48
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,399
We're getting older every day, Tee.

49
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,639
You're so tough.

50
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,680
What now?

51
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,240
You're still able to guilt-trip me.

52
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,759
I admit

53
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,519
I was wrong for not telling you
about my sterility.

54
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,959
But you got pregnant
all of a sudden.

55
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:22,000
Doesn't that mean
you slept with someone?

56
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,920
Do you really believe
I'm that kind of person?

57
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,279
Where are you going?

58
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,360
I'm thinking of chilling out
with Anan and Taurus?

59
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,319
Where?

60
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:53,839
Somewhere in the area.

61
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,720
Taurus said there's
a nice viewpoint.

62
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,480
So I thought I should join them.

63
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:01,879
What's gotten into them?

64
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,279
Right? I don't know either.

65
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,240
They probably think
the weather's nice in Thailand,

66
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,120
and it's suitable for sipping beer
on top of a mountain.

67
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,959
But the three of us haven't had
a conversation since we got here.

68
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,600
So I thought I should go with them.

69
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,040
The three of you seem close.

70
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,600
Have you ever fought?

71
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,680
There have been a few.

72
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,120
We tend to argue when we're drunk.

73
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,560
But we've never really
had a serious fight.

74
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:46,959
That's nice.

75
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:51,040
You're friends
and can also work together.

76
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,120
Well, we've been friends
for a long time.

77
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,319
They're like family now.

78
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,560
What?

79
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,240
Nothing.

80
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,079
Hm...

81
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:21,480
I've started talking to Apa again.

82
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,800
And are you okay?

83
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,360
Of course.

84
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,360
Oh,

85
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,120
well.

86
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,559
Perhaps

87
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,759
it's better this way.

88
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,240
Sometimes,

89
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,600
friends can trust each other
more than family.

90
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,679
Oh?

91
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,360
You're going right now?

92
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:05,559
Isn't it too warm?

93
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,840
Mm. I don't know
what they're thinking.

94
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,240
Right.

95
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,399
Should we have dinner separately
with our consecutive families?

96
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,799
We'll do it here.

97
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,559
We'll ask them
to arrange separate tables.

98
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,840
That sounds good.

99
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:24,120
Mm, okay. I can handle that for you.

100
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,480
Mm.

101
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,759
(Natee)

102
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,960
Is there anything else you need?

103
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,399
No, I think I have everything.

104
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
What?

105
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:50,600
Okay. I'll go and pick you up.

106
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Mm.

107
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,960
Can I borrow your car?

108
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,120
Where are you going?

109
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,759
To get something to eat.

110
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,639
Sure. The key's in the room.

111
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,559
You can just go in. It's not locked.
The key's on the bedside table.

112
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,480
Okay.

113
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,360
I'll be right back.

114
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,559
Cholly,

115
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,720
are there drugs in the car?

116
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:29,039
No. Why?

117
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,840
Nothing.

118
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,960
I saw you driving the car yesterday.

119
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:35,360
I thought you were
doing something in there.

120
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,480
It was just a question

121
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,759
in case Tara runs into a checkpoint.

122
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:47,360
I've dumped all of it.

123
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,960
Lin,

124
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,200
do you think
Mesa's going to like it?

125
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,759
Why are you going to give her this?

126
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,720
It's for our one-year anniversary.

127
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,039
Time sure flies.
It's already been a year.

128
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:23,840
I need to go to the bathroom.

129
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,960
Mm.

130
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,279
Hello?

131
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,879
What's up, Sky?

132
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,720
Have you finished?

133
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,480
Can you come to my room?

134
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:46,320
I'm sorry. I'm busy right now.

135
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:48,759
Oh, that's okay.

136
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:52,200
I can go to you instead.

137
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,279
Sky, I'm busy. I have to go.

138
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,799
Okay.

139
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,960
What's wrong?

140
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,440
What was the fight about this time?

141
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,120
Well,

142
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,399
same old.

143
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,240
Do you think

144
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,440
I'm a loser?

145
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:46,960
No.

146
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,240
Why do you think that?

147
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,440
I don't know.

148
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,200
I just feel

149
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:00,480
like I can't do
a lot of things properly.

150
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:05,039
So I feel crappy.

151
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:12,120
I feel worse the more
I'm being reminded of it.

152
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,960
Is it a mid-life crisis?

153
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:25,759
I don't think
you should overthink it.

154
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:32,679
Ari's just a fussy person.

155
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,200
Especially

156
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,559
now that she is
our family's only hope.

157
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,799
Look at me and Pha.

158
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,080
She's probably prone to mood swings.

159
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,840
I think you two should
talk it out if there's anything.

160
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,840
Remind yourself, that's how
it is with a pregnant woman.

161
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,600
If Ari's actually pregnant,

162
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:12,720
then I don't think the baby's mine.

163
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,399
Huh?

164
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,360
I'm sterile.

165
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,679
What do you mean?

166
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,919
I got tested in secret

167
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:42,840
when she and I were

168
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,279
trying to have a baby.

169
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,759
Are you sure?

170
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,480
And...

171
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,080
how did Ari get pregnant?

172
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:56,399
Well,

173
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,759
those tests aren't always accurate.

174
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:03,120
Or maybe she has someone else.

175
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:14,799
I think you two should get checked
properly at a hospital.

176
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,320
But if there's really

177
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:19,960
something going on with you,

178
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,399
then help each other sort it out.

179
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:29,159
But I don't think

180
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,759
Ari would have an affair.

181
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,080
And I don't think
you're sterile either.

182
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:46,759
But do you know

183
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,320
that even if you actually are,

184
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:51,120
it's not

185
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,879
your fault.

186
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:59,320
You understand, don't you?

187
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,960
Thank you.

188
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,080
I wish Ari understood things
as easily as you do.

189
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:36,200
You know it was wrong

190
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:38,159
when we slept together, don't you?

191
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,720
And it's been hard on me.

192
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:49,360
I wouldn't have done it
if I could turn back time.

193
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,039
You married into my family.

194
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,960
You're my brother-in-law.

195
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:04,279
That's all we can be.

196
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:08,960
We've talked about this.

197
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,680
I understand.

198
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:32,599
People make bad decisions
when they're confused.

199
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,680
I think you should call Ari
to come and pick you up.

200
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,680
I don't want anyone
to see we're close.

201
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:04,920
Are you serious?

202
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,799
Yes.

203
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,759
I've given it enough thought.

204
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:13,759
I want to sort my life out.

205
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:17,559
People will forget if I let it go.

206
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,200
But think about it.

207
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,200
Do you think his wife is

208
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:23,599
going to forget that easily?

209
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,279
All right.
So what are you going to do?

210
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:30,959
I'll probably tell her everything.

211
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,480
I don't care
if she'll believe it or not.

212
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:34,279
I've done my part.

213
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,359
Mm. Your call.

214
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,240
But...

215
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:44,599
What about Neree? What if she asks?

216
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:47,440
That's it. You can use it
to take revenge on Anan?

217
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:50,039
She won't ask about it.

218
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,000
I wouldn't know the answer
if she does anyway.

219
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,599
We've never seen it,
and there's no evidence.

220
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,440
I don't want to be like those people
who gossip about me.

221
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:02,319
Besides,

222
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,920
I don't think Sirin is stupid.

223
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,200
I think she knows
but just keeps quiet.

224
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:08,559
Mm.

225
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,759
And Anan won't be affected
by something this insignificant.

226
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:15,599
We'll have to find a chance to rub
salt in his wound when he falls.

227
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,039
Rub salt in his wound when he falls?

228
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:21,680
I was right not to be
enemies with you.

229
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,559
It's good we're friends.

230
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,720
Mm.

231
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,599
Sirin, are you in there?

232
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,920
Come on in.

233
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,519
Are you free to talk?

234
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,519
I'd like to have a word.

235
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,960
Well...

236
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:25,319
I want to talk to you about Anan.

237
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,920
The rumor
about me and him isn't true.

238
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:43,680
We never slept together.

239
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,519
What happened that day was

240
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,400
that we had a party
after a meeting with a client.

241
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,279
We went to his place
and continued to drink there.

242
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:58,200
I got drunk

243
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:01,799
and spent the night there.

244
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:04,240
Anan was sleeping next to me

245
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,880
when I got up.

246
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,680
That's all there is to it.

247
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,519
Someone must've seen it
and spread the rumor.

248
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,920
I know you because you've
worked here for a long time.

249
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,759
I'll believe you.

250
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,480
Have you talked to Anan about it?
What did he say?

251
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,440
I have.

252
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,400
He told me to forget it.

253
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,160
Can I ask you something?

254
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,400
Why are you telling me this?

255
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,119
I don't want you
to see in a negative light,

256
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:07,880
misunderstand me,

257
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,519
or feel horrible about me.

258
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:16,160
Thank you.

259
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,079
All right.

260
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,960
I won't bother you anymore.

261
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,079
Wait, Cream.

262
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:29,839
Yes?

263
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:34,119
I'm sorry you have
to go through this.

264
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,480
My husband is

265
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:39,839
a horrible person.

266
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:04,000
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

267
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:09,960
I'd like to arrange
some dinner at A9.

268
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:11,960
Please set the table for six.

269
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,240
Actually, make it seven.
I'll list the menu for you.

270
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:18,920
What time would you like to eat?

271
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:21,720
Around 6:30 p.m.

272
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:23,680
- I'll see to it, ma'am.
- Thank you.

273
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,559
Oh, Peng? What are you doing here?

274
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,200
I might get some beer.

275
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:39,880
Hey, wait.

276
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,799
That's a nice shirt.
Where did you buy it?

277
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,920
It's Chess's. He lent it to me.

278
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,119
Wow, you just met,
and you're already that close?

279
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:49,480
Not really.

280
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,839
Then why did you borrow his shirt?

281
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,039
Uh...

282
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,079
Well, I went for a dip in a pool,
and he lent it to me.

283
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,920
Mm. That's good. You two are
around the same age.

284
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,160
You should be friends.

285
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,920
Okay. I'll go
and grab some beer now.

286
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,599
- Go ahead.
- See you.

287
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,160
Go and wait in the room.

288
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,519
I'll catch up with you.

289
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,799
Hey.

290
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,880
Cholly,

291
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:51,640
someone might see us.

292
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,279
No one's going to.

293
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:02,519
Aren't you worried

294
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:05,039
Sirin might tell someone?

295
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:07,279
She won't.

296
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,839
Cholly.

297
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,359
Don't do this to someone
close to you again.

298
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,680
I'm begging you.

299
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,960
You know I have
to keep working here.

300
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:24,880
Why so serious? It's not a big deal.

301
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,440
I know what I'm doing.

302
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:31,400
Isn't this just
a business transaction?

303
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,480
Money can't

304
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,960
buy everything.

305
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,079
- I'm not soliciting.
- Pfft.

306
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,319
Isn't that what
we've been doing already?

307
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,079
I buy stuff. I pay you.

308
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,759
Then you pay someone else.

309
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:50,960
I know I'm not important to you.

310
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,960
We're just meeting
each other for money.

311
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:55,160
Hang on.

312
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:58,319
Who do I pay?
What are you talking about?

313
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,519
You sound like you're jealous.

314
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:04,119
Didn't we have an agreement?

315
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,240
You're just buying pleasure from me.

316
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,359
Chess, I remember

317
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,160
everything I bought for you.

318
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,599
I bought you a shirt,

319
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,880
and you let Peng wear it.

320
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,559
I know you well.

321
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,759
You're very possessive
about your stuff.

322
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,839
Do you have feelings for me?

323
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,079
It's mine.

324
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,680
You already gave it to me.

325
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,559
I can give it to whomever I want.

326
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:41,200
And how does it have
anything to do with you

327
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,480
if I'm going to have
feelings for someone else?

328
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,960
Okay.

329
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,480
I know we agreed not to
have feelings for each other.

330
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:51,079
I'm sorry then.

331
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,279
But I couldn't help it

332
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,279
when I saw him.

333
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:59,759
I'm sorry too.

334
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,440
I was just paranoid about Sirin.

335
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,720
It's okay. I understand.

336
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,079
Chess?

337
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,440
Can you kiss me goodbye?

338
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:48,799
You two talk to each other.

339
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,720
I'm going to the bathroom.

340
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:54,400
You're getting old, Anan.
Your pelvic floor's out of whack.

341
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,880
Excuse me?

342
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:57,960
You brought me here.
Where should I pee?

343
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:00,759
- In the woods. Beware of tigers.
- Over there.

344
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,799
Ah.

345
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:08,119
Don't you have
any plans to find a new wife?

346
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:13,039
Technically, I do.

347
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:15,279
But I'm getting old.

348
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,240
It's not easy to find someone.

349
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,079
I'm only worried about Nalin.

350
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,559
She's growing up.

351
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,160
I don't even understand
when we talk about girl stuff.

352
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,160
I want to be with someone
who can give me advice.

353
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:37,480
But it doesn't mean you can consult
your wife about anything.

354
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,680
Take me and Cholly as an example.

355
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,799
All of our conversations always
end in arguments.

356
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,200
You're always telling her off.
That's why she's angry.

357
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,079
Come on, Taurus.

358
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,839
I wouldn't
if I wasn't worried about her.

359
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,839
I tell her off because I am.

360
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,400
Besides,

361
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,519
I understand
women have to complain sometimes.

362
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:05,119
But she does it every day.

363
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:08,960
So I have to fight with her
like a couple of teenagers

364
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:12,079
instead of living a happy life?

365
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,720
Seriously,

366
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,960
have you ever thought
of breaking up with her?

367
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:20,079
No.

368
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:23,039
But...

369
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,039
I'm just enduring it.

370
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:27,839
I understand.

371
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,920
Speaking of endurance,

372
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,960
I think people put up
with each other

373
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:37,119
because they're afraid
of being alone.

374
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:45,279
Hey, are you guys flirting?

375
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:47,720
We'd be kissing
if it took you any longer.

376
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:49,440
Right? Things were
about to get steamy.

377
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,640
Ugh! I don't want to be old!

378
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,359
I want to go back to being a kid.

379
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,440
Adult life is full of headaches.

380
00:30:58,039 --> 00:30:59,480
If you don't want to be old,

381
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,119
then you should've died
when you were a kid.

382
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,039
You shouldn't have even grown up
with the state you were in.

383
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:06,960
It was a miracle you did.

384
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,599
That makes two of us.

385
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,480
All right. Cheers.

386
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,920
But I'm glad
I grew up with you guys.

387
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:26,720
I couldn't imagine what my life
would be without you guys.

388
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,160
He's being emotional.

389
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,079
So melodramatic.

390
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,640
Well, you guys were flirting.
I had to join in.

391
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,960
I bought these to test again.

392
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,039
And what if you're not pregnant?

393
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:05,440
If you're sterile,
then I can't be pregnant, can I?

394
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:08,799
I'll deal

395
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:10,519
with telling the others.

396
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,640
- Dad.
- What?

397
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:45,160
Can I talk to you?

398
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,680
Sure.

399
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:48,680
Let's sit over there.

400
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,240
Hey.

401
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,960
Where did all the stress come from?

402
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:57,519
Drink it away.

403
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,319
Don't tell me you got
your girlfriend pregnant.

404
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,200
No, Dad.

405
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,200
So tell me.

406
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,960
Mesa's been stressed lately.

407
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,640
It's probably because of work.

408
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,359
Will you be able to help her?

409
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,319
Did she tell you to come and ask?

410
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,400
No.

411
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,200
This is my idea.

412
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,960
Why does everyone think

413
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:31,680
she wants my help?

414
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,799
She's my subordinate.

415
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:35,720
You're my son.

416
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:37,759
And you two are dating.

417
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:39,880
It's only natural for
people to think that.

418
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,599
But Mesa never asked me to help her.

419
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,920
Mm.

420
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,920
I think you should ask her first.

421
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:52,200
Or you might get into a fight.

422
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:58,279
She wouldn't tell me
even if I asked her.

423
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,880
I just want to help her.

424
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,480
And she's been
under a lot of stress lately.

425
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,440
So I've been feeling crappy too.

426
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,119
Oh, what a hopeless romantic.

427
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,400
How much is the dowry
going to cost me?

428
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,519
This is serious, Dad.

429
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,400
Sure. I know.

430
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,480
Hm...

431
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,360
But I think

432
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,559
you should stay out of this.

433
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,199
All right? There could be a problem.

434
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:36,519
Come on, Dad.

435
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,719
Just this once.

436
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,119
Please help her.

437
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,360
Okay.

438
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,079
I will.

439
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,960
But I want no part of it
if there's a problem.

440
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:00,599
Sure.

441
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,519
But don't tell her, okay?

442
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,800
Right.

443
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,400
Let me tell you something, Sky.

444
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:14,559
As her boss,

445
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,239
I'm not okay with

446
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,559
you meddling in her work.

447
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:24,559
Mixing professional
and personal matters

448
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:26,119
isn't okay.

449
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,239
But as your dad,

450
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,360
I'm glad

451
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,360
you know how to love

452
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,199
and care about someone else.

453
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,880
But that's that.

454
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:43,840
You have to separate the two.

455
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:45,920
Don't mix them up.

456
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,679
You're a grown-up now.
You can think for yourself.

457
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,840
Okay?

458
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:54,199
Okay.

459
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,079
All right. Cheers.

460
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,559
They're all negative.

461
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:13,840
I'll get checked again
when we get back to Bangkok.

462
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,239
Then we can tell others
I've miscarried.

463
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,079
Can we still be together?

464
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,960
And why not?

465
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,519
I didn't sleep with anyone else,
unlike what you think.

466
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,239
Isn't that enough?

467
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:39,960
I don't know.

468
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,400
What do you think?

469
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:51,320
Tell me what's on your mind, Tee.

470
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:57,480
I'm tired.

471
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,000
I can't be a good husband to you.

472
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:06,039
Not by a long shot.

473
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,360
Please don't say that.

474
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:22,360
I'm sorry

475
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,639
I've been constantly pressuring you.

476
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:30,079
I was never embarrassed
of you or anything.

477
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:34,599
I just want you to be happy.

478
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,360
If we can't have a baby,

479
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,360
then it's okay.

480
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:49,880
I don't understand you at all.

481
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,920
Why are you putting up
with someone like me?

482
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,519
Because I love you.

483
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:11,239
Don't you love me anymore?

484
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,079
Oh?

485
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,960
You can keep smoking.
I won't complain.

486
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:06,880
No, it's bad for kids.

487
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:12,840
But don't do it too much,
or you'll look old.

488
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,239
Too late.

489
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,440
Mm. You really are old.

490
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,199
Oh? Don't remind me.

491
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:33,679
Come on.

492
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,159
Calm your horses.

493
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:38,920
I told you you're still handsome
even if you're old.

494
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,079
Whoa.

495
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:44,840
But you have to take
care of yourself, you know?

496
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,639
Hm?

497
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:50,079
Where do I find the time to do so?
What should I do? Botox?

498
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:53,599
You don't have to go that far.

499
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,400
All right. Should we get
some facial masks?

500
00:39:57,639 --> 00:39:59,239
- Hm?
- Right now.

501
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:01,039
- Right now?
- Mhm.

502
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,639
I'll go and grab some. Wait here.

503
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,800
And don't go anywhere.

504
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,719
Stay still.

505
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,360
There.

506
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,159
You're handsome now.

507
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:25,719
- Have you ever done this?
- No.

508
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,559
I already know. I was just asking.

509
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:30,360
Don't smile. It'll crease.

510
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:47,639
Pupha.

511
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:49,119
Hm?

512
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,400
I want to ask you about something.

513
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:54,679
Mm.

514
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,000
What if...

515
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,159
you were my age?

516
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,039
Give me an answer as a man, okay?

517
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:07,239
Do you think

518
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,840
I'm girlfriend material?

519
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,960
What are you doing?
Hey, don't remove it yet!

520
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,880
I quit. It's very sticky.

521
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,719
Oh?

522
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,159
- It hasn't been four minutes.
- I'll do it later.

523
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:31,840
I'll take it off too then.

524
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:38,079
That was a serious question though.

525
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:43,800
What kind of question was that?

526
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:47,840
I'm just curious

527
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:51,440
if I'm okay as a woman.

528
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,679
Of course you are.

529
00:41:57,519 --> 00:41:59,400
Can you describe it in detail?

530
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,960
I know

531
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:03,559
the question is inappropriate,

532
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,400
but I don't know who else to ask.

533
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,599
All right. Fire away.

534
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:12,960
The thing is

535
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:15,679
Atra is

536
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:17,800
a lovely woman.

537
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,679
She always looks after other people.

538
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:23,480
As for Ami,

539
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,880
I don't want
to praise her or anything,

540
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:29,000
but she's super-smart.

541
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:31,519
So I'm wondering

542
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:34,360
how guys see me.

543
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:38,159
You're a lovely girl.

544
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:40,840
You're full of energy.

545
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:43,679
And you're straightforward.

546
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,639
Anyone would probably be happy
when they're with you.

547
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:51,360
Why is it "probably"?
It should be for certain.

548
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:53,719
Well, if you don't misbehave.

549
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,079
And do you think

550
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:03,840
I'm sexy?

551
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,880
Like,

552
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:08,239
- when you see me, you want to...
- Hey.

553
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:10,199
Enough. Hold that question.

554
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,079
Come on.

555
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:14,719
It's just a question. Answer me.

556
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,880
It depends
on individual taste, doesn't it?

557
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,440
Each person has
their own preferences.

558
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:24,559
I know it does.

559
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,800
But...

560
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:28,960
That's why I'm asking you

561
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:31,320
if I'm all right in that regard.

562
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:36,199
I'm expecting something.

563
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:37,960
Mm.

564
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:40,639
What do you mean by "Mm"?
Do you mean I'm all right?

565
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:41,719
Mm.

566
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:55,880
Eat up.

567
00:43:58,199 --> 00:43:59,199
It's for the baby.

568
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,440
It's hungry.

569
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:07,639
Hello.

570
00:44:07,719 --> 00:44:08,719
Take a seat.

571
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,079
Sky, where's Mesa?

572
00:44:12,199 --> 00:44:13,800
She's unavailable.

573
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:19,840
You had a fight, didn't you?

574
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,480
That's relationship life.
You'll reconcile.

575
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:26,760
Toast?

576
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:31,800
Do you want any more?

577
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,679
No, it doesn't feel
like a vacation at all.

578
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:37,559
Alone again.

579
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,000
Right, Ari.

580
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:41,960
- Wine?
- Do you have morning sickness?

581
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,880
Not yet. I can eat everything.
Don't worry.

582
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,239
Just be careful.

583
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:50,800
Sky's mom didn't have
morning sickness either.

584
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,960
She only had cravings.

585
00:44:54,039 --> 00:44:55,519
Tee, be prepared for it.

586
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,518
I will.

587
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,239
I heard you wanted
to discuss a project with me.

588
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,400
Uh...

589
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:10,320
We can talk at work.

590
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,960
So I can do a presentation too.

591
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:16,360
Hey, just do it.
Save the presentation for later.

592
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:18,360
I want to know about your idea.

593
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,159
Well, I want to open up
a separate unit

594
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,119
specifically
for movies and TV series.

595
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,039
There's no production phase.

596
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:32,639
There'd be creatives and writers

597
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,679
so that the stories can
be sold to investors.

598
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:37,239
Interesting.

599
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,719
You don't get much from
commercials these days either.

600
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,639
It's good you're panning out.

601
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,880
Have you found a team?

602
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:50,280
Do you know
who you're going to sell to?

603
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,039
I haven't looked.

604
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,199
I thought I should talk
to you guys first.

605
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,360
Hey, don't wait. Do the prep now.

606
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:02,760
Set up a team. Get a marketing plan.

607
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,639
Otherwise, you won't be ready.

608
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,119
I'm still not that confident.

609
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,400
But I'll give it a try.

610
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:14,280
Come on.

611
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,440
You already have a good idea.
I'll support you

612
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:17,920
and talk to Taurus.

613
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,679
He's fed up
with commercials as well.

614
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,559
- Okay.
- And you're the team lead.

615
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,119
You have to be confident.

616
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:29,920
Besides,
you're about to be a father.

617
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,440
You can't be indecisive.

618
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,079
- Okay.
- Pupha,

619
00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:39,920
can we not discuss this here?

620
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:41,960
You can do it at work.

621
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:44,079
Mm.

622
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:46,719
Anyway,

623
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,239
you should hurry up.

624
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,840
You won't have time
after the baby's here.

625
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,280
You'll barely get any sleep.

626
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:56,480
- You won't be able to focus.
- Okay.

627
00:46:56,639 --> 00:46:59,559
Pha, just leave Natee alone.

628
00:47:04,519 --> 00:47:05,960
You should worry
about your family instead.

629
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,039
Ari.

630
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:19,000
All right, everyone. Let's toast.

631
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:20,920
Sky? Tara?

632
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:23,199
Natee.

633
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,239
Ari, come on. Oops.

634
00:47:25,719 --> 00:47:27,639
All right. We'll do it wirelessly.

635
00:47:36,679 --> 00:47:38,400
What's wrong?
Why aren't you drinking much?

636
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,920
I don't have an appetite.

637
00:47:42,679 --> 00:47:44,760
Hotel food is boring.

638
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,239
- What do you want?
- That explains it.

639
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,159
I'll have the ham.

640
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:05,679
Ari.

641
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,079
- Pha.
- Are you okay?

642
00:48:10,039 --> 00:48:12,239
I'm sorry about what
happened at the table.

643
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:15,159
There's been a bit of a problem.

644
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,199
But we'll be able to sort it out.

645
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:25,440
Is there anything you want
to tell me? I'm all ears.

646
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,039
No.

647
00:48:40,039 --> 00:48:41,039
Pha.

648
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,920
Oh? I'm about to take a shower.
Do you want to shower together?

649
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,239
How long have you
been sleeping with Chess?

650
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:24,800
Pupha found out.

651
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:29,760
I guess I'll have to quit my job.

652
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:31,599
Don't overthink it.

653
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,760
I promise I won't cause you trouble.

654
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,239
Oh, Peng?

655
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,360
Don't think too much
if you have feelings for Chess.

656
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,440
I've been paying him money.
