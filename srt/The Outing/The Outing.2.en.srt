1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,240
Jane,

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,919
who won the Employee of the Year?

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,839
Someone's not getting it for sure.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,839
- I think it might be Nu.
- Mm.

5
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:20,879
Hm?

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,440
I'm wondering about something.
I heard some gossip.

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,800
Is it true Sirin's family is
going to invest in our company?

8
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:31,120
The news came from Nu.
I think it's true.

9
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:33,039
Really?

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,920
If Sirin actually starts
running the place,

11
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:38,439
won't we have to find new jobs then?

12
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:41,439
Why do we have to be cautious?

13
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:45,880
Because professional and personal
matters will merge into one.

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,679
The company's going to collapse
if Sirin and Anan break up.

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,240
And why are you jinxing it then?

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,560
I'm not.

17
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,520
Well, Anan's such a womanizer.

18
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,879
(The Outing)

19
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,319
The maximum number of people
who can play is four.

20
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,240
It uses all of the parts
of your body.

21
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,599
Let's say I'm the spinner,

22
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,879
and it's your turn, Xena.

23
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,639
I spin it. There.

24
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,759
Say it lands on green

25
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,000
and right-foot.

26
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,240
So you have to place
your right foot on green.

27
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,400
If it lands on a cloud,

28
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:16,520
it means you have to put
your right foot in the air

29
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:17,400
and hold it there.

30
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,319
And what if...

31
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,639
That's right.

32
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:23,000
If it lands on the T...

33
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,879
If it lands on the T...

34
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,759
Raise it now.

35
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:31,120
- Right foot on green!
- Jane!

36
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,400
Hey!

37
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,520
Right hand on yellow!

38
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,840
Jane!

39
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,280
Your right hand, Chess.

40
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,639
Right hand in the air. Easy.

41
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,800
Jane, left hand on yellow.

42
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,159
Chess, on red.

43
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:46,680
Bottoms up!

44
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,000
Bottoms up!

45
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,199
- Bottoms up!
- Bottoms up!

46
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,000
What are you doing?

47
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,719
Left foot on red.

48
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,800
Hold on.

49
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:55,919
Uma is still doing okay.

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,240
- Don't go down, Uma!
- I'm not!

51
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,280
All right! Xena fell over!

52
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,000
Get up!

53
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,719
Right hand on red.

54
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:09,000
Chess, right hand on green.

55
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,039
Nonsense.

56
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,840
Right foot on blue.

57
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,039
Whoa!

58
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,319
- Can you do it?
- Can you?

59
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,639
Can you?

60
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,600
- Headbutt him!
- Come on!

61
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,920
- Headbutt!
- Can you do it?

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,079
So what now?

63
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,920
- Ooh!
- Whoa!

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,639
Can you do it? It's easy.

65
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,800
It landed on the T again.

66
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:31,120
Xena, right hand on yellow.

67
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,399
Whoa!

68
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,240
- It's so difficult.
- Do it.

69
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,279
Just a second.

70
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,639
How am I going to reverse?

71
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,839
You can put it down.

72
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,839
Right. Over here.

73
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,839
Put it there!

74
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,480
Are you cheating?

75
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,560
- Are you okay?
- You're about to topple over.

76
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,639
Come on. Right hand.

77
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,720
Get going! It's doable.

78
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,720
It's on the mat! Hurry up!

79
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,360
- Are you cheating?
- No, it's still there!

80
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,920
- It's still on!
- Keep it there!

81
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,800
Go down!

82
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:02,360
Right foot on red.

83
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,720
Ugh, it's hard!

84
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,720
- Where?
- Right foot on red.

85
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,759
You're falling over!

86
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,240
You lost!

87
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,279
Someone's dying!

88
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,920
I give up!

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,480
I'll sit down with you!

90
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,160
Two more laps?

91
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,560
How many more curves?

92
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,040
You had too much last night.

93
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,319
Hey, slow down.

94
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,399
- Chess.
- How come you're this fit?

95
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,079
You've got bigger muscles
than I do. What's wrong?

96
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:46,439
I'm just sore.

97
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,839
See? I misspoke.

98
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,639
It's not your heart.

99
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,800
Nearly there.

100
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,839
Aren't you even panting?

101
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,040
I am.

102
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,399
- Why are your strides so far apart?
- Pick up the pace!

103
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,040
Whoa, you're going backward!

104
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,079
You jerk!

105
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,560
Come on!

106
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,079
Oh? What is this?

107
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,199
Chess!

108
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,560
You're up early.

109
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,800
Oh? Atra.

110
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,319
How are you? Hungover?

111
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,839
I don't think so.

112
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,639
Where did you guys go for a run?

113
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,800
Around here.

114
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:41,319
- Do you want to come along?
- Sure.

115
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,160
Great. Okay.

116
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:45,199
I want to run another lap. Let's go.

117
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:47,079
Can you just stay away?

118
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,079
Don't lift me up like that!

119
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,920
Come on. Let's go.

120
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,639
- Listen to me.
- What?

121
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,040
It's really not my thing.

122
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,920
I'm begging you. I'm going now.

123
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,879
- Bye!
- I can't take it anymore.

124
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
What's with him?

125
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,319
Bye!

126
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,680
How many laps have you run?

127
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,720
Like three or four.

128
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,399
- Let's go.
- Let's.

129
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,160
That's a lot.

130
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,920
Hey, wait up!

131
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,319
Hold back next time.
You were so wasted.

132
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:56,560
Maybe find a wingman.

133
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:59,360
It's dangerous if you behave like
that somewhere else, understand?

134
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,959
Okay.

135
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,839
I'll ask you next time.

136
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,199
- Just a second.
- Atra!

137
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,480
Oh?

138
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,720
I need to take this.

139
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,600
- Nu.
- Hm?

140
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,919
- Can you help me with something?
- What?

141
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,799
All of the photos I took
are overexposed.

142
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,480
Can you help me adjust it?

143
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,080
Sure. I'll have a look.

144
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,679
Why are you out taking photos alone?

145
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,840
There was nothing else to do.

146
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,320
Hm.

147
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,320
I think it's good now.

148
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,919
- You're taking a photo now?
- Yes.

149
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,559
One, two...

150
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,399
Just a second.

151
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,240
One, two...

152
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,320
Yes.

153
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:30,440
Before 10 a.m.?

154
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:32,200
Does my face look okay?

155
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,080
Of course. You're cute now.

156
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,000
One, two...

157
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,879
Let's include the tree.

158
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,480
One, two...

159
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,440
It should be on time.

160
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,240
Sure. Thank you.

161
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,639
Good thing
it's not that sunny today.

162
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,399
- Mm.
- What are you guys up to?

163
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,759
Taking photos.

164
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,399
Do you want
to take a photo together?

165
00:09:58,759 --> 00:09:59,759
Sure.

166
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,840
Come on.

167
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Just a second.

168
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,639
- Can you help me down?
- Here.

169
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,559
Okay. Hup.

170
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,000
- Oh? I'm in the middle?
- Mm.

171
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,799
And now what?

172
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,480
My face looks so big.

173
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,759
Here. Come over.

174
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,840
Over here, Atra.

175
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:18,919
Wow.

176
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,360
- Is that okay?
- Top-down.

177
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,879
- Okay.
- Bottom-up will give you

178
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,960
give you a double chin.

179
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,559
One, two...

180
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,200
One, two...

181
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:30,440
Is that okay?

182
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,000
One, two...

183
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,759
It should be okay.

184
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,600
My knee hurts.

185
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,159
Ah!

186
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:42,320
What is this? It's funny.

187
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:46,399
Let's take another one.
Come a little closer.

188
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,799
- Okay.
- Come on.

189
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:50,320
One, two...

190
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:54,039
Three.

191
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,639
I'll take lots of shots.

192
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,519
What are you doing, Neree?

193
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,879
Some work preparation.

194
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,080
You're hard-working.

195
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,639
What time are you leaving?

196
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:33,039
Soon.

197
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,639
Is Pha up yet?

198
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,559
He is. He's in the shower.

199
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,360
Rin left me
drinking wine alone last night.

200
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:53,080
Are you traveling with the company's
vehicle or driving yourselves?

201
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,240
Uh.

202
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,559
I'm thinking we'll drive ourselves.

203
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:01,559
Pha probably will as well.
He doesn't like traveling in the van.

204
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,080
- Okay.
- By the way, Neree.

205
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,080
I remember now
what your cologne smells like.

206
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,879
Anan's.

207
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,559
Doesn't it?

208
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:24,320
No idea.

209
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,919
- Neree.
- Yes?

210
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,120
Do you know how to golf?

211
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,639
I played with my dad,
but it's been a while.

212
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,919
Great.
Do you mind going in my place?

213
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,279
Let her join you instead.

214
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:47,120
Your call.

215
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,639
Is that all right?

216
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,480
Of course.

217
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,000
I'll tell Jane
you're not going with her anymore.

218
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,240
You can use my clubs. I don't mind.

219
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,399
Okay.

220
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:12,840
All right. Giddyup.

221
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,279
Oops.

222
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,919
- There.
- It's dusty.

223
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,919
Where did you go last night?
You got back so late.

224
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,200
Partying with the employees.

225
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:29,960
You missed out
because you were busy being drunk.

226
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,480
How could you even vomit that much?

227
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,159
True.
I was completely wasted last night.

228
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,320
- Atra.
- Hm?

229
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:47,320
Were you close to Wiz
when you were at uni?

230
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,759
No.

231
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,519
He was just one
of the upper-year students.

232
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,879
And...

233
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,879
have you ever had a crush on him?

234
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,879
Honestly,

235
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,519
if I'd known him first...

236
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,559
I wouldn't leave him for Ami.

237
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,480
Silly! He's your sister's boyfriend!

238
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
He's already taken.

239
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,879
Stop talking nonsense.

240
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:30,279
You really haven't
had a crush on him?

241
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:33,960
Mm.

242
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,759
This.

243
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,799
You don't like him?

244
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,279
Isn't that normal?

245
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:01,960
It was nothing.

246
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:06,080
All right. If you insist.

247
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,279
Delete it.

248
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,879
I thought you said it was normal.

249
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,159
Ami might see it. That's all.

250
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:21,679
I don't feel like coming clean
about nonsense.

251
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,440
Okay.

252
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,440
Delete it now.

253
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,759
I'll do it in a bit.

254
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,039
Oh?

255
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,480
Are you ready? Who first?

256
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,480
Me?

257
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,879
Me first then.

258
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,960
Come on.

259
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:19,039
Nu.

260
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,679
Hm? What?

261
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:27,759
Can I come with you?

262
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:32,799
Hm? How come
you're acting differently today?

263
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:34,480
I thought you didn't enjoy going out.

264
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,519
Well, I need a change of atmosphere.

265
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:40,759
So I want to come with you.

266
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:45,159
It's hot out.
It's going to be tiring.

267
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,720
Even Sky's not going with Mesa.

268
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:50,440
It won't be long. I'll be back soon.

269
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,279
Are you mad about last night?

270
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,039
What are you talking about?

271
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,519
About me...

272
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,440
not letting you...

273
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,000
Well, I love you,

274
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,240
but I'm just not ready yet.

275
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,799
Mm!

276
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,079
Don't take it to heart.

277
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,440
I'm not mad at you.

278
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:38,079
Don't overthink it.

279
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,480
Really?

280
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,720
- Mm.
- Are you ready, Nu?

281
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:47,839
Yes, I'm coming.

282
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,599
I'll be right back.

283
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,480
Look at you.

284
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,759
- It's hot today.
- I know.

285
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,039
Is the course okay?

286
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,119
It's great.

287
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:26,880
You overshot.

288
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,799
Just a little bit. It'll be fine.

289
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,240
Come on.

290
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:31,960
- This early?
- This early.

291
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,920
Ahem.

292
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,559
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi.

293
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,680
Okay. Everyone's here.

294
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:44,119
How should we split into teams?

295
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,319
Hm... rock-paper-scissors?

296
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:50,160
All right. We can split up.

297
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,799
But I'm not pairing with you.

298
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,519
Because you suck!

299
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,920
Pu!

300
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Hm?

301
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:57,680
Hope you're as good at golf
as shooting your mouth off.

302
00:18:57,759 --> 00:18:59,559
Oh?

303
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,039
Hey, calm down.

304
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,400
What?

305
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,119
I'll pair with you, Taurus.

306
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,720
Sure.

307
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:09,440
Hey,

308
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,119
you have a bright future
if you pair up with me.

309
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,039
I'll take you on a world tour.

310
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,279
All right, all right.

311
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,880
Okay. I'll pair with Ari.

312
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:22,599
Okay.

313
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:25,880
Go on.

314
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,599
- Whoa.
- Nice shot.

315
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:54,720
You're always on top form, Anan.

316
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:55,839
Easy-peasy.

317
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,599
What do you think of my teammate?

318
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,599
Wait and see.

319
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,119
I've got a good teacher.

320
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,519
Go on. Good luck.

321
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,000
Are you okay? Do you remember?

322
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:24,720
How should I hold the club?

323
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,200
I forgot.

324
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:32,279
Line yourself up with the ball.

325
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,160
Okay.

326
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,200
Keep your eyes on the ball.

327
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:39,880
Spread your legs a bit wider.

328
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,920
Grip it tight here and loose there.

329
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,319
Okay.

330
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,599
Bend your knees a little.

331
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,160
There. Give it a shot.

332
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:08,359
Whoo!

333
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:11,680
So? How's my team?

334
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,519
Not bad.

335
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:26,359
Natee, you're up.

336
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,960
Why are you taking so long
to check the alignment?

337
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:27,279
Hey.

338
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:29,359
So I can get a hole-in-one.

339
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,279
What's up with these two?

340
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,599
I think they're a lost cause.

341
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:41,359
Look at your executive.

342
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,480
Ari?

343
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,799
- Oh? Over there.
- Ari?

344
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:48,079
That couple as well.

345
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:50,359
They're always arguing.

346
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:54,279
- Ari!
- The wife's always angry,

347
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:56,079
and the husband's super chill.

348
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:17,319
Here's some water.

349
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:20,599
Thanks.

350
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:26,039
You can go back. I'll manage.

351
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,559
It's okay.

352
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,119
Excuse me.

353
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,279
You're mad because of
what I said last night, aren't you?

354
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,599
You know I love you, don't you?

355
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,400
Let me join you.
It's quite nice here.

356
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,759
I wonder what's gotten
into Pupha lately.

357
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,839
It's much harder
to talk to Sky than it used to.

358
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,599
Is there a problem
in your family too, Sirin?

359
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:46,000
No, there's no problem.

360
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:49,279
Except for Ami. It's hard
to know what she's thinking.

361
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:57,240
Tara, stay single.

362
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:59,039
Solitude is the best.

363
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,519
You only have stepchildren.

364
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:03,359
That's enough headaches as it is.

365
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,839
Tons of women out there, but he
ended up falling for his employee.

366
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:12,400
You too, Apa. Be careful.

367
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,880
You'll go crazy
if Peng strays out of line.

368
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:29,839
Are you leaving now?

369
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,240
Yes.

370
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,759
I have an online call in a bit.
I need to be on standby.

371
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,960
Mm. Good luck. I hope you get it.

372
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:39,079
Thanks.

373
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,799
Sirin,

374
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:02,559
why did you let her
play golf with Anan?

375
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,119
You didn't know,
or are you pretending to be stupid?

376
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:08,880
Cholly!

377
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,559
Thanks so much
for worrying about me.

378
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:23,119
But you have to deal
with certain things

379
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,880
using your brain.

380
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,359
Let me handle
my private matters myself, Cholly.

381
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:33,079
I'm going up to my room.

382
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:47,720
Watch your step. You might trip.

383
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:49,799
It's okay. I'm healthy.

384
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,079
Hey, can I ask you something?

385
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,799
Hm?

386
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,880
Are you uncomfortable
dating the boss's daughter?

387
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:01,200
A little bit.

388
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,240
Why? Because of her dad
or her sister?

389
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,799
What is this?
What kind of question is that?

390
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,240
Why? Is it about Mesa?

391
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
That's right.

392
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,160
She doesn't care
about anything at all.

393
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,720
Now that she's
dating Sky, she's like,

394
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,920
"I don't care.
I have someone's backing

395
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,240
and a protective shield."

396
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,640
Maybe you're just overthinking it.

397
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:26,640
No, absolutely not.

398
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:29,880
So can you tell me now
why you're uncomfortable?

399
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,960
Well,

400
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,440
probably because it's hard
to know how to behave.

401
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,519
There wasn't anything at work,

402
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:39,079
but it's more obvious out here.

403
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:41,039
This outing isn't

404
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,240
like going out with friends.
It's like another form of work.

405
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:48,680
It might be even more
uncomfortable here than at work.

406
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,200
But you two are still in love,
aren't you?

407
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,200
Well, yes.

408
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,078
And if you had to choose
between work and Ami,

409
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:00,119
what would you choose?

410
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,559
I don't know.

411
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,720
What about you?

412
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:07,359
What would you choose
between Taurus and work?

413
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:10,640
Work, of course. There's nothing
between me and him anyway.

414
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,319
Then I'd choose work too.

415
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,200
Ami's not my boss.

416
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:49,839
Ami.

417
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,519
I'm back.

418
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,519
So? Did you miss me?

419
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:03,599
Very much.

420
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,720
What's wrong? You look down.

421
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:09,720
Nothing's wrong.

422
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,200
This is my natural face.
Haven't you gotten used to it?

423
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,599
Well, I'm more used to your smile.

424
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:25,079
I feel like going home now.

425
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Same here.

426
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:30,160
Should we just sneak out and leave?

427
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:35,880
You can do that, but I have to stay.

428
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,480
Mm.

429
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,720
Hm?

430
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,599
The others are calling
for a regroup.

431
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,400
Shall we go?

432
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,680
You go ahead.

433
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,799
Let me sit here for a bit.

434
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:01,400
Hmm, okay.

435
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,039
I'll go and shower.

436
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,160
Catch up once you're done here.

437
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,960
- Anan.
- Hm?

438
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,799
I was just talking to Dad,

439
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,119
so I arranged a meeting with him
to discuss the investment.

440
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:44,400
Okay. But I can't confirm it yet.

441
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:47,200
We'll just discuss the details.

442
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,640
You don't need my family
if you've already found an investor.

443
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Okay.

444
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,599
- Anan.
- Hm?

445
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,039
Can you give me a hand?

446
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,279
Jane, do you want this one?

447
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,720
It's okay.

448
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:17,519
Take some ham. It's good.

449
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:21,599
What do you think?

450
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,799
- Pha's good at his job too.
- Mm.

451
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Hm?

452
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,480
I'll talk to the Singaporeans again
about the investment.

453
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,920
I don't think

454
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,400
being funded by Sirin's
family is going to work.

455
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,039
I have zero comment about this.
It's up to you two.

456
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:47,400
But I'll agree with your decision.

457
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:51,240
But aren't things uncertain
with the Singaporeans?

458
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:54,160
Is there a problem with Sirin?

459
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,880
If it's about what Cholly said,
pay no mind to that.

460
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,039
I think it's easier for us
to manage things ourselves.

461
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,319
Let's think about it later.

462
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,720
All right.
Come and sit at the table.

463
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,880
Okay.

464
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
- Jane.
- Well?

465
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:11,400
Is that rare?

466
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,239
Go and grab more meat. It's good.

467
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,679
Maybe for dessert?

468
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,000
You're supposed to eat it first.

469
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:17,280
There are only shrimp heads now.

470
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,400
See? We're out. Just the heads.

471
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,239
Hey.

472
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:26,159
Do you want some?

473
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,639
Not yet. I'll take water.

474
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,559
Congratulations, Ari.

475
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,400
Pupha told me about it.

476
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:42,119
Thank you.

477
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,119
You shouldn't have gotten
pregnant just yet.

478
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,519
I have no one else to drink with.

479
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,679
Tara doesn't drink either.

480
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,400
Do you want a girl or a boy?

481
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:54,559
Whichever's fine.

482
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:56,559
That's true.

483
00:34:57,239 --> 00:34:59,320
They'll decide their own gender
once they've grown up anyway.

484
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,440
People nowadays
are very open-minded.

485
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,159
Can you serve me?

486
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,519
The others too?

487
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,320
No need.

488
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:16,480
That's a huge bite.

489
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:18,920
Oh? Isn't Atra sitting with us?

490
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,480
Over there.

491
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,480
She's with the employees.

492
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,880
- She fits in.
- Oh.

493
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:30,920
Come on.

494
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:34,159
- All right.
- Let's toast.

495
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,280
Oh, you're not
going to toast, Chess? Okay.

496
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:45,679
Hey.

497
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,320
Who do you think is going to win
Employee of the Year?

498
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,239
Jane and Wiz, obviously.

499
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,119
I don't know. But Jane's going to.
She carries the whole company.

500
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:56,920
Nothing is certain.

501
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,399
Should we do it this way?

502
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,480
We all get an equal share
of the winnings.

503
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:00,639
Are you stupid or something?

504
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,599
- Moron.
- What's gotten into you?

505
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:04,280
Count me out as well.

506
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,360
You're out of your mind.

507
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:08,039
Look who's talking.

508
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,440
Everyone,
I'd like a bit of your time.

509
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,760
All right. I'm going to announce
the winners for

510
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,519
both female
and male categories soon.

511
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:25,639
Make some noise
if you're not drunk yet!

512
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:26,880
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

513
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,280
- Whoo!
- Yay!

514
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,480
- Yay!
- Whoo!

515
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:35,599
Allow me to say something.
Thank you for coming tonight.

516
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:37,679
We've been working hard
for the whole year.

517
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,760
Tara, can you come up onstage
to present the award?

518
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:44,119
Give it up for Tara.

519
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,159
Whoa, Anan!

520
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:53,480
You're so generous!
Someone could settle down with this!

521
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:56,719
All right.

522
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,880
Let's start
with the male category first.

523
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,679
Employee of the Year
in the male category goes to...

524
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:08,239
Taurus!

525
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,079
Hold up!

526
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:12,039
- What?
- I don't think so!

527
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:13,440
No fair!

528
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Employee of the Year
in the male category goes to...

529
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,880
Nu!

530
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,039
Thank you.

531
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:34,360
As for the female category,
the award goes to...

532
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,960
Cream!

533
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:38,719
- Yay!
- Whoo!

534
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,239
Thank you!

535
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,679
Toast!

536
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,159
Of course she got it.

537
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,440
Most definitely.

538
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:45,880
Okay. Let's toast.

539
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,840
All right. Please come up onstage.

540
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,840
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

541
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,239
Is it okay if I say something?

542
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,400
I'm afraid I'll have to say yes.

543
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:56,320
First of all,
congratulations to both of you.

544
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,320
But I have a question.

545
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:01,400
What's the selection criteria

546
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,599
for Employee of the Year?

547
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,280
Work performance.

548
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,880
Was the decision only made by you,

549
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:12,320
or were Pupha
and Taurus involved too?

550
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,159
We discussed it among ourselves.

551
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,920
The thing is

552
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:25,039
I don't have a problem
with it or anything.

553
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,239
I understand we treat
each other like friends.

554
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:30,079
Like family.

555
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,840
But all of a sudden,

556
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,599
I started to wonder
about the selection criteria.

557
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:36,880
Anan, the thing is

558
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,039
if the criteria is
to have slept with an executive,

559
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,199
shouldn't Neree get it too?

560
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:49,920
Chol.

561
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:52,159
Mesa should get it too, right?

562
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,440
She's dating someone in our family.

563
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:56,159
- Your son.
- Cholly.

564
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,760
Shouldn't there be an Intern
of the Year award for Peng too?

565
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,360
Oh, I forgot.

566
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,359
Natee,

567
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,559
You deserve to win
Executive of the Year as well.

568
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:13,519
Cholly, enough. You're drunk.

569
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:15,719
Let's get you upstairs.

570
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,119
Hey!

571
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:18,360
Don't stress, guys.

572
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,239
Like I said,
we're like a family here.

573
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:24,760
We can be frank with each other.
Isn't that right?

574
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,320
It's time to go.

575
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,558
I think you won the award

576
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:56,678
not because of me at all.

577
00:44:56,679 --> 00:44:57,599
Thank you.

578
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:00,079
If there's anything
you can't say to Ami about,

579
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,400
you can come and talk to me instead.

580
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:02,559
I can tell.

581
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,359
If you're not in love
with Ami anymore,

582
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,760
you don't have
to keep putting up with her.

583
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:10,199
Do you think being a womanizer
and sleeping around is fun?

584
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:13,359
Have you ever thought
about how our daughters feel?

585
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,799
Don't you want
to get back at Anan at all?

586
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,039
It's not just men who can
use money and power on sex.

587
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:21,639
You can do it too.
