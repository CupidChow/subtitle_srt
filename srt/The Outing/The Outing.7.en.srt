1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:10,160
(Abortion and side effects)

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,720
What are you doing?

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,119
Random things.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,679
Can I join you?

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,079
Have you known for long?

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,800
How many months along are you?

7
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:29,359
For a while.

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,799
I haven't seen a doctor yet,
so I don't know how far along I am.

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,399
Have you talked to Natee?

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,679
Let me know if you need my help.

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,119
Thanks. I will.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,880
If you have to see a doctor
or join a class,

13
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,759
but Natee's busy, I'm happy to help.

14
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,920
I know what you're thinking.

15
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,079
But it's none of your business.

16
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:11,439
It's not what you think.

17
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:14,840
I know you're worried about me,

18
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,000
but it's not your duty to fulfill.

19
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,560
(The Outing)

20
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,000
Peng?

21
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:26,719
Peng?

22
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,280
You're still up, huh?

23
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm just pondering over things.

24
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,680
Can I sit with you?

25
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,759
Can I have a sip?

26
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,399
Just a little. It'll be fine.

27
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,360
You look stressed.

28
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,079
Did you have a fight with Nalin?

29
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:45,199
If I got stressed
from fighting with her,

30
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:48,360
I'd have died of
a brain aneurysm by now.

31
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,199
That bad, huh?

32
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:52,399
Stay alive with me first.
Don't die just yet.

33
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,199
Taurus,

34
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,279
were you mad at me at all
when I decided to do that back then?

35
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,240
I was furious.

36
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,360
But you didn't say anything.

37
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,120
What could I say?

38
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,439
You decided to do what you did.

39
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:16,240
But I was mad

40
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,800
because you told me nothing

41
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,519
and just disappeared like that.

42
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,079
Can you imagine that?

43
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,160
Then I turned around
to look at myself

44
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,600
and wondered
what kind of a person I was

45
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,879
and why my sister was too scared
to tell me what she was about to do.

46
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:39,519
And now? What do you think?

47
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:41,720
I'm still mad.

48
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:45,839
But about the cost of the wedding
and the dowry.

49
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,959
Just forget it.

50
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,959
It's all in the past now.

51
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,959
I'm only worried about Tara.

52
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,199
You shouldn't have
brought Peng along.

53
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,720
I didn't think things through.

54
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,399
I just wanted Peng to get along
with the other employees.

55
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:14,240
I'm sorry.

56
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,920
You don't have to apologize to me.
Go apologize to Tara.

57
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,439
I feel sorry for her.

58
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,040
Hey, wake up. Let's go for a run.

59
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,759
What's wrong with you?

60
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,160
I can't do it.

61
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,519
You go ahead. I'll pass.

62
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,600
Why did you wake me up?

63
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,600
You didn't close the tent properly
last night. I couldn't sleep at all

64
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,800
because of the mosquitoes.

65
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,519
I'm up now, so you have
to get up too. Come on.

66
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,959
You're a mess.

67
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,839
What were you up to last night?

68
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,079
I chilled.

69
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:21,079
Right. Where's Peng? Didn't he ask
to stay the night here?

70
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,279
I don't know.

71
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,439
Anyway, I'm going now.

72
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,560
Hey.

73
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,959
- What?
- Bring me something to eat.

74
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,920
Do you really think
I'd do that for you?

75
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
No.

76
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,279
Right. So why did you ask?

77
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,800
What are those boxers
you're wearing?

78
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:40,920
I'm going now, or it'll get too hot.

79
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,519
Hey!

80
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:45,639
Close the tent.
There are mosquitoes about.

81
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,680
Ugh.

82
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,079
How kind.

83
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
Can I sit with you?

84
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,519
Sure.

85
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,840
What kind of tea?

86
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,559
Earl Grey.

87
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,480
Where's Peng?

88
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,360
He's still asleep.

89
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
What were you going to say just now?

90
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,279
Oh, I was going
to apologize about Peng.

91
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,360
I didn't know you were
coming to the outing.

92
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,679
So I...

93
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,279
I'm feeling a bit uncomfortable.

94
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,879
I'm sorry
for not thinking it through.

95
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,480
Mm.

96
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,639
I'm sorry as well for being rude.

97
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:08,360
I didn't mean it.

98
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,720
I'm ordering scrambled eggs.
Do you want some?

99
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,279
You still don't
eat breakfast as always.

100
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,159
I'm completely the same as before.

101
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,559
Why are you back so early?

102
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,080
Chess, can I have a word?

103
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,480
What's up?

104
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,279
Are you mad at me?

105
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:17,080
Why would I?

106
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,639
I'm not mad.

107
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,600
Well, about last night,

108
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,799
why didn't we...

109
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:29,159
You already have a girlfriend.

110
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,360
I don't want any trouble.

111
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,519
If I wasn't dating Apa,

112
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,759
you'd be okay, wouldn't you?

113
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,960
Maybe? I don't know.

114
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,919
I'm thinking
of breaking up with her.

115
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,039
Huh?

116
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:54,639
Why?

117
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:57,279
Take it easy.
Think about it carefully.

118
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,840
I've been thinking for a while now.

119
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,879
I don't love her anymore,

120
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:03,320
and I don't know what's
the point of staying with her.

121
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Here.

122
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,519
Did you get any good photos?

123
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
Some.

124
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,080
Cholly was such a pain last night.

125
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:52,919
The party was ruined.

126
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,360
Very.

127
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,120
Everyone got an equal share.

128
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:58,279
I was planning
on partying all night long,

129
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,120
but everything got ruined.

130
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,919
You must be lonely then.

131
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,320
Pupha and Anan both got in trouble.

132
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,120
Where did you go afterward?

133
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,120
Did you continue to drink
in your room?

134
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:10,120
Ari can't drink.

135
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:15,440
Well, I did drink a bit
when I got back.

136
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,279
Taurus...

137
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,559
Is it hard to be a father?

138
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,159
It is.

139
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,759
It's freaking hard.

140
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
Aren't you going

141
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,879
to even give me a pep talk?

142
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,080
It's really hard.

143
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,159
But well...

144
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,159
You'll enjoy it eventually.

145
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:01,399
Can I ask you another question?

146
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
What is it?

147
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,480
I know you love Nalin very much

148
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,559
even though you adopted her.

149
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,840
Did it take long

150
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,080
before you loved her
like your own daughter?

151
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:29,080
I can't really say.

152
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,799
It just happened one day.

153
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:41,799
You'll just realize it's your child.

154
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,720
Don't stress about it.
Just look at Pupha.

155
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,480
He's been a doting father to Sky
even since the ultrasound session.

156
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,559
You don't have to care
about anything else now.

157
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:17,399
Just care about Ari.

158
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,960
Go easy on her.

159
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,720
She's pregnant
and prone to mood swings.

160
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,039
What are you doing?

161
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:05,399
Looking at Wiz's photos.

162
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,639
What?

163
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,559
Well, he's Ami's boyfriend.

164
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,480
I know that.

165
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,600
I haven't done anything, have I?

166
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,759
But you can't be so sure either.

167
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,120
That's bold.

168
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,240
Gee,

169
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:27,399
don't you have urges too?

170
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,639
None whatsoever.

171
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,120
- Sky?
- Huh?

172
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:37,960
Is it that obvious?

173
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,279
Mm, definitely.

174
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,960
Aren't you going to tell him at all?

175
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,960
How could I? I can't tell him.

176
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:50,639
Aren't you uncomfortable
keeping it to yourself?

177
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,840
If I were you,

178
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,519
I'd just tell him.

179
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,600
Then he can decide.

180
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,360
And what if he turns me down?

181
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:02,960
Then let it be.

182
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:06,960
I can't do that. We might not
be able to be friends again.

183
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,039
There hasn't been a friendship
even since you fell for him.

184
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,519
Do you have
only one friend in your life?

185
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,960
If you're worried
he'll turn you down,

186
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,680
then find someone else
who turns you on.

187
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,759
Xena!

188
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,960
If you wait for too long,

189
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,559
someone might take him away.

190
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,079
I wouldn't wait if I were you.

191
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,279
But I guess someone's
already taken him away.

192
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
Hey!

193
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,720
I can't do that.

194
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,680
I can't tell him.

195
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:56,480
I'm not forcing you to confess
your feelings to him or anything.

196
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:59,799
I'm just suggesting some options.

197
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:03,119
Because I'd do that

198
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,920
if I were you.

199
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,039
(Sky)

200
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,839
Okay, okay. I'll leave.

201
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,039
- "Hello, babe."
- Hey, get lost!

202
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,119
Hello?

203
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,000
What?

204
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,279
Lin, do you think
Mesa's going to like it?

205
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,680
Sky,

206
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,519
I have to tell you something.

207
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,440
Well,

208
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,519
actually,

209
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,920
I like you.

210
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:04,759
I have for a long time,

211
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:06,799
but I didn't
have the courage to tell you.

212
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:07,960
I was worried I might lose a friend.

213
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,680
But I'm so uncomfortable right now.

214
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,559
I felt I had to let it out.

215
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,960
I like you.

216
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,680
Lin,

217
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,680
do you think
Mesa's going to like it?

218
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:09,599
Lin?

219
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:12,319
- Lin?
- Huh?

220
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,599
What's wrong with you?

221
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,680
Do you think
Mesa's going to like it?

222
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:20,079
How should I know?

223
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:22,480
You should.

224
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:26,559
You guys have similar tastes.

225
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:27,960
Really?

226
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:30,559
Mm.

227
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,000
Mesa helped me pick
your birthday present last year.

228
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:35,319
You liked it.

229
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,680
Well, it was pretty.

230
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,839
Mm.

231
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,359
Why are you going to
give this to her?

232
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,440
It's for our first anniversary.

233
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,599
Time sure flies.
It's already been a year.

234
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,680
I need to use the bathroom.

235
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:10,839
Okay. Sorry for calling
for a meeting now.

236
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,920
The project was postponed, but now
the client's rushing us to finish.

237
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,960
So we're going to do a recap today.

238
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:18,400
Then we'll be able to get started
as soon as we get back.

239
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,000
Okay. The smaller campaigns
and events have all been approved.

240
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:25,559
We'll gradually release clips of
celebrities interacting

241
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:26,799
with the product.

242
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,359
As for the film,
what did Taurus say about the theme?

243
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,319
I already followed up with him.
But he's being a bit fussy.

244
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,279
But it's okay.
It should be done after this.

245
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,920
Anyway, I'd like
to set up another meeting.

246
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,599
It will be Uma,
Cream, Chess, and Pupha.

247
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,880
- Sure.
- Okay.

248
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,480
They asked
for three storyboards, didn't they?

249
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:44,440
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

250
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:47,839
I've sent Anan
the invoice for outsourcing.

251
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,920
We just need his approval.

252
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,599
It shouldn't be a problem,
but it's still a bit scary.

253
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,799
But he's approved
all of the presenters, hasn't he?

254
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,000
- Yes, he has.
- Okay.

255
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:00,160
So it means we only have to keep
the product to ourselves for now.

256
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:02,240
- Mesa, have you handled it?
- Not yet.

257
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:04,920
The presenter hasn't confirmed it,

258
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,920
so I haven't requested
the product from the client.

259
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,119
So when are we getting it?

260
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,599
Monday.

261
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,960
But Monday's a public holiday, Mesa.

262
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:14,519
They'll have to prepare
the product for us too.

263
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,680
The celebrity we have a deal with is
going on a vacation and has to bring

264
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:24,759
the product with them.

265
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,720
They're flying out on Tuesday.
Will it make it on time?

266
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,359
But it's a night flight.

267
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,400
We can hand over
the product at the airport.

268
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,640
Don't you know it exceeds
the carry-on size allowance?

269
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,720
Do you want a celebrity to open up
their luggage at the airport?

270
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:41,440
All right. When's the earliest
you can handle it?

271
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,559
I'll check.

272
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,759
Today's a public holiday.
Who'd respond to you?

273
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,160
Mesa, I didn't ask you to do much.
How did you let this happen?

274
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,799
Jane, we kept postponing it,
and people were complaining.

275
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,160
So I'm just waiting
for confirmation.

276
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,559
I respect your decision.

277
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,640
But we work as a team here.

278
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,240
Talk to the team first
so we can solve problems together.

279
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,960
You've been working in production

280
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,200
and as part of a team
for a while now.

281
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,799
Haven't you learned anything?

282
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:15,720
If I can get my hands
on the product, that's it?

283
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:16,960
Yes.

284
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,000
Right, Chess.

285
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:29,160
Have you checked with the client
what's necessary for the stills?

286
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,079
That's what Pupha told me.
There's no in-house.

287
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:36,960
I'll confirm it with Anan later.

288
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:39,680
It's a big account for sure,
but he's a friend of Pupha's.

289
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:41,559
In case he's able
to sell something else.

290
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,720
- Mm.
- Mm.

291
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,559
Okay. Then everyone's
workflow is still the usual.

292
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,359
I'll give you another update
if something comes up.

293
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,160
Okay.

294
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,880
(Sky)

295
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,400
(Sky)

296
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,640
- Hello?
- Have you finished?

297
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:39,480
Can you come and see me in my room?

298
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,960
I'm sorry. I'm busy right now.

299
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:43,279
Oh, that's okay.

300
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,680
I can come to you instead.

301
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,400
Sky, I'm busy. I have to go.

302
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,240
You're starting early.

303
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,880
It's an outing.
Is it wrong to drink?

304
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,359
Just don't get too drunk.

305
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,920
I won't. I have self-control.

306
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,880
Nalin.

307
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:37,559
What?

308
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,400
Dad, can I ask you something?

309
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,359
Is it fun to have an affair?

310
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,960
Do you feel guilty at all?

311
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,880
I want to give it a try.

312
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,039
You're drunk.

313
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:53,200
I'm not.

314
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,440
Nalin.

315
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:57,119
Go to sleep.

316
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,400
- Nalin!
- Dad!

317
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,759
I'll stop, but you have to
to answer me first.

318
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:03,960
Nalin!

319
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,720
Nalin, don't!

320
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,480
Hit me, just like you used to.

321
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,359
Can I ask you something?
Why did you adopt me?

322
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,759
If you're so lonely, get a dog
You'll be in full control.

323
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:18,880
- Nalin.
- I'm a person.

324
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,480
Taurus.

325
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,119
Taurus, let her go.

326
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,200
Taurus,

327
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,240
calm down.

328
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,880
What happened?

329
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,240
Are you hurt?

330
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,480
I hate Dad.

331
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,519
Calm down, Nalin.

332
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:56,160
He probably didn't mean it.

333
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Thanks.

334
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:28,519
Awesome.

335
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:32,559
They're stressing over work.

336
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,200
Is it okay for us
to be chilling like this?

337
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,880
Let me teach you something.

338
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,640
There are always problems

339
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:39,440
when there's work.

340
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:42,160
We just have to gradually
solve them. Don't overthink it.

341
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,279
So this is a usual occurrence?

342
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:46,440
Yes, and I'm fed up with it.

343
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,680
Honestly, I really enjoy work.

344
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,960
But I totally dislike conflicts.

345
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,799
I wish I could win the jackpot
so I don't have to work anymore.

346
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:00,680
Would you really
be able to stay put?

347
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,039
You're very hardworking.

348
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:03,240
Of course.

349
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,599
It's tiring to stay put too.

350
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,559
Really?

351
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,599
All right. What would you want to do
if you had a lot of money?

352
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,759
I don't know. I've never had money.

353
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:15,279
You have to open up a chef's table.

354
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:16,519
You're good at cooking.

355
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:18,240
Enough with it.

356
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:19,359
The business would go under
if I was running it.

357
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,119
Let's stop talking
about these things.

358
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,240
There's only one day left to relax.

359
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:25,839
Okay.

360
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:37,880
What?

361
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,680
Get in.

362
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,960
I'll jump in.

363
00:29:57,079 --> 00:29:58,079
Go for it.

364
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,559
Hey.

365
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,400
Oops.

366
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,160
- Hmph. You jerk.
- You started it.

367
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,480
Do you have a crush on me?

368
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,279
Mm.

369
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:49,680
What are you on about? Nonsense.

370
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,039
How many days
have we known each other?

371
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:14,079
Nalin,

372
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,160
have you eaten anything?

373
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:18,519
Uh, not yet.

374
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:20,839
Order something if you're hungry.

375
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,759
What's wrong?

376
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:49,079
Nothing.

377
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:51,160
"Nothing."

378
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,960
You had a fight
with Mesa, didn't you?

379
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,400
Know-it-all.

380
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,079
With that smug expression,
how could it be anything else?

381
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,519
Come on. It's major.
You'll have to give her some time.

382
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:08,880
- What's major?
- Oh?

383
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,920
Her forgetting to request
a product from a client.

384
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,799
I overheard Jane.

385
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,920
Really? So what should I do?

386
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,920
Hm... should you try helping her?

387
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,279
- Help her?
- Mm.

388
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,720
Ugh. I'll pass.

389
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,640
I haven't done anything
and still got a telling-off.

390
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,759
- She never asked for your help?
- Never.

391
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,200
For real?

392
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,039
Let's do it this way.

393
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,319
Try helping her,

394
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,119
but don't let her find out.

395
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,880
- Seriously?
- Mm.

396
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,039
Try telling your dad.

397
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,599
I think he can help.

398
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,119
Hm...

399
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:20,519
Peng, is something the matter?

400
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:30,000
Should we take a bit of a break?

401
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,559
Sure.

402
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:46,880
Your call.

403
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,679
You don't love me anymore, do you?

404
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,480
I can tell.

405
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:03,320
I don't know. I...

406
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,679
I understand.

407
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:14,159
I've gone through it before.

408
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:20,639
You have a crush
on Chess, don't you?

409
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:32,320
Why are you crying?

410
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:40,599
Don't cry.

411
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,320
I'm sorry.

412
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,320
Just be yourself.

413
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,679
You don't have to care
about what other people might think.

414
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:56,920
You don't even have to care
about what you are.

415
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,280
- All right. Let's toast.
- Cheers.

416
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,960
Go on.

417
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:37,800
Good!

418
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:39,960
What took you so long
to start drinking?

419
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:41,239
Is something bothering you?

420
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:44,280
A lot of things, actually.

421
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:47,039
Hey.

422
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,519
Tell us.

423
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,719
I think my daughter hates me.

424
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,679
I don't think so.

425
00:36:57,079 --> 00:36:58,639
That's how daughters are.

426
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,280
Honestly, sometimes I think

427
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,920
we might not be
on the same wavelength as them.

428
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:07,760
But they're really
difficult to understand.

429
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,639
So what was
the fight about? Tell us.

430
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:15,320
She thinks I'm a scumbag. That's it.

431
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,039
- Well, you are.
- You are.

432
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,440
What is this?

433
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:20,039
Just come to terms with it.

434
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,599
We all fought with our parents
when we were younger.

435
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:26,719
She'll understand once she grows up.

436
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,119
Come on. Let's toast.

437
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,920
There.

438
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,320
(MIRASIERRA)

439
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,199
I have to tell you now

440
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,440
I don't do consultations
with life problems.

441
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:34,000
Did you two have a fight?

442
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:39,159
Why?

443
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:42,000
Is it that obvious?

444
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,440
Mm.

445
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:50,199
We'll probably
have to break up in the end.

446
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:54,920
How come? Has he found someone else?

447
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,280
That's another issue.

448
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,559
But he doesn't love me
for who I am anymore.

449
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,039
Tara,

450
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,320
what I wanted to tell you is...

451
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:22,199
I'm truly sorry.

452
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:29,119
I only cared about myself back then.

453
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:33,440
How should I say this
without making it sound horrible?

454
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,920
If I kept pretending
not to feel anything

455
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,440
and spending my life
with you as a spouse,

456
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,280
I'd end up hating myself.

457
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:47,679
And I didn't want you
to put up with living

458
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:50,559
with someone who had to hide this
for the rest of their life.

459
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:53,880
Honestly,
I really wanted to tell you.

460
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,920
But it was very hard
for me at the time.

461
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,039
And what have I done wrong?

462
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:14,000
It's been ringing in my mind
this entire time.

463
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:15,920
"What have I done wrong?"

464
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,920
I didn't know back then

465
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:22,639
how I'd continue to live.

466
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,559
I didn't even know what to do

467
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:31,639
or how I'd wake up
without you right next to me.

468
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,199
But after I reached a certain point,

469
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:40,599
I only thought

470
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:43,760
about why I'd care about the world.

471
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:47,719
Other people didn't
even care about me.

472
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,519
The person I loved the most

473
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:54,199
didn't either.

474
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,639
And do you know what's funny?

475
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,480
Once I behaved
like I was worth something,

476
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,920
I'd be mad at myself every time.

477
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,000
Because it made me realize

478
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,880
that I was worth nothing.

479
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:21,559
On the contrary,

480
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:25,960
it was so satisfying

481
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:30,440
when I beat myself up.

482
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:38,320
But that's it.

483
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,719
Then I realized

484
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,000
what I did

485
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,760
didn't make anything better.

486
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:53,079
It seemed like I'd
come to a realization.

487
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,800
And then everything started

488
00:42:57,519 --> 00:42:59,119
taking a turn for the better.

489
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,280
But that wasn't the case at all.

490
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,360
Life is so funny, isn't it?

491
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:09,679
Don't forget
to give me back my shirt.

492
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,519
I've broken up with Apa.

493
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,440
Why?

494
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:25,639
I don't love her anymore.

495
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:28,039
I don't see the point
of us staying together.

496
00:44:33,159 --> 00:44:34,360
So what now?

497
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,639
Nothing.

498
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:47,119
And now I know

499
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,039
what I actually like.

500
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,320
Hey.

501
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:05,920
I have to get back to work.

502
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,880
Keep drinking if you want to.
Just tidy up for me.

503
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:08,960
See you.

504
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,440
Jane.

505
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,719
- Hi.
- Are you busy?

506
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,280
Uh, a little.
Is something the matter?

507
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,920
Can I talk to you?

508
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:58,960
Sure.

509
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,320
I know about the product.

510
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:02,760
I'll handle it for you.

511
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:05,800
Just send it over to me
once you get it.

512
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,480
Cholly and the client are
good friends.

513
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:12,000
Can I give it a try so we won't
have to ask her for a favor?

514
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:15,840
Sure.
But don't stress about it, okay?

515
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,199
By the way, is there any wine
left from the extra order?

516
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,599
Sure. I'll have Mesa send it over.

517
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,360
Okay. Thank you.

518
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,440
No problem.

519
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,400
Mesa, are you free? Come and see me.

520
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,199
I noticed you were in trouble.

521
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:01,639
So I just wanted to help.

522
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,039
If I can't help
when you're in trouble,

523
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,079
then why bother
being in a relationship?

524
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,320
Then we should break up.

525
00:51:55,639 --> 00:51:57,320
What did you
fight about this afternoon?

526
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,880
Is it Sky?

527
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,119
What right does Dad have
to teach me anything?

528
00:52:02,199 --> 00:52:03,880
It's not like he's perfect.

529
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:05,880
You know I like you,
don't you, Jane?

530
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:06,960
You're drunk.

531
00:52:07,639 --> 00:52:08,960
Go to sleep.

532
00:52:10,519 --> 00:52:11,880
Let go. You're hurting me.

533
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:13,119
If you refuse to let me go,

534
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:15,199
I'll quit my job.

535
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:18,239
Why doesn't anyone think
about my feelings at all?

536
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,480
Wait.
