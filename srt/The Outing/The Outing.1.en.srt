00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,960
(MIRASIERRA)

2
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,560
Greetings, ma'am.

3
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,919
How was the drive over?
Are you tired?

4
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,159
A little.

5
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,000
- When did you arrive?
- A while ago.

6
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,080
Thank you.

7
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,199
Can you give me back
my sunglasses now?

8
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:29,000
Stingy.

9
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,879
Do I look nice with sunglasses?

10
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,159
Quite so.

11
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,680
It means you don't. Give them back.

12
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:40,319
Why didn't you say I do?

13
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,000
I said, "Quite so."

14
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,719
Don't argue. I brought two pairs.
Take these.

15
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,719
Thank you.

16
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,400
Toodles.

17
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,560
Let's head in.

18
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:59,599
- Whoa.
- It's beautiful.

19
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,039
Can you take a photo of me?

20
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,719
Huh? Come on.

21
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,719
- I'm going to my room.
- I want a photo.

22
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:08,080
- Hi.
- Hi.

23
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,800
Here's the key to your room.

24
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,439
You can head there now.
It's ready for you.

25
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,520
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

26
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,079
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

27
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,959
It's very big.

28
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,399
Oh!

29
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,600
- Oh? Hi.
- You're here too?

30
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,839
- Hey!
- You got here fast.

31
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,040
I just got here.

32
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,639
- Hi.
- You're as pretty as always.

33
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,920
Thank you.

34
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,040
- I've missed you.
- I've missed you too.

35
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,920
- Let's go for a walk.
- Okay.

36
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,160
I thought you weren't coming.

37
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,600
I didn't want to,
but I didn't want to argue either.

38
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,600
It's good you came.
I almost forgot what you look like.

39
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,839
You're exaggerating.

40
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,079
What about Ami?

41
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,120
She's coming with her boyfriend.

42
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,480
- Boyfriend?
- Ami has a boyfriend?

43
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,720
She sure does.

44
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,120
Who is it?

45
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,079
A guy in the company.

46
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,160
Really?

47
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,360
How was the trip?
Was it difficult to get here?

48
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,879
It was.

49
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,120
Indeed. Chess was driving in circles
in a village for hours.

50
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,800
What are you on about?
Talk about exaggerating.

51
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:22,199
Jane, look at the posh food
at the back and see

52
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:22,959
if we have everything.

53
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,279
Is that all of the toiletries?

54
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:34,439
Why? Is something missing?

55
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,240
There don't seem to be that many.

56
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,959
How many do you want?
This isn't our house.

57
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,240
- Shut up.
- Hey!

58
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:45,399
- What?
- Xena?

59
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,560
Why?

60
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:50,839
Why did you step on my bed
with your shoes on?

61
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:56,120
Pink luggage.

62
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:58,040
Gee, it's new.

63
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,759
My clothes are also new.

64
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,319
Ami's cream is new too.

65
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,639
Hey, you're messing
with her things again.

66
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:11,639
- Hey!
- Xena.

67
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,879
Just a little bit.

68
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,000
Don't rope me in if you guys fight.

69
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:17,879
It smells nice.

70
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:21,279
- No, give me the cream.
- It's really nice, honest.

71
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:24,399
It really is. Smell it.

72
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:25,879
Come on.

73
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,319
It really is nice.

74
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,040
Don't pretend you do nothing wrong!

75
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,879
We haven't been
on a trip together in a while.

76
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,639
Should we find some time to go out,
just the two of us?

77
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,720
Sure, but let's wait
until the company's stable.

78
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,160
You still haven't found an investor?

79
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,720
The economy's not
doing so great right now.

80
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,160
So people are too scared to invest.

81
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,480
The advertising business is also

82
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,480
losing revenue.

83
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,600
I hinted at Dad.
He seemed interested.

84
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,360
I'll try talking to the others first.

85
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,639
Okay.

86
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,399
Oh? Why are you soaking wet?

87
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:26,600
It was Sky and his stupid prank.

88
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,319
He pushed me into the water.
The documents got wet as well.

89
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:31,120
Will you be able
to prepare them again in time?

90
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,159
- No idea.
- Neree?

91
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,960
Neree?

92
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:36,639
Let's go for a swim.

93
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,919
I'll pass.
I don't want to wash my hair.

94
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,600
- Oh?
- But I'll still come with.

95
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,720
What? You went for a swim
and didn't wait for me?

96
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,440
What are you on about?

97
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,240
Let's go.

98
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:11,240
You're going to drain the pool!

99
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,919
Look at him!

100
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:20,440
What's wrong with him?

101
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,120
Would you like anything else?

102
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,000
- I don't think so.
- Thank you.

103
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,759
I'll go and prepare for the meeting.

104
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,840
Sure.

105
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,480
Get in.

106
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:32,960
Not yet.

107
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,480
- No!
- Get in now!

108
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,799
Hey.

109
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,440
How did you do that?

110
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,360
- How?
- Like this.

111
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,879
Extra time.

112
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,320
- Duck your head.
- Go.

113
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,039
Are you guys drunk yet?

114
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,720
Shut it. Come here now. You're late.

115
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,200
- No, I'll pass.
- Aw.

116
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,759
Do you want to join us?

117
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,399
- You guys go ahead.
- How are you doing?

118
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,320
How many outfits
did you bring, Xena?

119
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,279
So, how are we doing?

120
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,519
- Come here.
- Both of us will sleep in a tent.

121
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,759
- Get over there.
- How are you doing?

122
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,720
Get in and join us.

123
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,879
I'm not ready. This is white.
I didn't bring a change of clothes.

124
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,279
- Hey!
- Ah!

125
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,399
Sky!

126
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,399
- Sky, you jerk.
- It's all waterproof.

127
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,679
- Ugh.
- Get in.

128
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:20,879
- It's white. I have to get changed.
- Go on.

129
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,159
- Are you okay?
- I'll go and get changed.

130
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,639
- Mm.
- See you in a bit.

131
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,320
That was too much.

132
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:30,759
I only splashed her. Get in.

133
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:32,039
Just a second.

134
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,360
- That was harsh.
- Too harsh.

135
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,840
Hey, Nu!

136
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:38,679
- What?
- Take a photo with my phone.

137
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:40,720
- Over there.
- Oh.

138
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:42,879
All right. Let's do it.

139
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,480
Jane, Tara, do you want to get in?

140
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,200
You go ahead.

141
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:48,440
- Here.
- Okay.

142
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,200
- All right.
- Come on.

143
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,639
One, two, three.

144
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:53,840
Mm! Chess!

145
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,799
Another. One, two, three.

146
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:57,080
- Ha!
- Ah!

147
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,039
Another one!

148
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,840
Another! One, two, three!

149
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,399
Mm.

150
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:05,840
Not yet! Don't!

151
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,000
Don't you dare!
You're always pranking!

152
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,799
- Take a look.
- What do you think?

153
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:12,159
Whose phone is it? Oh, yours?

154
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:14,519
- Do you think it's okay?
- You think so?

155
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:17,440
Wisanu, let's go.
The guys are ready for the meeting.

156
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,360
See you.

157
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,240
Bye!

158
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,399
I'm sorry for making you wait.
I took a bit of time to get dressed.

159
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,080
I told you to turn,
so why didn't you?

160
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,519
The sign said to go straight.

161
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,720
And who was right in the end?

162
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,320
Sheesh.

163
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,519
Get to the meeting.
The others are waiting.

164
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,720
Take the luggage with you. Hey.

165
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,159
Hi, I'm sorry.

166
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:07,240
Please continue.

167
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:14,879
Black seafood spaghetti.

168
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,399
Didn't I say no shrimp
when I ordered it?

169
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,159
It's okay. We'll sort it out.

170
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,440
My apologies.

171
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:34,960
Did I say you could have it?

172
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:37,600
You're not going to eat it anyway.

173
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:41,759
You have to ask before taking food
from someone else's plate.

174
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,399
I'm teaching you manners.

175
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,559
Here. Take my plate.

176
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:47,279
Or you'll have
an allergic reaction again.

177
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,080
And if you don't like it,
we can order something else for you.

178
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:53,000
Okay?

179
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,440
You can take it back.

180
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:02,159
Mm!

181
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,600
Well, you're not allergic.

182
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,559
It's good we swapped plates.
It's quite spicy.

183
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:10,600
You won't be able to take it.

184
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,360
An investor is
going to join us soon.

185
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,720
But I'm not 100 percent sure.

186
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:27,200
We'll have another meeting
after we get back.

187
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,960
If nothing goes wrong,

188
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:31,399
we'll stick to the original plan.

189
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,840
All right? I'm just giving you
a heads-up so you can be ready.

190
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:39,360
Has Sirin talked to her family?

191
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:46,159
Anan, let me ask you something.

192
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,360
Don't we have any other
sources of investment?

193
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,519
Wouldn't it be chaotic
if Sirin's family

194
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,440
comes in to run the place?

195
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,960
There has to be
someone on the board.

196
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,320
Besides,

197
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,200
Sirin's not thinking of coming in
to run the place anyway.

198
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,200
Uh... If there's nothing else,

199
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,679
let's wrap up so we can relax.

200
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,200
It's not every day
we get to go on an outing.

201
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,200
Jane.

202
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,080
That was quick, Taurus.

203
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,600
Let's go, Tara.

204
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,679
All right.

205
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,360
Let's go and relax.

206
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,679
Sirin, you're not mad at me,
are you?

207
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,480
It's not that I don't
want to work with you.

208
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,759
I just wanted things to be clear.
It's better than arguing later.

209
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,679
We'll have to wait
until they discuss it again.

210
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:13,480
I think Pupha
and Taurus are down for it.

211
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,200
Cholly, would you like
to order dinner now?

212
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:25,679
So I can bundle everything in one go.

213
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:32,200
And Sirin, Anan's ordered tofu salad
and mushroom risotto for you.

214
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,600
Sounds good.

215
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:38,440
I'd like...

216
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,000
salmon salad and grilled
chicken with rosemary.

217
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,559
Take a look at the wine first.
Sometimes it's not chilled.

218
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,679
Of course.

219
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,360
Did you put on men's cologne?
That's weird.

220
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,840
That's right.

221
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,600
I don't like sweet-scented perfume,
so I use men's cologne.

222
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:58,360
It smells nicer.

223
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,919
- Excuse me.
- Mm.

224
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:46,840
Excuse me, Sirin.

225
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,400
Are you really not going
to play golf tomorrow?

226
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,039
No, it's not really my forte.

227
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,920
Here. Take this
in case it's cold tonight.

228
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:28,880
Thank you.

229
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,079
But if you go,

230
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,039
you'll get to discuss the project
with Dad and the others.

231
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,079
Hm...

232
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:43,880
I'd rather be with you, Ami.

233
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,839
Hey, I'll head inside.

234
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,480
You two go ahead.

235
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:58,039
I'll go and get Wiz.

236
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,079
- All right.
- Wiz!

237
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,920
- Wiz!
- Hm?

238
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,240
Are you there?

239
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,599
I am.

240
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:06,079
Come on out.

241
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:07,799
Okay!

242
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,039
Just a second.

243
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,720
What?

244
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:22,799
Ami,

245
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:27,599
I'll wait in the next tent for now.
Come by when you're finished.

246
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,039
Okay. I'll be right there.

247
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,400
- Hey.
- Hm?

248
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,480
Why are you so good at this?

249
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:49,519
I studied to be a chef.

250
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:51,400
My dad paid for it.

251
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,359
Are you guys going to get fired
smoking this?

252
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,880
Maybe.

253
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,119
Just kidding! That's silly!

254
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,559
You shouldn't have asked
since she's already doing it.

255
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:03,039
I'm just an employee after all.

256
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,880
Oh, Ami?

257
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,160
Oh?

258
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:11,920
I'll go back to my room.

259
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,880
It's okay. I'll walk you.

260
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,720
Don't worry. Stay with your friends.

261
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:18,599
I can go on my own.

262
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:20,160
Oh.

263
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,240
It's okay.

264
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:25,200
Standing up and acting all cool.

265
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,839
What? I was going to walk her.

266
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:30,319
Women.

267
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,079
Oh, Ami.

268
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,400
Did Atra give you
a list of universities?

269
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,319
You have to start looking now.

270
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,519
She did.

271
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,400
And have you picked one?

272
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,319
Anywhere. You can tell me.
Just name a country.

273
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,720
I don't know yet.
I'll tell you after I've decided.

274
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:55,240
I'll go. Don't worry.

275
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:25,359
Have you slept with Wiz, Ami?

276
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,720
What kind of question is that?

277
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:36,720
It's only a question. Just tell me.

278
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,920
I don't think
it's any of your business.

279
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,400
Why would you want to know about it?

280
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:43,440
And uh...

281
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,640
What does he like about you?

282
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,359
Have you guys
ever thought of breaking up?

283
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,880
I'm not trying
to jinx it or anything.

284
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:04,400
I'm just curious
about what people are thinking

285
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:07,680
when they decide to start dating.

286
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,359
Look at Mom and Dad.

287
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,000
They got married and then divorced.

288
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:15,119
It seemed so simple.

289
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,559
So I'm wondering

290
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,799
if people usually
have second thoughts.

291
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,960
But I don't think
you're going to break up.

292
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,279
Wiz seems to be super into you.

293
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:42,279
Does my hair look okay?

294
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:45,400
- I think so.
- Okay.

295
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:47,799
I'm going now. Hurry up, okay?

296
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:35,480
Sirin, have you seen my cologne?

297
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,759
It's in the trashcan.

298
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:40,839
I was going to tell you ages ago
that I didn't like that scent.

299
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:05,599
- Atra.
- Huh?

300
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,680
Are you doing all right?

301
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,519
Of course.

302
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,440
Come on. I'll walk with you.

303
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,240
Hey, it's nothing.
You don't have to.

304
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:16,319
Chill.

305
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,279
You were so good at it.

306
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,000
Did you learn that at university?

307
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:26,480
Just a little.

308
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,279
- Really?
- Mm.

309
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,880
Of course. Isn't it normal?

310
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,960
Our seniors were always drunk.

311
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:38,519
- Really?
- Mm.

312
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:40,640
You seemed nerdy back then.

313
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,319
I didn't expect you
to be that adventurous.

314
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,680
Hmph.

315
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,480
Of course, I was a nerd.

316
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,880
Who'd be brave enough
to be as adventurous as you?

317
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,839
You guys looked scary.

318
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,119
Huh? We looked scary?

319
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,359
We're actually lovely.

320
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:56,720
You were just assuming things.

321
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,720
I definitely wasn't.

322
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,480
Oh?

323
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:07,759
Are you coming
to dinner with me, Atra?

324
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,559
You go ahead. I'm drunk.

325
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,599
What about you? Are you hungry yet?

326
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,519
No.

327
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:20,359
You go, Ami. I'm going
to shower and get changed.

328
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:23,480
Okay. I'll wait over there then.

329
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:24,920
Mm. Sure.

330
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,759
Do you want to dip it?

331
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,720
Do you want to?

332
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,720
Did you watch it?

333
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,079
- This one.
- Sure.

334
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,359
Guys.

335
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:50,118
Hey, don't reach over me.

336
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,159
(Shall we meet up tonight?)

337
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,519
Sorry. I just want some pork.

338
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,799
Isn't it delicious?

339
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,799
It is.

340
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,319
Do you want more of this?

341
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,640
Isn't it supposed to be fish?

342
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:09,799
Hey, what is this called?

343
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,960
The tuna's really good.

344
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:23,920
I'm quite tired tonight.

345
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,960
I'll give the party a pass
for one night.

346
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:27,200
Oh? How come?

347
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,519
I'm exhausted.

348
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,720
Excuse me.

349
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,519
Is the water enough?

350
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,440
Watch out. You might get drunk
if you keep drinking water.

351
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:45,119
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

352
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,880
Thanks.

353
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,759
It makes sense you're a creative
director from New York.

354
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:10,440
Thanks.

355
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:14,880
- Should I tell everyone then?
- Sure.

356
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:16,960
- All right.
- Fire away.

357
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:25,440
Everyone, can I have
a bit of your time?

358
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:26,559
We have something to announce.

359
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:28,119
Pupha.

360
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:29,599
The thing is

361
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:33,319
we don't keep secrets
from each other in this company.

362
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,359
As you all know, we're planning to
enter the stock market.

363
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,759
If nothing goes wrong
after this outing,

364
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,680
we'll get more and bigger gigs.

365
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:47,720
And that means
we'll earn more money.

366
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:52,559
After that happens, we'll take you
on an outing overseas next year.

367
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,480
- Seriously?
- Yes!

368
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,599
- Whoo!
- Awesome!

369
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,039
- Bottoms up!
- Cheers!

370
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:00,759
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

371
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:02,880
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

372
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,960
All right. Enjoy the party.

373
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,200
I'm going to get some rest now.

374
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,480
Enjoy.

375
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:15,400
Save your money. It's a waste.

376
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,799
Why didn't you
keep going with the others?

377
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,559
I wanted to be with you.

378
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:26,359
You look prim and proper,
but that's definitely not the case.

379
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,799
You guys just assume
I'm prim and proper.

380
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:34,160
Well, it's true.

381
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,920
That's why no one expected

382
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:41,440
you'd...

383
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,039
have a secret affair with my dad.

384
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,519
(NOBLE & CORAZON)

385
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:38,480
Wow, you're heaving.

386
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:42,160
You didn't even eat anything.

387
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,119
How come you're throwing up so much?

388
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:50,079
Are you okay?

389
00:32:58,279 --> 00:32:59,640
Are you okay?

390
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:05,640
Whoa.

391
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:11,400
There, there.

392
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,720
You're going to vomit your guts out.

393
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,519
Are you feeling any better?

394
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:22,079
Mm!

395
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:25,799
Thank you.

396
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:30,039
Come on. I'll walk you to your room.

397
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:32,079
Get up slowly.

398
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,000
Take it slow.

399
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,400
Oh?

400
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,240
- We're here.
- What is this?

401
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,680
Oh? All right. Lie down.

402
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,279
Okay.

403
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,880
Ugh.

404
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,920
I'm fine.

405
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,000
I'm okay.

406
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,759
What did you do?
How come you're so drunk?

407
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,480
Did you have too much to drink?

408
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,880
Uh-uh.

409
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,079
You're not making any sense now.

410
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,000
What did you guys have?
Why is she this drunk?

411
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,400
- Hm?
- Why is Atra so drunk?

412
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,239
I don't know.

413
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:15,280
I found her out front.

414
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:17,360
- Hm?
- Hmph.

415
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,960
You reek of vomit.

416
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,280
And somehow
you decided to take a whiff.

417
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:26,480
- What is this?
- Hm?

418
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:28,480
Are you worried about me?

419
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,199
You're so lovely.

420
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,440
Mm!

421
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:11,559
Atra's sleeping right there.

422
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:21,559
That's not a problem.

423
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:24,880
- Hm?
- Mm, no!

424
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,440
She's right outside.
She might see us.

425
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,119
Well then.

426
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,960
Should we go somewhere else?

427
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,440
Hm?

428
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:48,920
I'd rather not.

429
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,239
I'm still not ready.

430
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,440
Mm.

431
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,119
I understand.

432
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,119
Well then.

433
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,519
I should go.

434
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:52,239
What are you doing?

435
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,599
Well, I missed you.

436
00:36:57,039 --> 00:36:58,039
Neree,

437
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,280
we should stay away
from each other for a bit.

438
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,920
Why? Are you worried Sirin's family
won't invest in the company?

439
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,360
I have a question.

440
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,760
What are the selection criteria

441
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,760
for Employee of the Year?

442
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,559
Work performance.

443
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:18,119
Anan, the thing is,

444
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:21,280
if the criteria are
to have slept with an executive,

445
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,360
shouldn't Neree get it too?
