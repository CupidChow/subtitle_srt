1
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,000
You know

2
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:10,199
Apa is trans, don't you?

3
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:12,839
Of course.

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,199
Those two nearly got married.

5
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:18,320
She and Tara?

6
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:19,839
Yes.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,199
You might be overthinking it.

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,399
Tara is mature enough.
It's probably nothing.

9
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:34,520
But I can feel it.

10
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:37,759
Ah.

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,439
The hunch about an ex
and the current one?

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,119
That's normal.

13
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:42,920
Don't overthink it. Come on.

14
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,640
- Really?
- Mm.

15
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,119
Since I've already gotten
my nose into something,

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,840
can I go for another one?

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,320
Sure.

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,520
How did you and Apa start dating?

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,159
We met at some random party.

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,280
We talked and hit it off.

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,599
- Oh.
- Mm.

22
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:08,680
Did she tell you
from the start she's trans?

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,480
She did.

24
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,040
Whoa. That's cool.

25
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:17,319
How? Gender doesn't
really matter, does it?

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,760
Oh, I wasn't talking about that.

27
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,040
I meant to say I admire you

28
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:26,480
for choosing to follow your heart
and not caring about other people.

29
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,959
You like who you like.

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,680
That's so cool.

31
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,200
What about you?
Do you have a girlfriend?

32
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,319
No.

33
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:41,400
I don't really think
about that kind of thing.

34
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,040
I prefer to be alone.

35
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:22,039
(The Outing)

36
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,280
- We're here.
- Finally!

37
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,319
- Come on.
- Out of the way.

38
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,319
- Hey!
- Hey! What's the rush?

39
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:37,439
- Oh, jeez!
- Whoa, Chess.

40
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,879
- Uh!
- Do you want to sit down?

41
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,599
Let's take photos.

42
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,879
The rock is so smooth.

43
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,800
- Do you want to take a photo?
- Uma, take a photo for me!

44
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,759
- What's nice? The view?
- What do we have for food?

45
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,560
Come a little closer.

46
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,800
I didn't bring anything.

47
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,039
You're so useless.

48
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:59,280
The view's quite beautiful.

49
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,759
Maybe put your bags down first?

50
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,599
Let's take photos.

51
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,599
See? You're not supposed
to go over the line.

52
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:07,360
- Wiz!
- Really?

53
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,479
Ah!

54
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,599
Let's take photos.

55
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,479
Can you take it for me?

56
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,759
Behave.

57
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,719
One, two...

58
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:16,439
All right.

59
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,439
Come on.

60
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,680
Do you think I'd die if I jumped?

61
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,560
- I don't think so.
- Give it a go.

62
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,920
Here, Nu.

63
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,040
There.

64
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,800
I told you to change.

65
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,120
You eat a lot, don't you?

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And you count calories?

67
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,759
Yes, I do.

68
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,240
Why are you so fit?

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,240
- You're acting all tough.
- Here.

70
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,319
Drink this. It'll give you energy.

71
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,240
Thank you.

72
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,800
- It's everyone...
- Hey.

73
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,600
Did those two make amends?

74
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,759
I don't know.

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,240
- I think...
- Why?

76
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,680
Come on.
Let's do a department photo.

77
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,920
You stay there, Jane and Mesa.
It's nice.

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
A department photo?

79
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,800
Okay, okay. I didn't want
to be included anyway.

80
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,120
And you're rushing too much.

81
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,240
Of course. I'm all my lonesome
in my department.

82
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,319
Stop sulking, moron.
You can take photos with me too.

83
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,560
- Really.
- Come into the frame.

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Is this okay?

85
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:33,000
- It's the easiest, isn't it?
- Come on.

86
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,120
Let's do it together.

87
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,879
One, two, three.

88
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,279
Why are you taking so long
to check the alignment?

89
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,199
Hey. So I can get a hole-in-one.

90
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,399
How's Tara?

91
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,279
Is she okay?

92
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,839
I haven't heard her complain.

93
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,079
Has she found a new boyfriend?

94
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,959
I don't know.
Why don't you ask her yourself?

95
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,399
Really.

96
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,959
I think my sister didn't
give it enough thought.

97
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,279
I'm okay with her bringing him in
for an internship.

98
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:18,040
But I don't think it's okay
to bring him along to the outing.

99
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,839
My apologies.

100
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,959
It's okay. We're all adults here.

101
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:27,079
Just let the kids
handle it among themselves.

102
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,759
Besides, it's been a while now.

103
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,519
I think she should be okay now.

104
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,720
Ari?

105
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,839
- Oh? Over there.
- Ari?

106
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,199
That couple as well.

107
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,480
They're always arguing.

108
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,199
Ari!

109
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,399
What about you?
Are you seeing anyone?

110
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,639
No, I'm not.

111
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,199
That's good.

112
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,959
All right?

113
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:55,360
I think marriage is something

114
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,519
like if I could turn back time,
I wouldn't get married at all.

115
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,519
Life is tiring enough, and marriage
only adds to the exhaustion.

116
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,399
That's rich coming from you.

117
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:10,079
You're saying you're annoyed now.

118
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,279
But you'd miss her
if she wasn't there.

119
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,639
Don't tell anyone just yet.

120
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,360
So what are you going to do now?

121
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,519
I still don't know.

122
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,759
Let me know if you need my help.

123
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,840
What's wrong?

124
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,360
Did you two fight again?

125
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,360
Same old.

126
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,360
He doesn't understand things easily

127
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,960
and refuses to listen to anything.

128
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,360
He's not like other people.

129
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,840
You should take it easy.

130
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,600
I'm worried other people
might think you're difficult.

131
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,600
I understand.

132
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,960
But you need to reach a conclusion
for certain things.

133
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,080
It's like I'm the only one
making an effort.

134
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,320
It's exhausting.

135
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,360
We're getting older.

136
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,720
But he's not serious
about starting a family.

137
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,840
And he still doesn't
know I'm pregnant.

138
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,080
You are?

139
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:42,879
Mm.

140
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,000
Huh? You're pregnant?

141
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,960
- Mm.
- Hey!

142
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,320
Wow, congratulations!

143
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,480
- Congratulations to the new dad.
- Congratulations.

144
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,080
- Let's make a toast!
- Yes.

145
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,159
Finally, a junior addition.

146
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,600
(Abortion and side effects)

147
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,399
How was it?

148
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,360
It was nice.

149
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:30,559
Mm.

150
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:38,440
Right, Apa.

151
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:41,320
Did you almost marry Tara?

152
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,759
How did you find out? Who told you?

153
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,519
I don't have a problem with that.

154
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:55,120
But I don't understand
why you didn't tell me before.

155
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,840
I wanted to tell you
right from the start.

156
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,600
But I didn't have the chance, and...

157
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:09,080
Well, I didn't know she was coming
to the outing as well.

158
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:12,279
I don't have a problem with her,

159
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,279
but I don't know
how to act around her.

160
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,360
Well...

161
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,360
That's it. You probably understand.

162
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,000
I'll probably quit my internship too.

163
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,480
Why would you care?

164
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,840
We'll mind our own business.

165
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,200
Are you mad at me?

166
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,639
There are drinks and ice at the bar.

167
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:49,559
You can always tell the staff, Mesa.

168
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:52,559
But the extra wine
won't be delivered.

169
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,919
I've already informed Jane.

170
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,200
Thank you.

171
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,480
You're welcome.

172
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,639
Mesa,

173
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
do you want some water?

174
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:03,759
Not yet. I need
to check the stuff first.

175
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,840
Just a bit.

176
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:13,840
Uma,

177
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:17,240
do you think
there's enough wine for tonight?

178
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,320
I think so.

179
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,639
The employees can always drink
something else instead.

180
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
It should be enough.

181
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,159
We can go and buy more
if you think it's not.

182
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,639
I'll drive. I want to go
for a drive anyway.

183
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,240
I don't mind, no matter how far.

184
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:39,200
It's okay. I'll handle it.

185
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,639
It's nice.

186
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,480
I'll pass.

187
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:49,080
Mesa,

188
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,200
can you handle things here?

189
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,960
I'm going out to buy more wine.
I don't think we have enough.

190
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,480
I can drive her.

191
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,919
No worries. You stay here, Sky.
I'll handle it myself.

192
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:04,919
Mesa?

193
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,480
Mesa?

194
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,240
Mesa, wait.

195
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:13,919
Mesa?

196
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,039
Mesa?

197
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:20,240
Mesa, wait.

198
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,679
Can I help you?

199
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,600
Sky,

200
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:27,480
can you stop doing this?

201
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:30,039
It's my job. I can do it.

202
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:33,679
Oh? Why are you like this?

203
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,639
Do you realize

204
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,759
when you interfere with things,

205
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:41,240
it's like I'm taking advantage
of you being the boss's son?

206
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,639
But that's not what I think.

207
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:43,679
Other people do.

208
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,960
- And why would you care?
- Of course, I care.

209
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,080
I'm an employee.

210
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,039
You should go and relax.

211
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,360
I'll text you
once I'm done with things.

212
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,919
Hey, Sky! Do you want
to go and take photos?

213
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
No, I have a headache.

214
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,000
What's wrong?
Did you get into a fight with Mesa?

215
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,679
Leave me alone.

216
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:46,080
It's 20 minutes away.

217
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,798
- What if...
- Can you get me directions

218
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:50,759
to the closest supermarket?

219
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:54,679
But if it takes 20 minutes...

220
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:58,879
Why are you sitting here alone?

221
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,879
And why can't I sit alone?

222
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:09,240
I'm going out shopping.
Do you want to come?

223
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,679
Mm. But I'll drive.

224
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,639
Be careful. Don't go
over the line. Keep to the left.

225
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,000
The road is clear, Dad.

226
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,320
Just make it a habit.

227
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:45,200
Slow down. Don't go too fast.

228
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:48,799
You're not used to the road.
It's dangerous.

229
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,919
Stay focused.
You're still not that skilled.

230
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,080
You can take the wheel
if you're going to be so fussy.

231
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,120
Don't go over the line. Keep left.

232
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,480
Do you have a gig waiting
for you once we get back?

233
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:03,480
Yes, but I'm not handling it.

234
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:05,119
Jane won't let me yet.

235
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,240
Is work okay?

236
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,559
I think so. I like to be on set.

237
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:16,079
But I'm not really
keen on doing prep work.

238
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,000
Let me give you a warning.

239
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,559
You have to spend more time
doing things you don't like.

240
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,640
Otherwise, you'll make a mistake.

241
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:27,079
There are things you might
not think are important

242
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,759
but end up necessary somehow.

243
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,680
Hang on.
Did Jane hire you to say this?

244
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,359
Mm. At a high price too.

245
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,440
Well, I get what you're saying.

246
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:47,559
I'm trying.

247
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,319
But I'm just...

248
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,480
fed up.

249
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:56,759
Everyone always thinks
I'm using Sky to get ahead.

250
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,759
Honestly,

251
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:01,480
if I'd asked him to help

252
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,119
and people gossiped about it,

253
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,000
I wouldn't complain.

254
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,799
But I never asked Sky for help.

255
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:12,000
I don't know where people
got the idea from.

256
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,559
It's such nonsense.

257
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,799
I understand you 100 percent.

258
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:22,079
But if you truly love Sky,

259
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,880
you'll get through it.

260
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,119
And do you love Ami?

261
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,559
It's not that I want
a literal answer.

262
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,799
But I'm curious
about how you handle things.

263
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:38,000
Hm...

264
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,839
There's no way
to handle this kind of thing.

265
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:48,680
You just can't care
about what other people say.

266
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:51,839
Focus on work
and prove yourself to other people.

267
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,839
It'd be nice if I was like you.

268
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:01,559
But...

269
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,960
I'm living a much harder life
than you are.

270
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,960
When you're a woman,

271
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:08,960
if you start going out
with someone rich,

272
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:11,279
people call you a golddigger.

273
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:14,720
If it's someone poor,
they say you're stupid.

274
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:18,680
It's so hard being a woman.

275
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,480
Peng.

276
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:56,119
Peng.

277
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:58,599
What?

278
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:00,640
Should we talk?

279
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:04,359
What is it?

280
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,200
Should we talk things out?

281
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:08,440
What things?

282
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:10,200
Is there anything for us to discuss?

283
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,799
It feels like
you don't want to be with me.

284
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,079
It's hard to know how to act.

285
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,359
I came here as an intern,

286
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:23,359
so I have to spend time
with the others.

287
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,759
I don't want anyone
to think negatively of me.

288
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,680
I don't like it.

289
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:31,839
But you know it's not like that.

290
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,000
Why would you care if you're not
going to do an internship here?

291
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:41,279
Are you embarrassed to be with me?

292
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,079
What did you say?

293
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,200
You say that
as if you don't know me at all.

294
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,000
That's what you're making me feel.

295
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:55,559
All right. I won't go

296
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,079
if it's going to make you happy.

297
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,279
Do you enjoy cooking?

298
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,480
It depends on my mood.

299
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,720
I saw other people cooking,
so I wanted to try.

300
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,480
Does that look like it's cooked?

301
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,359
- No idea.
- Oh?

302
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:39,440
- Shoot!
- Are you okay?

303
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,440
Yes, I'm tough.

304
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:45,839
Why did I worry?

305
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,000
Hand me a plate.

306
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:50,680
How do you cut it? I don't know how.

307
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,160
Try it.

308
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:59,880
- Mm.
- How is it?

309
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:04,279
What?! Hey!

310
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,240
It's nice.

311
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,440
Oh.

312
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,440
But it's really delicious.

313
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,240
I know I'm good.

314
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,559
- It smells so nice.
- Mm.

315
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,559
Hey, something urgent came up.

316
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,720
Uma and Cream are coming.
You can stay with them.

317
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:32,039
Take the meat
from the grill. I'm going.

318
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,599
Where to?

319
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:34,680
You're just a kid.
Keep your nose out.

320
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,440
Why aren't you dressed?

321
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,519
Do you want some?

322
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:08,720
Just have a little.

323
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,880
Are you still mad at me?

324
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:20,839
I wasn't mad.

325
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Gee.

326
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,119
I'm sorry.

327
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:29,960
I'm sorry for being harsh.

328
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,440
I didn't really mind.

329
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,759
I understand.

330
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,000
I just wanted to help.

331
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:46,599
I know.

332
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:49,279
I know you do.

333
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:52,640
But it's not easy, is it?

334
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:55,640
Mm. Not at all.

335
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,759
I'll be more careful next time.

336
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:04,839
Mhm.

337
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,640
But I'm still a bit mad at you.

338
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,079
Are you hungry?

339
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,359
Let's eat.

340
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,839
- Oh!
- Useless.

341
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,359
Come on.

342
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,480
Nu, come here!

343
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,680
Save some for Jane too.

344
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:40,920
Come on.

345
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:44,119
What? I'm eating!

346
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,720
Why did you take it?

347
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:47,359
Can I sit here?

348
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,599
It's Cholly's seat.

349
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,799
- Oh.
- Do you want to sit here?

350
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,039
It's okay. You stay there.

351
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:53,240
Do you hire employees
based on their looks?

352
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,279
Is this one free?

353
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:57,440
Go on if you dare!

354
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:01,000
- I mean you.
- Don't you know when to stop?

355
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,160
- Really?
- Just eat.

356
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,240
I'll have the uh...

357
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,279
Right?

358
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,559
Do you want to get flicked
with chili dip?

359
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,240
The snacks.

360
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:16,039
The food is...

361
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,799
Do you want
to try the ham? It's good.

362
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:24,440
So, did you go out
for a walk earlier?

363
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,480
I didn't. I went out.

364
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,039
Mm.

365
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:33,039
I'm sorry.

366
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,440
I was stressed at the time.

367
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,240
Mm.

368
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:40,599
Can I join you?

369
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,799
Sure.

370
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,359
Aren't you going to tell me off?

371
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,359
Why? I didn't really mind.

372
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,160
You're definitely mad.

373
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,160
- Am not.
- Are too.

374
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,359
I'm not. What's with you?

375
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:53,680
Oh?

376
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:55,480
Okay. You're not mad.

377
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,160
Here.

378
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,559
It's really good. Eat up.

379
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,240
Spend your time making up with Mesa.

380
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,039
I already have. We're good now.

381
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,359
Mm.

382
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,799
Is this okay now?

383
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,160
Useless.

384
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,680
Let's go.

385
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:18,119
- Nu, come here!
- Save some for Jane too.

386
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,799
Hey, get me some potatoes.

387
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,359
Thanks.

388
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,720
What about me?

389
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:26,799
Oh?

390
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:29,039
Over there.

391
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:31,559
It's a buffet.
Go and get it yourself.

392
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,599
- I'll stab you.
- Don't tease her.

393
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,000
- Do you want to try this?
- Is it good?

394
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,599
It's okay.
But the meat's a little tough.

395
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,000
There's no knife.

396
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,799
Have you tried shrimp?

397
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,720
We're out.

398
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:46,039
See? We ate it all.
There are only shrimp heads now.

399
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Do you want some?

400
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,240
Not yet. I'll take water.

401
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:58,839
Congratulations, Ari.

402
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,839
Pupha told me about it.

403
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:02,720
Thank you.

404
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,599
You shouldn't have gotten
pregnant right now.

405
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,039
I have no one to drink with.

406
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,680
Tara doesn't drink either.

407
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,799
Do you want a girl or a boy?

408
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,240
Whichever's fine.

409
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,240
That's true.

410
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,119
They'll decide their own gender
once they've grown up anyway.

411
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,359
People nowadays
are very open-minded.

412
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,920
Guys,

413
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,440
who do you think is going to win
Employee of the Year?

414
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,519
I want to win.
I want to go to Japan.

415
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:39,160
And I need money to go.

416
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,680
It's got to be Jane and Wiz.

417
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,559
I don't know. But Jane will win.
She carries the whole company.

418
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,279
Nothing is certain.

419
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,440
Should we do it this way? We all get
an equal share of the prize money.

420
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:54,680
Are you stupid or something?

421
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,559
- Moron.
- What's gotten into you?

422
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,799
You're delusional.

423
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,039
Hey, let me tell you.

424
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,440
There's no splitting.

425
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:03,279
Count me out as well.

426
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,559
Everyone,
I'd like a bit of your time.

427
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,440
Make some noise
if you're not drunk yet!

428
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:13,439
Allow me to say something.

429
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,559
Thank you for coming tonight.

430
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,559
We've been working hard
for the whole year.

431
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,440
Tara, can you come up onstage
to present the award?

432
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,039
Give it up for Tara.

433
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,640
Why is the envelope so huge?

434
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,039
It's quite thick.

435
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,880
Let me see.

436
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,559
Why are you
holding your breath, Chess?

437
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,519
Leave me alone.

438
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:44,680
You're not going to win.

439
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,960
Facts.

440
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,079
Employee of the Year
in the male category goes to...

441
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:54,200
Nu!

442
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:55,920
Aw!

443
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,680
- See?
- Thank you!

444
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:03,920
As for the female category,
the award goes to...

445
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,440
Cream!

446
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,920
- Cream!
- Thank you!

447
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,759
Toast!

448
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:13,920
How come you won?

449
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,920
- It's not going to be you anyway.
- Okay. Let's toast.

450
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,920
All right. Please come up onstage.

451
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,160
Excuse me.

452
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,079
Is it okay if I say something?

453
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:24,440
Uh, sure.

454
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,440
First of all,
congratulations to both of you.

455
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,799
But I have a question.

456
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,920
What are the selection criteria

457
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,920
for Employee of the Year?

458
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,960
Work performance.

459
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,319
Oh.

460
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,799
Was the decision only made by you,

461
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,519
or were Pupha
and Taurus involved too?

462
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,440
We discussed it among ourselves.

463
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:55,799
The thing is

464
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,799
I don't have a problem
with it or anything.

465
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,200
I understand we treat
other like friends

466
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,200
or family members.

467
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,880
But all of a sudden,

468
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,440
I started to wonder
about the selection criteria.

469
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,680
Anan, the thing is

470
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,799
if the criteria are
to have slept with an executive,

471
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,559
- shouldn't Neree get it too?
- Chol.

472
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,279
Mesa should get it too, right?

473
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:24,160
She's dating someone in our family.

474
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:25,960
- Your son.
- Cholly.

475
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,039
Shouldn't there be an Intern
of the Year award for Peng too?

476
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,920
Oh, I forgot.

477
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,799
Natee,

478
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,559
there should be an Executive
of the Year award as well.

479
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,920
Cholly,

480
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,079
go to your room. You're drunk.

481
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:50,920
- Let's go.
- Hey!

482
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:54,920
Don't stress, guys.

483
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:56,440
Don't stress.

484
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,200
Like I said,

485
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,920
we're like a family here.

486
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,799
We can be frank with each other.
Isn't that right?

487
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,240
You can go ahead and relax.

488
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:22,279
Is something the matter?

489
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,119
Are there any other symptoms?

490
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,200
No.

491
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:38,119
What about

492
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:40,359
the baby?

493
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,759
What are you going to do?

494
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,759
But this has nothing to do with you.

495
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,559
I know it doesn't anymore.

496
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:55,680
But Tara,

497
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:57,880
this is a very big deal.

498
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,680
I want you to think
carefully about it first.

499
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,960
I don't want you to regret it later.

500
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:06,400
I'm telling you this
because I'm worried.

501
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,318
You can talk to me about anything.

502
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:11,680
I can take care of myself.

503
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:08,599
Cholly was right
about a lot of things.

504
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:12,480
Isn't it difficult to manage

505
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,599
when an employee dates
the child of the company's owner?

506
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:16,599
How so?

507
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,880
If Mesa or Wisanu

508
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,320
had a problem with the company,

509
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,320
no one would be able
to go up against them.

510
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,320
But Mesa never asked
for help with work.

511
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,159
And how do you know

512
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,039
she didn't approach you
for her own gain?

513
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,159
Mm.

514
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,559
Like Wiz.

515
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,599
He got the job here because of Ami.

516
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,480
I don't know about other people.

517
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:50,880
But I don't think
that's the case with Mesa.

518
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:56,000
Why are you so confident about it?

519
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,039
- Done?
- Mm.

520
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:12,159
Are you tired?

521
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:17,320
Do you want to go back and rest?

522
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,119
Let me finish this first.

523
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:26,320
I'm going to the employees' tent.

524
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,679
Are you interested?

525
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,360
Sure. Let's all go together, yes?

526
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:37,920
No, I'll stay here.

527
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:41,800
You?

528
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:45,920
No, I don't know anyone.

529
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,920
I'm so sick of introverts.

530
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,920
I'm going then.

531
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,880
Mm.

532
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:00,599
Are you sure?

533
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,320
Trust me. Oh, excuse me.

534
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,119
I'm okay.

535
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,360
That's enough.

536
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:46,599
Look after yourself.

537
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,360
Are you okay?

538
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,679
Come on. Let her be.

539
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:51,119
Go.

540
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:52,480
Just leave me, pals.

541
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,480
Oh? You're leaving.

542
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:57,119
Yes, we're about to.

543
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:58,679
Are you going to keep going?

544
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,920
I'm so drunk!

545
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,760
Look after Chess for me, won't you?

546
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,920
Do you want to go another round?

547
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,679
Oh.

548
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:11,880
I don't think I can.

549
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:14,679
I'm so drunk.

550
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,559
What are you stressed about?

551
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:26,239
If it's Cholly,

552
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:29,000
then don't overthink about it.

553
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,559
I'm not,

554
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,320
but I just don't understand

555
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:38,039
why there always has to be a benefit
when it comes to two people dating.

556
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:40,759
Would you believe me if I said
I never think about the benefits

557
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,559
when I'm dating someone?

558
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,360
Oh, Peng.

559
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,920
See?

560
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,039
You're stressed about Cholly.

561
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,360
Let's do it this way.

562
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,000
Whether it's relevant or not,

563
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:03,000
love is

564
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,679
about two people.

565
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:07,880
And that is you

566
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,239
and Apa.

567
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,239
Other people have
no right to meddle.

568
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,440
So you can stop stressing out.

569
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:20,440
Besides,

570
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:25,039
it's you and your own heart.

571
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,679
You can love whomever

572
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,920
and do whatever you want.

573
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,119
What about you?

574
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,360
Do you love anyone?

575
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:41,599
Honestly,

576
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,920
I don't really believe in love.

577
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,679
What do people actually need

578
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,679
apart from sex and money?

579
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:55,119
Hey.

580
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:59,360
I'm not saying I'd turn down
a nice romantic relationship though.

581
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,559
It's always nice

582
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,000
when there's someone to love you.

583
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,559
Mm. It doesn't have to be love.

584
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:14,199
But haven't you ever had
pleasant feelings for anyone?

585
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,599
I have pleasant feelings
for anyone I don't hate.

586
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,360
I'm not going

587
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:25,119
to waste my life
being angry with people

588
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,320
because I want to make

589
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:31,920
every second worthwhile.

590
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:35,440
Getting to be
with the person you love is enough.

591
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:37,440
Forget the rest.

592
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:45,039
Then how do you feel about me?

593
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,320
You don't hate me, do you?

594
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:52,920
I think...

595
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:56,039
a little.

596
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:58,320
Liar.

597
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,079
But I like you.

598
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,320
Huh? Seriously?

599
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,320
Thanks.

600
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,199
You should go back to Apa.

601
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:20,679
I'm going to bed.

602
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:23,320
See you later.

603
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:24,559
See you.

604
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,039
You're not going to bed?

605
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:47,800
Not yet.

606
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,800
Well, I was waiting for you.

607
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,719
So why didn't you call me?

608
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,840
I didn't want to rush you

609
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,320
and sour your mood.

610
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,559
I'm sorry on Cholly's behalf.

611
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:06,440
You're not overthinking it, are you?

612
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,519
Dad, can I ask you something?

613
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:24,480
Is it fun to have an affair?

614
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:26,639
Do you feel guilty at all?

615
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,639
Taurus, is it hard to be a father?

616
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,519
Have you known for long?

617
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:37,239
How many months along are you?

618
00:47:38,679 --> 00:47:40,480
Let me know
if I can help you with anything.

619
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,679
I know you're worried,

620
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:45,880
but it's not your duty.
