1
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,000
How's the weather nice?

2
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:46,400
It's scorching hot like a volcano.

3
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:51,759
This says it's 28°C.

4
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,919
It's definitely 30°C.
And it's winter.

5
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,439
That's as cold as
it gets in Thailand.

6
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:02,400
And how are you and Mesa doing?

7
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,159
Well, we're doing okay.

8
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,599
Go to her.

9
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,599
I'll bring your luggage inside.

10
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:17,319
Okay. Thank you.

11
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,479
Oh?

12
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,719
Your room key is with Pha.

13
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,159
Oh? Where is he then?

14
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,879
He's walking over.

15
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,439
Give me the key now. It's hot.

16
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,599
Here.

17
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,719
And where's Sky?

18
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:50,879
He went to see Mesa.

19
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,879
Bring his luggage
to his room too, okay?

20
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,719
- Hello, Pha.
- Hey. Where are you now?

21
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,159
Did you get lost?

22
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,879
We stopped at a cafe.

23
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,599
Hurry up.

24
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:11,599
Okay.

25
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,199
See you then.

26
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:19,720
Can you check the map for me?

27
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,079
I don't want
to be late for the meeting.

28
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,040
We'll get there in time.
I just looked.

29
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,160
We need to factor in extra time.
This way is a detour.

30
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,720
It's not even that much longer.

31
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,160
It is. There's still
like ten kilometers or so.

32
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,600
Well, I didn't want to use
the toilets at a gas station.

33
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:39,319
Why are you complaining so much?

34
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,720
I'm not.

35
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,759
I'm just asking you
to check the map.

36
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:01,958
Keep going straight.

37
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,199
I'll let you know
if we have to turn.

38
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,279
Okay.

39
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,000
Is the company
really making a profit?

40
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,560
Why did you guys decide
to have an outing here?

41
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,720
Why? What's wrong with this place?

42
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,040
It's beautiful, but it's still
not there yet, understand?

43
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,240
And where would that be?

44
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,040
Well,

45
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,920
maybe a five-star hotel
on an island?

46
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,920
You keep complaining about the heat
but want to go to the beach?

47
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,800
Wouldn't that be warmer?

48
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,560
It would be a different vibe.

49
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,920
We'll go there together later.

50
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,560
We just have to wait
until Anan can find an investor.

51
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,720
Pupha,

52
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,680
I know you and Anan trust
each other because you're close.

53
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,560
Do you think you can
actually trust friends

54
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,600
when there's money involved?

55
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,160
Of course.

56
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,000
I trust them.

57
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:11,680
Sometimes it's good
to be cautious to avoid pitfalls.

58
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
By the way,

59
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,000
you've been spending a lot lately.

60
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,680
Is there something going on?

61
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,920
Same old.

62
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,720
But I'll give it back
once I get the bonus.

63
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,360
All right. Let's go to the meeting.

64
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,480
You go ahead. I'll catch up.

65
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,120
Okay. I'll wait outside.

66
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,040
I feel super sleepy
when I'm in here.

67
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,120
Sure.

68
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,720
Oh? Let's go.

69
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,600
Don't you have
anything better to wear?

70
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,040
What?

71
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,360
Why?

72
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,040
It's a company outing,

73
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,160
not a personal vacation.

74
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,800
Get changed.
Wear something ordinary.

75
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,040
If you can't think of anything,

76
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,360
then use Sirin as an example.

77
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,800
Go on. Get changed.

78
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm sorry for making you wait.
I took a bit of time to get dressed.

79
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,560
I told you to turn,
so why didn't you?

80
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,119
The sign said to go straight.

81
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,360
And who was right in the end?

82
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,480
Get to the meeting.
The others are waiting.

83
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,120
Hi.

84
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,000
Take the luggage with you. Hey.

85
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,960
Hi. Please continue.

86
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,720
Okay.

87
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:51,000
I guess everyone's here. Well...

88
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,519
An investor is
going to join us soon.

89
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,600
But I'm not 100 percent sure.

90
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,000
Aren't these two cold?

91
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,360
Hey, are you drunk yet?

92
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,360
Cream,

93
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,240
are you okay?

94
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
No.

95
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,119
You know I don't
like this kind of thing.

96
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,960
I'm fed up enough with having
to see everyone's face at work.

97
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,120
But we're stuck together here too.

98
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,519
Come on.

99
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,240
Look. Free room, booze and meal.

100
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,240
Just enjoy the moment.

101
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,120
You'll be back in a few days.

102
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,960
- Uma.
- Huh?

103
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,360
I think you should
just leave Neree alone.

104
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,480
You're nothing compared to Anan.

105
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,720
What's the comparison?

106
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,240
There's something strange
between Neree and Anan.

107
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,840
I've noticed it for a while now.

108
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,240
They always sneak glances
at each other.

109
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,000
You have an active imagination.

110
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,600
It has nothing to do with me
if she's sleeping with Anan.

111
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:12,240
Trust me.

112
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,120
I can tell.

113
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,360
You used to look
at me like that too.

114
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:21,000
What do you mean?

115
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,240
Oh, I know.

116
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,240
I think

117
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:35,759
you're jealous of me, aren't you?

118
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,759
We moved beyond
jealousy a long time ago.

119
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:46,200
- Hey, can I join you guys?
- Sure thing.

120
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,919
Don't go to sleep yet. You're dirty.
Take a shower first.

121
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:35,960
Just a short nap.

122
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,919
How was the meeting?

123
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:45,559
Well, it sounds like we're going
to get funding from Sirin's family.

124
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,679
We'll probably get
to sign an agreement soon.

125
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,559
That's great.

126
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,919
If the company gets to expand,

127
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:01,399
you'll be able to finally
open your own unit.

128
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,320
Hurry up and talk to Pha

129
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,200
so he can go and talk to Anan.

130
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:16,039
Maybe I can do that
after we're back at work.

131
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,919
Do it now.

132
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,039
Find a good time
while everyone's drinking wine.

133
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,960
And find a chance tomorrow
to talk to him

134
00:12:23,364 --> 00:12:25,120
when you're out golfing.

135
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:28,120
Won't that seem rude?

136
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,039
It won't. We're all acquainted.

137
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:36,919
Mm.

138
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,399
I'll try.

139
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,600
Get in the shower. Come on.

140
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,200
So you'll look handsome
when we go out.

141
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,960
Go on.

142
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:53,559
Mm!

143
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:54,759
One kiss.

144
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:58,960
Go and shower.

145
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,039
I'm going.

146
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:35,279
Oh, right.

147
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,799
When are we going
on an overseas outing?

148
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,559
We can go right away, actually.

149
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,559
But you guys will have
to pay for yourselves.

150
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,240
- Do you have any money?
- No.

151
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:48,559
I only have someone else's money.

152
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:50,279
Gee.

153
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,120
Gee. Look. Ask that one over there.

154
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:56,399
I'm talking about you.

155
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,559
Mr. CEO.

156
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:14,960
All right. Cheers.

157
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,799
Me too.

158
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,679
I'm quite tired tonight.

159
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,240
I'll give the party a pass
for one night.

160
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,519
Oh? How come?

161
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,720
I'm exhausted.

162
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,159
Excuse me.

163
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,960
Watch out. You might get drunk
if you keep drinking water.

164
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:36,639
I know.

165
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:46,559
Right.

166
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,679
I think an overseas outing is
a good idea.

167
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,679
We can take the whole crew

168
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,559
after the company grows.

169
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,360
- Should I tell the employees now?
- Well?

170
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:58,080
You do it.

171
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,080
We're planning to
enter the stock market.

172
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,440
If nothing goes wrong
after this outing,

173
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,960
we'll get more

174
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:09,759
and bigger gigs.

175
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,759
And that means
we'll earn more money.

176
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,759
After that happens, we'll take you
on an outing overseas next year.

177
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:19,200
Seriously?

178
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,519
- Whoo!
- Awesome!

179
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:22,720
- Bottoms up!
- Cheers!

180
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,879
- All right! Cheers!
- Cheers!

181
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,200
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

182
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,320
All right. A toast.

183
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:36,440
The wine's good.

184
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,720
Let someone else do it.

185
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,440
Hey, Cream.

186
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:44,960
Have you seen Neree?

187
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,519
I haven't.

188
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:52,519
All right. Enjoy the party.

189
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:53,759
I'm going to get some rest now.

190
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:02,399
Anan's not here anymore either.

191
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,120
Well, his wife's already left.

192
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,879
Do you think someone like him
would go back to his wife?

193
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,080
Mm.

194
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,279
I'm going to go and take a dip now.

195
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,960
Hey, you coming?

196
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,879
No, you go ahead.

197
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,519
You're acting
like an old geezer again.

198
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:31,759
- Go ahead and relax, guys.
- Bye, Pupha.

199
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,279
I'll catch up with you.

200
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:07,000
What are you doing here all alone?

201
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,319
Oh, Xena?

202
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,759
I invited the oldies,
but they wouldn't come.

203
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,880
Are you saying you're not old?

204
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,839
Oh? Of course.

205
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,519
I concur. You're still handsome.

206
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,640
What do you want from that flattery?

207
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,319
Sixty baht.

208
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,000
There.

209
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,640
I'm definitely old.

210
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:34,880
You're growing up
to be almost as old as I am now.

211
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:41,000
Hey, are you okay?

212
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,758
Are you okay?

213
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:43,880
I'm sorry!

214
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,279
Can I have a look?

215
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:46,319
Boo.

216
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:50,400
You had me worried.

217
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:53,519
Hey, can I join you?

218
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,640
Come on in.

219
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:57,319
Ooh, what should we play?

220
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,640
Hey, there's a ball.

221
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,200
Water polo, anyone?

222
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,480
Good idea. Get more people.
Then we can make teams.

223
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:05,319
Xena, swim!

224
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:06,880
- Ah!
- Go on!

225
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,359
Hurry up, Pupha!

226
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,359
Catch!

227
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,880
- Over there!
- Hey, Sky!

228
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,480
- Here it comes.
- Hey!

229
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:19,119
Catch it!

230
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,240
Go after him!

231
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:24,119
- Get him!
- Don't touch him!

232
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,440
Don't touch him!

233
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,440
- We won't be able to keep this up.
- No.

234
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,680
Hey, no whispering! Don't cheat!

235
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:33,200
Let's go.

236
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,880
Hey!

237
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,359
- Hey! Bring it on!
- Come on!

238
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,240
- Ah!
- Hey!

239
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:41,359
Throw it!

240
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:43,000
- Ah!
- Yes!

241
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,119
- Yes!
- Is that even legal?

242
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,319
You're dead!

243
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:56,319
Hm?

244
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,920
No more for me.

245
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,039
Have we all grown old?

246
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:04,079
It's not even midnight,
and we're wasted.

247
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,279
I'm tired.

248
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,039
I'll go all in tomorrow.

249
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:11,079
You said it.

250
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,160
What is it? Can I try?

251
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,680
Mm.

252
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,400
Hm. It's quite fruity.

253
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,720
It's easy to drink too.

254
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:40,519
But once you come to your senses,

255
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:43,079
you'll throw up.

256
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,839
Aren't you drunk?

257
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,680
No, I'm not.

258
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,319
I can hold my liquor.

259
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:54,440
What about you, Apa? Are you drunk?

260
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:56,319
Not yet.

261
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,160
Can I ask you something?

262
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,559
Don't be mad at me, okay?

263
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,319
I'm curious. Are you not drunk

264
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,839
because you're still physically
strong on the inside like a man?

265
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,559
I don't know if it's related.
I'm just curious.

266
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,200
It's like that issue in the States.

267
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,599
They won't let transwomen
compete against female athletes.

268
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,160
I don't think it's related.

269
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:33,160
It's probably because I haven't
had much to drink.

270
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:41,279
Top it up.

271
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,079
It's okay. I'm thinking
I might go back to my room now.

272
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,200
And where did you meet Peng?

273
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,960
He's quite lovely.

274
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:56,519
He got through his audition
and landed a gig.

275
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,799
Then...

276
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:02,440
we met again somewhere else.

277
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,400
So we got to talk to each other.

278
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:06,920
Mm.

279
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,160
You'll live forever
dating someone younger.

280
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:11,680
Have you been together long?

281
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:15,559
It's been a while now.

282
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:18,680
That's nice.

283
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,079
It hasn't been long,
yet you're already going public.

284
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,160
Are you going to marry him?

285
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,319
I really should go.

286
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,559
I'm starting to feel a bit dizzy.

287
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:43,319
I guess I should go too. I'm sleepy.

288
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:56,960
I really couldn't help it.

289
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,079
How could she do this to our family?

290
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,680
She shouldn't have
brought Peng here.

291
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,559
Don't you feel anything
when you see them?

292
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,920
It's despicable.

293
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,680
There's no need to be considerate.

294
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,079
She's not considerate of you,
so why would you be?

295
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:16,440
It's been a long time, Cholly.

296
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,319
Why would you mention it?

297
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,079
I'll never forget
no matter how long it's been.

298
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,319
What about you?
Have you gotten over it now?

299
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,200
You can talk to me about anything.

300
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:32,799
Excuse me.

301
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,160
Your consideration's the reason
why they're treating you like this.

302
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:07,640
Has everyone finished drinking?

303
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,119
Mm.

304
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:17,000
Good.
So you'll have energy tomorrow.

305
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:19,799
It's going to be hot, and you might
not be able to keep up.

306
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:54,039
I'm sorry for being hot-headed.

307
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,400
I'm afraid that
you won't get a chance to say it.

308
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,640
I just want you to finally
get to do what you want.

309
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:17,519
I'm not up for it tonight.

310
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:20,000
Really?

311
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,759
You're not up for it?

312
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:30,400
- Really?
- Really.

313
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,759
Do you think so?

314
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:33,240
One round, okay?

315
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,160
Are you sure?

316
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:08,960
Oh dear.

317
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,039
Whoa.

318
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:13,400
Are you still drinking?

319
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,039
Stop already. It's late.

320
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,720
I'm taking a shower.

321
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,240
Pupha,

322
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:26,599
how many times have I told you
to wipe your feet before coming in?

323
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:29,759
I don't like a wet floor.

324
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:39,480
How many times have I told you
not to leave your pants around?

325
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:45,119
Cholly, why did you say that
during the meeting?

326
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,319
Wasn't I telling the truth?

327
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,039
You and Taurus have
fewer shares than Anan.

328
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:54,359
If Sirin steps in,

329
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,839
doesn't that mean
Anan's taking over?

330
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,960
You should've discussed it
and made things clear.

331
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,680
There could be
a problem in the future.

332
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,319
Leave the business operations to me

333
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,599
and stay out of it.

334
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,079
You'll get
your monthly allowance anyway.

335
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:12,960
Why do you care?

336
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,920
(Are you free? I've missed you.)

337
00:28:07,921 --> 00:28:09,680
(Let's meet.)

338
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,839
(Let's meet.)

339
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,640
Where were you last night?

340
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:44,200
I went to get some wine.

341
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,680
The weather was nice,
so I decided to drink by the pool.

342
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,000
Are you sure you're not coming?

343
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,759
You don't have to play.

344
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,440
There's a wine cellar
at the clubhouse.

345
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,200
Go there?

346
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:01,200
No, I'd rather stay here.

347
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,000
I won't be able
to talk to anyone anyway.

348
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,759
You're still fixated on
what I told you last night?

349
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,519
Can you not start a fight?

350
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,400
- Chol.
- What?

351
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,880
We should discuss this.

352
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,559
Discuss what? There's no need.
It ended ages ago.

353
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,640
Do whatever you want.

354
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:33,640
I'll just wait
for my monthly allowance.

355
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,000
Hurry up and come along.
I'll order coffee for you.

356
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,880
Hey, Jane.

357
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,880
Can I not go?

358
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,759
No, you have to go
no matter how bad your hangover is.

359
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:01,400
Chess had me
chain drinking last night.

360
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,079
I've got a banging headache.

361
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:07,079
I won't touch
any of his booze tonight.

362
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,519
Not even a single drop.

363
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:10,559
This hangover's a pain.

364
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:14,759
You wouldn't have a hangover
if you knew your limit.

365
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:19,559
- And don't you have a hangover?
- No.

366
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:21,319
Sure.

367
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:22,880
Oh, Jane.

368
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,319
Can I drink wine tonight?

369
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,000
There's a lot left over.

370
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,119
Go ahead if the resort delivers it.

371
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,440
Jane.

372
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:37,400
Yes? Is something the matter?

373
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,079
Nothing's the matter.

374
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,000
I'll let Neree go to the golf course
in my place today.

375
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:44,200
How come?

376
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:46,119
I don't feel like it anymore.

377
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,240
Okay. Should I look
into golf club rentals?

378
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:52,519
It's okay. She can use mine.

379
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,680
I just dropped by to tell you.

380
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:56,119
Otherwise, you might be confused
why Neree's not coming with you.

381
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
- Okay.
- I'm going now.

382
00:31:58,079 --> 00:31:59,000
Bye.

383
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,960
So, what do we do now?

384
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,640
I'm not getting up.

385
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:07,559
- Get up. Come on.
- Just a second.

386
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,640
- Can you give me a second?
- You're not hungover.

387
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:16,440
It's great.

388
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:21,119
Why didn't you line the cart up?
You overshot the line.

389
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,000
Just a little bit. It'll be fine.

390
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:24,559
Come on.

391
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,319
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi.

392
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,759
Okay. Everyone's here.
How should we split into teams?

393
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:36,559
- Hm... rock-paper-scissors?
- It's quite sunny today.

394
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:00,400
Do you want a girl or a boy?

395
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,799
What is this?

396
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:06,519
Come on. It's just a question.

397
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,720
I'm fine with either.

398
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,160
And what if you had to choose?

399
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:17,720
Maybe a girl.

400
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,400
It's difficult
being a man in this country.

401
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:24,400
How so?

402
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,279
I don't know. Well...

403
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,640
You have to be talented, nice, rich,

404
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,240
and...

405
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,119
a lot of other things.

406
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,640
I think everyone has to be like that
regardless of gender.

407
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,640
I want a boy and a girl
so they won't be lonely.

408
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,599
Mm. I'm fine with whatever.
It's up to you.

409
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:01,279
I have a feeling our family's
going to do well this year.

410
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:03,640
It'd be even better

411
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:05,240
if we can have a baby.

412
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,280
You're about to start
your own company as well.

413
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,599
Aren't you thinking too far ahead?

414
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,760
I haven't even started.

415
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,639
This is it.

416
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:22,159
That's why I told you to hurry up
and show them the business plan.

417
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,519
I think it has potential.

418
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,599
I have my own ways.

419
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,880
You don't have to rush me.

420
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,119
What ways?

421
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,280
You've been working on it
for a while with no results.

422
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,360
I have my ways.

423
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,039
So what are they?

424
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,599
Can we not talk about this?

425
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,360
Why not?

426
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,880
You're making no sense.

427
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,639
Ari?

428
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:55,559
Ari!

429
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:23,400
Can you get any reception?

430
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,159
No.

431
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,719
I'm not getting any.

432
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:28,199
What about your phone?

433
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,159
I'm not getting reception either.

434
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:32,599
Sky's not going to disappear.

435
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:34,199
You'll see him when we get back.

436
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,880
You actually
didn't have to come, Mesa.

437
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,559
Why didn't you stay at the hotel?

438
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,679
Neree didn't even come.

439
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,599
I can't do that.
It'd be inappropriate.

440
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,000
Trust me.

441
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,480
Make the fact that
you're dating the boss worthwhile.

442
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:57,599
You might be able
to do it, but I can't.

443
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,840
What are you trying to say?

444
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:03,920
You know it in your heart.

445
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,119
Hey, what's wrong?

446
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,760
You don't know,
or are you pretending you don't?

447
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:49,400
Know what? Don't take it out on me.

448
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,599
When I just broke up with you,

449
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,599
I went to this party
with some clients.

450
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:05,880
Then we went to Anan's condo
to continue partying.

451
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,320
He and I were drunk.

452
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,800
But he was still there
when I woke up.

453
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:15,400
A maid came in to clean up the place,

454
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:17,159
but she was the same one
at the company.

455
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:20,280
I don't know
if she gossiped about it or not.

456
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,920
And you...

457
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:25,360
No.

458
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:27,719
Are you sure?

459
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:29,639
Of course.

460
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Hasn't anyone told you anything?

461
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:35,280
Of course not.

462
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:36,679
Who'd dare to say it?

463
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:39,400
Everyone knows we used to date.

464
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:46,679
Do you think Mesa knows?

465
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:49,400
Maybe not.

466
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:52,639
Darn it.

467
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,239
I shouldn't have gone to his place.

468
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:00,960
Are you sure nothing happened?

469
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:04,920
It's considered rape
if you're not conscious.

470
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,280
Uma, believe me.

471
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,960
I know myself well enough.

472
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,840
Sure. I believe you.

473
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,159
What are you going to do now?

474
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:21,679
What else can I do?

475
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:30,440
Huh? You're pregnant?

476
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,920
- Hey!
- Oh?

477
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,239
- Hey!
- Oh?

478
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,400
Wow, congratulations!

479
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:37,800
- Congratulations to the new dad.
- Congratulations.

480
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,239
- Let's make a toast!
- Yes.

481
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,519
Finally, a junior addition.

482
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,679
- Congratulations.
- A new addition.

483
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,159
You're going to be an uncle now.

484
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,440
I already am.

485
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:52,840
That's why I asked
if you want a boy or a girl.

486
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,639
Have you gone
to a hospital to confirm it?

487
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:00,800
No, I just did a pregnancy test.

488
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,679
Go see a doctor
as soon as you get back.

489
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:05,639
Go to the same doctor as Sky's mom.

490
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:06,719
I will.

491
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:13,400
Right, Pha. Are you free?

492
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,800
Tee has a project
he wants to propose.

493
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,599
What project?

494
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,960
Uh...

495
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:25,480
I already came up with a plan.

496
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:27,119
I'll show it to you
once we get back.

497
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:28,679
Great. Do it now.

498
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,719
You'll realize there's no time
for anything else after the baby.

499
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,360
- Isn't that right, Anan?
- Correct.

500
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:41,800
So? Another toast?

501
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,039
Indeed.

502
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:44,920
Congrats.

503
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:47,159
Congrats. It's a good day.

504
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,158
(Can you conceive
with low sperm count?)

505
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:40,718
(Can you conceive
with low sperm count?)

506
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:43,158
(Men with azoospermia
or weak sperm can conceive.)

507
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:45,158
(However, a physical examination
is necessary...)

508
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:47,118
(to identify causes
of male factor infertility...)

509
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,800
(and proper medical treatments.)

510
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,559
(Pupha)

511
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:31,920
Should we find time
to travel overseas together?

512
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:34,400
I'll pay for everything.

513
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,199
Aren't you going to do anything?

514
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:38,760
And what do you want me to do?

515
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,400
We did sleep together.

516
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,440
It's normal.
There's nothing strange about it.

517
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:43,800
I'm not okay

518
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:45,799
with everyone thinking
I won the award

519
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,079
because I slept with you.
