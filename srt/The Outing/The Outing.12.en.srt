1
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:10,960
How long have you
been sleeping with Chess?

2
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,960
Oh.

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,519
You've been spending a lot of money

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,120
because you're his sugar mommy?

5
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:24,440
No.

6
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:26,359
I use it to help my family.

7
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,440
To help your family?

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,399
I don't think so.

9
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:35,200
He wears all those expensive things.

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,000
You bought them for him, didn't you?

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,479
That's right.

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,200
I bought him those things.

13
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:49,119
You only seem to focus on money.

14
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,200
Don't you want to know why I did it?

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,840
Why? Just tell me.

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,560
Because he listens to me.

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,840
Even if he was only pretending
like he cared,

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,119
it was worth the money I paid him.

19
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,359
But at least,

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
he makes me feel

21
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:10,719
like someone's
finally listening to me.

22
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,280
Has it been that bad between us?

23
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,719
You're always treating me
like I'm not part of your family.

24
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,640
It's like you don't
want to talk to me.

25
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:33,280
I love you and your family.

26
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:36,200
I'm always sticking up for you.

27
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,560
But how did it turn out?

28
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm still an outsider in your eyes.

29
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:45,560
It's not like that at all, Chol.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,319
You always had me working
in lowly positions

31
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,280
even though it's your company.

32
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,120
Do you think I'm a stupid woman
who lives a nonsensical life?

33
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,400
You know what?

34
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,879
I was so scared you might find out.

35
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,280
But now,

36
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,000
I feel so relieved.

37
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:14,159
It feels so nice.

38
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:20,599
If it's that horrible for us to be
together, then we should break up.

39
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,159
If that's what you want.

40
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,120
But I won't leave empty-handed.

41
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,400
The money you invested
in the company was

42
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,840
from my family.

43
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:35,439
I should have a hand
in the shares or something.

44
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,840
I paid back all of the money

45
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,960
to your family ages ago.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,439
Then there's your allowance.

47
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,400
How much did you get?

48
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,159
Isn't it enough for you?

49
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,680
You're the unfaithful one.

50
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,680
You'd get nothing

51
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,280
if I take you to court.

52
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,560
Sue me if you want.

53
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,240
Be my guest.

54
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,800
(The Outing)

55
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:32,839
Chess?

56
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,920
Oh, you haven't gone to bed?

57
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,920
Not yet.

58
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,560
Is something the matter?

59
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,600
Pupha's found out.

60
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,439
I guess I'll have to quit my job.

61
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,560
Just stay put.

62
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,360
He's a calm person.
He won't do anything.

63
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,480
Besides, he probably doesn't want
anyone to find out about this.

64
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,920
But if you're uncomfortable,

65
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,560
maybe you should look
at other jobs just in case.

66
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,480
I have some connections.
I'll give you a hand.

67
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,680
Don't overthink it.

68
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,800
I promise I won't cause you trouble.

69
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,480
Cholly,

70
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,040
what about you?

71
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
Are you okay?

72
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,800
Is there anything I can do to help?

73
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,800
I'm okay.

74
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,920
It's actually not
as bad as you think.

75
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,120
He mentioned a divorce,

76
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,160
but I don't know what's next.
We haven't discussed it properly.

77
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,480
But it might be good if we break up

78
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,000
so I can finally do what I want.

79
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,839
Oh, Peng?

80
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,480
I should go.

81
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,920
Did you come here to see Chess?

82
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,480
- Yes.
- Head inside.

83
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,040
I was just done talking to him.

84
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,560
Don't think too much
if you have feelings for Chess.

85
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,160
I've been paying him money.

86
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,279
Peng,

87
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,319
just say what's on your mind.

88
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,039
Can you join me for drinks?

89
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,919
I'd rather not.

90
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,799
Do you know

91
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,960
how exhausted I am right now?

92
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,559
I have to work tomorrow as well.

93
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,279
But I really need to talk to you.

94
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,559
Can you please come with me?

95
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,360
Then can I ask you something?

96
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,720
If I want to be more
to you than I am now,

97
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,080
is it possible?

98
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,320
Peng, didn't I tell you?

99
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,440
I'm not into commitment.

100
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,720
Why?

101
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,720
A relationship is...

102
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,480
full of nonsense.

103
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,840
Nonsense?

104
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,840
And what isn't nonsense to you?

105
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,120
Money?

106
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,240
I can buy you if you want.

107
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,120
Are you okay?

108
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,320
I want beer.

109
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,600
Can you drink with me?

110
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,600
Cream,

111
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,120
have you packed your bag?

112
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,200
No, but I can be quick.

113
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,720
You should hurry up.
You're a slowpoke.

114
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:40,840
I'm always scared of missing
my flight whenever I'm with you.

115
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,440
Hey, it was just once to Tokyo.
Why are you complaining?

116
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,840
Don't you mean Taiwan?

117
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,559
What are you doing? I thought
you weren't into social media.

118
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,480
I'm stalking Anan's daughters.

119
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,120
- Why?
- I think there's something strange.

120
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,679
I think so too.

121
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:04,320
I saw them fighting this evening.

122
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,200
Right?

123
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,240
Mm.

124
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,200
I think Atra's definitely into Nu.

125
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:13,200
I don't think so.

126
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,960
And the youngest one is

127
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,919
basically presenting herself
to him on a platter.

128
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,200
She doesn't care
that he's dating her sister.

129
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,039
And why do you care?

130
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,600
Wouldn't it be fun
if they were fighting?

131
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:29,600
Jeez, don't tell me you're...

132
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,360
Shoot.

133
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,200
How can you be so horrible?

134
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,679
Right? Aren't I?

135
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,840
Unbelievable.

136
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,080
I want a nightcap. I can't sleep.

137
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,720
Where to?
Should I find you something?

138
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,840
No, I'm sick of being in here.
I want to go to the mezzanine.

139
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:51,200
Can you rally up the gang?

140
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,200
- Sure.
- You send a text.

141
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,080
You should send a text.

142
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,440
You do it.

143
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,200
- Why?
- I just don't want to.

144
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,320
Are we going or not?

145
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:02,519
All right. I'll do it.

146
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:14,960
How come?

147
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:20,600
Things probably changed

148
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,000
after having been
together for a while.

149
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,960
But you were quick to say
you're still in love with her.

150
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,320
You're such a good person.

151
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,440
If I want to have
a boyfriend someday,

152
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:37,960
I want him to be like you.

153
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,359
- Hey.
- What do you want?

154
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,080
Cream.

155
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,440
Did you forget something?

156
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:13,879
No, look at this. Here.

157
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,360
- What?
- I've got something to show you.

158
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,519
Xena and Pupha?

159
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,360
- Mm.
- Jeez.

160
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:07,879
What did I do wrong?

161
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,120
You did nothing wrong.

162
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:22,399
But we can't do this.

163
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,960
We can't.

164
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,519
Okay?

165
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,840
Dad?

166
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:46,519
Xena, come here.

167
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,519
- Come on!
- Sky?

168
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:55,039
Sky?

169
00:16:57,713 --> 00:16:58,753
Sky!

170
00:17:01,993 --> 00:17:02,993
What's wrong?

171
00:17:03,473 --> 00:17:04,914
Are you still mad at me?

172
00:17:07,753 --> 00:17:09,713
Mesa, can you wait in our room?

173
00:17:11,194 --> 00:17:12,273
We'll talk later.

174
00:17:20,634 --> 00:17:21,793
Sky, I...

175
00:17:21,914 --> 00:17:23,154
What on earth did you do?

176
00:17:27,354 --> 00:17:28,993
It's not what you think.

177
00:17:30,473 --> 00:17:31,753
So what did I see?

178
00:17:33,434 --> 00:17:35,194
You were about to sleep with her.

179
00:17:37,793 --> 00:17:39,354
Don't you get it?

180
00:17:40,473 --> 00:17:41,793
You're a father, Dad.

181
00:17:44,194 --> 00:17:45,194
Uh...

182
00:18:05,594 --> 00:18:06,634
Anan.

183
00:18:13,753 --> 00:18:15,473
How could you do this to me?

184
00:18:17,154 --> 00:18:18,914
That was my daughter.

185
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:21,713
Darn it.

186
00:18:22,954 --> 00:18:24,954
That was my daughter!

187
00:18:37,634 --> 00:18:39,634
All of this is your fault.

188
00:18:42,473 --> 00:18:43,954
You have to take responsibility.

189
00:19:06,954 --> 00:19:10,194
I told you
you were part of my family.

190
00:19:16,954 --> 00:19:19,073
So how could you
do that to my family?

191
00:19:22,513 --> 00:19:24,834
My daughter is only a teenager.

192
00:19:28,713 --> 00:19:30,513
Look at my face!

193
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,073
Remember that.

194
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:33,114
Aren't you going
to tell the father first?

195
00:20:39,674 --> 00:20:41,033
I can't.

196
00:20:50,553 --> 00:20:52,473
Because Natee is the father.

197
00:21:10,273 --> 00:21:11,473
Are you sure?

198
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,273
Mm.

199
00:21:19,114 --> 00:21:20,233
Since when?

200
00:21:22,713 --> 00:21:24,154
Months ago, maybe.

201
00:21:31,954 --> 00:21:33,154
I'm sorry.

202
00:21:36,394 --> 00:21:38,594
I didn't want things
to be like this either.

203
00:21:39,033 --> 00:21:40,713
Don't blame yourself, okay?

204
00:21:42,473 --> 00:21:44,033
I can handle this.

205
00:21:45,473 --> 00:21:47,114
I can take care of myself.

206
00:21:51,713 --> 00:21:54,354
You know you don't
have to do this alone, right?

207
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,914
I won't interfere with your decision.

208
00:22:00,473 --> 00:22:02,553
But if you decide to keep the baby,

209
00:22:03,473 --> 00:22:05,154
I'll help you raise it.

210
00:22:12,713 --> 00:22:13,674
Tara,

211
00:22:16,553 --> 00:22:18,273
I won't abandon you again.

212
00:22:24,313 --> 00:22:26,033
Thank you!

213
00:22:31,553 --> 00:22:33,073
Thank you!

214
00:22:57,553 --> 00:22:58,553
Here.

215
00:23:00,753 --> 00:23:02,313
You can drink now, can't you?

216
00:23:18,394 --> 00:23:19,713
I'm sorry.

217
00:23:31,634 --> 00:23:33,073
I know I'm horrible.

218
00:23:35,834 --> 00:23:37,954
And that I take it out on you.

219
00:23:42,553 --> 00:23:45,513
I don't know why I did it either.

220
00:23:47,713 --> 00:23:48,954
But it's...

221
00:23:50,434 --> 00:23:52,874
probably better than blaming myself.

222
00:24:00,154 --> 00:24:01,354
Thank you.

223
00:24:16,313 --> 00:24:17,594
Take it easy.

224
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:21,594
There's a solution to everything.

225
00:24:24,434 --> 00:24:25,874
I'm only asking for one thing.

226
00:24:30,434 --> 00:24:32,354
Can you not give up on me?

227
00:24:44,793 --> 00:24:46,354
Actually, about the baby.

228
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:51,434
I don't mind if it's a girl or a boy

229
00:24:53,394 --> 00:24:54,914
as long as it's yours.

230
00:24:58,993 --> 00:25:01,313
I really want
to raise a baby with you.

231
00:25:05,194 --> 00:25:07,594
I know you'll be a great mother.

232
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,594
But I can't give you a baby.

233
00:25:20,313 --> 00:25:21,993
It feels so awful.

234
00:25:23,713 --> 00:25:25,154
And I don't understand

235
00:25:27,114 --> 00:25:29,114
why you'd put up
with someone like me.

236
00:25:40,033 --> 00:25:41,594
Do you love me?

237
00:25:42,473 --> 00:25:43,553
Of course.

238
00:25:52,394 --> 00:25:54,033
And what if I was the one

239
00:25:59,313 --> 00:26:01,194
who couldn't give you a baby?

240
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:05,154
Would you leave me?

241
00:26:07,553 --> 00:26:08,553
No.

242
00:26:49,154 --> 00:26:50,473
Are you okay?

243
00:26:54,753 --> 00:26:55,834
Mm.

244
00:27:08,114 --> 00:27:09,354
I'm quitting my job.

245
00:27:12,114 --> 00:27:14,033
I want to try something else.

246
00:27:15,713 --> 00:27:18,674
And I don't want
to lose you just yet.

247
00:27:25,434 --> 00:27:26,594
You can do it.

248
00:27:27,553 --> 00:27:29,233
You're a talented person, Mesa.

249
00:28:10,993 --> 00:28:12,033
Are you sleepy?

250
00:28:12,114 --> 00:28:13,552
- Hm?
- Do you want to sleep?

251
00:28:13,553 --> 00:28:14,354
Yes.

252
00:28:15,313 --> 00:28:16,313
I love you.

253
00:28:17,674 --> 00:28:19,674
Mm. I love you too.

254
00:28:31,473 --> 00:28:33,473
Here you are, sir.

255
00:28:40,473 --> 00:28:41,674
I'm so tired.

256
00:28:42,033 --> 00:28:43,033
Hm?

257
00:28:43,114 --> 00:28:45,553
I haven't had a break
since I got here.

258
00:28:47,313 --> 00:28:49,114
So many problems.

259
00:28:50,313 --> 00:28:53,713
I guess it should've been more fun.

260
00:28:56,033 --> 00:28:58,674
But this company isn't
what you'd call normal.

261
00:28:59,993 --> 00:29:01,114
What is that?

262
00:29:02,114 --> 00:29:03,913
A boss slept with an employee.

263
00:29:03,914 --> 00:29:05,713
An employee slept with a boss's son.

264
00:29:06,313 --> 00:29:07,553
The bosses might've

265
00:29:08,033 --> 00:29:09,874
even slept with each other.

266
00:29:13,874 --> 00:29:14,874
Right?

267
00:29:15,473 --> 00:29:16,914
Working here is really tough.

268
00:29:18,354 --> 00:29:19,713
They're so promiscuous.

269
00:29:26,594 --> 00:29:28,114
But I understand

270
00:29:28,473 --> 00:29:30,553
coming to an outing is necessary

271
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:34,914
so we can see our colleagues
in a different light.

272
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:37,233
But I'm not okay with that.

273
00:29:39,033 --> 00:29:40,233
It would be good

274
00:29:40,793 --> 00:29:42,233
if it's good.

275
00:29:45,114 --> 00:29:46,553
But if it's bad,

276
00:29:47,233 --> 00:29:48,713
we'd end up hating each other.

277
00:29:52,553 --> 00:29:53,874
Ugh.

278
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:55,993
What's up with you?

279
00:29:57,154 --> 00:29:59,793
We get along, don't we?

280
00:30:00,354 --> 00:30:01,354
Or do you beg to differ?

281
00:30:03,154 --> 00:30:04,713
Do you hate me in secret?

282
00:30:06,594 --> 00:30:09,114
That's why I told you.

283
00:30:10,033 --> 00:30:11,713
If it's good, then it's good.

284
00:30:13,594 --> 00:30:15,033
Bear with me for a second.

285
00:30:16,154 --> 00:30:18,313
What if we actually hated
each other's guts

286
00:30:18,874 --> 00:30:21,114
and had to live
in that tent for three days?

287
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:24,874
Ugh. Bad news.

288
00:30:32,553 --> 00:30:35,033
But even if you
actually hate my guts,

289
00:30:36,874 --> 00:30:38,553
you won't have
to put up with me much longer.

290
00:30:40,473 --> 00:30:41,793
I'll be out of here soon enough.

291
00:30:47,154 --> 00:30:48,233
Why?

292
00:30:52,473 --> 00:30:53,713
There's a lot of things.

293
00:30:56,434 --> 00:30:57,553
What about your girlfriend?

294
00:30:58,874 --> 00:31:00,033
Are you going to keep seeing her?

295
00:31:04,033 --> 00:31:05,313
I've broken up with her.

296
00:31:06,233 --> 00:31:07,233
Huh?

297
00:31:10,713 --> 00:31:12,114
Surprised?

298
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:14,993
It's only natural.

299
00:31:18,434 --> 00:31:19,553
But anyway,

300
00:31:20,634 --> 00:31:22,553
it's good to talk to you about this.

301
00:31:23,434 --> 00:31:24,834
I'm feeling much happier now.

302
00:31:26,914 --> 00:31:28,434
Working here is...

303
00:31:31,313 --> 00:31:34,553
Work and personal matters
get mixed up all the time. I...

304
00:31:35,073 --> 00:31:36,154
I don't think I can handle it.

305
00:31:39,313 --> 00:31:41,553
What are you going to do now?

306
00:31:42,674 --> 00:31:43,914
Where are you going to work?

307
00:31:45,273 --> 00:31:46,434
I don't know yet.

308
00:31:48,154 --> 00:31:49,273
I think

309
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:51,914
I'm going to call a friend
when I get back.

310
00:31:53,834 --> 00:31:55,914
He's asked me to come
and work with him once.

311
00:31:58,793 --> 00:32:00,033
Can you ask him for me too?

312
00:32:03,313 --> 00:32:05,033
I haven't decided
if I should quit though.

313
00:32:06,914 --> 00:32:08,313
You?

314
00:32:09,834 --> 00:32:10,834
Why?

315
00:32:12,033 --> 00:32:13,674
You and Pupha seem

316
00:32:14,513 --> 00:32:16,313
to get along well
when it comes to work.

317
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:25,273
Anyway.

318
00:32:30,674 --> 00:32:32,834
I'll go and get my bags.

319
00:32:32,954 --> 00:32:33,954
Mm.

320
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:59,073
(Chess)

321
00:33:36,834 --> 00:33:38,194
I've prepared your clothes.

322
00:33:38,793 --> 00:33:39,914
Take a shower.

323
00:33:40,553 --> 00:33:41,793
I'm going to pack our bags.

324
00:33:53,313 --> 00:33:55,273
Can you forget about Chess?

325
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:59,434
Forget everything
like when you told me to forget

326
00:33:59,834 --> 00:34:01,553
you had an affair.

327
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:03,394
I was able to forget.

328
00:34:03,954 --> 00:34:05,793
So can you at least try?

329
00:34:08,754 --> 00:34:10,033
That's easy for you to say.

330
00:34:12,314 --> 00:34:13,834
What if I said no?

331
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:16,274
Can't you do that at all?

332
00:34:17,394 --> 00:34:18,434
Why not?

333
00:34:19,553 --> 00:34:22,394
It's true I've done wrong.
I cheated on you.

334
00:34:23,553 --> 00:34:25,033
But it's all in the past now.

335
00:34:25,274 --> 00:34:26,794
And I didn't have feelings for her.

336
00:34:26,914 --> 00:34:29,193
I don't have
feelings for Chess either.

337
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:31,434
And what did you say last night?

338
00:34:32,274 --> 00:34:34,513
You feel nice
because he listens to you.

339
00:34:35,553 --> 00:34:36,914
He listens to you.

340
00:34:37,434 --> 00:34:38,834
That's all.

341
00:34:39,193 --> 00:34:40,553
I didn't say I love him.

342
00:34:41,394 --> 00:34:42,553
Why?

343
00:34:42,673 --> 00:34:45,954
You want me to forgive you
when it comes to yourself.

344
00:34:46,274 --> 00:34:49,274
But you can't forgive me?

345
00:34:49,794 --> 00:34:53,274
You chastised me like I was
some animal when I did wrong.

346
00:34:54,274 --> 00:34:56,153
What am I to you?

347
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:03,914
I won't divorce you.

348
00:35:04,754 --> 00:35:06,033
We'll keep living like this.

349
00:35:06,754 --> 00:35:08,314
And why should I put up with you?

350
00:35:08,794 --> 00:35:10,553
It won't be just you.

351
00:35:11,274 --> 00:35:13,033
I'll have to put up with you too.

352
00:35:13,834 --> 00:35:16,193
You can go ahead
and sue me all you want.

353
00:35:16,794 --> 00:35:19,673
But leave Chess alone.
He has nothing to do with this.

354
00:35:20,633 --> 00:35:22,633
Do you think you still can
negotiate with me?

355
00:35:22,914 --> 00:35:23,954
Negotiate?

356
00:35:25,274 --> 00:35:28,834
Trust me. If we're actually
going to negotiate,

357
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,033
you'll never win in this game.

358
00:35:32,794 --> 00:35:34,434
Especially when it comes to Xena.

359
00:35:36,513 --> 00:35:37,794
It's against the law.

360
00:35:38,754 --> 00:35:39,954
You know that, don't you?

361
00:35:41,274 --> 00:35:44,033
And if other people
find out about this,

362
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:47,794
will you still have the gall
to stay at this company?

363
00:35:50,073 --> 00:35:51,394
If I can't stay here,

364
00:35:51,914 --> 00:35:53,553
then we'll both go down together.

365
00:35:54,553 --> 00:35:56,033
We'll just keep living like this.

366
00:35:57,033 --> 00:35:59,553
You can find someone else
if you want.

367
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:03,553
I'll decide when I want a divorce,

368
00:36:04,553 --> 00:36:07,394
and you can keep putting up with me
like I've been putting up with you.

369
00:36:11,274 --> 00:36:12,794
Why are you doing this?

370
00:36:18,914 --> 00:36:20,153
Have you ever loved me?

371
00:36:20,274 --> 00:36:23,033
And you?
Have you ever loved me?

372
00:36:24,314 --> 00:36:26,794
Why are you asking for love now?

373
00:36:27,193 --> 00:36:28,954
I've given you everything.

374
00:36:29,434 --> 00:36:31,314
You never even cared.

375
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:34,113
I don't have
anything left to give you.

376
00:37:12,193 --> 00:37:13,193
Anan.

377
00:37:16,394 --> 00:37:17,673
Can I talk to you?

378
00:37:26,354 --> 00:37:30,354
Didn't I tell you people will
eventually forget about it?

379
00:37:34,153 --> 00:37:35,513
It's easy for you to say.

380
00:37:35,834 --> 00:37:37,113
You're not me.

381
00:37:39,073 --> 00:37:41,794
You'll get away
with anything in our circle.

382
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:44,073
It's only me who has to endure it.

383
00:37:45,593 --> 00:37:46,673
Why?

384
00:37:47,274 --> 00:37:49,754
Why do you have to act
as if you've slept with me?

385
00:37:52,593 --> 00:37:55,033
I don't know
what's going on in your head.

386
00:37:56,754 --> 00:37:58,314
But I want you to understand

387
00:37:58,874 --> 00:38:00,314
what I'm feeling.

388
00:38:08,794 --> 00:38:09,874
Okay.

389
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,513
I'll listen to you then.

390
00:38:17,434 --> 00:38:18,434
That's it?

391
00:38:20,033 --> 00:38:22,593
Yes. What do you want me to do?

392
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,234
Aren't you going
to apologize at all?

393
00:38:27,954 --> 00:38:28,954
Cream,

394
00:38:32,673 --> 00:38:34,314
I didn't do anything wrong.

395
00:38:34,434 --> 00:38:35,754
Hm?

396
00:38:36,434 --> 00:38:38,874
You were drunk that night,
and you fell asleep.

397
00:38:39,794 --> 00:38:41,593
I did nothing to you.

398
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:43,394
I slept in a different room.

399
00:38:44,033 --> 00:38:46,673
It's up to other people
to think whatever they want.

400
00:38:46,794 --> 00:38:48,794
So why didn't you say it?

401
00:38:49,033 --> 00:38:50,673
Just back me up.

402
00:38:51,593 --> 00:38:52,673
Why?

403
00:38:54,033 --> 00:38:56,593
Are you worried other people might
think you don't have the guts?

404
00:38:58,113 --> 00:38:59,714
I thought you already
understood everything.

405
00:39:02,633 --> 00:39:05,593
But you keep talking
about me having your back.

406
00:39:06,113 --> 00:39:07,874
It's not just about having my back.

407
00:39:09,633 --> 00:39:11,834
It's about my dignity.

408
00:39:12,834 --> 00:39:14,914
You have three daughters.

409
00:39:15,834 --> 00:39:17,714
You should understand.

410
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,834
I'm someone's daughter as well.

411
00:39:26,314 --> 00:39:27,314
Here.

412
00:39:33,434 --> 00:39:34,434
Cream!

413
00:39:37,354 --> 00:39:39,314
There's no evidence

414
00:39:40,593 --> 00:39:42,354
of what happened between us,

415
00:39:44,153 --> 00:39:46,874
and yet people speak
horribly about me.

416
00:39:50,593 --> 00:39:52,593
But this is solid evidence.

417
00:39:54,033 --> 00:39:56,033
People are going to have a heyday.

418
00:39:56,113 --> 00:39:57,274
Okay, Cream.

419
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:02,033
She didn't do anything wrong.

420
00:40:04,113 --> 00:40:06,153
So whatever you're
thinking of doing,

421
00:40:07,633 --> 00:40:09,033
think about it carefully.

422
00:40:16,153 --> 00:40:17,314
I won't do it.

423
00:40:19,314 --> 00:40:21,754
But you can't keep
this kind of thing a secret.

424
00:40:21,834 --> 00:40:23,714
People will find out eventually.

425
00:40:24,434 --> 00:40:26,633
And when people
start gossiping about her,

426
00:40:29,434 --> 00:40:31,914
I hope she can get through it

427
00:40:32,633 --> 00:40:35,714
and just forget it,
like you told me to do.

428
00:40:55,033 --> 00:40:56,754
Thank you for coming to the outing.

429
00:40:57,153 --> 00:40:59,274
Anyway, enjoy your time here.

430
00:42:08,113 --> 00:42:09,314
Anan,

431
00:42:09,553 --> 00:42:12,113
here's the full expense report
for the outing.

432
00:42:58,314 --> 00:43:01,033
(Can you get pregnant again
after an abortion?)

433
00:43:01,113 --> 00:43:03,553
(Can you get pregnant again
after an abortion?)

434
00:43:06,874 --> 00:43:07,914
Should we go home now?

435
00:43:09,314 --> 00:43:10,553
It's up to you.

436
00:43:12,993 --> 00:43:14,033
Well then.

437
00:43:14,914 --> 00:43:17,914
Can I go and smoke?
It's the last one.

438
00:43:56,513 --> 00:43:58,394
Doesn't Ari hate
the smell of cigarettes?

439
00:43:59,993 --> 00:44:01,513
You might end up fighting again.

440
00:44:04,153 --> 00:44:05,754
We fight all the time anyway.

441
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:08,633
It's okay.

442
00:44:20,394 --> 00:44:22,434
Do you think Ari's having an affair?

443
00:44:25,513 --> 00:44:27,394
She told me everything.

444
00:44:28,394 --> 00:44:29,513
I think

445
00:44:30,754 --> 00:44:32,513
you should think about it carefully.

446
00:44:34,073 --> 00:44:36,593
Ari isn't someone
who'd do such a thing.

447
00:44:39,954 --> 00:44:40,954
I guess.

448
00:44:54,394 --> 00:44:56,274
You're not sterile.

449
00:45:07,754 --> 00:45:09,314
What do you mean?

450
00:45:13,993 --> 00:45:16,033
The baby I'm carrying

451
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:18,834
is yours.

452
00:45:25,314 --> 00:45:26,673
But I've miscarried.

453
00:45:31,073 --> 00:45:32,473
I'm not saying this

454
00:45:34,073 --> 00:45:36,673
because I want you
to take responsibility.

455
00:45:39,073 --> 00:45:40,553
I just wanted to tell you.

456
00:45:47,033 --> 00:45:48,593
You and Ari should

457
00:45:49,033 --> 00:45:51,193
give it a try again.

458
00:45:56,033 --> 00:45:57,193
I believe

459
00:45:58,954 --> 00:46:01,193
you can be a good father.

460
00:46:50,473 --> 00:46:53,193
Should we make an appointment
with a doctor about having a baby?

461
00:46:54,113 --> 00:46:55,914
There might still be a way.

462
00:46:57,834 --> 00:46:58,834
Mm.

463
00:47:00,434 --> 00:47:03,954
But I'm actually happy
living like this with you.

464
00:47:04,954 --> 00:47:07,794
I'm okay if we can't
have kids as well.

465
00:47:22,314 --> 00:47:24,193
Let's give it another try.

466
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:29,033
Mm. We can try.

467
00:47:33,113 --> 00:47:34,113
Mm.

468
00:47:39,354 --> 00:47:40,354
Let's go.

469
00:47:40,834 --> 00:47:41,794
Mm.
