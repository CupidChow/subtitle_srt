1
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:40,999
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

2
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,797
Are you saying we should lie?

3
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:51,968
Well, no. I don't mean we should lie.

4
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,595
Instead,

5
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:56,723
if we make it seem
like the KMA is holding it,

6
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:59,142
then all the reporters
will swarm over there.

7
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:02,062
That's when we'll have
the exhibition in Samdal-ri.

8
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,647
If that's not lying, then what is?

9
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,859
Are you sure it's okay
for the KMA to lie like that?

10
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,235
Of course not.

11
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,988
But it won't be for long, okay?

12
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,865
We'll just stay quiet for a bit.

13
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:16,826
JEJU REGIONAL OFFICE OF METEOROLOGY

14
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:22,082
The exhibition opens in less than an hour,
but they haven't canceled it yet.

15
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,249
Does it mean it's on?

16
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,169
The KMA goes out of their way
to hold Cho's exhibition?

17
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,172
They'd be bashed for it.
You think they'd do that?

18
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,965
Right? They wouldn't do it.

19
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,593
Maybe we should go
to Samdal-ri and look for Cho.

20
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,428
We'd get that exclusive faster.

21
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,013
-Who's that?
-Someone's here!

22
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:40,266
Are you really going to hold
Ms. Cho's exhibition here?

23
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,476
What are you going to do?

24
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,436
There's only an hour left. Please tell us.

25
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,688
-She's not doing it, right?
-Please tell us.

26
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,815
You see…

27
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,488
-What?
-Wait!

28
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,406
They won't announce it until the day of.

29
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,200
-It'll be canceled.
-You didn't tell us.

30
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,952
-They're crazy.
-This isn't right.

31
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,204
This is better for us.

32
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,164
Cho Eun-hye and the KMA.

33
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,834
Thanks for the two controversies!

34
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:06,960
-Exactly.
-Right.

35
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,295
Then, all the reporters
will swarm over to the KMA.

36
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:12,632
And once they leave Samdal-ri,
we can prepare for the exhibition?

37
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:13,591
Yes, that's it.

38
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,846
They're really doing the exhibition?

39
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,348
At the meteorological center?

40
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,144
What about the photos?

41
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,188
They're all back at the KMA.

42
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:30,733
How can we get them out
without the reporters knowing?

43
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,403
They'll all come here if they find out.

44
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,281
We won't get caught. Don't worry.

45
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,198
Where are we?

46
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,618
-Samdal-ri.
-That's right.

47
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,495
And who do we have on our side?

48
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,500
Our own Jomnyeo Squad.

49
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:51,296
So what do we need to do?

50
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,964
Come on, Ms. Ko.

51
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,550
You know what we're good at.

52
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,385
Waging war.

53
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:02,348
She's right.
We'll just go and run over them.

54
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,516
-Right.
-Right.

55
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,269
Sam-dal, don't you worry about a thing.

56
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,270
Just count on us.

57
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,856
-Yes. We'll run over them.
-Yes.

58
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:13,067
Hold on, ladies.
You're not running over anyone.

59
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,861
We're not killing anyone.

60
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,237
Calm down, everyone.

61
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,407
The reporters are just doing their jobs.
This isn't a fight.

62
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,827
We're not fighting them.
Just distract them while I get the photos.

63
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,288
I see.

64
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:29,459
Ms. Ko, we're experts
in attracting attention.

65
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,880
Okay. I got it.

66
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,549
Yong-pil, tell us where to go.

67
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,803
You can't get through that.

68
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,722
No one could get through that.

69
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,518
My hunch tells me it's not here.

70
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,737
Goodness. I think they'll scatter soon.

71
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,281
Where are they?

72
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,468
How long do we have to wait?

73
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:26,057
It's almost time.
Are they doing it or not?

74
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,476
CHO YONG-PIL

75
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,604
Hey, how did it go? Should I do it now?

76
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,273
Yes, sir. Do it now.

77
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,066
Okay, got it.

78
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,330
Attention!

79
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,461
Well…

80
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,671
You see…

81
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,466
The KMA has--

82
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,139
-Over there.
-What's going on?

83
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,223
What's that?

84
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,752
What are they doing?

85
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,545
-What are you doing?
-Who are you?

86
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,561
Our Jomnyeo Squad
will head in to the front.

87
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,946
And we'll sneak in through the back.

88
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,041
Baek-ho!

89
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:25,259
-Goodness. Ma'am!
-I'm sorry this is all I can do to help.

90
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,136
No, it's all right. Thank you.

91
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,271
Hey, that's Cho Eun-hye.

92
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,107
My camera…

93
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,151
Hey. Stay here.

94
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,446
If we go now,
she won't let us interview her.

95
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,995
I think we'll hit the jackpot today.

96
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,039
Close it.

97
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,628
Should we come with you to help?

98
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,421
That's okay.

99
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,173
Can you just stall them?

100
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,717
-Okay. Go before someone sees you. Go.
-Thanks.

101
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,847
They're leaving. Hurry and start the car.

102
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:21,065
Isn't there an exhibition here today?

103
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,526
That's why we're here.
Where's the parking lot?

104
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,610
Sir.

105
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,611
Yes?

106
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,406
Do you have enough parking space
for all of us?

107
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,408
I don't think they do.

108
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:34,662
No, we don't have any parking space!

109
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:36,038
Is that so?

110
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,541
-They don't have any space.
-They don't.

111
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,668
Then, let's come back another time.

112
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,211
Let's go.

113
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,671
-Okay!
-Okay!

114
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,343
Let's go.

115
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,182
It was nice meeting you all!

116
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,943
They didn't see, right?
I hope the ladies got out all right.

117
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,237
Of course. Don't worry about them.

118
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:13,159
You can call in the special forces,
Navy SEALs, or the Marines to our town.

119
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,952
But they can't beat our Jomnyeo Squad.

120
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,829
You're right.

121
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,206
All right, then.

122
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,875
How about we head
to your first exhibition, Ms. Cho?

123
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,710
Okay! Let's do this!

124
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,766
There they come.

125
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,768
-Over here!
-Here!

126
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,604
Yes, over here!

127
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,193
That's it.

128
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,153
Let's hurry inside.

129
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,905
-Let's go.
-Watch your step.

130
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:00,206
So she came to get the photos?
With all those people?

131
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,125
And she's doing it here?

132
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:07,004
Why do all this to make comeback
with just a KMA exhibition in Jeju?

133
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,172
No.

134
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,675
This isn't a comeback.

135
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,512
There's a reason
why she needs to have it here.

136
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,766
I'll get that exclusive at all costs.

137
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:22,270
You seem pretty determined
after being humiliated by her last time.

138
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,188
I wasn't humiliated!

139
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,488
All right!

140
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,949
Let's all push our way in, okay?

141
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,284
It's almost time anyway.

142
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,451
-Let's go.
-Okay.

143
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,161
-Let's go.
-Let's go inside.

144
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,123
They're all there.

145
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:51,048
What? Weren't they having it
in the lobby? Is it canceled?

146
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,218
I apologize for the late announcement.

147
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,762
The KMA's photography exhibition…

148
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,266
has been canceled.

149
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,350
-What?
-What?

150
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,436
-What?
-What did you say?

151
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,979
Hold on.

152
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,690
You gave the impression you'd hold it,
and then canceled it?

153
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,066
What? They weren't doing it?

154
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,610
Let's go back to Samdal-ri.

155
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,361
-I think we were fooled.
-Let's go.

156
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,739
-We waited for hours.
-Let's go back.

157
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,782
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

158
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,659
-What in the world?
-Come on. Let's go.

159
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,911
Did we tell them too soon?

160
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,456
-They're going back to Samdal-ri.
-Beats me.

161
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:27,543
They have something big planned.
I'm sure they're prepared.

162
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,669
Something big?

163
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,864
He's a lawyer from my dad's side.

164
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,202
He's a reporter
and my mom's distant relative.

165
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:03,996
All right.

166
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,915
-Let's go inside.
-Let's go inside.

167
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,756
Why isn't Eun-hye replying?

168
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,634
I'm on a time crunch.

169
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,891
What are they doing here?

170
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,685
There you are.

171
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,607
What are you doing?

172
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,859
What's going on?

173
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,320
Let's put pressure on Chung-gi.

174
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,364
-Not Bang Eun-ju?
-That's right.

175
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,116
-Cheon Chung-gi?
-Why him?

176
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:44,537
What? Was that bastard also in on this?

177
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,331
No. He's a total coward, so I doubt that.

178
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,668
But he definitely knows something.

179
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:55,339
There's a way for you to come back
while being welcomed like a hero.

180
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,632
I have a plan, you know?

181
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:59,427
-What is it? Tell me.
-You stay right there.

182
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,429
In any case, I have a plan.

183
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,099
I'll tell you if you agree to help me.

184
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:09,520
He doesn't know how to keep a secret.
Poke him and he'll spill the beans.

185
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,606
Darn it. Why are you doing this?

186
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,316
Why are you two also doing this to me?

187
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,651
Hey.

188
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:17,695
Just spill it.

189
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:21,532
You knew she was secretly getting paid
to promote items.

190
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,325
What are you talking about?

191
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,493
Hey, Chung-gi.

192
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,745
I've seen this a lot on TV.

193
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:30,875
If you drag things out in a situation
like this, it'll get too boring.

194
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,835
We know there was no abuse of power

195
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,838
and Bang Eun-ju received money in secret.

196
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,381
What…

197
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,049
This bastard must've been paid too.

198
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:44,513
That's why you gave that incompetent woman
your project and brought her here.

199
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,350
Don't make things up.
I only found out two days ago.

200
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,230
What?

201
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,941
Article 32-1 of the Criminal Act.

202
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:59,069
"Anyone who aids someone in a crime
will be charged as an accessory.

203
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:02,656
"All actions that help the criminal
commit their crime is considered

204
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,949
aiding and abetting."

205
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,453
See? You were aware of it
and still gave her work.

206
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,080
-What are you going to do?
-But I…

207
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,082
I wasn't aware of it then.

208
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,836
I'm innocent. Really.

209
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,631
I know quite a bit about Bang Eun-ju.

210
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:19,798
Where should I begin?

211
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,383
Should I talk to the recorder?

212
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,720
How about we sit down over there
and talk about it?

213
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:28,849
Bang Eun-ju seemed a bit odd
from the moment she joined our company.

214
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:35,940
Ever since Bang Eun-ju worked
for Cho Eun-hye, she secretly took money

215
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,359
in exchange for promoting
items in magazines.

216
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,277
No wonder it didn't match the theme…

217
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:44,156
By the way, does your company
post these kinds of articles too?

218
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,284
Don't you specialize
in real estate and job listings?

219
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,994
You're right.

220
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,914
But this isn't the only newspaper in Jeju.

221
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,960
As a director, she could add
any item she wanted,

222
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:59,255
so she made all that up
about Cho Eun-hye's abuse of power.

223
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,632
I heard her very clearly.

224
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,807
Let's see…

225
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:12,184
JEJU REPORTERS' GROUP TEXT

226
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:16,397
TRUE FACE OF PHOTOGRAPHER BANG EUN-JU

227
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,815
We did it.

228
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,110
-Hello?
-What?

229
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,028
-What is it?
-What do you mean?

230
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,531
-Cho Eun-hye didn't abuse her power?
-What?

231
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,199
Pull up the article online now.

232
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,744
Guys, listen.

233
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,956
They say Cho Eun-hye
didn't abuse her power.

234
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,499
Find where Bang Eun-ju is right now.

235
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,126
-She's here in Jeju, right?
-Yes.

236
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,752
-We need to find her.
-Bang Eun-ju.

237
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:42,047
Hey, where's our car?

238
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,048
-Where is it?
-Hey!

239
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,384
Hey, can you give us a ride?

240
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,604
What's going on?

241
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,148
-Is this true?
-What have you done?

242
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,774
Is the news article true?

243
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,239
BANG EUN-JU PAID FOR ILLEGAL SPONSORSHIP

244
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,158
CHO EUN-HYE'S ABUSE OF POWER WAS A LIE

245
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:36,685
CHO EUN-HYE PROVEN INNOCENT,
ASSISTANT'S LIES REVEALED

246
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,409
I knew it, Ms. Cho.

247
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,535
Are you okay?

248
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,371
Bang Eun-ju is out of her mind.

249
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,164
Kids these days are so scary.

250
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:00,459
-You should sue her.
-I knew you were innocent.

251
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:04,713
What are you up to?

252
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,722
You finally had your name cleared,
but you don't look too happy.

253
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,892
Everything's just so simple and quick.

254
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:22,106
The same people who assumed I was guilty

255
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,733
are now saying they knew I was innocent.

256
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,986
Even the comments are like that.

257
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:31,323
The same people who bashed you
are bashing Bang Eun-ju now.

258
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:37,079
I thought I'd feel liberated
once the truth came out.

259
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,542
But why do I feel so bitter?

260
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,295
Of course, you'd feel bitter.

261
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,845
Let's go and move them inside.

262
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,018
-You're taking two?
-Sam-dal!

263
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,019
-We're here!
-Ms. Cho!

264
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,687
We got Chung-gi good!

265
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,939
-What should we do now?
-Nice. Here, take this.

266
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,733
Just take these? Hurry.

267
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,151
Everyone take one.

268
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,361
Careful. What?
Do they need to be refrigerated?

269
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,487
Why are they wrapped up?

270
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,989
-I'll take one. Thank you.
-Okay.

271
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,282
-Me too.
-This is heavy.

272
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,616
I'll carry it. Go inside.

273
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,868
Go in. I'll carry it.

274
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,037
-Sam-dal, here.
-Hurry.

275
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,997
Take them in. Don't bring them out.

276
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,750
In a world where everything
changes so fast each day…

277
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:23,917
-Hello.
-Hello.

278
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:28,172
I discovered the way
to not get caught up and lose myself…

279
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,090
-Is that a cloud?
-Hurry up!

280
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,342
…in my hometown of Samdal-ri.

281
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,553
-Go on in. Over there.
-Okay.

282
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,013
-Go.
-Hurry.

283
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,431
It's this way.

284
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,854
They're just atmospheric phenomena photos.

285
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,567
So why is she doing all this
to have this exhibition?

286
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,444
Aren't you curious?

287
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:58,535
What?

288
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,455
Darn it.

289
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,250
How did you know about this place?

290
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,795
Answer me.

291
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,297
You're the guy from last time.

292
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,050
Tell me why the hell you're here. Why?

293
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,929
Why are you always so threatening?

294
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:20,390
Why do you think I'm here?
To see the exhibition.

295
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,686
What, am I not allowed
to see this exhibition?

296
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,321
Damn it.

297
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,741
-Sir!
-You scared me.

298
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,247
I hope you

299
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,290
enjoy the exhibition.

300
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:52,172
Don't try to think of ways
to write scandalous articles about her.

301
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:56,426
Focus on Sam-dal's exhibition.

302
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,305
I hope you appreciate it.

303
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,308
It's really nice.

304
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,232
But I'm a reporter.

305
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,153
It's my job to find things to write about.

306
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:33,255
CHO SAM-DAL'S FIRST EXHIBITION
MY PEOPLE AND THE WEATHER

307
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,364
-Do you think this is better?
-I think so.

308
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,449
Hey.

309
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,247
Sam-dal, how high do you want this?

310
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,666
High? Got it.

311
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,210
What kind of pose is this?

312
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,128
My first pose was great.

313
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,087
It was really good.

314
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,511
You must be so happy.

315
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,223
Look, there's a rainbow.

316
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,152
You're all done.

317
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,322
But there's nothing here.

318
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,282
I took a photo of a rainbow earlier.

319
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,909
Once I overlap the films,

320
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:48,205
there will be a beautiful rainbow
over Ms. Yang's face.

321
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,748
She says there will be a rainbow.

322
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,210
The rainbow drawn
by the passage of Ms. Yang's time.

323
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,670
TIME AND RAINBOW

324
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,506
Nice and easy, Mr. Cho.

325
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,049
Nice.

326
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,302
Sam-dal, there's nothing here.

327
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,806
-Are you sure about this?
-Mr. Cho, just trust me.

328
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:08,976
That's nice.

329
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,560
Ready?

330
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,149
Okay. It's done. Mr. Cho!

331
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,777
The halo that was cast on
Uncle Sang-tae's smile.

332
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,161
MY MOM, KO MI-JA

333
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,454
My Mom, Ko Mi-ja.

334
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,167
MY DAD, CHO PAN-SIK

335
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,752
And my Dad, Cho Pan-sik.

336
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,675
Let me back up.

337
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,760
-Bring it down a bit.
-A little bit.

338
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,470
Relax, ladies!

339
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:46,930
Okay, go!

340
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,767
Walk in a straight line!

341
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,729
You're doing well. Don't be nervous.

342
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,022
-Gosh.
-Act natural.

343
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,356
I'm so nervous!

344
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,317
Don't look at Sam-dal.

345
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,234
Fine!

346
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,945
The sea of the haenyeos,
like a flowery path.

347
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:04,781
And…

348
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:05,991
VAPOR TRAILS AND HAENYEOS

349
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,745
…my haenyeos who are like flowers.

My Power Rangers.

354
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,325
LET'S GO, POWER RANGERS!

355
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:49,284
And…

356
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:51,995
My Cho Yong-pil.

YONG-PIL AND THE LENTICULAR CLOUDS

358

CHO SAM-DAL'S FIRST EXHIBITION

359
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,858
The place where I can truly be myself…

360
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,527
MY PEOPLE AND THE WEATHER

361
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,362
My hometown.

362
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,322
My

363
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,241
people.

364
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,140
Looking into those around me,

365
00:23:57,227 --> 00:24:01,481
I find myself and my path within them.

366
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,028
FINAL EPISODE

367
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:17,831
A WARM GAZE TOWARD HER PEOPLE,
CHO SAM-DAL'S FIRST EXHIBITION

368
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,469
INDEX DAILY
REPORTER AN KANG-HYUN

369
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:34,347
Jeez.

370
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:35,974
What's with him?

371
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:40,896
CHO SAM-DAL HAS STARTED ANEW
UNDER HER REAL NAME

372
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,231
MANY ARE WAITING FOR HER
TO RETURN TO THE MAINLAND

373
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,834
Upsy-daisy.

374
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,788
Getting ready for the battle?

375
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,206
Oh, my God!

376
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,543
Hey, you startled me!

377
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,711
Come out.

378
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,046
Let's go for a walk.

379
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,174
Sounds great. Just a second.

380
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,477
Did you just laugh at me?

381
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,853
No, I didn't.

382
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,941
You finally look like a Jeju native now.

383
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,529
The first time we went for a walk,
you had all this gear. It was hilarious.

384
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,782
I didn't do that.

385
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:23,206
By the way,
I've been curious about something.

386
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,124
What?

387
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:28,253
Why didn't you try to reach me
when I was on the mainland?

388
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,299
Well…

389
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,843
I didn't have your number.

390
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,678
Yes, you did.

391
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,054
And my studio's address.

392
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:41,224
You sent me flowers
every time I won an award.

393
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,643
-Yes, that's me.
-Flower delivery.

394
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,729
Thank you.

395
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,528
YOUR NUMBER ONE FAN, BU

396
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,073
You knew about that?

397
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,701
Of course. The sender's name was "Bu."

398
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,870
You're the only Bu I know.

399
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,247
I thought you wanted me to know.

400
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,082
I guess so.

401
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,419
I must've wanted that deep down.

402
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:15,133
If you think now's your chance,
then you should at least tell her.

403
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:18,011
What if it feels
like that chance will never come?

404
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,012
Then…

405
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,431
You should give up.

406
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,894
Give up… Is that so?

407
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,146
If it will never happen,

408
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,149
just give up, Sang-do.

409
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,068
That's one-sided love.

410
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,869
Sang-do.

411
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:44,537
Yes?

412
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,247
By any chance…

413
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,336
is the person you like…

414
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,296
Is it--

415
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,964
It's not you, so don't worry.

416
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,133
It's…

417
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:01,304
Hey! I know that!

418
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:02,806
I was asking just in case!

419
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:05,433
Of course, it wouldn't be me. Jeez!

420
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,186
You look a little disappointed.

421
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,396
Yes, I am.

422
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:15,443
I was worried I had some kind
of irresistible charm I wasn't aware of.

423
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:24,411
Sang-do, you know what? Women in Seoul
would line up to date a guy like you.

424
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,454
-Don't exaggerate.
-I'm serious!

425
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,623
I'll look around in Seoul.
How about blind dates?

426
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:29,582
No way.

427
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,668
Just go on one. All right?

428
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,294
-Fine.
-Okay, let's do it!

429
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,387
Mom, should I become a haenyeo too?

430
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:45,849
Why?

431
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,977
I mean, I'm a good swimmer.

432
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,979
And it'd be nice to dive with you.

433
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,272
Are you insane?

434
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,774
It's not the same as swimming.

435
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,609
Do you know how arduous it is?

436
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,111
You'd be risking your life.

437
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:00,196
What about you then?

438
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,323
You're risking your life too.

439
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,577
I could watch out for you
if I went with you and--

440
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,953
Don't be ridiculous.

441
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:11,416
I'm never going to ask
my children to protect me.

442
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:18,715
Haenyeo school?

443
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:23,970
I mean, I'm not saying I'll do it.
I just want to look into it.

444
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,974
I keep thinking about it
after you said that nonsense.

445
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:31,019
It's not nonsense.
I really think you should do it.

446
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:35,315
But your mom's the haenyeo leader.
Why are you asking me?

447
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:38,818
She's proud of her job and says
it's an intangible cultural heritage.

448
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,987
But she doesn't want
her children to do it.

449
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:45,950
Right. No parent would want their children
to suffer, especially because of them.

450
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:50,413
Yeah, and I know how that feels
better than anyone.

451
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:54,709
I really don't want
Ha-yul to make decisions

452
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,169
just because of me.

453
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:59,172
But…

454
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,842
even though I'm a mom myself,

455
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,261
I keep forgetting how my own mom feels.

456
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:09,057
I'm sure she's like that too
with your grandma.

457
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,767
Right? She probably does, right?

458
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:12,602
Gosh.

459
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:16,689
Wait, why do we get each other so well?

460
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,942
Be honest with me.
You have a secret child, right?

461
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:20,568
Does it show?

462
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:22,821
Seriously?

463
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:24,531
Namchun.

464
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,453
Don't joke around!
I actually believed you.

465
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:31,871
Goodness.

466
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,583
Come to think of it,
you're always so cheerful.

467
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,252
Me?

468
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:40,213
Of course. Why shouldn't I be?

469
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,341
When Ha-yul gets a boyfriend later

470
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:46,427
and hangs out with him
instead of me, I bet I'll be sad then.

471
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,264
Then, you can hang out with me.

472
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,224
What?

473
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,519
With you?

474
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,230
What? Yeah.

475
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:58,857
Because…

476
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,985
you could get a boyfriend too.

477
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,904
And it could be me.

478
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,365
Then…

479
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,786
that means we could go out.

480
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,596
Are you studying again, Ha-yul?

481
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,891
No, I'm not studying.

482
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,309
I'm drawing, Grandma.

483
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:38,897
Goodness, you're good at drawing too.

484
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,482
What were they called again? Artists.

485
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,692
You should become one.

486
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,070
By the way, what are you drawing?

487
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,033
This?

488
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:53,870
Isn't this your mom?

489
00:31:57,123 --> 00:32:01,169
And this is the president
of the dolphin center.

490
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,670
That's right.

491
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,381
It's Mom and the dolphin man.

492
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,551
Why are you drawing them?

493
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,137
Did you take this photo?

494
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,806
-Yes.
-Why?

495
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,600
No reason.

496
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,626
Ha-yul must be good at swimming too.

497
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,587
What? Ha-yul?

498
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,674
What do you mean?
She's terrible at swimming.

499
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:48,591
What?

500
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,892
Her dream is to become a swimmer.

501
00:32:58,643 --> 00:32:59,727
She can't swim?

502
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,729
Ha-yul's dream

503
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,065
is to become a professional swimmer.

504
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,234
Then why…

505
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,493
What's wrong, Mom?

506
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,371
You said you wanted to talk to me.

507
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,089
Ha-yul.

508
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:32,844
How come you never tell
only me what your dream is?

509
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:36,180
What? You suddenly feel hurt about that?

510
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,558
You're not a kid, Mom.

511
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,977
You're afraid of the water.

512
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:43,938
But why do you want to become a swimmer?

513
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:47,567
What?

514
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:51,195
How did you find out about that?

515
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,488
By coincidence.

516
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,035
You're scared of the water and can't swim.

517
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:58,453
So why?

518
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:03,249
Well, I may be afraid now,

519
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,711
but I might not be in a few years.

520
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,130
What do you mean?

521
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:11,799
If you're scared, just don't do it.

522
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,135
You like drawing much more.

523
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,721
But why do you want
to swim if you're afraid?

524
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,477
It's because of me.

525
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:26,898
Ha-yul,

526
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,901
I really don't like you doing this.

527
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,613
I don't want you to try
to achieve what I couldn't.

528
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:34,739
I hate it.

529
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,326
You're not me, so why would you do that?

530
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:42,038
Because it's my fault.

531
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:46,084
You couldn't do it because of me.

532
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,169
Because I was born.

533
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,213
That's why I should do it.

534
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:51,172
Cha Ha-yul!

535
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,967
It's not that I couldn't.
I chose not to do it.

536
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,262
Because I liked you much more.

537
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:02,391
I chose to quit because I loved you
much more than swimming.

538
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,855
I'm not happy at all. No, I hate it.

539
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:12,610
I hate how you're so thoughtful
and how you care about me so much.

540
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,570
And I hate that you're so kind.

541
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:19,200
I wish you'd throw a tantrum
and do whatever you wanted.

542
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,077
Then, what about you?

543
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,913
What about the things you want to do?

544
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,876
I will do

545
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:30,878
the things I want to do.

546
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,464
I'll achieve

547
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:35,883
my own dreams.

548
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,636
So you should just do…

549
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,431
what you want to do.

550
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:58,990
Don't cry.

551
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:03,828
It's okay.

552
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,038
Don't cry.

553
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,259
-Mom!
-Goodness.

554
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,219
Teach me how to dive.

555
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:23,389
I'm going to do it!
Not for your sake but because I want to.

556
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,684
I want to start swimming again.

557
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:38,362
SAMSONGJANG MOTEL

558
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,124
Are you really going to sleep in there?

559
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,083
Yes.

560
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,921
Will you keep me company?

561
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,090
I don't share beds.

562
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,346
I swear I saw it.

563
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,224
I saw a cockroach.

564
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:09,101
But sir, how can you sleep…

565
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:11,812
Good night, sir.

566
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,481
Damn it.

567
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,373
CHO JIN-DAL

568
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,336
Because I love you.

569
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,214
That's right.

570
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,508
Because I love you.

571
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,768
-Hello.
-Hello.

572
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,442
You didn't have to run.

573
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,124
When I…

574
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,962
first saw you here,

575
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,507
do you know what scared me the most?

576
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:30,224
I was afraid that after barely moving on,

577
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:34,228
your feelings for me would reappear again.

578
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:39,775
I was afraid this would happen again.

579
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,995
Pack up your things
and go back to your company tomorrow.

580
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:56,459
My mom is still absolutely against
the construction of the theme park.

581
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,919
And it's only right
that it goes to Namdal-ri.

582
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,465
Set your priorities straight again,

583
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:07,219
and I want you to be
the president of AS Group. I mean it.

584
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,271
What about your feelings for me?

585
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,651
Have they reappeared again?

586
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:32,995
Why do you never take your feelings
into consideration when making a decision?

587
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:38,209
When we got divorced,
you said it was only right.

588
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:41,462
You said it was only right
for me to remain at AS.

589
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:47,468
Even now, you're saying it's only right
for me to return to the company.

590
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:51,764
Why do you always try
to do only what's right?

591
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,183
Your heart…

592
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,144
Cho Jin-dal's heart.

593
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,815
You've always left that out.

594
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,737
Do you love me? Did you miss me?

595
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:10,032
That's what I want to know.

596
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:20,543
I know you like me.

597
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:27,049
I know you love me.

598
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,804
Wake up.

599
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:34,598
-Wake--
-I'm awake.

600
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:35,891
All right.

601
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:41,480
If it's not love,

602
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,525
then why do you smile at me?

603
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:45,985
I never smiled at you.

604
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:47,278
Yes, you did.

605
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:54,076
Why would you worry about me

606
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,329
if you didn't love me?

607
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,414
Fine!

608
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,209
It's love.

609
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,631
But I can't love you.

610
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:12,887
I could never.

611
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,347
Not okay.

612
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:19,810
I'm not going to suffer again.

613
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,145
Damn it.

614
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,772
What do you take me for?

615
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,486
-Hey.
-What?

616
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,321
Leave.

617
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,532
Go back to the mainland!

618
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,659
No.

619
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:39,413
Well done.

620
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,500
Well done, Jin-dal.

621
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:44,835
Hey.

622
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,590
SAMSONGJANG MOTEL

623
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,526
-You lunatic!
-What's wrong?

624
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,277
Seriously!

625
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,403
For crying out loud!

626
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:12,821
Jeon Dae-yeong, you…

627
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:13,989
I can't believe this!

628
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,115
You!

629
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,367
Hey, why are you here?

630
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,536
No! Why am I here?

631
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,663
Hold on.

632
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,708
Honey, there's a cockroach!

633
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:33,801
Honey, there's a cockroach!

634
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,427
Oh, my God!

635
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:36,887
What do I do? I'm going crazy.

636
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,389
-Get dressed. Oh, my God.
-Honey!

637
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:41,225
Put your clothes on, you lunatic!

638
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:42,935
-Get dressed!
-Clothes? They're there!

639
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,189
-Hey.
-Yeah?

640
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,607
Get up now.

641
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,442
-Okay.
-I'll take you home.

642
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,443
Really?

643
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,362
Get up.

644
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:55,364
-Yes, ma'am.
-Let's go. Go.

645
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:56,532
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

646
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,368
-Yeah.
-It's understandable.

647
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:02,204
-Yes.
-It's not right.

648
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:03,831
Why not?

649
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,543
Go inside. Go.

650
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:12,047
Not there. In there.

651
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:16,093
This is where I'll sleep tonight.

652
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:17,261
Hold on.

653
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,850
-You're sleeping here?
-Yeah.

654
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:25,811
A cockroach.

655
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:30,649
There's a cockroach this big in there.

656
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,110
I swear I saw it.

657
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,195
You idiot.

658
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:39,283
You're such a handful.

659
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:45,914
Cockroach, you little bastard.

660
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:49,043
Over there.

661
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:52,296
It ran right under the bed.

662
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:53,631
Over there.

663
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:56,675
Where are you?

664
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,552
You little cockroach.

665
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,055
No.

666
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,432
Over there.

667
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:04,600
Over there.

668
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:05,684
-There.
-Here?

669
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:06,727
Over there.

670
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:07,811
There.

671
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:12,691
-You little cockroach.
-You little cockroach.

672
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:16,695
It's not here.

673
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:52,690
Look--

674
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:53,607
Listen,

675
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:56,568
right now…

676
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:00,948
my mind's not working.

677
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:05,119
Let's talk again tomorrow.

678
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,793
What if we don't care
about AS or anything else?

679
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,296
What if we ignore them

680
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,551
and the two of us

681
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:22,511
just love each other?

682

00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,517
Wait. What's this?

686
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,144
Congratulations, Mr. Cho.

687
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:13,645
He sure is incredible.

688
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,189
I applied for you.

689
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:18,233
What did I tell you? I said you'd make it.

690
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:22,196
Forget it. I'm not going.

691
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,823
Hey, Yong-pil!

692
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:25,991
What is it?

693
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:28,118
You got accepted to the WMO.

694
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,204
Your long-held dream has come true.

695
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,664
How many times
do I have to tell you? I'm not going.

696
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,751
Why not? Others would kill to go.

697
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:38,045
Yong-pil, this is your dream.

698
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:06,448
Cheers to Cho Sam-dal's return

699
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,534
-to the mainland!
-To the mainland!

700
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:12,579
I couldn't have done it without you guys.

701
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:15,415
-Thanks.
-Come on.

702
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,792
Don't mention it.

703
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:20,754
By the way, why did you help
that bastard with his photoshoot?

704
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:21,838
Yeah, why?

705
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:24,925
Why go after someone
who's already at the end of his rope?

706
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:28,095
And he did tell us information too.

707
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,222
Anyway, Hae-dal will become a haenyeo.

708
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:32,808
Yong-pil won't have to
keep an eye on Ms. Ko now.

709
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:34,476
Or have her use a floral pattern buoy.

710
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,813
-Right.
-He'll finally get to wear that fur coat.

711
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:40,357
Fur coat? What do you mean?

712
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,359
It's something
he used to say all the time.

713
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:44,778
He always said Seoul was
like Tarzan's fur coat

714
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:47,030
and Jeju was Tarzan's underwear to him.

715
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:50,784
And now look. Since they're in love,
he put on that fur coat right away.

716
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:52,077
Tell me about it.

717
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,747
Yong-pil will finally go back
to the mainland thanks to Sam-dal.

718
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:58,166
That fool took advantage of Tarzan.

719
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,126
Poor Tarzan.

720
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,335
But it's for the best.

721
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:03,255
I mean, he has more
than enough talent for Switzerland.

722
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:05,132
-Right.
-Why Switzerland?

723
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,010
-Haven't you heard?
-What?

724
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:10,012
The holy grail for Korean forecasters.

725
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:13,432
Only the top 1% who are chosen
can get into the WHO.

726
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:14,725
-It's WMO.
-WMO.

727
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:17,352
World Meteorite Organization?

728
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:19,021
-Meteorological.
-Meteorological.

729
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:20,731
Yong-pil could go there?

730
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:24,234
Of course, he's more than capable.
Problem is he just won't apply.

731
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,028
Why not?

732
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:28,113
He says he's just not interested.

733
00:48:28,905 --> 00:48:32,492
But he'd gain access
to the best research data there.

734
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:37,748
He's been researching the global climate
by himself for years now.

735
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,042
So you'd think he'd be up for it.

736
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:42,419
Leave him be. No one can understand him.

737
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:44,463
At least he's joining HQ.

738
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:48,508
I can't help but feel sad
to hear you're leaving again though.

739
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:49,801
-I agree.
-Right.

740
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,053
Speaking of which,

741
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:54,473
you two are the only ones going back
after coming here as failures.

742
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:55,849
-Hey!
-There you go again.

743
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:57,851
-Stop it.
-There he goes.

744
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:00,479
So what?

745
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:02,481
It's true that we failed.

746
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:03,815
Don't walk on eggshells.

747
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,192
Yeah, I only state the facts.

748
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,278
You guys were failures too.

749
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,489
You failed the quickest, Gyeong-tae.

750
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:14,201
Eun-u wasn't even close to becoming
a cartoonist before failing.

751
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,995
I didn't fail.
I came back to make a living.

752
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,373
-Right.
-I've never even set foot there.

753
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:20,749
Hey, that's enough.

754
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:23,043
This is too heartbreaking to listen to.

755
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,671
They might as well try
going to Seoul again.

756
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:28,090
Don't say that. They'll really do it.

757
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:35,472
You in?

758
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:38,433
I'm in.

759
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,977
Don't be absurd.
You can't decide this so rashly.

760
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:43,689
-It's not rash.
-You should come with us this time.

761
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:47,150
-Why should I?
-You could open a branch in Cheongdam.

762
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,319
-Don't be absurd.
-Gyeong-tae can part-time.

763
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:51,530
-My heart's always in Seoul.
-It's perfect.

764
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,535
-WMO.
-World Meteorological Organization.

765
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,120
Yong-pil could go there?

766
00:49:58,203 --> 00:50:00,622
He's more than capable.
Problem is he just won't apply.

767
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:02,791
-Okay?
-It's okay.

768
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,757
Gosh, there's some trash here.

771
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,811
Hey, are you still at the hideout?

772
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:08,482
Why did you get them all excited?

773
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,066
They're all determined to go.

774
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,778
They might be packing
their bags for Seoul right now.

775
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:13,862
I know.

776
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:17,824
But if they have regrets,
it's all right to go back to Seoul.

777
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:24,664
They failed there, came back home,
and finally managed to settle down here.

778
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:28,668
They're not even 40 yet.
What's stopping them from trying?

779
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:33,173
If they fail again,
they can come back here and take a break.

780
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,801
Right, that's true.

781
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:38,845
But who came back recently
as a failure and bawled her eyes out?

782
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:42,015
That happened ages ago.

783
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:43,975
It was pretty recent.

784
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:53,276
Hey.

785
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,445
-Yong-pil.
-Yeah?

786
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:58,198
What about you?

787
00:51:59,074 --> 00:51:59,991
What?

788
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,326
Don't you have any?

789
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:03,078
Any what?

790
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:08,750
Is there anything you'd regret
down the road for not doing?

791
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:10,627
Nothing?

792
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:12,754
What if there is?

793
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:17,092
In that case, you should do it.

794
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:21,680
No, I don't have any.

795
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:22,889
Nothing.

You got in.

798
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,327
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance.

799
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,496
You sure you won't regret not going?

800
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:49,624
Wait, I…

801
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:51,877
I crumpled this up

802
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,963
-because I didn't want to go--
-I know you want to go.

803
00:52:55,547 --> 00:53:00,135
I know you've always wanted to go
but stayed in Jeju because of my mom.

804
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:05,765
And now, I'm the reason
why you don't want to go.

805
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:15,025
Sam-dal,
if you go back to the mainland now,

806
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:18,069
you'll have to start all over again,
and it'll be really hard.

807
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:19,738
You see,

808
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:24,284
I still regret leaving you there
all alone for eight years.

809
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:25,493
I regret it so much.

810
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:28,121
I'm fine. I don't need to go, okay?

811
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:30,707
See? I knew it.

812
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:34,419
Hey, I'm not Cho Eun-hye! I'm Cho Sam-dal.

813
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:38,381
I don't fear anything now thanks to you.

814
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:42,844
It's all thanks to you.

815
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:50,852
-What's wrong?
-What?

816
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:53,813
Are you okay?

817
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:56,149
What's wrong? Why are you crying?

818
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:58,401
What's wrong? Who made you cry?

819
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:00,445
I want to go home.

820
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:02,072
I want to go back to Jeju.

821
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:03,740
It's too hard for me.

822
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:15,835
Hey, Sam-dal.

823
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,630
Yeah? What's up?

824
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,759
Are you okay?

825
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:25,553
Are you okay?

826
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:34,312
Let's look for her. We can do it.

827
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:37,983
Not the photographer Cho Eun-hye.
Cho Sam-dal.

828
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:39,484
What?

829
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:42,195
Your dream may have disappeared,
but you haven't.

830
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:46,116
The KMA is hosting
a Jeju photo exhibition.

831
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:47,534
You should enter.

832
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,454
Sam-dal loved taking photos too.

833
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:58,586
Cho Sam-dal. She used this.

834
00:54:58,670 --> 00:54:59,754
One shot, one kill.

835
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:01,798
You're not alone.

836
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:05,552
You have your parents,
your sisters, your friends.

837
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:07,721
And you have me!

838
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:15,687
So just like how
you've supported my dream,

839
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:19,441
can't I do the same for you?

840
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:10,658
TWO YEARS LATER

841
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:17,207
FAMOUS SANGDO'S

842
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:20,168
-This is good.
-Hey.

843
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:21,086
Hey, Sam-dal.

844
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:22,212
Ms. Cho!

845
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:25,882
You're always late. Are you a celebrity
or what? The fish is cold now.

846
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:28,968
-It doesn't get cold like a stew.
-It does the longer it's out.

847
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:32,263
I hear you're successful these days.
You're acting so busy.

848
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:35,183
I'm not acting busy. I really am busy.

849
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:38,520
But guess who made me so busy today.

850
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:39,979
I'm sorry.

851
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:43,650
Your crazy boyfriend urged me
to let you go an hour before work ended.

852
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,777
I'd love to punch him if I ever see him.

853
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:49,656
Yes, I have him right here.

854
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,075
Did you make Eun-bi
leave work early again?

855
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:54,953
So what if I did?
It's because I missed her so much.

856
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:57,247
It's your friend's
first relationship ever.

857
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,457
Would it kill you to let her leave early?

858
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,584
In any case, you better not break up.

859
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:05,338
I'll make you pay
for all her late-night shifts I covered.

860
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:09,384
-How much is it?
-Right. He would've been unable to talk

861
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:12,178
in front of you for a year.
So how did this work?

862
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,305
Right. He could never speak to a girl.

863
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:15,473
He was always single.

864
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:19,853
People fall in love even during wartime.
So this is nothing.

865
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:20,770
So…

866
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:23,273
-Right.
-Yes?

867
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:25,692
You see…

868
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:29,446
I have…

869
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:30,864
Normally,

870
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:32,699
I'm very…

871
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:34,451
Excuse me.

872
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,161
Yes?

873
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,120
Well…

874
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:40,748
Why don't you just text me
what you want to say?

875
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:41,833
Right, I'll…

876
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:44,294
I'm pretty impatient,
and this is excruciating.

877
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:45,628
Text…

878
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:48,631
-Then…
-Yeah.

879
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:55,805
Wait…

880
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,396
I like you.

881
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:19,704
But you know what?

882
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:22,916
We probably only texted
our first six months of dating.

883
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:26,711
-Seriously? That's crazy.
-Seriously.

884
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:28,880
Why are you dating him? Think again.

885
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:30,298
Are you jealous?

886
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:32,509
Then, hurry and go out with someone too.

887
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:34,093
What…

888
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:36,221
Hey.

889
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:41,226
Gyeong-tae, is it really impossible
to stop running your mouth?

890
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:44,020
I mean, it's just as I said.

891
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:47,357
After what happened to you two,
we all can't see Yong-pil either.

892
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,026
Why did I--

893
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:51,945
What's wrong?

894
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,279
What is it?

895
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:56,824
-Gyeong-tae, you're really something.
-What do you mean?

896
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:00,578
-What?
-Goodness.

897
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:01,621
Man-su?

898
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:03,873
That's ridiculous.

899
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:05,124
What about him?

900
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:07,377
-It's that part-timer.
-Right.

901
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,754
He donated a billion won
to Samdal-ri and vanished.

902
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,673
That's crazy.

903
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:14,133
That's absurd.
He doesn't have that kind of money.

904
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:15,760
It's true.

905
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:16,844
It's true?

906
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,846
Is it really true?

907
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,265
-Hey, Hae-dal.
-But how?

908
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:21,975
Hey, where did he get all that money?

909
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:24,227
It's a billion for sure.

910
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,437
He left a note saying "Thank you."

911
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:28,189
Then, he vanished.

912
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:31,651
Goodness, stop gossiping
and hurry up with the treatment.

913
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:33,403
Jin-dal, let's talk later.

914
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:37,657
I wasn't gossiping, Mom.

915
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,534
They deserve to know too.

916
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:42,704
Right? This is incredible news.

917
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:48,001
Just a moment, ladies.

918
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:50,878
You have to spread this
all over your face.

919
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,547
-Pat it into your skin.
-Okay.

920
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:53,756
-Pat.
-Okay.

921
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,091
Thoroughly.

922
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:56,718
-Okay.
-Thoroughly.

923
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:00,096
Hae-dal.

924
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:03,016
It feels so moist.

925
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:08,021
Gosh, it's really cold these days.
Our skin is so dry.

926
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:12,191
We're so lucky to have
to have Hae-dal in our haenyeo group.

927
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:13,276
Right.

928
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:15,486
Do you want some too, Ha-yul?

929
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:17,780
Goodness.

930
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:25,705
Hey, that's Jeon Dae-yeong,
the president of AS Airlines.

931
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:29,500
The guy who resigned from his position
and came here because of a woman?

932
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:31,085
-Yes.
-Gosh.

933
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:34,088
I don't know
if that's admirable or foolish.

934
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:39,636
Please check the new recruits

935
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:42,722
and let me know.

936
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,400
-But, sir.
-Yes?

937
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:56,277
-Your wife…
-Yes?

938
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:58,404
-I mean, Ms. Cho.
-Right.

939
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:01,115
She doesn't fly, right?

940
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:02,867
-She trains them, doesn't she?
-Yeah.

941
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:05,662
Then, why does she carry around
a suitcase every day?

942
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:07,914
I'm curious too.

943
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:41,030
Why are you so curious?

944
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:52,417
-Really?
-Do you know Samdal-ri?

945
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,627
-Samdal-ri?
-Samdal-ri.

946
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:57,964
What? She suddenly can't make it?

947
01:01:58,923 --> 01:02:00,341
It's driving me insane too.

948
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:02,427
I spoke to her just this morning.

949
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:06,597
-But now she's in Japan.
-You never do your job…

950
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:11,561
We can't shoot without a model.

951
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:12,729
Exactly.

952
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:15,106
The penalty for canceling will be…

953
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:17,400
What do we do?

954
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:25,074
Hurry up and find a replacement,
or we'll have to call it quits.

955
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:27,660
How will we find
a top-tier model right now?

956
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,913
We'll be in huge trouble
if this gets canceled.

957
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:33,666
Sam-dal.

958
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:36,002
What about her?

959
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:37,545
Who?

960
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:40,339
I think I saw on the news
she's back from the US today.

961
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:41,924
You two are close.

962
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:43,509
Are you crazy?

963
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:46,429
We're not close. We just met through work.

964
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:48,473
She won't come anyway.

965
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:49,932
Forget it. Let's call it quits.

966
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:51,601
Sam-dal, please help me…

967
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:53,811
I mean, please help us.

968
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:55,146
Just this once.

969
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:57,231
Just give her a call.

970
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:58,566
You never know, right?

971
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:06,032
Please.

972
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:16,042
Do you think she'll come
on such short notice?

973
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:20,880
Let's just wrap things up.

974
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:24,926
It was too much
to ask of anyway. It's ridiculous.

975
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:26,427
Let's call it a day.

976
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:28,513
Chung-gi, we're shutting it down.

977
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:29,597
She's here!

978
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:31,265
She's here!

979
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:33,893
-What?
-Sam-dal, she's really here.

980
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:35,686
-What?
-She's here!

981
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:37,647
Get ready!

982
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:03,631
Ms. Cho!

983
01:04:12,139 --> 01:04:13,808
Tae-hee.

984
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:24,151
What happened here while I was in the US?

985
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:26,487
Are you okay?

986
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:30,700
Did you come here
straight from the airport?

987
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:34,120
Gosh, I'm really sorry about this.

988
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:35,329
Don't be.

989
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:38,249
I meant to visit you
as soon as I came to Seoul anyway,

990
01:04:38,332 --> 01:04:41,002
so I rushed over
when I heard you needed a model.

991
01:04:42,336 --> 01:04:44,881
Thank you for saying that.

992
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:47,383
You don't believe me? It's true.

993
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:50,052
I'm late, aren't I?

994
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:55,266
I was hesitant to reach out
to you after what happened.

995
01:04:57,018 --> 01:05:00,438
Of course, I would've felt
the same way. It's totally fine.

996
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:06,235
It still bothered me,
so I sent you gifts from the US.

997
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,528
Did you get them?

998
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:10,781
Really?

999
01:05:11,532 --> 01:05:13,159
I guess you didn't.

1000
01:05:14,368 --> 01:05:18,331
Since I didn't hear from you,
I thought you were still struggling.

1001
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:22,752
Gosh, I'm sorry.
I was back in my hometown.

1002
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:27,757
Is that why
you look so much more at peace?

1003
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:29,675
I'm relieved.

1004
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:39,894
Thank you so much.

1005
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:42,772
-Good!
-Great!

1006
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:43,856
That's it.

1007
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:45,483
She looks so pretty.

1008
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:47,526
-One more time.
-Absolutely gorgeous.

1009
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:49,445
-Beautiful.
-You look great.

1010
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:51,530
Looking good!

1011
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,074
I love it.

1012
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:55,868
That's nice. Keep going. Lovely.

1013
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:01,916
Delivery.

1014
01:06:09,423 --> 01:06:12,385
My vision was hindered
by all the hate I received,

1015
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:15,137
so I failed to see some things.

1016
01:06:18,015 --> 01:06:19,225
I want it bright.

1017
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:21,519
Ready?

1018
01:06:21,602 --> 01:06:23,437
Two! Okay!

1019
01:06:25,439 --> 01:06:28,442
You're just a goddess. You're so gorgeous.

1020
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:29,944
One minute.

1021
01:06:30,027 --> 01:06:32,279
-Excellent.
-Take a look, Ms. Cho.

1022
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:33,906
-Isn't it nice?
-It's so good.

1023
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,741
I'm going to use all of them.

1024
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,159
You really should.

1025
01:06:37,576 --> 01:06:39,578
So many people still loved me.

1026
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:47,420
I may have not noticed,

1027
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:50,965
but Seoul was full of love too.

1028
01:06:55,219 --> 01:06:59,390
It's unlikely that it'll snow
tomorrow on Christmas.

1029
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:02,768
It's due to warm temperatures
caused by El Niño.

1030
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:08,357
The KMA forecasts rain
or warm weather instead of snow.

1031
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:10,401
We hope you have a wonderful Christmas.

1032
01:07:10,484 --> 01:07:14,405
I couldn't care less
if it rained or snowed

1033
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:17,908
since I'll be home anyway.

1034
01:07:22,496 --> 01:07:24,540
CHO YONG-PIL

1035
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:26,751
Why isn't he reading my texts?

1036
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:31,881
He must be busy.

1037
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:41,474
God!

1038
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:44,935
Don't you know how to knock?

1039
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:47,605
What's the point
when it's just us two here?

1040
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:51,567
Hey, I thought you were visiting
Yong-pil next month.

1041
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:52,818
I am.

1042
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:54,111
You're already packing?

1043
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:55,654
Are you bored?

1044
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:57,782
No date with my brother-in-law
on Christmas?

1045
01:07:57,865 --> 01:08:00,159
He's on a business trip. And you.

1046
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:03,120
I told you not to call him that.
We're not family.

1047
01:08:03,204 --> 01:08:06,082
Then, how should I address him?
"Dae-yeong"?

1048
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:07,500
That gave me goosebumps!

1049
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:09,502
Dae-yeong!

1050
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:11,837
Then, what would you call him? "Dad"?

1051
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:13,881
Whatever. Go take the trash out.

1052
01:08:13,964 --> 01:08:16,258
-It reeks.
-No, you do it.

1053
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:17,593
I said it smells.

1054
01:08:17,676 --> 01:08:19,637
Exactly, so you can do it.

1055
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,138
You little…

1056
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:23,140
Why are you getting mad?

1057
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:25,226
You were busy all last week.

1058
01:08:25,309 --> 01:08:27,436
-What are you doing?
-So I took out the trash.

1059
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,064
-It was me.
-Jin-dal.

1060
01:08:30,147 --> 01:08:31,649
-I did all the work.
-Jin-dal!

1061
01:08:31,732 --> 01:08:32,608
All right.

1062
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:35,361
I'll take it out. Okay?

1063
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:36,320
All right.

1064
01:08:36,403 --> 01:08:37,571
-Go.
-Is it cold out?

1065
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:38,948
-Hurry up.
-Fine!

1066
01:08:40,699 --> 01:08:42,326
-It's so cold.
-It is?

1067
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:54,255
I can't even reach Yong-pil.

1068
01:08:56,882 --> 01:08:58,717
I hope he's okay.

1069
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:03,139
Damn it. Why isn't he reading my texts?

1070
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:04,849
It's freezing.

1071
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:07,351
I guess it won't be
a white Christmas this year.

1072
01:09:07,434 --> 01:09:08,853
I heard it won't snow today.

1073
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:10,396
You're right.

1074
01:09:12,898 --> 01:09:14,233
It'll snow today.

1075
01:09:20,781 --> 01:09:22,575
What? It really is snowing.

1076
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:27,454
It's beautiful.

1077
01:09:28,038 --> 01:09:29,206
It really is.

1078
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:33,752
-It's a white Christmas.
-You're right.

1079
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:16,962
What's going on? Why are you here?

1080
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:18,172
Why are you here?

1081
01:10:18,255 --> 01:10:19,840
I came because I missed you.

1082
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:21,383
Are you crying?

1083
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:25,596
I couldn't reach you,
so I thought something had happened.

1084
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:30,267
Let me see you.

1085
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:31,769
You look even more handsome.

1086
01:10:32,436 --> 01:10:33,437
You do.

1087
01:10:34,104 --> 01:10:36,315
You've become more handsome.

1088
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:57,419
Nice. I like that.

1089
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:59,046
-Nice.
-That's nice.

1090
01:10:59,129 --> 01:11:00,339
It's the right exposure.

1091
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:04,426
Stay just like that.

1092
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:05,803
Ready?

1093
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:10,140
-Looking good.
-That's nice.

1094
01:11:10,224 --> 01:11:11,892
I love it!

1095
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:12,935
-Nice.
-Nice!

1096
01:11:13,018 --> 01:11:13,852
I love it!

1097
01:11:15,562 --> 01:11:16,438
Enjoy.

1098
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:21,360
All right.

1099
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:24,113
-Here's your dish. Thank you.
-Thank you.

1100
01:11:24,196 --> 01:11:25,197
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

1101
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:26,907
-Enjoy.
-Sir, we'd like to pay.

1102
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:29,034
Coming! Goodness.

1103
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:31,954
-Hae-na, King Fried Prawns for table two.
-Okay.

1104
01:11:32,037 --> 01:11:33,622
-Your King Tteokbokki.
-Thank you.

1105
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:35,124
You can eat it right away.

1106
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:39,795
Okay. Welcome.

1107
01:11:39,878 --> 01:11:40,713
Welcome.

1108
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:41,630
Table for three?

1109
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:43,841
Here come the Powerpuff Girls. This way.

1110
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:49,972
KOREA'S BEST TTEOKBOKKI, KING SNACKS
WE'RE LOOKING TO FRANCHISE

1111
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:53,934
What do you think, Ms. Eun?

1112
01:11:54,518 --> 01:11:58,188
How about we reveal
this work first instead?

1113
01:11:59,356 --> 01:12:00,316
What do you think?

1114
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:02,192
It sounds great.

1115
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:03,110
I agree.

1116
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:05,654
-We'll do that then.
-Yes, sir.

1117
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:18,334
Jeju agrees. It won't snow.

1118
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:20,210
Wait, I disagree!

1119
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:22,838
It's going to snow in Jeju.

1120
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:25,591
Given the temperature and humidity,

1121
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:27,468
it's bound to snow for sure.

1122
01:12:27,551 --> 01:12:29,053
-Sir, it will snow.
-Hey.

1123
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:31,013
-No, just go back to Jeju.
-But--

1124
01:12:31,096 --> 01:12:32,514
-But--
-Just go, you knucklehead!

1125
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:33,599
Sir, I'm serious.

1126
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:34,808
Can you please go?

1127
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:37,227
-Sir, it's definitely going to snow.
-Just leave!

1128
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:39,646
-It won't snow!
-You don't know Jeju well!

1129
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:40,814
-Yes, I do!
-Hold on!

1130
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:42,441
-For the love of God!
-Please!

1131
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:43,650
Director Han!

1132
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:44,818
-No.
-It's going to snow!

1133
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:47,029
-It won't!
-Seriously! The temperature will drop!

1134
01:12:47,112 --> 01:12:48,489
-To 3 degrees!

SAMDAL-RI'S MASCOT
SAMDAL'S HOUSE

1136
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:16,475
Why did you have to come here

1137
01:13:17,601 --> 01:13:19,478
and make my wife cook twice?

1138
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:22,648
Then, just eat it without cucumbers.

1139
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:23,857
This is my house.

1140
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:25,067
Is that so?

1141
01:13:44,336 --> 01:13:45,295
Hae-dal!

1142
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:47,673
I'll be back!

1143
01:13:50,509 --> 01:13:51,802
Goodness!

1144
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:56,390
As always,

1145
01:13:56,473 --> 01:14:01,103
we're going for only as long
as our breath allows without being greedy.

1146
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:05,023
And whenever we're out of breath,

1147
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:07,443
we'll come back to that place.

1148
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:15,451
-Our small stream, Samdal-ri.
-Our small stream, Samdal-ri.

1149
01:14:18,078 --> 01:14:24,585
HAVING A PLACE TO RETURN TO
IS AN INCREDIBLE RELIEF

1150
01:14:56,533 --> 01:14:58,702
THANKS TO ACTRESS KIM TAE-HEE
