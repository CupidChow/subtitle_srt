1
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:40,999
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

2
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:45,336
Of course.

3
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,255
Hey.

4
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:48,757
Over here, Jin-dal.

5
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,883
Hey, guys!

6
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,302
Hey, your clothes…

7
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,679
I told you to dress up.

8
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,973
I did dress up. It's in my style.

9
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,185
Forget it. This is Jin-dal's charm.

10
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,269
Of course.

11
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:05,732
I don't know how a girl like her
was able to live with that rich family.

12
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,276
Hey, I've missed you. How have you been?

13
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,653
Thank you. Enjoy.

14
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,575
You hired such a great employee.

15
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:18,745
She's always smiling, so it puts me
in a good mood when I'm here.

16
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:21,331
-See you.
-Have a nice day.

17
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,500
-Goodbye.
-Hello!

18
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,545
Congratulations!

19
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:31,966
That's my, Ms. Cho.
She gets everything she wants!

20
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,593
That's very true.

21
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:36,346
Work or love, you are capable
of having it if you want.

22
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,430
I bet you never fail.

23
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,182
That's not true!

24
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,226
Thank you!

25
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,560
Cheers!

26
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:43,978
They say, "A shadow is cast

27
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,814
behind a shining person."

28
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,233
Behind the splendor

29
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,777
and bright smiles,

30
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,656
there is a hidden darkness
that's… difficult to notice.

31
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,700
Your mother-in-law said to throw them out.

32
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,870
Goodness, and it seems she sent
only the select abalones too.

33
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,705
Gosh, leave them.

34
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,207
I'll just eat them myself.

35
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,589
How disgusting.

36
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:56,092
EPISODE 11
WHAT DOESN'T KILL YOU MAKES YOU STRONGER

37
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:58,678
Okay, fine.

38
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,722
Let's hear it.

39
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,682
What did I say to you that day?

40
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:03,892
What was it?

41
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:07,645
You confessed.

42
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,275
What…

43
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,236
What? Hey.

44
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,655
That was absolute nonsense!

45
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,240
I said I had feelings for you?

46
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,826
Gosh, I must've been crazy!

47
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,913
-That was--
-You confessed.

48
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,541
You said you liked me.

49
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:32,795
And I said I liked you too.

50
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,975
We should go. Let's go.

51
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,096
Sam-dal!

52
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,681
Cho Sam-dal!

53
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,144
Sam-dal! Wait!

54
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:35,900
Sam-dal!

55
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:42,115
Jeez, only in the countryside.
Who asks a convenience store to deliver?

56
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:46,077
It's Sam-dal. Sam-dal, are you busy?

57
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,037
Sam-dal! I'm sorry about that day--

58
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,831
-Hey.
-What now?

59
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,332
There's a red car up the road.

60
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,458
What red car?

61
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,713
Cho Sam-dal!

62
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,550
Sam-dal, wait.

63
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,218
Hey, wait up!

64
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,138
What's going on?

65
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,306
They're working out.

66
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,099
Goodness.

67
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,893
Don't your sides hurt
if you run right after a meal?

68
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,645
They're not working out.

69
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,064
Looks like a date to me.

70
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,111
I know something you don't.

71
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:23,114
Maybe you should forget
about whatever that is.

72
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,199
Sam-dal!

73
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,454
Hey, wait.

74
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,085
Cho Sam-dal.

75
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,380
What's wrong with you?

76
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,467
Come on. Let's talk.

77
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:43,885
Hey.

78
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,846
Why are you running away?

79
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,683
Seriously.

80
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,186
Why are you acting this way?

81
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,693
Sam-dal, what's wrong?

82
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,612
Was it because you were surprised?

83
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,364
Open the door. Let's talk.

84
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,450
-I'm coming in.
-Stop.

85
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,744
Just leave me alone.

86
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,412
Are you okay?

87
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:16,000
You should've just left me alone.
Why did you chase me all the way here?

88
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,418
Hey. I chased you,

89
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,128
because you suddenly ran away.

90
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,924
But are you really okay?
Is there something else wrong?

91
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:24,675
No.

92
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,843
Are you sure?

93
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,054
Yes.

94
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,686
How could you run away
after I said that? You startled me.

95
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,357
Forgetting what you did
after getting drunk is normal for you,

96
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,733
so I understand.

97
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,027
But if you run away after hearing that,

98
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,321
honestly,

99
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,490
it hurts.

100
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,911
What… After hearing what?

101
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,542
I said you confessed
your feelings for me, and you ran away!

102
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,295
Hey! How was that
a confession of my feelings?

103
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,631
Who confesses with a kiss…

104
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,594
Hey.

105
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,682
You remembered, didn't you?

106
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,684
Right?

107
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,478
Sam-dal. You actually remember, don't you?

108
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:22,275
-Right? Open the door.
-Yes, I remembered what happened!

109
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,654
I need to collect my thoughts.

110
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,283
So leave me alone.

111
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,009
They're dating.

112
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,218
It's true.

113
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,929
It's obvious that they're dating again.

114
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,974
Okay? I saw them clearly
with my own two eyes.

115
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,855
They're definitely dating.

116
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:06,527
So that means they've had feelings
for each other this whole time?

117
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:07,778
That's right.

118
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,490
Why did they break up then?

119
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:14,994
Good question.

120
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:19,290
Why did they break up
if they've liked each other?

121
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:20,708
-What?
-What?

122
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,169
What are you talking about?

123
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,296
Jeez.

124
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,882
You always know only half of the story.

125
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,759
Jeez.

126
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,303
If I knew everything,
then why would I be here?

127
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,779
You had Gyeong-tae,

128
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,656
Eun-u,

129
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,407
and Sang-do.

130
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,535
You had all of them, right?

131
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:59,539
I was always alone.

132
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,168
I couldn't even turn the radio on

133
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,672
in case they suddenly played
Cho Yong-pil songs.

134
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,717
And if that happened…

135
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:14,637
then,

136
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,224
my heart would sink in an instant.

137
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,540
SAMDAL FISHING VILLAGE HALL

138
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:43,624
We believe

139
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,919
this area is more suitable than Namdal-ri.

140
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,170
Hold on.

141
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,130
But…

142
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:54,260
you do know which town this is, right?

143
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,887
I do. It's Samdal-ri.

144
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,060
Ms. Ko, you should leave.

145
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,562
What are you talking about?

146
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:05,688
Just go.

147
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,233
What nonsense are you planning
to do to our town this time?

148
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,988
You.

149
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,034
What are you doing here?

150
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:19,619
Are you insane?

151
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:23,456
How dare you come here?

152
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,499
You never even showed up four years ago.

153
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,877
How have you been, Father?

154
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,420
Father?

155
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,255
-I'm going to kill you.
-Dad.

156
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,466
-Dad!
-Dad!

157
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:34,800
-Dad!
-Father!

158
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:38,054
I told you not to come to this town.
I said to stay out of sight!

159
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,639
Stop it!

160
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,390
You.

161
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,642
Shut your mouth.

162
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,435
And put that thing down, dear.

163
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:47,772
He's not your child.
You can't decide whether he lives or dies.

164
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,503
Do you still get the hiccups
when you're startled?

165
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,714
I apologize.

166
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:19,011
I doubt you came knowing
I was the head of the haenyeos here.

167
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:20,679
Why did you come here?

168
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,474
Because of the theme park.

169
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:25,935
That's right.

170
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,938
For the theme park.

171
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,648
-That's in Namdal-ri.
-Quiet.

172
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,610
Do you need our town's help

173
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,446
for the theme park in Namdal-ri?

174
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,865
If so, don't worry about it.

175
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:43,869
We won't let our personal feelings
get in the way of your business.

176
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,706
It's not in Namdal-ri.

177
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,504
You should read that carefully.

178
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,638
"The start of a new theme park."

179
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,474
IN SAMDAL-RI

180
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,352
In Samdal-ri?

181
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,524
Instead of building
AS Group's theme park in Namdal-ri,

182
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,276
we'd like to build it in Samdal-ri.

183
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,653
Jeon Dae-yeong! Are you insane?

184
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:23,909
The AS theme park in Samdal-ri?

185
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,077
Yes.

186
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,789
Who came up with that idea?

187
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,628
President Jeon did, ma'am.

188
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,177
-My goodness!
-Mom!

189
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,511
-No, Mom!
-Mother!

190
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,638
Wait, Mother!

191
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,765
Listen, Mom.

192
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,935
-Mom.
-Mom, this is terrible for your health.

193
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,645
He never even showed up once,

194
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,231
and after four years,
that's what he came to say?

195
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,316
Wait, Mom.

196
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,489
Hae-dal, you go home with Dad.

197
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,865
-Okay.
-And Dae-yeong.

198
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:03,866
Yes?

199
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:04,950
Follow me.

200
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,494
Why?

201
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:08,954
Why would you talk to him?

202
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,372
I'll deal with him.

203
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,791
What would you need
to talk with him about?

204
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:13,834
What about you?

205
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,838
What do you two have to talk about?
You two are strangers now.

206
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:19,882
Go on home.

207
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,801
You,
follow me.

208
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,720
Pardon? Yes, sir.

209
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,558
Enjoy your drinks.

210
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:45,032
What? You don't want to drink
because it's not imported liquor?

211
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,953
You sure drank up
when you begged to marry Jin-dal.

212
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:51,956
Thank you, Father.

213
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,457
Stop calling me that!

214
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,751
I'm not your father-in-law anymore.

215
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,503
Right.

216
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,713
Then, from what position

217
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,633
should I continue this conversation?

218
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,010
I mean, as your ex-son-in-law

219
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:09,181
or as the president of the theme park?

220
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,940
He's going to be in a big trouble

221
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,150
if Namdal-ri theme park doesn't work out.

222
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,403
He suddenly changed his word.

223
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,530
Suddenly?

224
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,657
Out of blue?

225
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,077
There was a small incident…

226
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,037
at Namdal-ri.

227
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,789
We know Jin-dal well enough.

228
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,585
Even as a kid, whenever she was upset,
she would smash everything.

229
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,086
Her mother had to pay for all those

230
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,379
wrecked punching machines.

231
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,631
-That's right.
-Serves her right!

232
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,050
Hey!

233
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,888
I won't sign this contract!

234
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,097
What?

235
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,682
Don't be too upset.

236
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,351
They just thought
taking President Jeon's side

237
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,353
-would please him--
-No. I mean,

238
00:14:56,437 --> 00:15:00,190
how could he upend the deal
in Namdal-ri for a reason like that?

239
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,191
Oh, that.

240
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:06,071
Well, you know he gets triggered
when people speak ill of you.

241
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:06,989
Exactly.

242
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,869
After all that,
he still hasn't come to his senses.

243
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:19,084
Do you remember
what you promised me at this very table?

244
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,045
Do you?

245
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:28,177
I told you I couldn't let my daughter
marry into the family of AS Group.

246
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,595
I clearly told you

247
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,431
that my daughter would be unhappy.

248
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,017
And what did you tell me back then?

249
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,812
You said you'd protect her
even if you were disowned by your family.

250
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:44,526
You knelt down right here
and promised me that.

251
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,112
Did you or did you not?

252
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,198
I did, sir.

253
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,241
You said you'd protect her,

254
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,038
but then you send her home alone
with divorce papers?

255
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,166
After AS Group's family
was exposed for abuse of power

256
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,709
by one of their daughters-in-law,

257
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,295
the investigation will expand
to the entire conglomerate.

258
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,923
During their investigation,
the prosecution found

259
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:09,218
evidence of Bang Sang-mi,
the wife of the CEO,

260
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:13,055
and Jeon Dae-sik, the eldest son,
providing illegal political funds,

261
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,224
and they've begun a search and seizure.

262
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,018
The search and seizure was conducted
at AS Group's headquarters…

263
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,395
Did Jin-dal say anything?

264
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,398
It's exactly as the news says.

265
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,565
That's all she said.

266
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,276
She couldn't stand her mother-in-law

267
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,155
and Dae-yeong's older brother mistreating
the people working in that house,

268
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,325
so she exposed them and got a divorce.

269
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,328
They plan to track down
the flow of the illegal funds.

270
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,123
Is Dae-yeong
still not answering the phone?

271
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:43,293
The prosecution will seek
an arrest warrant for Jeon Dae-sik

272
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:47,631
and summon Vice President Jeon Dae-yeong
as a witness for questioning.

273
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,679
I have a right to know.

274
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,850
Although you're not family anymore,

275
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,269
for a short while,

276
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,980
you were my still son-in-law.

277
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:07,860
So I should know
whether you were okay or not.

278
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,874
I also wanted

279
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,379
to be disowned by my family.

280
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:32,968
I didn't care at all
about AS Group and wanted to leave

281
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,846
with Jin-dal,

282
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:39,224
so I even went
to the local district office.

283
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,727
I went, but…

284
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:49,693
But the hoju family register system
had been abolished.

285
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:54,156
Since the hoju family register system
was abolished,

286
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:58,535
so I couldn't disown myself.

287
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:04,625
That's right.
It was abolished back in 2008.

288
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,043
Idiot.

289
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,045
I also…

290
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:17,471
wanted to keep my promise.

291
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,265
But…

292
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,437
Jin-dal, that bitch…

293
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,314
You punk.

294
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,900
You're way too drunk.

295
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:40,619
I was more than willing
to give them all up.

296
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,371
But…

297
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,248
But?

298
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:50,712
She said that I couldn't live
without money.

299
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,465
Jin-dal said that.

300
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,385
And then,

301
00:18:57,427 --> 00:19:01,557
she left me!

302
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,892
I can

303
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:10,566
live without money too!

304
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,493
This.

305
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,163
And this.

306
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,125
Father, you can have all of these.

307
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,629
I don't need any of these things!

308
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,925
Father, take them all.

309
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,179
Why do you keep calling me Father?

310
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,766
Let me see.

311
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,562
Let me try this on…

312
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,565
Well, look at that.

313
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,942
It fits perfectly.

314
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,866
Aunt Jin-dal, can't you please sit down?

315
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,827
-You're making me dizzy.
-It's driving me nuts.

316
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,787
She's right. Take a seat.

317
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,498
Dad's probably catching up
with his ex-son-in-law.

318
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,835
Catching up,
like, "Why did you divorce my daughter?"

319
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:17,549
Why would he upend everything over that
and bring over Namdal-ri's deal?

320
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,384
-Darn it!
-My goodness.

321
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,679
He upended the deal with Namdal-ri
and brought it here? Why?

322
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,391
It's a really childish reason.

323
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,187
Jin-dal.

324
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,148
Yes, Mom?

325
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,150
What is it, Mom?

326
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,819
How long have you been
in touch with Dae-yeong for?

327
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,447
Ever since the divorce?

328
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,741
No. Of course not!

329
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,411
After I came back to Jeju,
I only met him once,

330
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,497
and it was in the street by coincidence.

331
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,583
What was the thing Mom made me do?

332
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,626
The traffic baton.

333
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:56,088
On the day I was doing that,
I ran him on the road.

334
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,507
If you see him again, tell him.

335
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,719
Not even an inch of that theme park
will be allowed in Samdal-ri.

336
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,055
Of course. That would be insane.

337
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:08,350
Mom, I even get headaches
whenever I see AS Group's name anywhere.

338
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,566
Good night.

339
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:22,864
By the way, Jin-dal,

340
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:26,159
are you sure nothing happened
to you while you were married?

341
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:31,623
I mean, they did so many mean things
to their housekeepers and drivers.

342
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,375
And they opposed your marriage.

343
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,211
They must've treated you horribly too.

344
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,924
Did you forget I'm Cho Jin-dal?

345
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,428
If they did that to me, I would've exposed
everything and left in a month,

346
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,470
not five years.

347
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,640
-That's true.
-Yeah.

348
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,643
Anyways, where is Sam-dal?

349
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,729
-She's been gone the whole day.
-I know.

350
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,912
It's cold. Let's go home now.

351
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,042
Sam-dal.

352
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,964
If you don't want to talk,

353
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,301
then just listen.

354
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:27,846
Can I…

355
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,519
make you waver a bit more?

356
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,442
Taking care of you and worrying about you…

357
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,696
are things I've always done,
so they're natural for me.

358
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:51,453
But if you're wavering
because of these things…

359
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:56,625
then let me do a bit more.

360
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,671
Why do you keep asking if I'm okay?

361
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,341
Why do you keep worrying about me

362
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,594
and taking care of me?

363
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,846
Why do you keep…

364
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,767
making me waver?

365
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:20,107
What are you going to do
if I really do lean on you?

366
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,860
I'm going to make you waver a lot more.

367
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:27,364
So just…

368
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:32,702
You can just lean on me.

369
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,046
If I lean on you…

370
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,675
are you confident you can handle it?

371
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,761
Yes.

372
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:33,805
I'm confident.

373
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:20,685
Are you two…

374
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:23,897
back together?

375
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,546
Sam-dal,

376
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,424
do you still have feelings for Yong-pil?

377
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,197
Why won't it turn off?

378
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,533
This thing still doesn't work.

379
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:18,994
What is it?

380
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:19,953
Please turn off.

381
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,039
I mean,

382
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,459
I can't believe they'd do this
in a morning soap opera!

383
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:27,711
My goodness!

384
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,462
Are you looking down on this show?

385
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,755
This is about romance too.

386
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:31,673
I mean,

387
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:35,135
how could they air this in the morning?

388
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:38,430
Children might be watching at this hour.

389
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,890
What's with all the fuss?
It's so old-fashioned.

390
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,977
Call Jin-dal and Hae-dal in for breakfast.

391
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:45,395
Okay.

392
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,817
I'm not old-fashioned.

393
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:52,527
Am I?

394
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:57,115
Something like that being aired
at this hour is what's strange.

395
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:59,576
They should show
children's shows, not kissing…

396
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:05,790
What's wrong with me?

397
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:07,709
I must be crazy.

398
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,548
Jin-dal, Hae-dal. Wake up!

399
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:14,966
Oh, my God!

400
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,094
What in the world?

401
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,182
Dad?

402
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:23,558
Who's this?

403
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,187
What is it?

404
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,229
Our brother-in-law.

405
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,564
Brother-in-law?

406
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:31,608
Jeon Dae-yeong?

407
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:35,362
Damn it, why are you
so noisy this early in the morning?

408
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,323
-What's with this heap?
-No…

409
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,121
Why…

410
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,414
Why is he here?

411
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:48,416
-No idea.
-We don't know.

412
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,834
Come on!

413
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:52,337
Dad.

414
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,463
Wake up.

415
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:55,256
-Dad, wake up.
-Wake up.

416
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,341
Wake up.

417
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:58,426
-Dad, wake up.
-Hey!

418
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,844
-Get away from him.
-Dad.

419
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:00,929
Hey!

420
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,014
-Get away from him!
-Dad, wake up!

421
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,849
-Damn it, get off!
-Dad, wake up!

422
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,228
Goodness.

423
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:10,063
Dad, why did you bring him with you?

424
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:12,607
He should be kicked out of town.

425
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,901
And why are you feeding him, Mom?

426
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,277
Be quiet.

427
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:20,532
How can we kick someone out of our house
at breakfast without feeding them?

428
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,451
You can leave after you eat,

429
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,620
and never come back.

430
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:29,207
So do you want him to eat or not?

431
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,793
Just relax and eat your food.

432
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:34,712
Yes, sir.

433
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,174
Dae-yeong.

434
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:41,094
I mean, Mr. Jeon.

435
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,430
Was it two years ago?

436
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:47,767
AS Group banned me
from shooting advertisements.

437
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:48,893
You know that, right?

438
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,230
Come on, Sam-dal.

439
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:53,815
Let him eat.

440
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,400
-Right.
-Please eat.

441
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,820
I lost my part-time job
at the AS-affiliated coffee shop.

442
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,405
Right.

443
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,240
-Jin-dal hasn't been reinstated--
-Hae-dal!

444
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,202
You little brats.

445
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,622
Ignore them and eat.

446
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,308
How come only you get to eat this?

447
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:35,732
Yuck! It tastes like poop.

448
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,278
How disgusting.

449
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,459
Hey.

450
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:57,045
-Stop eating. Come on.
-Why?

451
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,880
-Why?
-I said let's go.

452
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,467
LUCKY CONVENIENCE STORE

453
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,437
Uncle Sang-tae.

454
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,481
Are you here to buy something?

455
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,066
No.

456
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,609
Then, are you here for Yong-pil?

457
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,112
He went to work.

458
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,156
Is that so?

459
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:44,133
THE PRIDE OF SAMDAL-RI!
CHO YONG-PIL IS HERE!

460
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,322
ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENA

461
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,783
From what I saw yesterday,

462
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,619
it didn't look like she was running
in embarrassment.

463
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,914
Sam-dal ran away
because you said you liked her, right?

464
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,043
Did she run away
in embarrassment or in anger?

465
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,879
I'm sure you can't answer me.

466
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,714
Light pillars.

467
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,424
Do you even know what they are?

468
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,259
I've been here for three years.

469
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:28,970
I may not know a lot,
but I know at least that much.

470
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,890
-So did you confess or not?
-Jeez. Come on, just stop.

471
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:36,477
Why are you so interested
in other people's love lives?

472
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,937
"Other people's"?

473
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,522
Because of other people's love lives,

474
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,191
I lost touch with my old friend
for eight years.

475
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:45,111
You need our permission
to get back together again.

476
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,237
Fine, I got it.

477
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,655
I'll cut you out this time.

478
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:51,618
First, the Forecasting Division,
and now here? You're so clingy.

479
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:52,994
Speak for yourself.

480
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:57,373
How bad was the fight with your dad
to make him demand for your transfer?

481
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,917
What are you talking about?

482
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,252
Your dad's talking
with Director Han right now.

483
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,880
He wants you
to be transferred to a rural area.

484
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,298
A rural area?

485
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,258
What's a more rural area than this?

486
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,384
Dokdo Island?

487
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,054
We don't have an office on Dokdo.

488
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:12,889
I'm off.

489
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,518
We have our next schedule.

490
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,479
I see. Sorry.

491
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,064
-Thanks for your hard work.
-Thanks.

492
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,273
Thank you.

493
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,275
Have a nice day.

494
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:35,662
As if they all started out great.
Why are they only doing this to me?

495
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,164
Sue all of them.

496
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:40,208
Who leaves in the middle
of a shoot like this?

497
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,669
You made them work
four hours of overtime. You…

498
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,129
I mean, we.

499
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,924
Just use the autofocus.
Don't focus manually.

500
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,342
That's why the photos are blurry.

501
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,594
When were my photos ever out of focus?

502
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:53,513
Ms. Bang,

503
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:56,432
whenever you complained
about the lighting or the models,

504
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:59,602
it was actually your photos
that were out of focus. Everyone saw it.

505
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:03,606
Didn't Eun-hye teach you how to focus?
She always taught her assistants that.

506
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,858
-You didn't pay attention, did you?
-Hey!

507
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,820
It's because I'm nervous.

508
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:13,700
I was nervous to finally pick up
a camera after being an AD for so long!

509
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:19,789
Right, then you should take
some time to think about it.

510
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,339
Everyone now knows how bad she is.

511
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:31,509
She doesn't even know
how to get the focus right,

512
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:33,928
but she was doing it in manual mode
to copy you.

513
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,014
Everybody knew
it was the focus that was out,

514
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:39,809
but she kept complaining
about the model and the lighting.

515
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:42,770
She takes others in the industry
for fools.

516
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,480
So did they do the shooting?

517
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:45,940
No, she couldn't.

518
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,277
All the models and staff
got pissed off and left.

519
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:54,198
It served her right for being
the "best photographer in the world."

520
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,786
You're so funny, Eun-bi.

521
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,624
Did they kick her off

522
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,753
-the Magazine X project, then?
-Of course.

523
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:09,964
I wanted to see how far she'd go
with the concept she swiped,

524
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,632
but she's fired.

525
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:13,676
But she somehow got

526
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,889
Cheon Chung-gi to land her another deal.

527
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:21,601
Ms. Cho…

528
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,020
There's something really odd.

529
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,271
Odd?

530
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,273
Do you remember

531
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:30,318
the scarf that Bang Eun-ju insisted
against your will?

532
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,903
The scarf?

533
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:37,450
Ma'am, what's this scarf?
It wasn't included during our meeting.

534
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,035
Well…

535
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,870
Right. You see,

536
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,372
-it's…
-I added it.

537
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:47,794
What's that?

538
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,923
I told you to remove that!

539
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:53,883
Oh, yeah.

540
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,009
I remember it.

541
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:58,846
She had some issues with the wardrobe
because she insisted on using it.

542
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,723
Isn't it a bit weird?

543
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,975
I don't give a damn.

544
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,812
I'm very busy here.
I have no time to think about that.

545
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:06,813
What?

546
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,272
What do you mean?

547
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:11,484
Are you working on some secret project
behind our backs?

548
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:14,320
We feel really sorry for getting paid

549
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,072
for doing nothing here.

550
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,492
If there's anything, let us know.
We'll be there in no time.

551
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,119
All right.

552
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,204
Okay.

553
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:24,914
Bye.

554
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,254
A scarf.

555
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,758
Whatever.

556
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,553
CHO YONG-PIL

557
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,936
What's there I can't handle?
I'm confident.

558
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:50,022
I'm sure about my feelings,
and so are your--

559
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,107
What about mine?

560
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,568
How do you know how I feel?

561
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:58,239
Yes, I couldn't forget you
for a long time.

562
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:02,201
We've known each other
for 30 years. Of course, it was hard.

563
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,496
But that was all in the past.

564
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:09,041
If you felt that way back then,
what about now?

565
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,878
And why did you do that the other day?

566
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:15,673
Why did you get drunk
and do that to me? Why did you kiss me?

567
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,926
Do you always do that
when you're drunk? To just anyone?

568
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:20,553
Hey!

569
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,597
I don't do that
to just anyone when I'm drunk!

570
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:24,515
Damn it.

571
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,475
Don't you follow me.

572
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:28,853
Hey.

573
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:32,732
I clearly told you I'd make you waver.
You agreed to it!

574
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:34,275
What are you talking about?

575
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,402
I'm going to make you waver from now on!

576
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:39,071
You know those tube men
that flail around like this?

577
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,115
I'm going to turn you into that!

578
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:46,704
I must be crazy.

579
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:54,045
You're out of your mind, Cho Sam-dal.

580
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:01,802
What are you doing?

581
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,061
Go away!

582
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:15,608
And stop sneaking up
silently on me like that.

583
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:17,026
What do you mean…

584
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,238
What, you want me to go around yelling?

585
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,573
Just make some kind
of noise when you come.

586
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:26,285
Why do you keep appearing silently?
You always startle me.

587
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,662
I was so scared.

588
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,121
Seriously, what's wrong?

589
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:31,582
Where are you going?

590
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:33,751
One stew for table four.

591
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:34,961
-Okay.
-I got it.

592
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:42,093
So Yong-pil wasn't dumped?

593
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:45,554
They broke up even though they had
feelings for each other.

594
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:48,349
Goodness, I only looked out for Yong-pil.

595
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:51,018
But Sam-dal must've had a hard time too.

596
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:54,313
-Exactly.
-So are they seeing each other again?

597
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:58,025
Yes, Gyeong-tae's mom saw them together.

598
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,736
No, they're not dating.

599
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,737
What?

600
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,532
She said they definitely were.
They're not?

601
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,908
No, they're not.

602
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,911
Sang-do would know best.
He's friends with them.

603
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:12,707
Sang-do, then you should help them
get back together.

604
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,710
-You're right, he can just do that.
-Yeah.

605
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,670
Why should I?

606
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:20,715
Yong-pil is head over heels for her.

607
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,091
You should just--

608
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:24,135
Why do I have to help if he likes her?

609
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,182
I'm getting closer.

610
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:34,061
What? You told me to keep making noise.

611
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:41,569
Don't you have any work to do?
Why are you following me around?

612
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,696
What do you mean? I'm working right now.

613
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:46,449
Get your camera.
We have to go take pictures later tonight.

614
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,496
Forget it. Just send me the coordinates.
I'll go there myself.

615
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,498
What are you talking about?

616
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,000
Excuse me, Miss Photographer.

617
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,879
We need to put our feelings aside
and be professional about this.

618
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:02,089
We have work to do.

619
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:06,427
What are you talking about?
There are no personal feelings here.

620
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,722
They're right there. Those were
your personal feelings just now.

621
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,849
You can't look me in the eyes.

622
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,768
You shoo me away. You get nervous.

623
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:14,977
I bet your palms are sweaty.

624
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:18,731
What… You keep talking nonsense.

625
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,649
When was I ever nervous?

626
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:24,320
You look so nervous right now.
I've felt the same for a few days now.

627
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,489
Honestly, don't we feel the same way?

628
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,913
-Yong-pil.
-Yeah?

629
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:38,793
Remember when I said,
"An ex is worse than a stranger"?

630
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:40,920
Do you know why?

631
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:43,339
Why is an ex worse than a stranger?

632
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:47,510
It's much harder to get back together
with someone you broke up with

633
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:51,013
than to get to know and date a stranger.

634
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,973
Why is it much harder?

635
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,059
Because we'd never forget.

636
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:56,769
Forget what?

637
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,273
The reason why we broke up.

638
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,529
Because we'd never forget why we broke up.

639
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,369
Why should I?

640
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:16,163
Am I a matchmaker? Why should I do that?

641
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,791
If you don't want
to help them, then don't.

642
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,669
There's no need to get mad at me.

643
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:25,381
They've been in love with each other
all these years despite breaking up.

644
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:28,175
-Don't you feel bad for them?
-No, not at all.

645
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,386
What's wrong with you today?

646
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:32,847
Did you have a fight with them?

647
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,932
Come on, don't be like that.

648
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:38,352
Yong-pil has been so nice to you.

649
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:42,773
He always let you have his things
since you were kids, didn't he?

650
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,827
Sang-do! Bu Sang-do!

651
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,287
What about me then?

652
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:58,998
I always let him take a lot more.

653
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:01,792
I always let Yong-pil
take what was mine like an idiot!

654
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,043
Always!

655
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:06,046
Why do I always have to
give up what I want?

656
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:14,388
Goodness, don't mind him.

657
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:24,940
What's with you guys?

658
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:26,817
Did you have a fight?

659
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:28,402
No, we didn't.

660
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:33,449
Yes, you did. Why?
What did you fight about?

661
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,035
Sang-do, what is it?

662
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,538
Sam-dal. I'm sorry,
but could you excuse us?

663
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:42,750
What?

664
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,337
Well…

665
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:48,506
Okay.

666
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,687
What's going on?

667
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,690
I wonder what they fought about.

668
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:10,236
I've never seen them be like this before.

669
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,043
These are Yong-pil's.

670
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,547
Why are his bags here?

671
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,550
Look, I know you said
you wouldn't care about how I felt,

672
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,594
but don't you think
you're taking it a bit far?

673
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,638
I mean, I didn't say anything wrong.

674
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:40,641
You always took what was mine.

675
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:43,769
What do you mean?
What did I take from you?

676
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,522
You think you didn't?

677
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:50,109
Those two never fight.
What's going on with them?

678
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,612
Oh, no. What if they have a fist fight?

679
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,239
I got better grades than you.

680
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:59,243
But I always let you be class president,
and I was vice president.

681
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:00,828
What do you mean you "let me"?

682
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,998
That was an election.
More people voted for me.

683
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,710
I sang better than you too.

684
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:10,921
But because you were on Korea Sings once,
I always let you sing.

685
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,923
I wanted to sing too, you know.

686
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,258
Please!

687
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:16,302
I was always a better singer than you.

688
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,678
-Korea Sings?
-That's a lie.

689
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,388
Don't you remember the festival?

690
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:22,474
-This is how well I sang!
-That's not the right note.

691
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:23,559
-Hey!
-That song--

692
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:27,521
What are you guys doing?
You're bickering like little kids!

693
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,024
Hold on, Sam-dal. You stay out of this.

694
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,275
Let's be honest.

695
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:34,987
Only I could hit that high falsetto note.
Don't you remember?

696
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:38,073
Also, I always switched seats
with you on field trips.

697
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:41,035
I was your partner, but I always
gave up my seat for him. Right?

698
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,122
That is right. Yes.

699
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,375
Fine, if she says it's true,
I'll admit that.

700
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,963
So this time,
it's your turn to concede. Please.

701
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,966
Why should I concede this time?

702
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,176
Don't you remember?

703
00:43:57,259 --> 00:44:00,763
Whenever I played that plane game
at the arcade and set a new record,

704
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:02,222
whose name did I put there?

705
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,932
Your name. I conceded for you.

706
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,477
-That was--
-BSD. I put your initials, Bu Sang-do.

707
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,145
-That's--
-That was a big one.

708
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,396
I never asked for it!

709
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,649
So it's actually your turn
to concede this time.

710
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,692
I'm begging you. Please.

711
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,321
This is so childish.
I can't listen to this anymore.

712
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:18,572
What is this about?

713
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,783
Concede what? Did you find
money on the ground?

714
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:23,369
-It's between me and him.
-You don't need to know.

715
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:26,205
Unbelievable. Whatever!

716
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:28,540
One of you give up. I don't care who!

717
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,334
Just do it now.

718
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:32,461
Who's going to give in? Do it now!

719
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:33,671
We can't give in!

720
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,756
We can't be caught like sitting ducks!

721
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:39,718
How dare they come in and snatch
our theme park away from us?

722
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:41,136
It's time for a good old fight!

723
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,972
Let's go!

724
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:47,685
ALL RESIDENTS OF NAMDAL-RI
WELCOME THE THEME PARK

725
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:57,277
Are you bored?

726
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,155
Why do you keep hovering around me?

727
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:03,033
I'm just here

728
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,077
on business.

729
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,121
Right, the AS theme park.

730
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,039
Have you gone insane?

731
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:15,546
You think I'd let AS Group
come into my hometown?

732
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:19,800
You want my parents to look at it
and be forever distressed by it?

733
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:20,843
No.

734
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,803
That's not it.

735
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:27,099
I wasn't planning on it either.

736
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,309
But it just happened.

737
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:30,769
And…

738
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:33,480
it just so happened…

739
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:36,692
Why would you do this
for such a stupid reason?

740
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:38,193
Why over such a petty thing?

741
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:41,363
Even after what I did to you,

742
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:44,533
you can't stand people badmouthing me?

743
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:47,661
Why is that a petty reason?

744
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:49,663
It is a good reason.

745
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,542
And you didn't do anything to me.

746
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:56,753
You did it, because you had to.

747
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,133
And if you hadn't,
I would've done it myself.

748
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:07,806
Anyway,

749
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:10,684
a theme park in Samdal-ri
will never happen.

750
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:14,313
Look, don't be like that and…

751
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:23,405
They're here! It's the Jomnyeo Squad!

752
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:24,323
What?

753
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,408
You…

754
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,367
Damn it!

755
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:29,786
What…

756
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:31,788
So…

757
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,766
This is bad.

758
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:55,312
-Why are you fighting?
-Hold on.

759
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:56,271
Hurry!

760
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,856
-When we were young…
-Hey!

761
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,608
-And when we played marbles--
-Hey!

762
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:01,485
-Come with us now.
-What do you two want?

763
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,153
The Jomnyeo Squad's here.

764
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,488
-What?
-The Jomnyeo Squad?

765
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:10,327
Let's go!

766
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,037
Let's go!

767
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:16,458
The Jomnyeo Squad? But why?

768
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,835
No idea. It's the first time in ten years.

769
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:21,547
-Come on out.
-Wait. It happened ten years ago too?

770
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,633
-You weren't here.
-Mom went to Namdal-ri for horned turbans.

771
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:27,844
-She was the reason 20 years ago too.
-My mom's off limits. Let's go!

772
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,513
-Hey, hurry.
-What? Okay.

773
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,473
What's going on?

774
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:36,228
Hey, you two cut it out
and hurry up! My goodness!

775
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,115
Take a good look

776
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:50,867
at what you've done.

777
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:04,881
They're here.

778
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,843
What… What's going on?

779
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:11,430
This is really bad.

780
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:16,268
Excuse me. Shouldn't we call the cops?

781
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:18,437
They're not gangsters. Why call the cops…

782
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:20,355
Hey!

783
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,067
I mean, what?

784
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,778
Sam-dal, don't get involved
in the fight. Okay?

785
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,406
I think I know what it's about.

786
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:30,824
The theme park.

787
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:32,242
But that's in Namdal-ri.

788
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,161
-Is it coming to Samdal-ri?
-I'm for it.

789
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:36,955
Are you okay with it?

790
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,665
-Gyeong-tae.
-Yes?

791
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:40,917
You want a few years off your life?

792
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,336
No, I think I'm fine.

793
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,379
Aren't haenyeos about community?

794
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:47,591
They are. That's the Samdal-ri community
and the Namdal-ri community.

795
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:15,327
What do you want to fight about this time?

796
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,788
It seems you're doing this
more and more often.

797
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:23,835
Didn't you consider that you do
something stupid more and more often?

798
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,213
Is this about the theme park?

799
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:29,257
We don't need it. Just take it.

800
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:33,845
You always say one thing,
but do something else behind our backs!

801
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:36,473
Your daughter didn't receive any alimony,

802
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:39,518
so are you trying steal some money
from AS with the theme park?

803
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:42,854
Or are you trying to set up a store
for Sam-dal after her career failed?

804
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,272
What did you say?

805
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:49,027
How dare you utter my daughter's name
with that filthy mouth, you witch?

806
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,570
What did you call me?

807
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:52,823
A witch?

808
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:54,282
That's right, a witch!

809
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:57,327
-Hey!
-Hey!

810
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:58,537
Mom!

811
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,746
-Hey, hurry.
-Mom!

812
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:10,108
Stop!

813
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:15,280
Stop!

814
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:18,200
Please stop!

815
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,159
Stop!

816
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:22,871
At this rate, we're all going to die!

817
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:58,573
-Hey.
-Yes?

818
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:01,326
You saw what happened.
You still want to go through with it?

819
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,579
Go to Namdal-ri and apologize right now.

820
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:06,122
Build your theme park there.

821
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:11,962
I'm doing this to stop Mother from diving.

822
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:19,928
What?

823
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:23,890
It's dangerous for someone
with arrhythmia to go diving.

824
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,351
If a theme park is built here,

825
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,728
she won't have to dive anymore.

826
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:33,692
How do you know about that?

827
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:38,446
It's atrial fibrillation.

828
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:40,490
Arrhythmia.

829
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:45,745
It won't affect her much
if she takes medication regularly,

830
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:49,124
but it's very dangerous
because she keeps diving.

831
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:53,086
It's like an underwater time-bomb.

832
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:55,964
If the theme park is built here,

833
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:58,717
she won't have to dive for work.

834
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,512
The waters will become a tourist area,
so she'll be prevented from diving.

835
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:03,805
And the compensation

836
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:07,976
will be as good as a pension.

837
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:14,024
So you brought the theme park project
over here for my mom?

838
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:21,698
You paid for her hospital bill too?

839
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,453
Why would you…

840
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:29,748
What are you doing?

841
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:32,626
We're not family anymore.
Why would you care about my mom?

842
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,170
I'm sorry, Jeon Dae-yeong,

843
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:37,756
but you seem to keep forgetting something.

844
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,677
Have you forgotten
about your brother and mother?

845
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,763
Just doing this will get you in trouble!

846
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:48,058
I don't care anymore.

847
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:50,310
Stop being so immature.

848
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,145
You're on your own.

849
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,484
I don't want anything from you!

850
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:00,570
Just accept my intentions.

851
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:05,784
This is the only way
to stop your mother from diving.

852
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,704
I'll help you.

853
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:22,217
-Right.
-Goodness.

854
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,094
-Those Namdal-ri scoundrels.
-Jeez.

855
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:27,263
They pulled all my hair out.

856
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:28,264
Goodness.

857
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,600
Theme park, my foot.

858
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,769
-Even if trucks came, I won't let them in.
-Gosh,

859
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:36,231
Goodness. Are you okay, Ms. Ko?

860
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:40,777
You just got out of the hospital.
I can't believe this is happening.

861
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:41,903
Exactly.

862
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:47,742
But if a theme park is built here,
won't things get easier for us?

863
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:50,745
I mean, the compensation is huge

864
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:53,540
so isn't that why those scoundrels
are fighting for it?

865
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:54,749
Are you crazy?

866
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:58,044
You want to live comfortably
with that money after selling off the sea?

867
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:59,129
Goodness.

868
00:55:00,296 --> 00:55:02,799
I mean, Ms. Ko is ill.

869
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:05,927
Everyone's telling her to stop diving.

870
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,389
Well, I do think about that too.

871
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:14,519
I stay up all night worrying
you'll have another accident.

872
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:15,729
Right?

873
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,772
I'm worried about that too.

874
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,315
That's enough.

875
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:22,777
I'll never allow it.

876
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:26,156
It's up to us to protect the sea.

877
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:29,534
If we allow such changes,
what will become of this land?

878
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,872
If I die, I'd rather die in the sea.

879
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:37,876
I'm the sea, and the sea is me.

880
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:41,880
So don't worry about me.

881
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:09,991
Why…

882
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:13,578
Why am I getting butterflies?

883
00:56:17,373 --> 00:56:19,542
Why do you
keep getting butterflies, Sam-dal?

884
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,377
Why do you keep…

885
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:30,637
What are you going to do?

886
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:34,099
He gives you butterflies,

887
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:36,768
so what are you going to do?

888
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,901
Sam-dal, are you done showering?

889
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,612
Why are you taking so long?

890
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,874
What are you doing here?

891
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:03,002
Me? I was waiting for you.
Are you done showering?

892
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:04,671
What?

893
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:06,089
Are you trying to come in? Why?

894
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:08,341
No, I'm not coming in.

895
00:57:08,424 --> 00:57:09,259
Hurry on out.

896
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:12,387
We're supposed to
take pictures in the evening.

897
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:15,473
Honestly, I'm just doing my job right now.

898
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:16,683
Hurry up. We're late.

899
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:18,351
Right.

900
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:22,564
Can we just go another day?

901
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:24,524
Another day, okay? Bye.

902
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:25,942
-Wait.
-What is it?

903
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:27,944
It can't wait. It's today or never.

904
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:33,491
Please, just leave me alone.

905
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:36,161
Please, I'm begging you.

906
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,290
Let's go.

907
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:53,470
Sam-dal, how long are you
going to be cold like that?

908
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:56,598
You'll know when we get there
why it has to be today.

909
00:57:58,266 --> 00:58:00,185
You don't listen to a word I say.

910
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,187
You don't even care.

911
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,731
Because you don't look me
in the eyes when you speak.

912
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:12,614
By the way, I saw your bags
in the hideout.

913
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:13,698
Why are they there?

914
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:14,782
Well…

915
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:16,701
I moved out.

916
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:19,078
What?

917
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:23,124
It just happened. I've moved out for now.

918
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:24,501
But…

919
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:26,586
Why would you move out?

920
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:28,421
Is it because of me…

921
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,301
Because of you what?

922
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:35,762
Nothing.

923
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:48,608
My daughter is pretty today as always.
My baby, my love.

924
00:58:57,992 --> 00:59:00,161
A HAPPY BIRTHDAY WEEK WITH FRIENDS

925
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,458
THIS PLACE IS LIKE HEAVEN

926
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:11,881
HAPPY IN PARIS

927
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,852
Life isn't all about money, you know?

928
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:30,191
A lot of good things in life
can't be bought, you boomer!

929
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,410
Goodness.

930
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:45,540
What is this doing here?

931
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:03,516
Ha-yul, what are you doing?

932
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,060
I'm looking at the stars.

933
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:09,022
I'm bored. Play with me.

934
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:12,066
You should look too.

935
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:13,985
The stars?

936
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:15,820
Fine, I'll look at the stars.

937
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:17,447
Let's see.

938
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:24,203
-Mom.
-Yeah?

939
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:28,499
What does the Big Dipper look like?

940
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,294
The Big Dipper?

941
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:33,254
I don't know.

942
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:38,676
You didn't pay attention
in school, did you?

943
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:42,513
I didn't. Just you wait.

944
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:45,558
I'll find the Big Dipper for you. Hold on.

945
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,685
Big Dipper…

946
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,146
-This?
-Yeah.

947
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:51,898
Let's see.

948
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:54,984
It looks like that one.

949
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:58,363
Wait. Isn't it the one next to it?

950
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:01,783
-The ladle-shaped one.
-This one?

951
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:03,117
Yeah.

952
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:06,996
No, that one looks too much
like a question mark.

953
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:10,541
I think that's the correct one.

954
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:11,668
Are you sure?

955
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,379
Or maybe not?

956
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:17,048
I don't know.

957
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:27,266
Ha-yul.

958
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:28,851
Yes?

959
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:32,563
Did you hide Grandma's diving suit?

960
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:35,316
Yes.

961
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:39,862
Why?

962
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:43,866
Were you worried about her going diving?

963
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,788
Because she might have another accident?

964
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:50,998
Yeah.

965
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:58,089
You really like Grandma a lot.

966
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:01,134
How adorable!

967
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:03,720
Who told you to be so adorable?

968
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:07,890
Mom, I can't breathe.

969
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:13,062
-Ha-yul.
-Yes?

970
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,940
Should we go see
the dolphins you like tomorrow?

971
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:19,652
Namchun doesn't come by these days.

972
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,529
No, not that.

973
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:23,698
You can see them in the aquarium.

974
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:26,117
Really?

975
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:27,702
Of course.

976
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:33,082
How about we go see the dolphins
and then eat tteokbokki tomorrow?

977
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:35,668
You can have the tteokbokki yourself

978
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:37,253
Why?

979
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:39,172
Let's eat together.

980
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:40,965
I don't want to.

981
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:51,392
JEJU DOLPHIN CENTER

982
01:03:03,237 --> 01:03:06,949
My daughter is pretty today as always.
My baby, my love.

983
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:25,551
I was more than willing
to give them all up.

984
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:27,887
Jin-dal said that.

985
01:03:28,846 --> 01:03:30,097
And then,

986
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:34,811
she left me!

987
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:38,272
I can

988
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:44,654
live without money too!

989
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:15,643
Tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.

990
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:18,187
A Samdal-ri theme park presentation
for residents.

991
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:20,648
I'll wait in front
of the convenience store.

992
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:22,733
Let's work together.

993
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:28,489
Jeez, it's cold.

994
01:04:36,914 --> 01:04:39,250
So why did you move out?

995
01:04:42,169 --> 01:04:43,170
Drink this.

996
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,259
You brought coffee?

997
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:49,760
Yes.

998
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:51,304
Don't you remember?

999
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:54,932
We used to always drink coffee
while looking at the stars.

1000
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:10,197
It's good.

1001
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,451
It tastes better
in a nice place like this, right?

1002
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:18,039
Am I supposed to take photos of the stars?

1003
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:20,249
No.

1004
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,751
The squid boats then?

1005
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:23,961
Squid boats are so common in Jeju.

1006
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:27,340
No. Just be patient.

1007
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:31,427
I don't know when it might appear,
so keep your eyes wide open and wait.

1008
01:05:36,223 --> 01:05:37,099
Let's see.

1009
01:06:16,013 --> 01:06:17,181
Sam-dal.

1010
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:21,060
Yeah?

1011
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:24,397
Why did you think I moved out…

1012
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:28,818
because of you?

1013
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:32,238
What?

1014
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:34,281
You asked me if it was because of you.

1015
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,244
Well, it's just because…

1016
01:06:42,456 --> 01:06:44,041
What do you think was the reason…

1017
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:48,295
why we broke up?

1018
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:50,798
What?

1019
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,926
Why did we break up back then?

1020
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:23,664
Why bring up the past after all this time?

1021
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:27,084
You told me

1022
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:30,296
that an ex is worse than a stranger,

1023
01:07:31,922 --> 01:07:34,759
because even if time passed,
you'd never forget why you broke up.

1024
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:40,473
Right.

1025
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,434
But even if we can't forget the reason,

1026
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,105
but we could still overcome it.

1027
01:07:50,357 --> 01:07:52,234
What do you mean?

1028
01:07:53,986 --> 01:07:55,237
The memories of our love…

1029
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:01,285
are stronger
than the reason for our breakup.

1030
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:01,804
I know

1031
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:05,683
that whatever the reason
for our breakup was…

1032
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:09,145
I can overcome all of it.

1033
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:01,238
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

1034
01:10:28,265 --> 01:10:30,517
We just fell asleep. By accident.

1035
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:32,269
You're going to eat
ramyeon again today?

1036
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:33,687
No, I'm not.

1037
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:36,023
Didn't we agree to speak
casually at that bar?

1038
01:10:36,106 --> 01:10:37,733
When did I agree to that?

1039
01:10:38,692 --> 01:10:40,736
Mom, she's…

1040
01:10:40,819 --> 01:10:43,656
I won't tolerate anyone
who mistreats our daughters anymore.

1041
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:45,241
-Did you upload this?
-Yeah

1042
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:48,202
I just stomped on her to make sure
she'd never get up again.

1043
01:10:48,285 --> 01:10:51,163
-They're here.
-How dare you set foot here?

1044
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,624
Yong-pil is serving his punishment.

1045
01:10:53,707 --> 01:10:54,750
For what?

1046
01:10:55,459 --> 01:10:57,253
Would you return to Seoul?

1047
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:02,758
