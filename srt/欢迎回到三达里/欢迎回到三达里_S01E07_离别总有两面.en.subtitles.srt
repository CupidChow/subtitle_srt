1
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,999
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

2
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:46,921
8 YEARS AGO

3
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:14,491
You must be going somewhere far away
to even cancel your phone plan.

4
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,825
-Yes. Here you go.
-Thank you.

5
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,120
What about the data on your phone?

6
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,456
-Please erase it.
-Okay.

7
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,947
Can you text me the reference
that the magazine sent you?

8
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,282
I'll check it right away.

9
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,366
Bye.

10
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,553
Just when I'd thought
that I had completely let him go…

11
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:25,556
Perhaps

12
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,852
that was when
I was clinging onto him the most.

13
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,950
EPISODE 7
BREAKING UP, WITH LOVE

14
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,516
Ok is outside again.

15
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,937
She spent all her life
working like a dog as a haenyeo.

16
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,023
She must be sick of the sea,

17
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,233
so why is she always out there?

18
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,903
I wouldn't even look
at the sea if I were her.

19
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,572
Yeah, right.

20
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,117
You even came to work
with a cast around your broken leg.

21
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,831
That's when my husband lost
all his money investing in hot springs

22
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:35,168
and when Gyeong-tae ran off with my money.

23
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,838
She's right.

24
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:43,342
She broke her leg when she fell
while chasing after Gyeong-tae.

25
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,385
You're right.

26
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,137
Laugh it up.

27
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:55,271
The sea is the best place to be
when you're troubled.

28
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:59,317
It's peaceful,
and no one bothers you there. Right?

29
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,986
-I disagree.
-Goodness, Ms. Ko.

30
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,323
You really like the sea
despite everything you've gone through.

31
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,407
-Right.
-Right.

32
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,535
There's no such thing as an easy job.

33
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:14,624
But what's good is we neither have to
retire nor compete with others.

34
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,293
We earn as much as we work,

35
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,712
and can keep working
as long as we're healthy.

36
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,130
That's true.

37
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,217
The sea provides our children
with food and tuition.

38
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,761
-Right.
-Right.

39
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,433
Goodness, Ms. Ko.

40
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,477
Yong-pil told you to keep that on.

41
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,687
Gosh, just leave it on.

42
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,898
Yong-pil will be hurt if he sees it.

43
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:41,526
Why? It's too worn out.
I should take it off.

44
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:45,279
By the way, where is he?
I haven't seen him since yesterday.

45
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,823
Yong-pil?

46
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,699
He went to the mainland yesterday.

47
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:49,742
He took a half day off.

48
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:50,743
-What?
-He did.

49
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,412
Why would he need
to take a half day and go there?

50
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,372
Beats me.

51
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:57,125
Eun-u heard it at the office.
He doesn't know why either.

52
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,459
-Eun-u said that?
-Yeah.

53
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,379
I thought the Power Rangers
knew everything about each other.

54
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,297
I thought they knew nothing at all.

55
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,302
Goodness, you startled me. What is it?

56
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,221
Nothing.

57
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,889
I'll get going first.

58
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,225
Make sure to wrap up and go home.

59
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,184
What?

60
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,936
-You're leaving?
-Ms. Ko!

61
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,023
What's going on?

62
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,783
Sang-tae.

63
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,745
Goodness, why are you carrying so much?

64
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,123
Goodness. Going somewhere?

65
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,499
My daughter's place in the city.

66
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,001
-Gosh.
-And you?

67
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,753
On my way to an eye doctor
in the city. My vision's blurry.

68
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,132
Let me carry them. You can't do it alone.

69
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,176
You'll collapse on your way there.

70
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,178
Gosh, you're so kind.

71
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,888
You're always too kind.

72
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:52,972
Let's go.

73
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,023
Let's go, ma'am.

74
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,197
What's the matter?

75
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,116
I'm afraid I'll have to
catch the next bus.

76
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,745
-Can you take these to her seat?
-Sure.

77
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:19,540
You're not getting on? You'll have to
wait a long time for the next bus.

78
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,625
Take care.

79
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,133
Aren't we going to go?

80
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,176
Yes, sir.

81
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,219
Get your hands off her!

82
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,015
Let's go.

83
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,486
Is that you, Mom?

84
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,032
What are you doing?

85
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:41,205
Why do you have that?

86
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,418
Sam-dal,

87
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,046
do you still have feelings for Yong-pil?

88
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,969
That was so random.
What are you talking about?

89
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,762
Jeez.

90
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:57,680
This.

91
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,142
Did you really go to Seoul by yourself?

92
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,062
Well…

93
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,611
Grandma, I'm hungry.

94
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,695
Gosh.

95
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,447
-Me too, Mom.
-Gosh.

96
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,073
-Let's eat.
-I want food.

97
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,701
-Ha-yul, wash your hands.
-Okay.

98
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,715
Whatever.

99
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:45,394
What could he still be doing outside
on this tiny island?

100
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,817
I'm so bored.

101
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,738
You're still not over her, are you?

102
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,790
Are you still not over her, Yong-pil?

103
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,463
Does it seem that way?

104
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,758
Then, is it okay if I like her?

105
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,811
I've always liked her.

106
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:30,022
I liked her when you guys were dating.

107
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,942
I liked her even before that.

108
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,573
I wasn't going to tell you.

109
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,160
But whenever I see you,

110
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,914
it gnaws at me and I feel guilty.

111
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,424
Never mind. You don't have to answer me.

112
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,428
You must be confused
and flustered right now.

113
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,470
I'm sure you are.

114
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,556
Do I have to be?

115
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,392
Do I

116
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,812
have to feel confused

117
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,731
and flustered?

118
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,363
I said I have feelings for Sam-dal.

119
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,283
Are you okay with that?

120
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,411
Yeah.

121
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,745
What?

122
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,041
Hey, Yong-pil.

123
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,126
Yeah?

124
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,755
I used to like Sam-dal.

125
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,552
I really liked her a lot.

126
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,638
But because of you,

127
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,016
I couldn't tell her that.

128
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,769
I hate you.

129
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,690
I used to like Sam-dal.

130
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,193
No.

131
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,111
I still do.

132
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,032
But because of you…

133
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,083
You dummy.

134
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,711
You really should see a doctor.

135
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,046
This is serious.

136
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:20,424
I watched this documentary recently.

137
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,427
What was it called again?
Alcohol-induced blackouts?

138
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:27,181
It's the gateway to dementia.
It could really be the death of you.

139
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,476
Wait. I've told you this before?

140
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,811
Yes, about 17…

141
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:33,854
No, wait.

142
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:37,650
Including the last time you told me,
I've heard this a total of 18 times.

143
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,860
-17 times?
-I didn't want to embarrass you,

144
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:40,986
so I tried to forget.

145
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,198
But every time I almost forget
about it, you bring it up.

146
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,658
Jeez, you idiot.

147
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:46,784
Come to your senses.

148
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,372
I really don't remember telling him.

149
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:53,749
Hey, Sang-do.

150
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,634
You shouldn't feel bad…

151
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,055
about liking someone, don't you think?

152
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:13,769
And you definitely
don't need anyone's permission to do it.

153
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,692
So don't feel guilty about it.

154
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,070
It's how you feel.

155
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,030
So do as your heart says.

156
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,908
It's not like you stole something,
so don't worry about me.

157
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:28,951
You're too kind.

158
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,081
How could I ever do that?

159
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,167
If you're still not over her,

160
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,295
then how can I like her?

161
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,716
That's why I'm asking you, Yong-pil.

162
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,637
Do you still have feelings for Sam-dal?

163
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,309
Hi, you two.

164
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,521
What are you doing out here in the rain?

165
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,066
You should at least be under some eaves.

166
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,026
You're going to catch a cold.

167
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,157
Don't touch them.

168
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,075
Why not?

169
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:56,038
Their mother will abandon her kittens
if they're touched by humans.

170
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,915
-Seriously? She'll do that?
-Yeah.

171
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,506
How long are we going to stay here?

172
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,217
It's been an hour already.
My legs are killing me.

173
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,636
If we leave, they'll get drenched.

174
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:14,598
I would've brought an umbrella
if you'd predicted the weather correctly.

175
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,266
But you're just a fraud.

176
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,351
Excuse me?

177
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,937
I'm still a trainee.
I'm not a forecaster yet.

178
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:21,647
Jeez.

179
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,025
And there's no point in forecasting
the weather in Jeju nowadays.

180
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,736
It's obviously going to rain
every single day.

181
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,447
-It's true.
-All right.

182
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,700
Look at how cute you are
getting all worked up.

183
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,661
I feel so bad for them.

184
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:38,872
They're kittens, so it's dangerous
if they catch a cold.

185
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,041
What should we do?

186
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,338
It's so refreshing!

187
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,632
Come here! You're going to go bald.

188
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,260
We're in Jeju. The rain here is clean!

189
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,013
-This is awesome!
-You'll catch a cold. Come here.

190
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:01,353
You can't kiss me!
The neighbors might see us!

191
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,399
-Hey.
-Let's go.

192
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,420
SHINING JEJU, TOWARDS THE FUTURE TOGETHER

193
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,797
Cho Jin-dal
from Samdal Girls' High is back?

194
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,215
The one from Rosebay Gang?

195
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:34,178
Yeah, I could never forget her.
I suffered so much because of her.

196
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:37,056
Yeah, because you always bullied
the kids from her school.

197
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,057
Gosh.

198
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,017
Aren't you going home?

199
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,810
-Yes, we are.
-Yes, we're leaving.

200
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,688
Why is she back though?

201
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,523
What do you mean? Didn't you hear?

202
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,692
Because of her sister Cho Eun-hye,

203
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,570
that famous photographer
who made headlines recently.

204
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,906
All three came back
because her career failed.

205
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,741
They couldn't show their faces in Seoul.

206
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:57,910
Who?

207
00:17:58,744 --> 00:17:59,745
Who's here?

208
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,915
Right. You live in Samdal-ri.
The leader of the haenyeos…

209
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:06,001
Sam… Sam-dal's back?

210
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,629
To live in Jeju?

211
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,048
Gosh.

212
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,468
Almost there.

213
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,261
Damn it.

214
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:22,684
Isn't he a forecaster? How could he
leave his window open when it's raining?

215
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,611
Damn it!

216
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:35,656
Darn it.

217
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,960
What are you doing?

218
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:21,910
Are you okay--

219
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,578
I'm really fine.

220
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,456
I don't need any ointment for my elbow.

221
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,082
You know what?

222
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,460
If I get a scar here like this,

223
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,629
it'll look like…

224
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,882
Like I have a story to tell.

225
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:20,302
I'd look like a mysterious guy
with a cool scar on…

226
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,185
Let me see your arm.

227
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,062
Okay.

228
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:35,692
Just bear it.

229
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,794
It's your fault for startling me.

230
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,295
And what about you?

231
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:59,549
Why were you climbing my wall
and peeking into my room?

232
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,010
Well, because…

233
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,640
Are you even a forecaster?
Why leave your window open when it rains?

234
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:10,936
Don't you remember getting your mattress
all drenched the last time you did that?

235
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,271
Right, I remember.

236
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,316
My mattress became
squeaky clean because of that.

237
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,069
You call that squeaky clean?
It made you reek for months.

238
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,570
Is that so?

239
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:25,867
I get it. You were worried I'd reek,
so that's why you climbed my wall

240
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,744
and peeked inside my room.

241
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,831
Hey, I'm not a pervert.

242
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,958
The window was open!

243
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,460
All right, already. The window.

244
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,130
Fine. You wanted to close the window.

245
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:40,340
That's why you climbed my wall

246
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,509
-and peeked inside.
-You better watch it.

247
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:47,389
Jeez, how can you be still so annoying?

248
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,141
Look at you all sopping wet.

249
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,601
Don't tell anyone you're a forecaster.

250
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,562
No one will believe the forecast.

251
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:57,524
You know, there's a lot of things
about me you seem to overlook.

252
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,484
To be honest,

253
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,030
I'm actually the best forecaster
of the Jeju Office.

254
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,782
That's me.

255
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,535
It's the truth.

256
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:12,622
HQ calls me multiple times a day
because they want to recruit me.

257
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,499
It's no joke. I'm in high demand.

258
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,377
You know, I've been curious about that.

259
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,046
Others are dying to join HQ,

260
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:21,506
but I heard you've been refusing to go.

261
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,885
Why? Do you have some treasure
hidden on this island?

262
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:27,637
Hey.

263
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:32,768
It's not like I'd become
any more successful

264
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,146
if I went to suffer
in a far off place full of strangers.

265
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,774
A dragon rises from a small stream, right?

266
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,026
Be the dragon in Seoul.
I'll be the stream.

267
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:43,904
Small stream, my foot.

268
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,116
You're a real piece of work.

269
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:50,994
Hey, it stopped raining.

270
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,125
It's not raining anymore.

271
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:22,859
Hey, Yong-pil.

272
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:24,736
Yeah?

273
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,782
Don't tell my mom

274
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,411
that we went to Seoul together.

275
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:02,149
SEOUL TO JEJU

276
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:30,051
FORECAST LOG

277
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:49,946
Come on, Dad. Why are you
in my room and touching my stuff?

278
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,781
This is my house, not your room.

279
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,786
Where's your lotion? I ran out of mine.

280
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,248
Here.

281
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,584
It's brand new, so you can keep it.

282
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:05,837
Hey, Yong-pil.

283
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,173
You should join HQ.

284
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:11,593
Here we go again.
You've been speaking to Director Han.

285
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,512
I don't have any privacy
at work or even in town.

286
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,639
I'm an adult, you know.

287
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:18,183
You can get a promotion if you join HQ.

288
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,227
You should go while their offer stands.

289
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,687
They won't want you there when you're old.

290
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,857
You'll be monitoring the weather
in Korea and around the world too.

291
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,610
You won't have to jot things down in that.

292
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,529
I was just doodling. That's all.

293
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,490
Why were you snooping around my room?

294
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,367
I'm not joining HQ.

295
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,915
What? What is it?

296
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,543
Why do you keep trying
to send me to the mainland?

297
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,714
I'll leave as soon as you get remarried.

298
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,718
Then, at least come home early.

299
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,304
You've been coming home late.

300
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,815
What is it now?

301
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:11,069
You can keep it.
It doesn't suit my skin type.

302
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,196
Old folks like me need
something with more oil.

303
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:20,829
Dae-yeong? Goodness! Move.

304
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:21,913
It's insane, right?

305
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:25,709
How could she run into the president
of AS Group here in Jeju?

306
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,419
I had no idea either.

307
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,005
It was so absurd, so I looked it up.

308
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,882
He's here
for that theme park in Namdal-ri.

309
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,136
-Gosh.
-What on earth is this?

310
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:39,639
Goodness, his face.

311
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,392
-What happened?
-Poor Dae-yeong.

312
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,688
To be honest, his family was the problem.

313
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,398
He wasn't that bad.

314
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:51,776
Hey, Dae-yeong and his family
are inseparable.

315
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:56,990
By the way,

316
00:26:57,073 --> 00:27:00,785
why are you always in here
instead of our big living room? Get out.

317
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:05,498
Are you going somewhere?

318
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,584
Here it is.

319
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:08,752
Where are you going?

320
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,005
To find Cho Sam-dal.

321
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:14,382
What?

322
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:29,856
Hey, where you going?

323
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,316
Going hiking?

324
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,443
To Hallasan Mountain?

325
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:35,612
No.

326
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:40,158
I'm going to find Cho Sam-dal
instead of Cho Eun-hye.

327
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:42,952
What are you talking about?

328
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,332
You told me to find Cho Sam-dal. Remember?

329
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:49,376
Right, I did say that.

330
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,002
But…

331
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:52,587
Don't tell me…

332
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,674
No way.

333
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:58,468
What?

334
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,678
Don't tell me

335
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,182
you're off to find yourself

336
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:05,809
on the Jeju Olle Trail?

337
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,561
Yes, I am.

338
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,107
Where can I find myself?

339
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,443
Where?

340
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,958
FINDING MYSELF ON THE JEJU OLLE TRAIL

341
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,004
"Finding myself on the Jeju Olle Trail"?

342
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:39,092
Sam-dal, you're hilarious.

343
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:41,594
You're still just as silly
as you used to be.

344
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:44,305
You don't have to go that far to find her.

345
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,016
She's right here. This is Cho Sam-dal.

346
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,019
Is this funny to you? Is it?

347
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,688
You told me to find myself.

348
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,773
Yes, I did say that.

349
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:57,402
But I didn't think
you'd make a huge deal out of it.

350
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:59,738
You look all set to climb the Himalayas.

351
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,948
Stop teasing me and just go.

352
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,158
Do you need a ride?

353
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,909
No, just go.

354
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:05,952
All right.

355
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:09,205
Good luck!

356
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,547
What's his deal?

357
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,969
It's not going to be easy
to find Cho Sam-dal.

358
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,242
You shouldn't feel bad

359
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,287
about liking someone, don't you think?

360
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,539
That's why I'm asking you, Yong-pil.

361
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,294
Do you still have feelings for Sam-dal?

362
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:02,842
Or have you left the past behind
and just see her as a friend now?

363
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,432
If I told you I wasn't still over her,

364
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,894
would you stop liking her? No…

365
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,522
Would it even be possible?

366
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,317
No…

367
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,194
No.

368
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:23,947
I'm still going to like her.

369
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,951
Okay. Then, that's good.

370
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:29,953
I'll answer your question.

371
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,121
It's not that…

372
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,583
I couldn't get over her.

373
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,298
I just chose not to.

374
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,513
The thing is

375
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,140
I've…

376
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,520
never tried to get over Sam-dal.

377
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:26,861
We should go now, sir.

378
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,113
She must've seen me.

379
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:30,782
Sir?

380
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:32,367
I'm talking about Jin-dal.

381
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,286
Do you think

382
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,872
she saw me that day?

383
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,628
Do you mean Ms. Cho?

384
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,882
Judging by the angle of her turned head…

385
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,510
She saw you.

386
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,101
How was my expression? Did I look okay?

387
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:02,605
You looked

388
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,441
absolutely terrified, sir.

389
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,110
Damn it!

390
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,616
Human instincts are truly a mystery.

391
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,412
What's next on the agenda?

392
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:20,665
You'll rest at the hotel
until evening, then head to city hall--

393
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:21,708
Dae-yeong.

394
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,460
Hey.

395
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:28,423
I saw that you landed
in the headlines again.

396
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:31,509
It's an incredible nickname.
"Clumsy Dae-yeong."

397
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:33,678
I heard some entertainment journalists

398
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:36,639
are becoming business reporters
solely to cover him.

399
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,600
You should work out regularly.

400
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,353
A real man should have strong legs.

401
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:43,813
Oh, right. You're divorced.

402
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:46,524
I guess there's no need for them.
Sorry, little brother.

403
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:47,817
Could you please stop joking--

404
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,863
Uncle must be worried sick
about handing over the business to you.

405
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,240
Thanks to your ex-wife,

406
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:56,993
the entire nation cussed out
your family for abuse of power.

407
00:33:57,076 --> 00:34:01,330
We spent tens of billions of won
trying to restore our company's value!

408
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:05,084
Jeon Dae-yeong, come to your senses.

409
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,086
Or let us manage the company instead.

410
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,422
All you do is cause trouble.

411
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,597
Why, hello there.

412
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:20,808
I've been learning taekwondo these days.

413
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,272
I've trained so much
that whenever I blow my top,

414
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:28,858
I automatically throw a kick.

415
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,278
My goodness, your legs.

416
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,614
You should work them out.

417
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:37,241
A real man should…

418
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,160
Right.

419
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,497
You already use them
here and there a lot. That's right.

420
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,918
What is this, Jin-dal?
Where are your manners?

421
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:49,462
Manners? Oh, yes.

422
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,507
Manners are definitely important.

423
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:56,344
It's my motto
to mirror the person in front of me

424
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,097
and treat them the way they treat others.

425
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:05,144
And I can't teach dogs to talk, now can I?

426
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,562
-Dogs?
-Yes.

427
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:07,772
Yes!

428
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,315
What are you doing? Let's go!

429
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:11,609
-Dogs?
-You're embarrassing me!

430
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:16,656
Serves you right.

431
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,324
Honey…

432
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:28,918
Sir?

433
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,212
Sir?

434
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,381
Yeah?

435
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,715
Are you all right?

436
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:36,717
Yes.

437
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:44,225
I think he's become
an even bigger idiot since the divorce.

438
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:52,400
Secretary Ko.

439
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,653
What town did you say she lived in?

440
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:57,738
Sudal-ri?

441
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:58,698
Hudal-ri?

442
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,535
Three…

443
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,620
Right. Samdal-ri!

444
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:09,876
Hello.

445
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,047
All right, Ha-yul.

446
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,968
Put anything you want in this basket.

447
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,137
It's my treat.

448
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,889
What's the occasion?

449
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,224
You make it sound
like I don't buy you anything.

450
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,566
I heard you didn't like this town.

451
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:40,156
To be honest, I hate it too.
It's so irritating.

452
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,743
What do you do when you're irritated?
You shop. Okay?

453
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,120
Okay. Now go.

454
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,422
KIDS BINOCULARS

455
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,939
A ghost that feeds on alcohol
must be haunting our house.

456
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:17,443
I keep buying them,
and they keep disappearing.

457
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:21,113
There are three ghosts
that feed on alcohol at our house.

458
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,699
Are you done already?

459
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,077
What did you pick? Let me see.

460
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:29,330
HANGOVER TONIC
KIDS BINOCULARS

461
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:31,916
Binoculars?

462
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:35,544
Great choice. Kids your age
should like toys like these.

463
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,800
I didn't pick these because I like them.

464
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,803
I just had nothing to buy.

465
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,097
You should hurry up too.

466
00:37:57,191 --> 00:38:00,528
AS BEER

467
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:04,949
Just how better could this beer be
compared to other brands?

468
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,952
This must've been that idiot's idea.

469
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,578
Jeez.

470
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:14,583
Goodness!

471
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:17,628
My goodness.

472
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,256
Mr. Ko.

473
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:22,717
How have you been, ma'am?

474
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:25,344
Well…

475
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:29,223
You can walk home by yourself?

476
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,517
I know this town like the back of my hand.

477
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,270
Yes. You're right.

478
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,148
Bye.

479
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,779
-Please sit down.
-Yes, ma'am.

480
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:50,453
I see you're still boycotting AS products.

481
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:51,996
Well…

482
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:57,960
Isn't it only natural for a divorcée
to boycott her ex-in-laws' products?

483
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,046
But you did that
when you were married too.

484
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:15,269
It's good to see that you're doing better.

485
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:18,647
I'm glad you're still working there.

486
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,067
No one's bothering you now, right?

487
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,318
All thanks to you, ma'am.

488
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:24,862
You taught them
all a lesson before you left.

489
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,282
When did you return to Jeju?

490
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,079
The way we met again after four years
was quite intense, wasn't it?

491
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,373
Right. Tell me about it.

492
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,167
It just had to be the day
when I looked like that.

493
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,378
I looked pathetic, right?

494
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,295
No.

495
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:46,008
You looked ten times cooler
than when you were married.

496
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,596
What brings you here anyway?

497
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,101
I felt bad

498
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,520
that I never called you.

499
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:04,318
Thanks to you, we're finally being treated
like decent human beings.

500
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:06,946
You're our savior.

501
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,616
Yet we didn't call you
even once out of fear.

502
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,035
We're terrible people.

503
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:16,956
What did I tell you?

504
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,333
You're not the terrible ones.

505
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,420
The terrible ones were petty enough
to forbid you from seeing me,

506
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:25,464
so why are you blaming yourself
for not risking your job?

507
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:30,344
You're innocent, so stop blaming
yourselves as if you were guilty.

508
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:32,972
I knew it.

509
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:34,890
You're still the same.

510
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,916
Where's Namchun?

511
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:07,173
Hi, Mom.

512
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,924
I'm at the beach right now.

513
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,764
First, contact the ship owners

514
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:18,809
and check when they last spotted Namchun.

515
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:22,313
The Ministry of Oceans
will find Namchun's last-known location,

516
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:23,606
so let's wait for them.

517
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:32,239
What?

518
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,325
Sir, could you drop me off here?

519
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:46,378
I'll continue to check the coast!

520
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,507
Come on, Namchun.

521
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,009
PLEASE INSERT 500 WON

522
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,093
Five hundred won?

523
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,149
Damn it.

524
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,158
Are you alone?

525
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:19,787
Then, I'll come over to where you are.

526
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,664
Okay, wait for me there.

527
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,796
What's he doing?

528
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,428
Excuse me!

529
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,724
What's the matter?

530
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,434
Do you have a 500-won coin?

531
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,358
Who was that?

532
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,071
Just some guy who's a bit dumb.

533
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,744
-Just a 500-won coin.
-Well…

534
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,706
Sure. Okay.

535
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:04,790
Just a minute.

536
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:12,673
Thank you so much!

537
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,265
She's not here.

538
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:24,310
Come on, where are you?

539
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,521
Come on. Let me see you.

540
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,984
Excuse me.

541
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:34,903
What's your name?

542
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,947
Please show yourself.

543
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,074
Where are you from? Where's your guardian?

544
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,284
Please…

545
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,746
Do you not know your name?

546
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:46,415
Or do you perhaps have a name tag?

547
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,753
I can't help him if I don't know his name.

548
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:53,047
Do you really not know your name?

549
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,465
Namchun!

550
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,550
There we go!

551
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,011
Namchun is over there!

552
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:00,638
Namchun!

553
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,681
-Jeez!
-Nam-chun?

554
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:08,020
Right. 500 won.

555
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:13,359
Well…

556
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:17,029
-I don't have any money right now, but--
-Nam-chun?

557
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,114
-Sorry?
-So that's your name!

558
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:23,452
Goodness, it's very dangerous
to be wandering around here all alone.

559
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,871
Where did you come from, Nam-chun?

560
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:27,539
Me?

561
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:29,875
I'm from the center.

562
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,003
Right, the center.

563
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,631
Okay. Can you tell me
the name of the center?

564
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,804
JEJU WELFARE CENTER

565
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,263
I see.

566
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,349
-You meant this kind of center?
-Yes.

567
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:48,644
I'm going to see if it's nearby,
so tell me the name.

568
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:52,314
JEJU BOTTLENOSE DOLPHIN GROUP
PRESIDENT GONG JI-CHAN

569
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:56,110
"Dolphin Center President…"

570
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,954
Look, I'm sorry.

571
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:10,457
I mean, you were shouting
and talking to yourself so--

572
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:11,667
Talking to myself?

573
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,961
Didn't you see Namchun
jump out back there?

574
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:16,171
We hadn't been able to
track her since yesterday.

575
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,382
I was worried sick,
so I wasn't in my right mind.

576
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:19,842
Exactly.

577
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,886
I had no idea
you were so passionate about dolphins.

578
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,305
It took me six years to free Namchun.

579
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,516
It's not just passion.
She's like my child.

580
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,477
How could a parent be sane
when their child's missing?

581
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,564
I guess you're right.

582
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:35,190
How could it be like his child?

583
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:37,067
What did you just say?

584
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,071
Forget it.

585
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,906
No, wait.

586
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,533
No, look.

587
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:47,619
It's understandable
if the dolphin's like a child to you.

588
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:48,954
Of course.

589
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:50,664
Ha-yul!

590
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:53,459
That kid…

591
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,253
Goodness.

592
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,340
What's this?

593
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,677
You told me not to hang out
with weird strangers.

594
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:08,307
So why are you here with this dumb guy?

595
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,351
Let me get this straight, kid.

596
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:15,355
So she told you not to hang out
with me because I was dumb?

597
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:18,317
-I can explain--
-This dumb guy is leaving.

598
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,736
Unbelievable! Dumb?

599
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:21,653
Hold on.

600
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:24,615
I'll feel terrible
if I let you leave like this.

601
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:28,118
The 500 won. You don't need
to pay me back, okay?

602
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:29,453
Shall we call it even?

603
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,639
What are you doing? That was dangerous.

604
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:50,516
Goodness.

605
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:54,186
Let's go.

606
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,022
Aunt Hae-dal!

607
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,734
Let's go, Aunt Hae-dal.

608
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:04,446
What…

609
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:06,573
Ha-yul.

610
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:08,992
Ha-yul.

611
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:23,048
Are you still putting in requests
for your reinstatement?

612
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,843
Why do you ask?
Are you going to dissuade me?

613
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,346
Because it won't happen?

614
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,808
I know AS Group's preventing it.

615
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:37,813
But I'm going to keep trying.

616
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,609
There aren't any reasons
for me to be disqualified.

617
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,528
Why should I give up?

618
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:49,741
-Or you could ask Mr. Jeon--
-Don't.

619
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,868
Don't you dare bring up that idiot.

620
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:54,830
Just don't let me see him.

621
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:05,507
Mr. Jeon.

622
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:07,968
Secretary Ko.

623
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:16,393
What brings you here, sir?

624
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:18,520
What?

625
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,523
What… Why?

626
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:23,817
Well…

627
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,028
What was it again?

628
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,490
-I came here looking for you.
-Sir?

629
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:31,575
What?

630
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:33,660
Well…

631
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:39,541
I wanted to visit the Jeju Sambangsan
Carbonate Hot Springs,

632
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,209
but the car was gone.

633
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:44,379
You're on the clock, you know?

634
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:45,672
Where have you been?

635
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:47,424
Come on, Secretary Ko.

636
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:50,260
How did you get here then?

637
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:52,054
The hotel taxi.

638
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,975
Why didn't you take that
to the hot springs?

639
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:58,060
What?

640
00:48:58,935 --> 00:49:00,395
Gosh, that's a great idea.

641
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:03,315
Why didn't I think of that?

642
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,320
Can you move aside so I can go home?

643
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:11,657
Right. Sure. Go ahead.

644
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:13,575
That's not my house.

645
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:18,955
So it's not this one. Then…

646
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:20,957
I see.

647
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,376
So…

648
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:23,627
Is it that red roof?

649
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,921
This one has a blue roof. It's not…

650
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:27,297
It's not this one.

651
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,924
Honey! I mean…

652
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:29,841
"Honey"?

653
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:31,468
What should I call her?

654
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:32,719
Excuse me!

655
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:38,141
What is it?

656
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:40,727
Well…

657
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:42,396
So…

658
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:44,439
I just…

659
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,485
Have you been well?

660
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:14,219
Listen.

661
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:18,890
If your brother
sees you here, he'll kill you.

662
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,352
There's a lot of eyes here.

663
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:37,784
Secretary Ko, hurry.

664
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,040
Hurry up.

665
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,399
You're off early today, Mr. Cho.

666
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:10,317
I am.

667
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,195
Maybe it's because all three
of your daughters are back,

668
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:15,947
but you look very happy.

669
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,074
Your house must be full of cheer.

670
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:22,537
Not at all. They only make us upset.
It was peaceful when it was just us two.

671
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:23,622
Goodness.

672
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,625
Goodness, what'll you do now?

673
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:30,462
They'll all settle down here
since Sam-dal can't go back to Seoul.

674
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:34,090
I guess you won't have the chance
to be lovey-dovey with your wife.

675
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:35,675
-What?
-What?

676
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:38,512
-Sam-dal can't return to the mainland?
-Of course not.

677
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:39,805
How can she?

678
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:42,641
It's not that she can't.
She's choosing not to.

679
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:45,310
She's innocent, so there's no reason
she can't go back.

680
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:49,606
-I see.
-She even went to Seoul two days ago.

681
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:52,234
Did she?

682
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:53,401
Yes.

683
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:55,570
Two days ago?

684
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:59,449
Didn't Yong-pil go to the mainland
two days ago as well?

685
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:00,534
-Yes.
-He did.

686
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,661
Yong-pil went to Seoul two days ago too.

687
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:05,997
He did?

688
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,251
Hello.

689
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:14,673
Hold on.

690
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:18,093
CAPTURING JEJU'S WEATHER
PHOTOGRAPHY EXHIBITION AND CONTEST

691
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:32,357
Hey, you've only been interested
in forecasting the weather.

692
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,025
So why are you interested in this?

693
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:38,154
As an employee of the Korea
Meteorological Administration,

694
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:40,699
I should be aware
of events my workplace holds.

695
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:42,200
This is perfect for Sam-dal.

696
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:45,328
Really?

697
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:49,541
My mom saw Sam-dal headed somewhere
in hiking gear this morning.

698
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:50,792
Did she go somewhere?

699
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:55,338
-Probably.
-Where? Hallasan Mountain?

700
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:57,632
I don't know.

701
00:52:57,716 --> 00:53:00,010
She wanted to find herself or something.

702
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:01,219
What does that mean?

703
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:03,763
What's the one trip in Jeju
you take to find yourself?

704
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:05,932
Finding myself…

705
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:08,351
The Jeju Olle Trail?

706
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:09,853
Yeah, the Jeju Olle Trail.

707
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:11,062
That's where she went?

708
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:52,270
What problems would
a young lady have to come here alone?

709
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:54,314
She's not that young.
Maybe in her forties?

710
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:55,649
Are you still single?

711
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:56,566
Yes.

712
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,568
Are you divorced? What about your husband?

713
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:02,739
Shouldn't you get a grip
before trying to finding yourself?

714
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:06,368
Just how many people
signed up for this program?

715
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:25,637
She'll have to find herself
in that crowd first.

716
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:26,930
Why didn't you stop her?

717
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,059
Gosh, that Jeju Olle Trail.

718
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:32,936
Why would I ever stop her?

719
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,187
What's wrong with you?

720
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:36,022
Have you finally gone crazy?

721
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:38,525
Hey, I heard you went to Seoul.

722
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:39,734
Goodness.

723
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:41,611
What for?

724
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,071
You don't need to know.

725
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,703
Why do you keep trying to find out?

726
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,287
You must've gone with Sam-dal.

727
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:56,126
Hey, I heard Yong-pil and Sam-dal
went to Seoul together!

728
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:05,010
You went there with Sam-dal…

729
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,067
My goodness!

730
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,821
The sky is so beautiful
that I don't want to go home.

731
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:30,952
Let's go, people.

732
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:33,121
-The sun is setting.
-Let's go.

733
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:34,998
-Let's go!
-Come on, let's go.

734
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:37,584
-Let's go.
-Okay.

735
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:44,382
Goodness.

736
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:46,468
That's what happened.

737
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:49,846
Does this mean those two are dating again?

738
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:51,931
Isn't that obvious?

739
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,726
Why else would they go
to the mainland together?

740
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:58,229
Yong-pil's such a pure-hearted guy.

741
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:04,194
Hello, Ms. Ko.

742
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:06,071
Why are you so late?

743
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:09,532
Goodness. Maybe it's
because the days have become longer,

744
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,201
but I'm sleepy all the time.

745
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:15,622
I wonder what Ms. Ko ate
when she was pregnant

746
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:18,625
to have given birth
to a girl with such devilish charm.

747
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:21,878
What kind of nonsense
are you talking about?

748
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:23,546
It's about Sam-dal.

749
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,381
Maybe she's playing dumb.

750
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:28,468
Do you really not know?

751
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:31,930
Sam-dal and Yong-pil are back together.

752
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,057
What?

753
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,143
Who told you that nonsense?

754
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,230
You don't have to yell at us.

755
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:44,192
-They went to the mainland together--
-So what if they did?

756
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:46,277
Does that make them a couple?

757
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:48,488
Those two aren't dating!

758
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:50,615
Don't be ridiculous.

759
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:54,536
You better not say
such absurd things ever again.

760
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:56,955
Damn it!

761
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,001
Goodness.

762
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,420
-Why is she so worked up?
-She's upset.

763
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:06,005
Did something happen?

764
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,549
Jeez.

765
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,266
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

766
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:18,560
Cheers!

767
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:34,284
Dad!

768
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:36,077
Please talk to her for me!

769
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:38,705
You should talk to your mom.
This is not about me.

770
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:40,623
She won't even see me.

771
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:43,126
You don't even spend
your money here in the country.

772
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:45,837
So please talk to her
and tell her help me out!

773
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,881
-Take this!
-Okay.

774
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:50,925
I checked your ledger.
You made a bunch of money last month.

775
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,510
We're barely making a profit.

776
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:55,597
You gave him the restaurant!
What about your other sons?

777
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,892
-You should give us money then.
-Our parents are still alive, you know!

778
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:01,102
Shut your mouth, Sang-do.

779
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:02,854
We're making bunch of money?

780
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:05,815
It took us eight years
to pay back the money you took.

781
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:08,610
And it took four years
to pay back what our brother took.

782
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:12,405
Mom and Dad worked like dogs
for 12 years just to pay off your debts.

783
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,866
I told you to shut up, you bastard.

784
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:19,037
-Don't you have any shame?
-You little bastard.

785
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,246
You come with me.

786
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:26,211
-All right.
-Let go! Let go of me!

787
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:30,089
I was too soft on you
since you were the youngest.

788
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,007
You punk!

789
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,345
Hey! Get out!

790
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:37,472
You brat!

791
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:40,016
Will you give me the money or not?

792
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:41,851
-Yes or no?
-No!

793
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:43,770
Come on!

794
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:44,938
I'm sorry.

795
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:47,023
I'm sorry, everyone.

796
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:49,776
-What was that about?
-Goodness.

797
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,461
Are you okay?

798
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:11,756
No.

799
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:15,009
Right. Of course not.

800
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:19,430
Yeong-do really knows
how to throw a punch, doesn't he?

801
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:21,849
That's not why.

802
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,894
It's because I'm embarrassed.

803
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:29,357
You don't have to be embarrassed
about this in front of me.

804
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:33,820
Having a ton of money

805
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:37,365
can't always be such a good thing.

806
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:45,623
Why do I always end up
looking pathetic in front of you?

807
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:23,661
Hey. Starting today,
I need you to drink my milk for me.

808
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:26,706
Why?

809
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,708
I only like chocolate milk.

810
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:32,795
What do you mean? You're perfectly fine.

811
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:35,715
I was always so proud of you.

812
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:38,426
I also heard it was you
who helped your restaurant grow.

813
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:41,304
You used to be so poor,
and I always took care of you.

814
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:44,766
But you drive a supercar now.
You're successful. I'm so proud of you.

815
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:46,476
So what's the problem?

816
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,561
That's exactly what the problem is.

817
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:55,109
I don't want you to be proud of me.

818
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:00,657
I don't want you to comfort me.

819
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:05,620
I want to comfort you instead.

820
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:53,751
It feels like I got trampled
by an elephant.

821
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:59,841
That damn Jeju Olle Trail.

822
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:15,898
This is killing me.

823
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:17,024
Everything hurts.

824
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:14,207
Goodness, ma'am.

825
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:17,293
Your legs must be bothering you a lot.

826
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:21,297
I'm worried you'll be crawling
on all fours the next time I see you.

827
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:23,883
You knew about that Olle Trail Program,
didn't you?

828
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:26,135
Where are you going?

829
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:29,222
-To buy medicine for my sore muscles.
-Here, I already bought some.

830
01:03:34,101 --> 01:03:35,311
Don't laugh!

831
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:37,772
Let's go.

832
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:40,858
Take this too.

833
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:54,372
Right.

834
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,250
I wanted to give this to you.

835
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:58,751
-Here.
-What?

836
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:01,629
What's this?

837
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:02,880
Check it out.

838
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:07,969
The KMA is hosting
a Jeju photo exhibition.

839
01:04:08,052 --> 01:04:09,220
You should enter.

840
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:15,142
You told me to find Cho Sam-dal.

841
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:18,729
I put my camera away
when I got rid of Cho Eun-hye.

842
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,731
Then, enter as Cho Sam-dal.

843
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:22,817
Did you forget?

844
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:25,444
Sam-dal loved taking photos too.

845
01:04:28,155 --> 01:04:31,409
I left Jeju 18 years ago.
I don't know it that well anymore.

846
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:34,871
You don't have to. The person in charge
will guide you through it all.

847
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:39,750
Forget it.

848
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:43,296
I put my camera deep inside the closet,
so it's a hassle to take out.

849
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:45,756
How deep inside could it be?

850
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:48,551
That hurts.

851
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:51,304
Are you all right?

852
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:53,180
Does it hurt a lot?

853
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,685
It's pretty steep. Want me to help?

854
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:00,187
Forget it. It's not like I'm hurt.

855
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:01,105
I'll hold you up.

856
01:05:01,188 --> 01:05:03,065
I said I was fine.

857
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:04,609
-I'm fine--
-I'll help you.

858
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:06,944
What? You were on the mainland too?

859
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:08,738
The three of you?

860
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:10,615
Yeah.

861
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:12,241
What? Yong-pil never mentioned you.

862
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:14,952
Why did you three go and not invite us?

863
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:18,873
Right? There wouldn't be any rumors
if people knew you went too.

864
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:20,207
What rumors?

865
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:22,710
What else? Rumors of Sam-dal
and Yong-pil dating again.

866
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:25,671
Hey, why didn't Yong-pil mention him?

867
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:27,965
Does it hurt that bad? Does it?

868
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:29,300
You find this funny?

869
01:05:29,383 --> 01:05:31,928
Of course not. You're in so much pain.

870
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:33,179
My friend's hurt.

871
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,766
I think I feel slightly better
after taking the medicine.

872
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:37,934
We're almost home.

873
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:52,281
No, Mr. Cho.

874
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:55,284
No, I don't want to. I can't do that.

875
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:56,494
Sam-dal.

876
01:05:57,578 --> 01:05:58,579
I can't…

877
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:01,832
I can't do it either.

878
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:06,045
How could I possibly bear
to see you, Sam-dal?

879
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:12,093
How could I bear to see you
with this grudge I have in my heart?

880
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:16,222
I can't live without Yong-pil.

881
01:06:17,181 --> 01:06:20,059
I can't live without him.

882
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:22,645
I can't live without Yong-pil. Please--

883
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:25,648
I can't live without my son either.

884
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:29,110
Mr. Cho, please!

885
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:31,404
I can't live without him, Mr. Cho.

886
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:34,824
I can't live without Yong-pil!

887
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:29,378
I don't need you anymore.

888
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:30,671
So let's break up.

889
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:35,217
Wait, hold on.
What is this? You're joking, right?

890
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:37,011
Why are we suddenly breaking up?

891
01:07:37,094 --> 01:07:38,471
-Let's break up.
-Hey.

892
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:42,558
Cho Sam-dal!

893
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:47,730
Are you two

894
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,066
back together?

895
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:03,454
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

896
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:13,798
8 YEARS AGO

897
01:08:44,703 --> 01:08:46,038
"Let me pour you a drink."

898
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:48,916
The iron plate was so hot
he fell straight backwards!

899
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:23,742
For me,

900
01:09:24,785 --> 01:09:26,453
it was harder letting you go

901
01:09:27,788 --> 01:09:29,540
than holding onto you

902
01:09:30,374 --> 01:09:31,417
causing you pain.

903
01:10:05,784 --> 01:10:07,286
By the way, Dad…

904
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:08,412
Do you still

905
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:09,788
resent her?

906
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:11,415
Sam-dal ran into

907
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:13,918
Yong-pil's dad earlier.

908
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:14,960
What's wrong with you?

909
01:10:15,085 --> 01:10:18,088
I kept feeling happy,
so it made me want to see you again.

910
01:10:18,172 --> 01:10:20,799
-Did you see it?
-You did your homework, kid.

911
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:22,259
Hello.

912
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:23,719
What's wrong?

913
01:10:23,802 --> 01:10:24,678
Are you in pain?

914
01:10:24,803 --> 01:10:27,681
Goodness, your buoy
is all covered in flowers again.

915
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:29,308
Where did Ms. Ko go?

916
01:10:29,433 --> 01:10:30,684
Request for the coast guard!

917
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:32,061
-Ms. Ko!
-A Samdal-ri haenyeo

918
01:10:32,144 --> 01:10:33,479
went missing while diving.

919
01:10:33,604 --> 01:10:35,147
Yong-pil, are you talking about

920
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:36,440
my mom?

921
01:10:39,777 --> 01:10:42,738
