1
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:40,999
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

2
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,054
Let's hurry.

3
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,014
All right.

4
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,516
-Where? Here?
-Yeah.

5
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:07,567
-Let's go.
-Hurry up. Let's go.

6
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,069
Let's go.

7
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,405
-Go boil some water.
-Okay.

8
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:36,346
CHO YONG-PIL AND CHO SAM-DAL
ARE BORN IN 1986

9
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,347
So beautiful.

10
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,057
So it's not a son?

11
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,934
Why is it a girl?

12
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,018
Exactly.

13
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,853
I thought they were having a girl,

14
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,397
but they had a boy.

15
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,651
You said they'd give birth to a general
and they'd have a princess.

16
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,069
It's the total opposite.

17
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,445
Have you lost all your powers?

18
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,863
Come on.

19
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,449
When did I say this one would be a boy?

20
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,451
I said it'd be a general.

21
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:02,539
Who says generals always have to be men?
There are female generals too.

22
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:08,044
And I swear this one
had felt like a girl to me.

23
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,004
But it's a boy.

24
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,507
-He's a rebel already.
-I know.

25
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,510
So we have a female general
and a rebellious boy.

26
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:17,345
You're right.

27
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,642
You two are always joined at the hip.

28
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,812
-Is that why you gave birth together?
-Goodness.

29
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,647
It's as if they're twins.

30
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,108
How could you two
give birth to at the same time?

31
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:33,736
I know. It's not something you can plan.

32
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,113
It's so fascinating.

33
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,868
What are the names of this female general
and the rebellious boy?

34
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,412
He's Yong-pil. Cho Yong-pil.

35
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,123
She's Sam-dal. Cho Sam-dal.

36
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,457
Goodness.

37
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:51,921
You two must be destined to be soulmates.

38
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,592
You're right. They're soulmates.

39
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,677
Oh, my.

40
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:06,811
EPISODE 2
THE SOULMATES' HISTORY

41
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,440
Wow, seriously. You're such a loser.

42
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,691
You're not good enough yet.

43
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,693
That's what you two are to me. Dung.

44
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,613
During her time
as photographer Cho's assistant,

45
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:20,158
Bang claims to have regularly suffered
abuse of power and verbal abuse.

46
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,827
She tried to take her own life
but was rescued.

47
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,454
She's now recovering at a hospital.

48
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,333
-Hey, there's Cho Eun-hye!
-There she is!

49
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,336
Do you admit
that you've been abusing Bang?

50
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,504
No, I never did that.

51
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,839
Why did you do it?

52
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,967
You're mistaken. I never did such a thing.

53
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,761
Why did you come to the hospital?

54
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:41,804
Do you admit to it?

55
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,766
Ms. Cho!

56
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,851
-Ms. Cho!
-Did you apologize?

57
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,145
-Don't you feel guilty?
-Ms. Cho!

58
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,356
-Ms. Cho!
-Please say something!

59
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,649
Ms. Cho!

60
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,360
Eun-ju, this isn't right.

61
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,737
You can't do this, Eun-ju!

62
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,198
Let's talk about this. Okay?

63
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:03,368
Eun-ju. Bang--

64
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:06,496
-Did you apologize to her?
-Do you admit to abusing her?

65
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,248
Please give us a comment.

66
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:18,091
Bang is in stable condition,
but the hospital claims she…

67
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:21,010
Where did you say that hospital is?

68
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,888
You said you fought
because she seduced your boyfriend.

69
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,182
So why did she play
the recording like that?

70
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,143
This is just unbelievable.

71
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,942
Sam-dal, lead the way.
Take us to the hospital.

72
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,528
Get up!

73
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,696
Come on.

74
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,033
What are you going to do
once you get there?

75
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,869
Damn it!

76
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,831
What's the matter with you?
Stop overreacting.

77
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,548
Goodness, why are you overreacting?

78
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,924
Overreacting?

79
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,552
Do you think I can stay calm
in this situation?

80
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:06,431
Cho Jin-dal, the older sister
of the photographer,

81
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:11,019
got divorced in 2019 from Jeon Dae-yeong,
the CEO of AS Group.

82
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:15,315
She is the ex-daughter-in-law who exposed
the wealthy family's abuse of power.

83
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,401
-Her sister abuses power and she…
-You don't mess with family.

84
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,111
How dare they expose my identity?

85
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,113
And why did they reveal just my name?

86
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,781
Sam-dal, lead the way.

87
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,410
The best thing to do right now
is do nothing, okay?

88
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,330
Sam-dal, get it together.
You can't sit around like this.

89
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,706
Let's go, okay? Get up.

90
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,168
Online sleuths say
their younger sister's an unmarried mom.

91
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,796
-She's 29 and has a 9-year-old daughter.
-What? The entire family's a mess.

92
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,548
I worry about that kid's future.

93
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:41,716
I'm not an unmarried mom!

94
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,802
And how dare they talk about my daughter?!

95
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,681
-Where's the hospital? Show us.
-You said not to overreact.

96
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,391
How can I not overreact?

97
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,394
Just be quiet. Let me think.

98
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:56,981
Darn it.

99
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,699
Ms. Cho, I think the reporters discovered
your address. They're on their way.

100
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,493
-Oh, no!
-What is it?

101
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,244
They're coming here.

102
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,121
-The reporters.
-What?

103
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,464
Ms. Cho!

104
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:23,925
What?

105
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,428
Did our home address get leaked too?

106
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,640
Why can't this country
respect people's privacy?

107
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,266
What do we do?

108
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,311
What should we do?
This is going to drag on for some time.

109
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,522
I don't know. I'm just going run away.

110
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,856
Hey!

111
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,400
They know exactly who I am.
I'm coming with you.

112
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,403
What? Are you leaving
Ha-yul and me behind? Are you insane?

113
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,322
-You have a part-time job.
-Who cares?

114
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:49,075
Fine, then! Then, let's all leave. Okay?

115
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,160
-Pack all your bags.
-Okay, let's go.

116
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,620
-Let's go.
-Cha Ha-yul!

117
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:53,746
Get up… Hold on.

118
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,998
What is it?

119
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,544
Do we have anywhere to go though?

120
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,798
Well…

121
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,989
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR NEW JOB

122
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,117
Do I have no choice but to turn away?

123
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,370
As I cherish the memories

124
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,205
I stay…

125
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,961
You're Mona Lisa

126
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,715
…too regretful

127
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:52,054
Can you truly not accept my love?

128
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,278
Aren't you busy?

129
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,238
Can't you see? I'm busy to death.

130
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,324
I need to go to work. Help me with this.

131
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,576
That's exactly my point.

132
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:17,330
Why do you sing at every festival
in the neighborhood when you're so busy?

133
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:20,416
-You're a civil servant.
-You're so behind on the times.

134
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,585
This is called my alter ego.

135
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,128
Alter ego.

136
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,423
I'm the pride of Jeju, Cho Yong-pil.
That's my alter ego.

137
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,549
-Alter ego?
-Yes.

138
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,887
I get it. So who's getting married
at the altar?

139
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,143
Forget it. Why do I even bother?

140
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,103
-Darn it.
-Forget it.

141
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,563
What are you talking about?

142
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,527
-Hey.
-What?

143
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,404
By the way,
why did you go to the mainland?

144
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,572
Why would I do that?

145
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,699
Someone saw you at the airport.

146
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,118
Why did you go? Did you go to Seoul?

147
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,956
I have no reason to go to Seoul.

148
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:03,459
I just went to the airport
to meet someone.

149
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,503
Move.

150
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,380
-You just went to the airport?
-Yeah.

151
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,422
Man…

152
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,343
Why do you sound so disappointed?

153
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:16,389
You sound like I should've gone
to the mainland.

154
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,808
No, not at all. What I meant was…

155
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,352
I thought maybe you had met someone.

156
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:24,855
Who could I possibly meet in Seoul?

157
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,108
Yong-pil!

158
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,192
Yes?

159
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,737
I can't sing another song.
I need to go to work.

160
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,322
-That's not it.
-Then?

161
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,365
How's tomorrow?

162
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,784
Are you hosting
another festival here tomorrow?

163
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:39,370
No. I mean, is it going to rain tomorrow?

164
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:42,123
-I need to spray pesticides.
-Rain? Let me see.

165
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,544
Right.

166
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,755
It's not going to rain.

167
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,299
-What?
-You can spray them.

168
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,633
-Really?
-Yes.

169
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,093
-All right.
-I'm off.

170
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:57,013
-Bye.
-Everyone! I'll get going now!

171
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:58,848
-Bye!
-See you!

172
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,016
Come again!

173
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,401
Hey, Eun-u.

174
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,194
What?

175
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,240
Call Sam-dal if you're worried about her.

176
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,118
Don't worry about me.

177
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,751
It's not that I'm worried about you.

178
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,380
I don't have her number.

179
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,480
Sorry.

180
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,319
No way. What is this?

181
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:56,906
Jeez.

182
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,747
Hey!

183
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,291
Hey, stop!

184
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,169
Where's he going?

185
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,089
Yong-pil, have you seen this?

186
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,175
-Roll down your window. Did you see this?
-Jeez.

187
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:19,220
You have. The reporters picked
all the ugliest photos.

188
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,262
This seems bad.

189
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,848
Roll down your window.
Hurry up and roll it down.

190
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,059
Roll-- Are you getting out? Get out.

191
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,144
What is it this time? What do you want?

192
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,105
-Didn't you see it?
-See what?

193
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,314
About Cho Sam-dal.

194
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,403
They're saying she abused her power
over a mentee. There's a recording too.

195
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,863
Did she really do this?
You know something, right?

196
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:40,950
Gyeong-tae…

197
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,910
Did she really do this? Do you know?

198
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,748
You think I'd know something
you wouldn't know? Unbelievable.

199
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:48,833
Just close it.

200
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,043
You know what?

201
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,879
You have no ethics.

202
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,047
Me?

203
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,090
No manners, either.

204
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,842
-Me?
-And you're tactless.

205
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,010
Just…

206
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,392
Hey, you were her friend
before you were her ex.

207
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,477
-Aren't you worried?
-Go man the gate!

208
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,396
What if someone comes?

209
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,898
I left it open, you fool!
I'm keeping an eye on it!

210
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,984
Who's he to tell me how to do my job?

211
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,154
What in the world is happening?

212
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,240
Should I call and ask her?

213
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:45,681
DOWNFALL OF PHOTOGRAPHER CHO EUN-HYE
SUSPECTED OF ABUSE OF POWER

214
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:06,035
KOREA METEOROLOGICAL ADMINISTRATION
PERSONNEL APPOINTMENT PROPOSAL

215
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,041
Are you a rebel?

216
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:16,295
When I told you to go, you said to throw
that away. Now, you change your mind?

217
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,173
What are you talking about?

218
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,383
I…

219
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,802
Keep this up, and I really will go.

220
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,221
-Please.
-Okay?

221
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,183
When do I need to go?

222
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,186
If I want, can I move to Seoul right away?

223
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,980
Seriously? Did you have a change of heart?

224
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:36,607
Hey!

225
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,194
Just say the word,
and you can go there first thing tomorrow.

226
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:44,240
You were so adamant about staying here.
What made you change your mind?

227
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,950
I didn't say I was going.

228
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,745
It was just a question.

229
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,833
It was hypothetical.

230
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,461
Does he want to go or not?

231
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:02,132
Wasn't there someone in Seoul
he wants to avoid?

232
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,381
This is so refreshing!

233
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:45,050
I bet it is!

234
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,136
It's so nice to be back home.

235
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,345
-This is nice.
-Right?

236
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,014
-There's no place like home.
-Sit up.

237
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,098
Yes, ma'am.

238
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,522
You've been too busy to visit
even during the holidays.

239
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,650
So why are you here out of the blue?

240
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,156
Grandma, you see…

241
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,997
They said they're just here to rest.

242
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,333
Ha-yul's on school vacation too.

243
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,584
-Yes!
-Yes!

244
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,169
Ha-yul is on her break.

245
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,046
Yes. He's right, Mom.

246
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,214
Ha-yul missed her grandparents.

247
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,342
-So we all decided to visit.
-Right.

248
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,928
Mom, come on now.

249
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,764
What kind of mom asks
why her children are visiting her?

250
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,974
I know. She's unbelievable.

251
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:34,892
Goodness.

252
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,269
Exactly. They're here to rest.

253
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:45,611
But I don't know what to make of
all this luggage you've brought.

254
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,534
I guess you all happened to be free.

255
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,244
-Yes!
-That's right!

256
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,288
-Right!
-Our schedules lined up!

257
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,539
-Right!
-Right!

258
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,667
When I saw your luggage, I had a…

259
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,293
What do you call it?

260
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,045
It's a…

261
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,382
-When you've seen it in your dreams.
-Rendezvous?

262
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,304
-It's déjà vu, Grandma.
-Right.

263
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,224
That's what it feels like.

264
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,521
It feels ominous for some reason.

265
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,027
Mom…

266
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,699
I'm pregnant!

267
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,083
Mom, Dad.

268
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,377
I got a divorce.

269
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:54,388
Those suitcases brought back…

270
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,265
What's the word for it?

271
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,307
Trauma, Grandma.

272
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,809
Yes. Trauma.

273
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:08,902
Did you beat someone up again?

274
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,822
Mom, please!

275
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,282
Are you pregnant again?

276
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,367
Come on, Mom.

277
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,661
You…

278
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,913
Did your career fail?

279
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,292
What…

280
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,377
Mom, what are you talking about?

281
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,546
Come on, Mom.

282
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:28,922
Which one is it?

283
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,051
Whose fault is it you're here this time?

284
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,927
Come on, tell me! Who is it?

285
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,320
What?

286
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,364
Dad, what's wrong with you? Keep it down!

287
00:17:56,408 --> 00:18:00,913
She disciplined her mentee?
What did she do exactly? Did she hit her?

288
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,334
Of course not.
Instead of discipline, they say…

289
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,379
she abused her power.

290
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,258
But it's not true. They just argued.

291
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,302
She should deny it and claim innocence.

292
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:19,014
She did. She published her side
of the story and said she was innocent.

293
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,516
-And?
-It didn't work.

294
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,894
Only one article covered it,
but it was ignored.

295
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:25,604
How come?

296
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,023
The public doesn't care about that.

297
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,609
They prefer bad-mouthing
a successful photographer

298
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:31,902
who abused her power.

299
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:35,114
They just want to believe it's true.

300
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,742
How come? I just don't get it.

301
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,161
Sam-dal is innocent, so why criticize her?

302
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,872
They should get to the bottom of this.

303
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,916
Are mainland people always this rash?

304
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,334
That's not it.

305
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:51,547
People in the industry
are avoiding her just to avoid trouble.

306
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,970
She went through so much
to become a photographer.

307
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,183
Don't let your mom find out about this.

308
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,101
Of course.

309
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,520
She'll be carried off again
if she finds out.

310
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,606
"Carried off again"? What do you mean?

311
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,071
What I mean is, she'll be shocked.

312
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,765
What are you doing?

313
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,767
You startled me.

314
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,230
What were you
chatting about with the girls?

315
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,232
I was just…

316
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,610
I just thought I could help them unpack.

317
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,986
What did they tell you?

318
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,573
Who's to blame for them coming here?

319
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,533
I don't know either.

320
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,913
Let them be.
It must be tough to live on the mainland.

321
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,209
What was that?

322
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:56,880
What?

323
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,257
Is that trash?

324
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:04,012
Darn it. What kind of scumbag
would litter in the street?

325
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,643
I'll just throw it away myself.

326
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,944
Hey!

327
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,488
Finish it before you throw it.
Don't waste beer.

328
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,282
Jeez.

329
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,327
See? There was a lot left in there.

330
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,373
So many articles saying I abused my power,

331
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,250
but only one about my explanation?

332
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:37,254
I told you. You should've told them
about how she seduced your boyfriend.

333
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,755
Why didn't you?

334
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,299
No way.

335
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,385
-It hurts my pride.
-Listen.

336
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:47,806
-Your pride isn't important right now.
-Jeez. Why did you tell Dad?

337
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,475
He has to know
so he can protect you from Mom.

338
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,395
If Mom finds out why you're really here…

339
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,108
she'll put on her long johns show again.

340
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,526
Oh, God! No way.

341
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,153
That can never happen. Never.

342
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:08,785
I feel bad for Sam-dal,
but Ms. Ko must be so distraught.

343
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,830
Does this mean she'll put on
her long johns show again?

344
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:16,418
She did it when Jin-dal got divorced
and also when Hae-dal got pregnant.

345
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,338
She ran around only wearing long johns.

346
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,672
You're right.

347
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,258
The Three Terrible Sisters of Samdal-ri

348
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:29,014
are always busy creating trouble,
so Ms. Ko can't get any peace of mind.

349
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:32,100
Hey, Man-su.
It's about time you took a break.

350
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,560
Why are you always working?

351
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:36,855
Working for others isn't easy.
I need to earn my keep.

352
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:39,608
No, it is easy.

353
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:43,779
You should relax while the boss is away
and chat with us. Come sit down.

354
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,782
But you're the boss's son.

355
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,493
I'm the son, not the boss.
And we're practically strangers.

356
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:50,786
Sit down and rest, okay?

357
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,038
Here, have some snacks. Eat up.

358
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,373
Have a drink of this too.

359
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,917
Take it easy.

360
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:02,005
By the way, "The Three Terrible Sisters"?

361
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:03,548
Who are they?

362
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:07,052
You've probably never met them
since you only came here last year.

363
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,386
So you don't know.

364
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:14,142
They're legends in this neighborhood.

365
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:20,232
The Three Terrible Sisters.

366
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,617
The strong one.

367
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,960
The crazy one.

368
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:43,839
The cheeky one.

369
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,052
The strong one is the eldest.

370
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,388
She's stood out ever since she was a baby.

371
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,723
Legend has it she ate with a spoon

372
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,685
when others her age
were still being bottle-fed.

373
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:02,524
No matter the age or gender,
no one was stronger than her.

374
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,277
-She controlled all of Jeju.
-I'm sorry.

375
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,195
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

376
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,989
-Oh, dear.
-It's not them, ma'am.

377
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:17,914
All the punching machines
in not just Samdal-ri but all through Jeju

378
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,541
had the same warning sign.

379
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,334
CHO JIN-DAL IS FORBIDDEN TO PLAY

380
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:32,929
The second daughter.

381
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,806
The crazy one.

382
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,643
Hey, Sam-dal. Sorry.

383
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,271
You're dead meat.

384
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,649
She had a nasty temper.

385
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:49,779
She'd go crazy and torment anyone
who annoyed her until she was content.

386
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,450
THIS BELONGS TO CHO SAM-DAL
ANYONE WHO LOOKS IS DEAD

387
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,081
I told you not to read that.

388
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,168
From now on, I won't keep a diary!

389
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:05,420
-Gosh!
-I'm going to tear it apart!

390
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,256
Why did you read it?

391
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,217
The cheeky one.

392
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,637
Could you go to the store over there
and buy some makgeolli for me?

393
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,096
Get yourself a snack too.

394
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,308
Is this the police?

395
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:24,314
There's a man here who's asking
a kid to buy alcohol for him.

396
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:25,941
Hey, kid!

397
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,067
It's not true.

398
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,193
Gosh, I'm sorry.

399
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,945
-You can go.
-She was just…

400
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,447
-Goodbye, sir.
-It didn't matter if you were an elder.

401
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,032
She lived by her own rules.

402
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,116
What do you think?

403
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:38,620
Shocking, isn't it?

404
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:42,958
This entire neighborhood lived in fear
because of these three sisters.

405
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,586
-Hence the "The Three Terrible Sisters."
-I see.

406
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,673
Where are they now?

407
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:52,509
-What?
-You won't see them around here.

408
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,803
They're living good lives on the mainland.

409
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,639
That's not true.
Jin-dal and Hae-dal had their issues.

410
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,057
And look at Sam-dal now.

411
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,394
But they must still be doing well
if they haven't returned to Jeju.

412
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,771
You and I failed in Seoul and came back.

413
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,233
They're the only ones
who've succeeded out there.

414
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,609
That's true.

415
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:12,445
I guess they're doing okay
if they're still in Seoul.

416
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,200
THE PRIDE OF SAMDAL-RI!
CHO YONG-PIL IS HERE!

417
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,455
What are you looking at?

418
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,000
When are they leaving?

419
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,961
They just got here yesterday.
Don't be so hard on them.

420
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,047
What?

421
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,090
Yong-pil hasn't left for work yet?

422
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,428
What is it?
Are you worried he'll run into her?

423
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:21,639
He lives right across the street.
He's bound to see her.

424
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,684
She's an idiot.

425
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,980
I wonder what loser she dated this time
to make her come home like this.

426
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,443
-What?
-Sam-dal's the reason they're all here.

427
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,820
You know about it?

428
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,407
She broke up with her boyfriend again.

429
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:45,538
How is she still not able
to pick a decent man at that age?

430
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,751
That's a good question.

431
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,712
She must be hurting a lot.

432
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,506
Don't resent her for it.

433
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,593
I would never resent my own daughter.

434
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,887
Plus, she's the most normal one
of the three.

435
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,432
Everyone, get up!

436
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,268
Get up and come eat…

437
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:20,573
You little…

438
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,202
Cho Sam-dal!

439
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:28,581
What? What is it? What's wrong?

440
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,875
-Did you come here to get drunk?
-Mom!

441
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:31,918
-Did you?
-That hurts!

442
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,711
How many cans are there?

443
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:36,756
-Mom!
-You drank all of these by yourself?

444
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,260
Jin-dal and Hae-dal drank with me.
I didn't drink all of them.

445
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:44,097
-She was dreaming.
-We didn't drink.

446
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,474
You did. How dare you?

447
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,476
-Hey, let go!
-I drank all of them?

448
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,895
-I said let go!
-Let go!

449
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,982
You lunatics!

450
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,193
-Mom!
-Mom!

451
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,612
-Mom!
-You're not kids anymore!

452
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,323
-You're all crazy.
-Mom!

453
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,410
-Why is she so strong?
-What's wrong with you?

454
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,828
Mom, listen!

455
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,288
Hear me out.

456
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:09,998
Mom, listen.

457
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,876
All done.

458
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,587
Did a fight break out outside?

459
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,297
It's so noisy.

460
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,257
Maybe it's a dog barking.

461
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,343
All right. Here's your breakfast.

462
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,933
These dishes look awfully familiar.

463
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,229
Did you reuse the stew I made yesterday?

464
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,231
Even the side dishes are the same.

465
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:38,568
How could you suspect
your son of something like that?

466
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:41,404
Look at this.
How does this meal look familiar?

467
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:45,950
You made stir-fried mushrooms yesterday.
But this is…

468
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,495
This is spicy stir-fried mushrooms.

469
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,455
Right? And look here.

470
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,417
There are sesame seeds too.
Yours didn't have any, but mine does.

471
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:58,004
You just added some chili powder
and cooked it again.

472
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,215
You have to stop doing this.

473
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:03,092
Why are you so picky about breakfast?

474
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,386
Don't be a baby. Eat up. It's good.

475
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:07,430
Jeez.

476
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:14,062
When are you off night shift this month?

477
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,021
Why do you ask?

478
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,566
Do you want to spend
some quality father-son time?

479
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,320
The eldest daughter
of the fishing village's chief is 28.

480
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,155
She's an elementary school teacher.

481
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,324
She's a teacher.

482
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:30,119
No. I don't like teachers.
I'm allergic to them.

483
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,122
Ever since I was little, they made me

484
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:36,543
feel tired and sleepy,
and I was afraid they'd throw chalk at me.

485
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,670
So you're not going to get married?

486
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:41,089
Why don't you get married instead?

487
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:46,469
Dad, how about I set you up
with the cleaning lady at my work?

488
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:47,846
She's gorgeous.

489
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,098
How could you say like that to your dad?

490
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,099
Jeez.

491
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,566
Hey, Sang--

492
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,533
That bastard.

493
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,119
What an oddball.

494
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,208
Let's see.

495
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,460
Where was it again?

496
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,055
Hey, Bu Sang-do!

497
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,979
He's the one with no ethics.

498
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:42,400
He may not have any ethics,
but he's got wealth.

499
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,068
He's a nouveau riche.

500
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,820
-Nouveau riche.
-Where were we?

501
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,739
Feet that made them soulmates.

502
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,240
Fate, not feet.

503
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:52,076
It was fate that connected
Yong-pil and Sam-dal together.

504
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,538
They were joined at the hip
for the first 30 years of their lives.

505
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,540
-Am I talking too fast?
-No, it's fine.

506
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,752
So they fell in love.
Grown men and women can't be friends.

507
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,754
I see. Friends became lovers?

508
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,631
That's right. That's what happened.

509
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,967
When Sam-dal went to Seoul
to pursue her career,

510
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,261
Yong-pil followed her,
because he was worried.

511
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,680
That's when they fell for each other.

512
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,850
That crazy couple will go down in history.

513
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,520
From friends to lovers. How amazing.

514
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,440
-Amazing, my foot.
-But why aren't they together now?

515
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:24,984
They broke up.

516
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,529
She said she was going to
study abroad and dumped him.

517
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,448
Back then, Yong-pil was…

518
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:34,744
He was like a zombie back then.

519
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:37,455
-A what?
-A zombie. He was like a zombie.

520
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,624
A zombie.

521
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,878
He was probably heartbroken, right?

522
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,130
"Was"?

523
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:49,175
"Was"? Do you think it's all in the past?

524
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:52,762
Since then, he hasn't dated
a single woman in the past eight years.

525
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,389
With that handsome face. What a fool.

526
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,099
What? Eight years?

527
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,810
Is he still in love with her then?

528
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,853
How on earth would I know how he feels?

529
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,772
-Why are you getting mad at me?
-Sorry.

530
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:07,485
Man, I feel so bad for Yong-pil.

531
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,779
I feel bad for myself more.
This is taking forever.

532
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:12,657
You should've sent them out on time.

533
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,876
A supercar in the countryside?

534
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:25,837
Hurry up.

535
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,174
Darn it!

536
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,969
Jeez! This is exactly
why I hate coming home.

537
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:34,637
We're not meant for hard labor.

538
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,264
We have to work every time we visit.

539
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,849
It's so hot, Mom!

540
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,019
Shut your mouth.

541
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:48,860
Ms. Ko, you should be fair
and make all of us work.

542
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:51,738
Why would you exclude Sam-dal?

543
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,239
That hurts!

544
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,783
Mom. Wait, I…

545
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:56,701
Ms. Ko.

546
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,036
-You see, we--
-Sam-dal.

547
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,203
Yes?

548
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,205
You should just stay home.

549
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:04,792
The neighbors will think
you came back because you failed.

550
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:06,544
Yes!

551
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,046
-Mom, that's not fair!
-Mom!

552
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,714
-Ha-yul needs me.
-Are you kidding--

553
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,340
-Mom, I--
-Mom!

554
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,217
-She--
-Hold on. Come here.

555
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:16,387
It's obvious. Mom doesn't want her
to run into Yong-pil.

556
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,641
Right. She shouldn't.

557
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,352
By the way,

558
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,772
why in the world did he dump her?

559
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:26,856
He was madly in love.

560
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:28,816
Who knows? Maybe he fell out of love.

561
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,820
Sam-dal had it rough.

562
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,740
Thank goodness she went abroad to study.

563
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:36,866
If she stayed here,

564
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,328
she would've become a lost cause.

565
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:45,917
But she could only move on
since she was dumped so heartlessly.

566
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,211
That's true.

567
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:52,048
It's easier to get over someone
who dumped you than someone you dumped.

568
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,091
-Right.
-Right.

569
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,019
CHO'S ACADEMIC HISTORY IN CONTROVERSY

570
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,941
They're so good at making stuff up.

571
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,694
Her abuse of power
is a disgrace. Just die.

572
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:14,946
She should kill herself.

573
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:17,532
This scumbag's exhibition?
I'm glad it failed.

574
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,534
Cho Eun-hye, why are you even alive?

575
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,375
This is so frustrating.

576
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:34,966
Is this true?

577
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,009
Damn it.

578
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:41,931
CHEON CHUNG-GI

579
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,146
Damn it, this is so annoying!

580
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,317
Hot! That's hot!

581
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:55,945
Damn it!

582
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,156
Damn it.

583
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,454
For crying out loud…

584
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,065
What's wrong with this?

585
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,571
Is it out of batteries?

586
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,907
Let's see.

587
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,033
Here it is.

588
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:46,954
I finally found it.

589
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,298
Where did she go?

590
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,382
What?

591
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:01,761
She should be home
since she's not diving today.

592
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,263
Let's see.

593
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,101
TITLE DEED

594
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:13,773
Darn it.

595
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:19,320
Come on. They should be
around here somewhere.

596
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,450
Where are you, batteries?

597
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,618
Darn it.

598
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,412
Where are you?

599
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,249
Mom!

600
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,093
Mom, is your buoy inside?

601
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:44,053
Where did you put it?

602
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,346
Cho Yong-pil?

603
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,556
What's he doing here?

604
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,474
Damn it.

605
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:49,558
Mom!

606
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,435
I'm coming in.

607
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,106
Why is he coming into my house?

608
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,900
-Mom!
-What do I do?

609
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:58,859
Ms. Ko!

610
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,410
So you were home after all.

611
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,203
Mom.

612
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,581
Or is it Mr. Cho? Mr. Cho?

613
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:14,959
Mr. Cho.

614
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:16,877
Mom.

615
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,170
Your buoy…

616
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,050
What's this?

617
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,358
What is this?

618
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:42,945
What the…

619
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:53,372
Come on. Why is it stuck?

620
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,793
What… What's going on?

621
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:00,254
I know someone's in there.

622
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,964
Who is it? Tell me.

623
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,675
-I'm going to lose my mind.
-Stop playing around! Open up!

624
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,428
Come on. Stop joking and open up.

625
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,680
I'm here because of the buoy…

626
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,609
What is it?

627
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,736
What?!

628
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:25,071
Got it.

629
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,702
Where are you going, Gyeong-tae?

630
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,747
I'll take that.

631
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,915
Watch the store.

632
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,753
-Hurry up!
-Coming!

633
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:41,837
Darn it.

634
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,514
I told them to close the front gate.

635
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,350
This is driving me insane.

636
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,605
But why am I hiding?
I haven't done anything wrong.

637
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,650
That's right. I'll just go out.

638
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:08,030
They'll run into each other at least once.

639
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,156
What should we do?

640
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,159
What can we do?
It's inevitable since we live so close.

641
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:16,080
I just hope she at least looks pretty
when they do.

642
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:17,957
She can't look like a slob.

643
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,751
It's not like she still has
feelings for him.

644
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:21,836
It shouldn't matter.

645
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:22,962
Hey.

646
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:26,090
He dumped her.
He should be made to regret it.

647
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,053
What in the world?

648
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,685
I look terrible.

649
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:46,152
You dirty little thief.

650
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:48,696
You're dead meat, you scumbag.

651
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,030
You bastard.

652
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,615
Damn it. You scumbag.

653
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,492
Open up.

654
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,786
-How did he get the key?
-Why isn't this opening?

655
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,539
How dare you rob Ms. Ko's house?

656
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,170
I got you now, you bastard.

657
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:08,716
Jeez, you're strong.

658
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:11,802
Come on!

659
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,139
Open up.

660
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,685
Just go already, you lunatic!

661
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:29,695
Who are you?

662
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:30,988
I said, who are…

663
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,173
Let's break up.

664
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,593
I don't like you anymore.

665
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:54,762
I don't need you anymore.

666
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:56,305
So let's break up.

667
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,767
Why are we suddenly breaking up?

668
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,690
Cho Sam-dal!

669
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:19,495
Let's just break up.

670
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:21,747
I don't need you anymore.

671
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,751
Yong-pil, can you please come out? Please?

672
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,760
I can't do this, Yong-pil.

673
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,014
Don't let me go, Yong-pil.

674
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,871
Long time no see.

675
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,211
But why are you here?

676
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,672
This is my house.

677
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:13,882
Right.

678
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:20,097
-Come out, you bastard!
-Be quiet! The thief will run away!

679
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,850
Are there more people here?
Did you tell them to come?

680
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,769
Yeah. It's Eun-u and Gyeong-tae.

681
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,982
Why would they come here?

682
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:30,899
This is…

683
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,403
This is mortifying.

684
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,488
I don't want to see anyone right now.

685
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,158
Look at me. I look horrible.

686
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:40,993
This is so embarrassing.

687
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:47,124
Why is this happening to me?

688
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,861
Just stay like that for now.

689
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,656
I'll take care of them.

690
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,622
-Where are you? Come out!
-Show yourself!

691
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:27,998
-Gosh.
-Where is he?

692
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,459
-He's not here.
-What do you mean?

693
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:32,628
-He's gone. Just go.
-Did he threaten you?

694
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:34,129
-I'll take care of this.
-Get out.

695
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:37,466
-He's gone, so just leave!
-What… I know you're not strong enough.

696
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:39,176
-Stop lying.
-Just go.

697
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:40,177
-You tie him up?
-Go.

698
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,512
What's going on?

699
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,892
-Just go.
-We're leaving.

700
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,894
-We'll just talk to him.
-Hey.

701
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:50,562
-I saw something.
-No one's home.

702
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:53,065
-You went soft, didn't you?
-Just leave already.

703
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:55,192
-Just go.
-Let me just see him.

704
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,443
What's with you?

705
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,779
-I'm good at this.
-I saw something back there.

706
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,155
-He's gone.
-You three.

707
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,199
How's life going for you?

708
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:03,700
-Hello.
-Mom, he's acting weird.

709
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,160
Take a look at him.

710
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,703
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hi.

711
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:09,790
Look at Gyeong-tae.
He's here and not working.

712
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,291
-Come on.
-You called him over.

713
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:17,464
-Where are you headed?
-To Ms. Ko's.

714
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,966
-I made some food.
-Hold on.

715
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:20,884
-What?
-You can't.

716
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,219
-I mean…
-What?

717
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:25,597
You see, Ms. Ko isn't home.

718
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:26,640
No one's home.

719
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:27,599
Really?

720
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,686
Is she at the tangerine grove?

721
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:32,855
-I'll leave it inside.
-Wait!

722
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:34,148
What?

723
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,233
Come to think of it,

724
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:39,194
her house faces south.

725
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:42,489
The food will go bad quickly.
It'd be a waste.

726
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,032
Come by again in the evening.

727
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,201
You're right.

728
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:49,788
Her house is always warm
around this time of the day

729
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,415
-even during the winter.
-Right.

730
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:55,085
Right. I guess I'll have to
stop by again in the evening.

731
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,128
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

732
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:58,464
-Goodbye, ma'am.
-The store isn't unattended.

733
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:01,216
-Man-su's there.
-Yong-pil! Eun-u!

734
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,634
Bye.

735
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,636
-Goodbye, ma'am.
-Mom.

736
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:07,890
-You're acting very weird.
-What?

737
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:11,560
You said there was a thief, so we came,
and now you say he's gone.

738
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:14,313
I came here in the middle
of work. What is going on?

739
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:15,814
I was busy babysitting too.

740
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:17,941
There's no one.

741
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:18,859
What?

742
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,694
I thought there was a thief,

743
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,197
but there wasn't.

744
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,531
What do you mean? Stop playing.

745
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,241
-Let's just check.
-Sounds good.

746
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,535
-Wait! There is no thief.
-You said--

747
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,329
Why won't you believe me?

748
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:33,332
You were babysitting?
And you were cleaning the store?

749
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:34,833
Go back to what you were doing.

750
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,001
-But still--
-Just go.

751
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:37,669
-Jeez.
-Bye.

752
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,546
-But we--
-Gosh, just go.

753
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,964
-Go.
-What a lunatic.

754
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:43,133
-He's a nutjob.
-He told us to come.

755
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,552
-Take care.
-He made it sound urgent.

756
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,346
-Just go. I'll call you later.
-Jeez.

757
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,139
Bye.

758
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:36,478
You…

759
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,316
You don't look horrible.

760
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:43,277
So don't worry.

761
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:21,398
Yong-pil, you're seriously the worst…

762
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:23,567
Why would you…

763
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,696
Why would you do that?

764
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,283
I'm such a loser.

765
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:56,308
Hello.

766
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:59,436
The photographer's from Jeju.
The power-tripping killer.

767
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:01,396
-I heard it wasn't true.
-Please tap again.

768
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,691
Of course, it is. Do you expect her
to just admit to the charges?

769
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,026
It's obvious.

770
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,611
That evil bitch.

771
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:09,738
-Hey.
-Yes?

772
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:11,573
Don't you see this?

773
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:12,824
You didn't pay.

774
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,993
Why are you running away without paying?

775
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:16,745
I didn't know.

776
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:20,165
-And I wasn't running away.
-Of course, you were.

777
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:21,917
People who don't pay

778
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,378
obviously wouldn't admit
to dodging the fare.

779
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,505
What's your problem?

780
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:33,220
She said it wasn't true.
Why won't he believe her?

781
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,138
And she never killed anyone.

782
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,973
He needs to watch his…

783
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:45,857
-Damn it!
-My gosh!

784
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:47,901
You startled me! My back!

785
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:49,069
You really startled me.

786
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,737
You look like a ghost.

787
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:54,282
I was just going to drink water. Come on.

788
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:57,369
Hey, where are you going?

789
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:58,578
Hey, Sam…

790
00:49:58,662 --> 00:49:59,871
Cho Sam-dal.

791
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,748
I was so startled. Hold on.

792
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:40,662
FAMOUS SANGDO'S

793
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,177
-Sang-do!
-Yes?

794
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:59,055
It's so hard to meet up with Sang-do.

795
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:00,807
He's busy with his restaurant.

796
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:04,311
At least he lets us know he's alive
by revving loudly each day.

797
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,104
He's just an attention seeker.

798
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:09,065
Who'd be impressed
by his supercar in this countryside?

799
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:11,067
It's so obvious he's a nouveau riche.

800
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:13,195
I mean, even Yong-pil is a lunatic.

801
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:15,280
Why don't we have any normal friends?

802
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:17,824
Of course, we do. We have Sam-dal.

803
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,243
She's the only normal one
among the five of us.

804
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:23,580
Right. Why are you getting mad at me?

805
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,208
Did you give her a call?

806
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:27,793
No.

807
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:32,005
You know what?
I just couldn't bring myself to do it.

808
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:33,632
She's always been so proud.

809
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:37,093
I don't want to hurt her feelings
by reaching out to her.

810
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,929
I really can't do it.

811
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,808
You don't even have her number.

812
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:48,063
That's true.

813
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:49,022
I don't.

814
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:50,232
Moron.

815
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:55,278
Let's go. No one's here.

816
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,863
Let's just walk up to there.

817
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,115
You go. I'll shine the light.

818
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,451
-Come on!
-I'll shine the light. You go.

819
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:18,635
The smell of the ocean…

820
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,181
I hate it.

821
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:41,199
That's enough, all right?

822
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:51,293
Ms. Cho, is this news article true?

823
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:52,836
Why did you do that?

824
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:56,590
I feel bad for you. Kids these days
are scary. You should've been careful.

825
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:59,050
Is it true?
Did you really abuse your power?

826
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,637
I pity you, Eun-hye.

827
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,224
No one asked how you're doing.

828
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:14,608
I can't believe she attempted suicide.

829
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:20,405
Wow, seriously. You're such a loser.

830
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:22,365
Don't blame me for your low self-esteem.

831
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:25,535
It's only an opportunity
if you're ready. Otherwise, it's a risk.

832
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:26,912
You're not good enough yet.

833
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:28,872
Who are you to judge that?

834
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:30,498
And you think you can?

835
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:34,336
Have you ever stepped in dung before?
You feel pissed when you realize it.

836
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:37,547
But you can't let it ruin your day.
Wipe it off and move on.

837
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,342
That's what you two are to me. Dung.

838
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:51,186
WHERE ARE YOU? CAN WE TALK?
THIS ISN'T RIGHT

839
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:53,480
EUN-JU, PLEASE PICK UP
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

840
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,690
OKAY, I'M SORRY
PLEASE PICK UP THE PHONE

841
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:05,951
Did you really…

842
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:10,246
do that because of me?

843
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:35,897
NIGHT DIGGING IS FORBIDDEN
IN THE VILLAGE'S FISHING AREA

844
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:39,275
HARVESTING SEAFOOD
OF ANY KIND IS FORBIDDEN

845
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:55,458
Goodness. Hello, Ms. Ko.

846
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,590
Have some of this.

847
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:03,842
Goodness.

848
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:05,343
Hurry on over, everyone!

849
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:06,636
Come here, everyone!

850
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,972
-Hurry up!
-Come on!

851
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:15,520
Did a lot of people come to fish?

852
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:17,605
Gosh, they sure did.

853
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:20,400
Six groups have come so far.

854
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:21,526
Oh, dear.

855
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:24,571
I guess they all came
to Jeju since it's vacation season.

856
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,657
-All right.
-They can come if they want.

857
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:30,160
I'll hit them with this hook.

858
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:34,372
That's going to kill them.

859
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:37,792
You'll be put behind bars
before you know it.

860
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,840
All right. Eat up.

861
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,176
Thanks for your hard work.

862
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:49,429
Please. You work the hardest.

863
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:52,849
We take turns standing guard
every other day,

864
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:56,144
but it's not easy to bring food
every single day like you do.

865
00:55:56,227 --> 00:56:00,440
Don't worry about me,
and focus on protecting our livelihood.

866
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:01,816
-Yes, ma'am!
-Yes, ma'am!

867
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:07,822
By the way, I'm glad to see
Ms. Ko smiling like this.

868
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:13,244
I was worried too she'd go
on a long johns marathon again.

869
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:14,621
I was worried sick.

870
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:17,791
What do you mean?

871
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:21,169
Why would I do that?

872
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:22,212
What?

873
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:24,631
What?

874
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:26,883
I see.

875
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:29,177
Did you see Jin-dal and Hae-dal?

876
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:32,430
They're just visiting
because Ha-yul's on vacation.

877
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:35,183
No, we're talking about Sam-dal.

878
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:37,519
It's quite serious from what the kids say.

879
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:41,481
What do you mean?

880
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:44,150
Don't you know what's happened?

881
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:47,862
Sam-dal apparently
abused her power over her mentee,

882
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,906
and it has caused a huge commotion.

883
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,451
What?

884
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:56,454
Goodness. I guess she really didn't know.

885
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:58,164
Really?

886
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,252
What do we do?

887
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:04,420
Why would you bring that up?

888
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:27,735
I wasn't that hard on her, was I?

889
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:38,371
This water is really deep.

890
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:04,958
Yong-pil!

891
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:39,784
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

892
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:44,289
-What about this one?
-And this?

893
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:45,331
This one.

894
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:49,877
LUCKY MART

895
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:04,267
SOULMATES

896
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:05,476
Soulmates again?

897
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,686
Yes.

898
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:09,606
I need to save up if I want to
take a plane to the mainland.

899
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:12,692
This is the best snack
we can get with this money.

900
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:13,776
I see.

901
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:17,905
This candy must be named after you two.

902
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:22,702
Here.

903
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:25,204
Can't you give me the "soul" box?

904
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:26,539
I like strawberry better.

905
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,750
Hey, I'm the older one.

906
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:31,169
That's why I get "soul,"
and you get "mate."

907
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:34,255
But we're in the same grade.

908
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:35,923
Our classmates are all the same age.

909
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:37,383
That's not true.

910
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,594
Gwang-sik and Gwang-tae are twins.

911
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:41,971
-What does Gwang-tae call Gwang-sik?
-Older brother.

912
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:45,350
Exactly. Gwang-sik is older,
because he was born two minutes earlier.

913
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:47,560
I was born five minutes before you.

914
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:49,479
I see.

915
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:51,522
Got it? Now have this.

916
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:52,607
Thanks.

917
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:56,402
Bees!

918
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:02,158
Run!

919
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:05,244
-Wait up!
-Run!

920
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:12,543
Go away!

921
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:16,005
What do I do?

922
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:31,396
Yong-pil, you should've run away too.

923
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:33,064
You got stung.

924
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,275
I'm okay.

925
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:39,445
Why didn't you run away
like the rest of them?

926
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,031
Because…

927
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:45,827
I couldn't run and leave you behind.

928
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:58,005
PHOTOGRAPHER CHO EUN-HYE

929
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:23,072
"MY PERSON" IS AN EXHIBITION DEPICTING
THE PHOTOGRAPHER'S PAST 15 YEARS

930
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,757
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

931
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:43,760
This exhibition has been canceled.

932
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:45,011
You're not allowed in here.

933
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:49,682
I see. I'm sorry.

934
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,691
Excuse me.

935
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:04,989
You know how visitors
write their names down?

936
01:03:05,072 --> 01:03:06,157
Right.

937
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:08,826
Is that the book for it?

938
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:09,827
Yes.

939
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:11,412
May I…

940
01:03:12,997 --> 01:03:14,457
write my name in it?

941
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:19,128
Well, we'll be throwing this away
since this exhibition is canceled.

942
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:20,505
But still…

943
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:24,926
Well, at least she had one visitor.

944
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,761
Well…

945
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:41,943
CHO YONG-PIL.

946
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:50,451
FIRST PHOTOGRAPHER OF 2023, CHO EUN-HYE

947
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:52,829
CHO EUN-HYE'S PAST 15 YEARS
MY PERSON

948
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:28,197
-Sam-dal!
-I told him to keep my presence a secret!

949
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:30,283
-Hey!
-Or maybe Sam-dal is already back here

950
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:31,909
and hiding somewhere.

951
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:33,786
What's that?

952
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:36,330
That guy is back.

953
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:38,833
That's not why.

954
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:41,419
It's because she's fuming.

955
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:42,336
Honey!

956
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:44,005
You went to Sam-dal, right?

957
01:04:44,088 --> 01:04:45,214
-Did you meet her?
-Yes.

958
01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:47,216
Who's that? Who are you?

959
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:49,927
So is the article true?
Is Sam-dal really…

960
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:51,512
What if Sam-dal returns…

961
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:54,599
I'm glad that you're happy that I failed.

962
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:55,850
It's just a misunderstanding.

963
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:57,935
What kind of a misunderstanding?

964
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:02,815
