00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:40,999
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

2
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,461
JEJU INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
2005

3
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,004
Thank you.

4
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,046
-Thank you.
-Here.

5
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:47,964
Thanks.

6
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,508
-Aren't you too old to use a student ID?
-What?

7
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:54,137
I've been reminding you
to bring your ID card for the past month.

8
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,806
This is my ID card. What's wrong with it?

9
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,518
I was a student up until a month ago.
That's why I brought it.

10
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,686
Jeez.

11
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,271
Hold on.

12
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,150
Hi, Mom.

13
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,944
We just got our tickets.

14
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,863
Yong-pil? He's with me. Don't worry.

15
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,074
Mom, I won't let her out of my sight!

16
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,241
Don't you worry!

17
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,661
I still don't get it. I'm the one
who wants to make it in Seoul,

18
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,122
so why does he need to come with me?

19
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,373
Hello? Mom?

20
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,334
She hung up on me.

21
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,504
You better treat me well
if you want to live in Seoul a while.

22
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,840
Treat me bad,
and I'll return to Jeju right away.

23
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,092
Then, you'll also have to come back home--

24
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,260
You little…

25
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,887
-Darn it.
-Hey, Cho Sam-dal.

26
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,307
Didn't I tell you to call me
Cho Eun-hye, not Cho Sam-dal?

27
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:42,519
Hey, Cho Sam-dal.

28
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,395
You need a motion sickness patch.

29
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,939
I don't have motion sickness.

30
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:46,898
-Hey.
-What?

31
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,400
I'm changing my name
to Eun-hye, so be careful.

32
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,652
Why change it?

33
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,529
"Cho Sam-dal" sounds perfect.

34
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,240
Why would you change it? All done.

35
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,282
I need one--

36
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:57,742
What was that?

37
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,787
-What? Our tickets!
-Hey!

38
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,248
-Darn it!
-Hey!

39
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,501
Grab him! I got you, you scumbag!

40
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,296
-Did you know it was me?
-What on earth?

41
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,509
-Did you have to do that?
-Jeez, what are you doing?

42
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:17,137
-Darn it.
-Darn it. What's wrong with you?

43
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,848
What's your problem? I can't believe you!

44
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,559
-Jeez.
-Why are you doing this?

45
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,810
Give our tickets back.

46
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,687
-Give them back.
-Give them.

47
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,523
What are you doing here?
Are you seeing us off?

48
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,360
-Are you insane? Of course not.
-He's crazy.

49
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,028
Hey, we're also…

50
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,946
-going.
-Going.

51
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,409
-You could've just said that.
-You run so fast.

52
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,577
-All right.
-Unbelievable.

53
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,167
-You think they're from Seoul?
-Gangnam?

54
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,084
Gangnam?

55
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,378
Gyeong-tae, what are you doing?

56
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,463
Your mom paid for two years
of your cram school.

57
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,548
Exactly.

58
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,968
I mean, what kind of mom does that?

59
00:02:57,051 --> 00:03:01,014
She thinks I won't pass next year.
There's no trust in our family.

60
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,307
I'll just go to Seoul

61
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,059
and open up my own shop.

62
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,438
And how will you do that?
You need money to open one.

63
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,480
I have money.

64
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:11,608
No, you don't.

65
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,817
Don't tell anyone.

66
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,737
I found it in my mom's wardrobe.

67
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,907
-What? You crazy bastard!
-You crazy bastard!

68
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,408
-Hey!
-You're a crazy bastard!

69
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:23,077
How could you steal
your mom's hard-earned money?

70
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,078
Get off the plane.

71
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,163
-Get off.
-Get off!

72
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:29,042
It's too dangerous to get off now.
And I didn't steal it. I'm borrowing it.

73
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:32,128
-She just doesn't know that.
-That's stealing, you lunatic.

74
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:35,173
-Didn't you get into Tamra University?
-What?

75
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:38,217
I'll never become
a cartoonist if I go to college.

76
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,512
Everyone makes their debut
after a few years in Seoul.

77
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,599
Enough. You know we're inseparable
like the Power Rangers.

78
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:47,185
We should make it together,
not just you two.

79
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,354
That Power Rangers stuff was ages ago.

80
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,065
One of us isn't here anyway.

81
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,525
Right. Well, leave Sang-do out of this.

82
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,987
He can't fly out.
He doesn't have money for a ticket.

83
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,490
What kind of family
can't afford a plane ticket?

84
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:18,091
Whatever. We can take care of him
once we're successful.

85
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:22,136
Let's go to Seoul,
enjoy the night view from Namsan Mountain,

86
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,639
and live our best lives. Let's go!

87
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,561
All right.

88
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,815
Let's do it!

89
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,400
Let's go!

90
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,443
Let's go, Captain!

91
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:43,032
Like migratory birds setting out in winter
on a long journey to find warmth,

92
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,202
protected by our youth
as our armor, we ventured out

93
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,121
in pursuit of our dreams.

94
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,331
We need to book train tickets in advance.

95
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,249
It's free.

96
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,084
You idiot. It's not free.

97
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,461
Nothing's free in Seoul.

98
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:01,467
HANKOOK UNIVERSITY

99
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,468
Excuse me.

100
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:06,431
Excuse me.

101
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,391
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

102
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,109
Wait. Hold on!

103
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,407
-Two steaks for table seven.
-Okay.

104
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,076
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

105
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:28,870
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

106
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,288
Are you ready to order?

107
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,206
Two carbonaras, please.

108
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,124
All right.

109
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,675
This isn't your house. Get up right now.

110
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,720
-How much did you drink?
-I feel sick.

111
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,098
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

112
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,641
Take care, ma'am.

113
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,935
Your mom is here to pick you up.

114
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,353
I have to go to round three.

115
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,813
No.

116
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,358
Hey.

117
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,278
I have to go to the next spot.

118
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,368
It's alive.

119
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:19,128
JEJU MACKEREL

120
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,897
Happy birthday, son!

121
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,024
Have some of your favorite, mackerel.

122
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,575
Don't worry. I'm having some right now.

123
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,877
JEJU INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
2011

124
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,669
The migratory birds pursued
their youthful dreams,

125
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,380
but they eventually flew back…

126
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,261
to Jeju, their home.

127
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:59,437
EPISODE 3 - LIKE WILD BIRDS,
SOARING, DREAMING, DESCENDING

128
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,581
I pity you, Eun-hye.

129
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,084
No one asked how you're doing.

130
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,974
Why would you search
every nook and cranny?

131
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,684
I barely have any time to sleep.

132
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,436
If we do it, we should do it right.

133
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,272
-I'm sick and tired of this.
-I'm exhausted.

134
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:48,653
By the way,

135
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,031
Sam-dal wouldn't do
anything stupid, right?

136
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,242
Like what?

137
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,411
I mean, everyone's criticizing her now.

138
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,872
-What if she goes to the Han River and--
-Hey!

139
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,165
Hey!

140
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,291
Don't be ridiculous.

141
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,002
How could you say that?

142
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,462
She wouldn't do that.

143
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:08,839
Of course not.

144
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,302
Hold on. What is she doing?

145
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,269
What? No, wait.

146
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,257
Cho Yong-pil!

147
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,419
Yong-pil, are you okay?

148
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,505
Are you all right?

149
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:35,384
Wake up. Are you okay?

150
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,636
Hey, are you all right?

151
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,430
Why would you jump in there
when you can't even swim?

152
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,557
-Darn it.
-Are you okay?

153
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,100
Get up.

154
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,352
-Get up.
-No.

155
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,063
What's wrong?

156
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,064
-Go.
-What's this?

157
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,148
Go.

158
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,275
Are you hurt?

159
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,735
Hey, let me see.

160
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,028
-No, I--
-Open your eyes.

161
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,989
No, you should go. Go home.

162
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,158
How could I leave you here like this?

163
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,077
Are you sure you're okay?

164
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,830
Come on, look at me.
At least open your eyes, will you?

165
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:05,915
No, I--

166
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,542
I can't open my eyes.

167
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,044
Your eyes won't open?

168
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,004
Oh, no. I should call 911.

169
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,090
No, don't call them.

170
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,383
-Don't call them.
-Then?

171
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,051
-It's not that…
-Yeah?

172
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,387
-my eyes won't open.
-Okay.

173
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,097
I can't open them.

174
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,473
Why not?

175
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,019
What did you say?

176
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,773
What are… What?

177
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,442
Because I'm mortified right now!

178
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,695
I'm so embarrassed! Damn it!

179
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,115
It's mortifying. Just go home.

180
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,866
This is mortifying.

181
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,868
I don't want to meet anyone right now.

182
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,286
This is so embarrassing.

183
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,585
-You're right…
-Yeah.

184
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,923
It can be embarrassing. I understand.

185
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,260
Sorry.

186
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,012
Just go.

187
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,692
Are you sure

188
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,695
you're really okay?

189
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:18,612
Go.

190
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,782
Okay. I'll get going first.

191
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,910
Get up and take care
of yourself, okay? I'll go then.

192
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,829
Okay. I'm leaving.

193
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,456
Bye.

194
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,137
Darn it.

195
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,014
Damn it, I'm so embarrassed.

196
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,641
How humiliating!

197
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,188
All because I leaned a bit
and lost my balance.

198
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,067
I almost died today.

199
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,445
Jeez, you startled me.

200
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,655
What? Why are you still here?

201
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,992
Sorry, I just had to give
something back to you.

202
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:06,619
What is it?

203
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,884
Don't do that!

204
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,969
This is what you did.

205
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,848
I can't believe it!

206
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,642
What was this supposed to be?

207
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,190
It's so hilarious.

208
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,664
-So when did you arrive?
-It's only temporary.

209
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:56,043
-I'm going back soon. I'm not staying.
-Right.

210
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:57,962
I see.

211
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:02,550
I mean, I thought you'd be curious
about why I was here.

212
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,179
I mean, you're visiting your family.

213
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,641
-I think that's a good enough reason.
-What?

214
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,436
Yeah. Right.

215
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,064
I'm just visiting my family, right?

216
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:23,195
-When are you going back?
-I'm not here because I failed.

217
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,659
I mean, just in case
you get the wrong idea.

218
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,035
It's not that at all.

219
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,957
So just don't tell the others I'm here.

220
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:36,834
I know.

221
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:40,713
You're not someone who'd run away
and come back home because you failed.

222
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:44,341
Of course not.
I would never run away. No way.

223
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,720
That's what my sisters would do though.

224
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,179
Right.

225
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,726
By the way,

226
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,354
I guess your sisters are back too.

227
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,899
-What?
-What?

228
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,359
Over there.

229
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,536
-Nice landing.
-Nice.

230
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,999
Why did they hide the beer outside?

231
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,668
They're here temporarily too, right?

232
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,087
Right.

233
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,381
Of course. We're going back soon.

234
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,549
It's only temporary.

235
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,675
Good night, then.

236
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,096
Hey, Sam-dal.

237
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,433
What does he want now?

238
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:36,685
Yeah? What's up?

239
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,692
Are you okay?

240
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,504
Sir, why would you pull out
when the photos are ready?

241
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,339
Please, be patient. And everything…

242
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:06,924
Ma'am, wait! Just a minute.

243
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,306
ACTOR JANG SEOK-JUNG
PRESIDENT KANG JAE-YUN

244
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,183
EDITOR JOO HYEON-SEON
MODEL YEOM JEONG-U

245
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,219
What do you mean?

246
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,682
Right. You must've seen
the articles about me.

247
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,393
Yes, I'm pretty popular these days.

248
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,603
But I'm fine. It's not a big deal.

249
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,688
Bye.

250
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,149
I'm freezing!

251
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,241
Gosh, it's so cold.

252
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,744
Sam-dal apparently
abused her power over her mentee,

253
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,662
and it has caused a great commotion.

254
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,384
Can you please get out?

255
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,805
Get out!

256
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:18,764
But…

257
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,480
Why did she just kick us out?

258
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,523
Well,

259
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,818
something annoying probably happened.

260
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,528
It's not "happened."

261
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,322
It's still happening to Aunt Sam-dal.

262
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,158
-You're right.
-Right.

263
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,162
Ha-yul, you're so smart.

264
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,372
Let's call it a night.

265
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,456
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

266
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,701
SAMDAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

267
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,077
Hey, it's Sam-dal!

268
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,498
Hey, Sam-dal.

269
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,709
Are you okay?

270
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,131
Why did you have to go
and provoke Jin-dal again?

271
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,885
Whatever. This is so annoying.

272
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,346
Are you okay?

273
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,185
-What's wrong?
-What?

274
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,104
Are you okay?

275
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:51,982
Are you okay?

276
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,195
Here.

277
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,696
Drink it.

278
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,422
Not again.

279
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:05,138
Not again.

280
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,641
Ms. Ko's at it again.

281
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,479
-The long johns marathon.
-Honey!

282
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,690
I'm sorry.

283
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,692
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

284
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,778
I just didn't want you to get hurt again.

285
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,532
Please put something on, at least.

286
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,745
Honey!

287
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:34,626
Si-yun.

288
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,920
Can I see the adiabatic curve
from three hours ago?

289
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,005
-Okay.
-Thanks.

290
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:47,014
PARIS MAGAZINE WORLD TOUR
IN KOREA HAS BEEN CANCELED

291
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,558
DUE TO CHO EUN-HYE'S
ABUSE OF POWER ALLEGATIONS

292
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,394
PEOPLE ONLINE
HAVE BEEN OUTRAGED BY HER ACTIONS

293
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,605
HER ABUSE OF POWER IS A DISGRACE
JUST DIE

294
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:59,192
I can't believe what people say
just because they're anonymous.

295
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,988
It looks like none of this
has been proven to be true either.

296
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,574
SHE SHOULD KILL HERSELF

297
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,341
It couldn't have been. No way.

298
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,266
Why are you here so early?

299
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,729
I gave the short-term forecast
to Forecaster Kang. It's for the meeting.

300
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,481
Hey.

301
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,067
You're going, right?

302
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,486
-Of course, I'm going home. I'm off today.
-Not that.

303
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,571
I mean headquarters.

304
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,992
Right. Goodness, headquarters.

305
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,452
By the way,

306
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,287
why haven't you thrown this away yet?

307
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,623
Are you planning to reuse it?

308
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,375
Gosh, you're thrifty.
I'm sure you'll be rich.

309
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,211
-You're the best.
-That little… Hey!

310
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,254
You said you wanted to go!

311
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,506
Were you mocking me?

312
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:04,716
Damn it.

313
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,843
CHO EUN-HYE'S PAST 15 YEARS
MY PERSON

314
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,150
I passed by Ms. Cho's house.
There still were a lot of reporters there.

315
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,112
They're relentless.

316
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:30,700
It was wise of her to go to Jeju.
I mean, it's not even close to dying down.

317
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,244
Tell me about it.

318
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,037
Gosh, these photos…

319
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:37,207
She worked like a dog
for years to prepare this.

320
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,500
CHO YONG-PIL

321
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,418
Eun-ju hasn't called you either, right?

322
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,505
No, she won't even pick up.

323
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,385
I'm dying to hear her side of the story.

324
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:52,013
Should we request an interview
with the reporters and defend Ms. Cho?

325
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,933
She explained it herself,
but it didn't get any attention.

326
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,560
They probably won't hear us out.

327
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,690
That guy is back.

328
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,495
We kept telling him
you never abused your power,

329
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,080
but he kept questioning us.

330
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,832
Maybe you just didn't realize it.

331
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,333
You're wrong.

332
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,335
Ms. Cho may be a bit intimidating,

333
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,421
but she genuinely cares about us.

334
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,131
I see.

335
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,841
So she's intimidating?

336
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:29,843
When is she like that?

337
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,429
Does she go around and yell at people?

338
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,181
I'm sure you've been scolded too.

339
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,640
When is she intimidating?

340
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,393
When we do something wrong.

341
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,355
Only a lunatic would scold
someone who's innocent.

342
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,737
He wasn't interested
in finding out who you really are.

343
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,865
It felt like he just came to hear
what he wanted to hear.

344
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,909
This is so unfair, Ms. Cho!

345
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,328
She's right! This is so unfair!

346
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,038
It's okay. Don't be upset.

347
00:24:58,663 --> 00:24:59,664
I'm all right.

348
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,835
Thank you for cleaning everything up.

349
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:09,174
For now, don't come in to work,
and let's see how this pans out.

350
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:10,926
Okay.

351
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:14,471
Make sure you don't skip your meals.

352
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,097
I won't. Bye.

353
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,072
BANG EUN-JU

354
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,282
Maybe.

355
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:47,254
The phone you called is turned off.
You'll be directed to voicemail.

356
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,217
Sam-dal!

357
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,096
-What was that?
-Hey, Sam-dal!

358
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:00,183
-Is that Yong-pil?
-Sam-dal!

359
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,559
Is he serious right now?

360
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:04,479
I told him not to let
people know I was here!

361
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:06,982
-Sam-dal!
-He's looking for Sam-dal, right?

362
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:11,027
Sam-dal!

363
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,241
What's going on?

364
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:20,036
Wasn't that Yong-pil's voice?

365
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,080
It couldn't have been.

366
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,250
Seriously?

367
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:42,726
Honey.

368
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,147
I can't believe you two.

369
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,357
What are you doing out here?

370
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,525
Goodness.

371
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:51,943
Honey!

372
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,990
-What was that about?
-Lie down.

373
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,452
Gosh, this is nice.

374
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:01,619
This is wonderful.

375
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:02,954
Goodness.

376
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:05,707
Sam-dal!

377
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:07,500
Sam-dal!

378
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,046
Darn it! That hurts! Why did you hit me?

379
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,464
What are you doing?

380
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:16,468
Are you letting everyone know I'm here?
I told you to keep it a secret!

381
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,178
I am keeping it a secret.

382
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,430
Is that what you call it?

383
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:22,223
What else do you think I'm doing?

384
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:23,641
How is this…

385
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,518
You're letting everyone know!

386
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:28,813
What the hell are you talking about?
Gosh, that hurts.

387
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:29,939
Hey, Sam-dal!

388
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:32,942
Hey!

389
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:34,778
Sam-dal!

390
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:35,987
Come here.

391
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,615
Where did you run off to
without your leash?

392
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:39,699
You little mutt.

393
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,660
You went to see Kkakkung
in Namdal-ri, didn't you?

394
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,623
Goodness, Sam-dal.

395
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,295
What kind of name is that for a dog?

396
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,508
It's raised here, so we named it Sam-dal.
What's wrong with that?

397
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:59,135
But that's my name.
Why did you give it the same name?

398
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,554
In that case, I have the same name
as that singer too.

399
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,598
But he's not a dog.

400
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:04,557
Change its name now.

401
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,559
I can't do that.

402
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,728
All the villagers raise it together.

403
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:12,357
Besides, even if I did change its name,
it wouldn't understand.

404
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,069
And you have different surnames.
You're "Cho," and that's "Dog."

405
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,487
Dog…

406
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,826
I should seriously change my name soon.

407
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,702
You still haven't changed it?

408
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:28,081
Doesn't it just happen
right away when you apply?

409
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:30,250
I don't know. They still won't let me.

410
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,419
Anyway, don't tell--

411
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:35,713
Fine. I won't tell anyone, so don't worry.

412
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:37,590
Hey, Yong-pil!

413
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,301
Sam-dal, what should we…

414
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,553
Where did she go?

415
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:52,772
-Is Sam-dal here?
-What?

416
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,818
There she is!

417
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,320
Goodness.

418
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,030
You little mutt.

419
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,490
Why is your face swollen?

420
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,743
Did you visit Kkakkung again?

421
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,911
Goodness, Sam-dal.

422
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,372
You can't resist those male dogs, can you?

423
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:10,957
That little…

424
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,916
-Hey.
-What?

425
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,668
You see that new article about Sam-dal?

426
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,171
-What?
-Apparently,

427
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:19,716
another article came out saying
her mentees were intimidated by her.

428
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,302
And everyone's busy writing hate comments.

429
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:24,888
Jeez. The garbage they write…

430
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:29,100
Gosh. I'm surprised
she hasn't returned to Jeju by now.

431
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,311
Hey.

432
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,521
-What?
-Where are you going?

433
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,149
Want to do this for me?

434
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:40,361
Sure, I'll throw them away.
Why do this all by yourself?

435
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,030
What's with you?

436
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,408
What?

437
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:53,666
Or maybe Sam-dal is already
hiding somewhere in Jeju.

438
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,502
Oh, my God! What's that?

439
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,215
What…

440
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:01,883
Hey.

441
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,552
-Excuse me.
-Come here.

442
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:09,432
-Hey, Gyeong-tae.
-What?

443
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,518
Long time no see. How have you been?

444
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,686
Hey, Sam-dal.

445
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:17,273
But why are you crouching
in a pile of trash?

446
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,316
Are you back?

447
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,735
No, I'm not. I was just passing by.

448
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,862
I popped by and then…

449
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,030
You popped by Jeju?

450
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,115
What I mean is, I'm only visiting.

451
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,534
See you around. Bye.

452
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,164
-Hey.
-What?

453
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,374
She's back, isn't she?

454
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,417
I guess she is.

455
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,127
-Hey, Sam-dal--
-Hey.

456
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:41,089
Where are you going?
She's gone. Why follow her?

457
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:44,384
What do you mean? That's Sam-dal.
Aren't you happy to see her?

458
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:47,053
Oh, right.
You might not be happy to see her.

459
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,137
Hold on.

460
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,099
Why aren't you surprised to see her?

461
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,851
What? I am surprised.

462
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,143
Did you already know?

463
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:57,230
No, I just found out.

464
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:01,025
-What? You're acting strange.
-What do you mean?

465
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,694
Are you two dating again--

466
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,904
Listen, you should just…

467
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,996
Just you wait and see.
I'll get you one day.

468
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:15,999
Man.

469
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,879
Hello? Hey, Sam-dal is here.

470
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,547
Not Sam-dal the dog. Cho Sam-dal.

471
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,717
What? Cho Sam-dal?

472
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,469
Cho Sam-dal is back?

473
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:37,645
The entire neighborhood will know
now that Gyeong-tae's found out.

474
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,231
Darn it.

475
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:47,155
Hey, Mom found out why we're here.

476
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,240
Hae-dal and I ran away to hide for now.

477
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,326
Come on.

478
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:04,213
I WANTED TO GIVE UP ON MY DREAM
BECAUSE OF CHO EUN-HYE'S ABUSE OF POWER

479
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:25,485
Cha Ha-yul, you shouldn't have taught
Grandma how to read the news online.

480
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:28,237
Mom, she deserves to know.

481
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:32,158
Why is everyone in this neighborhood
so eager to gossip about others?

482
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,910
Tell me about it.

483
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:38,081
By the way, Dad, why does Mom
run around in just her long johns?

484
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,792
You don't know? Even I know.

485
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,502
It's menopause.

486
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:45,171
They say it makes you
feel like your body's on fire.

487
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:48,341
That's not why, Aunt Jin-dal.

488
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:50,551
It's because she's fuming.

489
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,261
Who told you that?

490
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,179
Grandma did.

491
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:54,931
Once because of you,

492
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,058
and once because of you.

493
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,644
And this time, because of Aunt Sam-dal.

494
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:05,608
Why did all of you have to
come together and upset her?

495
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,403
It was teeming with reporters
outside our house, Dad.

496
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,238
They exposed our identities too.

497
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,824
They said Jin-dal was
the ex-wife of AS Group's CEO

498
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:15,159
and I was an unmarried mom.
They're bad-mouthing us.

499
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,160
An unmarried mom?

500
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,246
That's not true.

501
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:21,874
And so what if Jin-dal had married
into a rich businessman's family?

502
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:22,875
What's the problem?

503
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,795
They said Jin-dal exposed
how the rich abused their power

504
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,547
while her sister abused hers.

505
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:47,108
AS, A COMPANY THAT OPENS UP THE FUTURE

506
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,714
Is there anything else I could get you?

507
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,051
A glass of water, please.

508
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:14,844
Sure, sir.

509
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,688
Bring me my alcohol!

510
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:26,647
Please calm down.

511
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,107
-Should I break this?
-Calm down.

512
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,359
-Please calm down.
-Then, bring it to me now!

513
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:33,279
-What kind of first class is this?
-Please sit down.

514
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:36,115
-Please calm down.
-Bring it to me! Now!

515
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,326
-Bring it to me.
-Please sit down!

516
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:40,578
Damn it.

517
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,872
Who do you think you are?

518
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:43,956
Oh, no!

519
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,253
I'm restraining you
for breaching the Aviation Security Act.

520
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,671
Bring me the rope.

521
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,174
That hurts! Let me go!

522
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:03,643
Sir.

523
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,145
Sir?

524
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,357
Right.

525
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,359
Here's your water.

526
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,985
Okay. Thank you.

527
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,342
What should I tell her?

528
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:41,389
Why am I even worried?
I can just tell her it's not true.

529
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,851
I'm the victim here.

530
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:24,807
Mom.

531
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,769
Look, I just…

532
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,771
Let me explain what happened.

533
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:31,856
Hang these.

534
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,483
-What?
-Hang them out to dry.

535
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,653
Okay.

536
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,072
By the way, Mom--

537
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,825
Where does everyone disappear to
when I need their help?

538
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,152
Holy…

539
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:23,366
Jeez, I knew it.

540
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,409
Gyeong-tae, that son of a…

541
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,539
Are you sure she's back?

542
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,999
I'm positive.

543
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,126
We even said hi.

544
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:37,630
Didn't that door just open a bit?
I think it was Sam-dal.

545
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,508
Maybe she doesn't want to see us.

546
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:44,553
Don't be absurd! She was ecstatic
to see me. She said, "See you around."

547
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:49,100
That's your definition
of "ecstatic"? "See you around"?

548
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,687
Where is she?

549
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,315
I do want to see her since she's here.
It's been eight years.

550
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,609
This is all
because of that punk, Yong-pil.

551
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:02,363
Why did he have to date
and break up with his childhood friend?

552
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,115
She even cut ties with us too.

553
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,701
Yong-pil didn't break up
because he wanted to.

554
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,495
What would you know anyway?
You've never dated anyone.

555
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:10,871
Let's wait.

556
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:14,917
She said, "See you around."
So that means she wanted to see me again.

557
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:16,919
Does it?

558
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:29,515
Gosh. How is Gyeong-tae
still just as clueless?

559
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:36,397
I said I'd see him around.
So why did he follow me home?

560
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,691
Forget it. Let's just go.

561
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:41,819
Ms. Ko's started her long johns marathon.
It's not a good time.

562
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,739
You're the one who was eager to see her.

563
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,657
Of course, I want to see her.

564
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,160
But given the situation,

565
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,455
even I'd want to be left alone. Let's go.

566
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,415
But…

567
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,335
-Are you really leaving?
-Let's just have some beer.

568
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:01,630
Is she not home?

569
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,677
-It felt like she was about to come out.
-Forget it.

570
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,058
Hey, Sang-do!

571
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,685
Hey, Sam-dal is here!

572
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,321
Who's here?

573
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:26,364
Cho Sam-dal.

574
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:38,709
He's definitely not normal.

575
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,339
-No!
-Don't do it.

576
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:44,423
Jeez.

577
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:48,177
Sang-do!

578
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,681
-Did you just see my son?
-Did something just pass by?

579
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:53,641
Time?

580
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:56,769
Give me a gae!

581
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,687
-You got a gae!
-You got a gae!

582
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,481
-I actually got it.
-You got a gae!

583
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,948
I shouldn't have come to Jeju.

584
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:12,159
Gosh, this blanket is cold.

585
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,037
Come on.

586
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:15,955
Jeez.

587
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:17,748
Darn it.

588
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:22,628
Are they still out there?

589
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,264
They're gone.

590
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,016
Can I please

591
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,727
have some peace until I leave?

592
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,317
I have a feeling Gyeong-tae will be back.

593
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:46,402
Darn it.

594
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,863
This is all because of Yong-pil.

595
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:55,828
Darn it!

596
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:10,342
Oh, my gosh!

597
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,136
Who are you?

598
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:14,597
Oh, my gosh! Who are you?

599
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:19,977
Is that you,

600
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:21,979
Sam-dal?

601
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:28,944
Bu…

602
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:30,946
Sang-do?

603
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,510
Hey!

604
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,234
You're really back.

605
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,414
You startled me!

606
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:34,468
You heard it too.
She said, "See you around."

607
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,428
It means she wants to see us again.

608
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,432
Hey, will you ever grow up?

609
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:41,559
What do you…

610
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,519
Hey, Sang-do! Come here.

611
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,729
You went to visit Sam-dal, right?
Did you see her?

612
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:48,774
-Yeah.
-What? You really did?

613
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:49,817
Yeah.

614
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,443
I told you we should've waited!

615
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,279
We're the only ones who didn't see her!

616
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,656
-Jeez.
-Did you meet her too, Yong-pil?

617
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,409
Yeah, we just ran into each other.

618
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,077
I see.

619
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:03,914
Are you okay?

620
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,256
What?

621
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,801
What? Of course, I'm okay.

622
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,887
I really am. Stop overreacting.

623
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:20,431
He's right.

624
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,975
It's been eight years.
It'd be weird if he wasn't.

625
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,227
-Are you leaving?
-Yeah.

626
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,729
Okay. Let's go.

627
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:28,606
-Where are you going?
-To see Sam-dal.

628
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,149
-Come on.
-You weirdo!

629
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:32,151
-Hey.
-Give it a rest!

630
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:34,737
The whole town is
already talking about her.

631
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,364
Why do you want to go
and make it harder on her?

632
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,408
-He's right.
-What did I do?

633
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:42,786
It's because I know she's struggling.
Imagine how she must feel.

634
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:46,123
I should go and bother her
so she won't think about it.

635
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:47,207
-What?
-Okay?

636
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,834
You all went through it too.

637
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,419
Each time one of us came back,

638
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:53,631
everyone would gossip
about how we were failures.

639
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,049
It must be worse for her.

640
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,550
So stop yelling at me.

641
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:01,722
He left by himself.

642
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,098
-Sit back down.
-Come here.

643
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,267
Let's just drink. Tell him to come back.

644
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:10,439
Jeez, where in the world
does all that beer go?

645
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,399
Gosh, they drink so much.

646
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:32,294
Is Ms. Ko not coming today?

647
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:33,253
-What?
-Goodness.

648
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:36,465
She's in no state to come out here.
Her long johns marathon is on.

649
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:38,676
-Goodness.
-You're right.

650
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,678
So is that article true?

651
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:41,595
-What?
-What?

652
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:45,808
Did Sam-dal really abuse her powers?

653
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:46,767
I don't know.

654
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,769
It's not like we can ask.

655
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,438
Sam-dal's not the type to do that though.

656
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,357
-Right.
-Right.

657
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,778
Even if you can figure out the deep sea,

658
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:00,531
they say you can't know
how person really is.

659
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:05,494
If it's true,
then my heart will break for Ms. Ko.

660
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:07,121
To imagine Eun-u being guilty

661
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:10,249
of doing something like that
to someone else…

662
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:11,166
-Gosh.
-Goodness!

663
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,084
Oh, dear.

664
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:14,044
Anyway, if Sam-dal returns too,

665
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:17,131
it means all the kids who went
to Seoul failed and came back.

666
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,674
-You're right.
-You're right.

667
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:19,842
-You're right.
-Yeah.

668
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,729
What if Sam-dal ends up returning too?

669
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:36,442
If she does, Ms. Ko
will be extremely devastated.

670
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,902
After what happened
to Jin-dal and Hae-dal,

671
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,863
Sam-dal was all she could rely on.

672
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:42,239
So if she returns too,

673
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:45,242
Ms. Ko would be too ashamed
to show her face around town.

674
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:46,577
Could it be true?

675
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,746
That Sam-dal bullied her mentee
and drove her to suicide?

676
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,082
It was an attempted suicide! Attempted!

677
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:53,834
Suicide--

678
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:59,756
Seeing how there's so much fuss about it,
there must be some truth to it.

679
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,014
Goodness.

680
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:09,933
Never mind.

681
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,329
This darn neighborhood.

682
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:33,290
Who said I'm a failure?

683
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,667
I didn't fail.

684
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,938
CHEON CHUNG-GI

685
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,862
Why are you ignoring my calls?

686
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:06,782
Is it true?
Did you really abuse your power?

687
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:07,699
Tell me!

688
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,785
Why are you so curious about it?

689
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:12,704
If only you had put this effort
into being productive.

690
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:29,054
SAMDAL-RI'S MASCOT
SAM-DAL'S HOUSE

691
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:32,891
What are you looking at?

692
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,477
You think it's funny I failed?

693
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:36,562
Go away.

694
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,147
Stop staring at me. Just go.

695
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,691
Don't look at me. Go.

696
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:44,861
What are you doing?

697
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:48,490
You startled me.

698
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,909
Why are you taking it out on poor Sam-dal?

699
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:51,827
Why?

700
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:55,247
What? I didn't take it out on her.

701
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:58,125
And why are you
all covered up like this? Take this off.

702
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:02,045
You'll stand out more
if you do that in our neighborhood.

703
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:04,339
Mind your own business and leave me alone.

704
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:08,885
This town won't give me any time
to be alone with my thoughts.

705
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,807
Hey. Look…

706
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,894
Being alone with your thoughts

707
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:22,024
won't give you an answer
if it's not there in the first place.

708
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:26,361
You'll only think of doing
something foolish.

709
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,322
Hey, Sam-dal.

710
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:31,325
We all go through
our own hardships in life.

711
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:35,495
If you think of doing something foolish
every time that happens…

712
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,540
What do you mean by
"think of doing something foolish"?

713
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:44,087
Last night at the water,

714
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,299
I knew you were going to jump.

715
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,261
Hey! Have you gone insane?

716
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,929
I'm not crazy.

717
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,973
It's not what you think it was.

718
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,391
What? You weren't?

719
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:59,353
Weren't you trying to jump in yesterday?

720
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,731
No! I was just stumbling
because I was drunk.

721
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:06,652
How could I drown in that shallow water?
You know I'm a good swimmer.

722
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:10,197
Hey, I know. I know fully well. Okay?

723
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,324
I know you would never do that.

724
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:13,909
Of course, I do.

725
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:17,913
But given your current situation,
I just thought I'd talk about it.

726
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:22,042
So why did you drink alone by the water
when you know it's dangerous?

727
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,086
-What's it to you?
-Get up. Let's go.

728
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:25,629
Go where?

729
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:28,465
The guys are drinking beer.
Let's go and join them.

730
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,260
No one's supposed to know I'm here.

731
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:35,555
Even this dog knows that you're here.

732
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,271
You said you didn't fail.

733
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:45,524
Of course, I didn't.

734
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:48,026
So let's go then.

735
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,822
Come on, you can tell them yourself.

736
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:53,824
Come on.

737
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:55,450
I'm going now.

738
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,672
Does it hurt your pride

739
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,717
to see your friends again?

740
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:17,389
It doesn't matter why you came back.

741
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:20,934
We're just happy to see our friend again.

742
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:22,978
I told you I'm not back for good.

743
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:24,062
You know what?

744
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,356
I'm glad.

745
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:32,487
I'm glad to see you.

746
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:40,370
I was curious

747
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,706
about how you'd been doing.

748
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,126
How have you been?

749
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:56,928
Given our history,

750
00:50:57,971 --> 00:51:00,098
we can't be that happy to see each other

751
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:03,477
or wonder how we're doing.

752
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,230
Well, that's true.

753
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:08,982
Right.

754
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:21,203
What else do you want to know?

755
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:26,666
Is there anything else you want to ask me?

756
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:32,088
No.

757
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:38,261
I see. It's fine if there isn't.

758
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:55,862
You know how Sam-dal is.
She has a strong sense of pride.

759
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:58,949
-She probably doesn't want to see us.
-I know that.

760
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:03,829
But I thought
maybe we could be of help to her.

761
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:06,540
Let's be frank.
We've all been failures before.

762
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:10,544
-Maybe not as bad as Sam-dal, but still.
-Jeez.

763
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,003
But you know what?

764
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:16,091
A part of me is honestly glad
she failed and came back.

765
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:17,676
-Don't you agree?
-Hey!

766
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,762
Sam-dal.

767
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:23,390
Cho Sam-dal.

768
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:25,433
-What Gyeong-tae meant--
-It must be nice.

769
00:52:26,142 --> 00:52:29,437
I'm so relieved to know
you're happy that I failed.

770
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,481
-Sam-dal--
-What he meant was--

771
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:34,109
You must've wanted to see me fail
and come back so badly.

772
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,445
That's not what I meant.

773
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:38,697
But unfortunately for you,

774
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:42,909
I'm seriously only here for a moment.

775
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,538
I didn't fail.

776
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,582
I'm not a failure.

777
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:54,212
I'm so sick and tired of this town.

778
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:56,089
-Hey, wait…
-Wait, Sam-dal!

779
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:00,802
Damn it.

780
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,348
Hey, Sam-dal.

781
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,808
Sam-dal, wait.

782
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:07,726
Let's talk…

783
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:14,399
Hey, Gyeong-tae.

784
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:20,030
You're happy she failed
and came back? Are you serious?

785
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:23,033
I didn't mean I was happy that she failed.

786
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:25,619
I just meant I've missed her so much,

787
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:28,163
and I was just happy to see her back here.

788
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:30,874
I just meant I was happy
to see her. That's all.

789
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:32,751
Then, you should've said that…

790
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:33,835
Gosh.

791
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,004
Jeez.

792
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:37,172
Seriously…

793
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:39,257
Wait up!

794
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:42,928
Sam-dal, hold on.

795
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:46,806
Hey, Sam-dal.
It's just a misunderstanding.

796
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:50,185
Really? A misunderstanding?

797
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:54,356
You're no different from them.

798
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:58,443
I know you're happy too.
You're only curious about my failure.

799
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,612
What are you talking about?

800
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:02,781
You're curious about how I've been doing?

801
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:05,533
You know dozens of news articles
about me pop up each day.

802
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:08,036
So you're seriously curious
about how I've been?

803
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,457
What do you think?
Does it look like I'm doing well?

804
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:15,835
What? Friends?

805
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:18,964
If you were truly my friends,

806
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:23,218
you wouldn't have cared
that I failed and came back.

807
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:26,763
You would've wondered

808
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:30,976
if someone really tried
to kill herself because of me.

809
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:34,270
And why I'd do
such a thing if it was true.

810
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,065
You should've been curious about that.

811
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:42,988
People I don't need to explain myself to
keep asking questions.

812
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:47,158
But people I want to talk to
won't even hear me out.

813
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:49,369
No one will ask me anything.

814
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:53,248
Do you admit
that you've been abusing Bang?

815
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:56,126
-No, I never did that.
-Why did you do it?

816
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:58,545
You're mistaken. I never did such a thing.

817
00:54:58,628 --> 00:54:59,713
Is this news article true?

818
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,715
Is it true?
Did you really abuse your power?

819
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,091
Is this true?

820
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:04,926
Mom.

821
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:06,720
Look, I just…

822
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:09,055
Let me explain what happened.

823
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:09,973
Hang these.

824
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,767
-What?
-Hang them out to dry.

825
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:17,022
By the way, Mom--

826
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:20,233
What else do you want to know?

827
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:24,195
Is there anything else you want to ask me?

828
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:26,489
No.

829
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,575
It's not true.

830
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,201
I really didn't do it!

831
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:33,163
What they say on the news isn't true.

832
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:36,750
I didn't do it. I'm really innocent!

833
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:38,960
So why won't you ask me?

834
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:42,005
Why aren't you asking me anything?

835
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:46,384
I'm innocent. I didn't do it!

836
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:05,862
Are you okay?

837
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:10,617
Are you sure?

838
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:14,621
Are you certain
that our daughter is innocent?

839
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:16,331
Of course.

840
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:19,876
She just had an argument
because of her ex-boyfriend.

841
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:25,715
You should've just asked her
instead of worrying about it.

842
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:28,802
I was too afraid to ask.

843
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,223
What if she admitted to really doing it?

844
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:35,391
You're her mother.

845
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:37,185
You know her.

846
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:41,564
She's been away for 18 years,
so how would I know?

847
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:47,403
I shouldn't have let her go
to the mainland.

848
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:00,208
I'm innocent!

849
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,878
So why won't you ask me anything?

850
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:06,756
Why won't any of you ask me?

851
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:10,218
I'm innocent. I didn't do it!

852
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:12,720
I'm really innocent.

853
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:14,556
Why won't you ask me?

854
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:16,599
Why won't anyone ask me?

855
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,935
I'm truly innocent.

856
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:23,398
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

857
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:29,195
Don't worry. I'm having some right now.

858
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:32,782
-Jeez, that smell!
-Man, it stinks!

859
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:35,243
Look at all the cup noodles.
What are you up to?

860
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:38,329
-Lock your door, will you? Seriously.
-Why are the lights off?

861
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,123
Cup noodles again? Give me a bite.

862
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:41,249
-Don't eat that.
-Hey!

863
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:43,376
Don't eat that. I'm making seaweed soup.

864
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,502
What are you doing here?

865
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:46,296
What do you think? We came to eat.

866
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:48,673
Check this out. Jeju mackerel.

867
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:51,801
-That's really expensive!
-So I could only buy one.

868
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:54,053
Why is it so expensive?
It's cheap in Jeju.

869
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,639
We should've bought one more.
This isn't enough.

870
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,057
-Eun-u!
-Don't eat this.

871
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,767
-What?
-What's wrong?

872
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:04,689
I think this will last you
until your next birthday.

873
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:06,441
How much seaweed did you put in?

874
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:08,776
-All of it.
-Don't you know seaweed?

875
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,446
You can't put in
the whole pack like ramyeon.

876
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:14,282
-It's my first time cooking it!
-It's steamed seaweed.

877
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,409
Take it easy, guys.

878
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:19,120
The seaweed will feel bad.

879
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,332
-Hey, you spat on me.
-Sorry.

880
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:23,791
-Disgusting.
-The ramyeon…

881
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,210
-Just eat a lot.
-Let's try it.

882
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:28,671
-Happy birthday, dear Cha Eun-u
-Happy birthday, dear Cha Eun-u

883
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:31,216
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

884
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:32,967
Blow them out!

885
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,556
By the way, did you get any presents?

886
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,891
No.

887
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:41,518
-Really?
-What is it?

888
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:42,769
-What?
-What did you get?

889
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:45,355
What? No way!
Did you really get him something?

890
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:47,815
-What's that?
-What's gotten into you?

891
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,446
You idiot.

892
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:54,447
It's for you.

893
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:55,573
-Jeez.
-You ass.

894
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:57,200
He definitely stole this too.

895
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:58,743
This is illegal, you bastard.

896
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:01,204
Where did you steal this from?
Was it Korail?

897
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:03,831
I didn't steal it.
This was so hard to find.

898
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:07,502
All the other rolls were used up.
It's hard to find one that's this big.

899
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:10,547
I'm broke. I can't buy this.
Are you nuts? Hope you like it.

900
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:13,258
Man, this will hurt my butt.

901
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:16,052
-Damn it.
-Eun-u, please. Don't be disgusting.

902
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:17,637
-He has sensitive skin.
-Damn it!

903
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,514
That's gross. Don't say that.

904
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:22,976
Who's that?

905
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,728
-Are you expecting someone?
-No, I'm not.

906
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,021
Open it.

907
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:30,358
-Check this out.
-Holy cow, Sang-do!

908
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:31,484
How many are there?

909
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,903
To the poor hillbilly living in Seoul.

910
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:35,071
These are all for you.

911
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:36,281
-Right.
-Happy birthday.

912
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:37,365
Hey, Sang-do!

913
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:38,992
-Thanks!
-Sang-do!

914
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:40,827
-We got the fish!
-How are you doing?

915
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,453
How many did you send?

916
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,289
-How are you doing?
-What about abalone?

917
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:45,873
Jeju has a variety of seafood.

918
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,083
How are you, Sang-do?

919
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:49,335
How's working
with the night view of Seoul?

920
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,838
Don't mention night views.
It makes me puke.

921
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,340
Don't mention that.
My customer puked and I cleaned it.

922
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,551
Don't mention customers.
I didn't find a job yet.

923
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:57,844
Don't mention jobs.

924
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:00,221
I'm sick of my part-time job.
Hey, Sang-do.

925
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:02,974
Should I just go back
to Jeju tomorrow? It sucks here.

926
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:04,767
Are you bragging right now?

927
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:05,935
How is this bragging?

928
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:08,563
Living in Seoul is unbearable.

929
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:10,982
It may be hard for them,
but I love it here.

930
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:13,318
-You have my address, right?
-Be quiet.

931
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,986
Sang-do, you should come too!

932
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:16,195
Hurry on up!

933
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,197
-Let's hang out!
-Thanks for the fish!

934
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,145
Don't follow me, you jerks.

935
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:51,522
-Do you remember what happened last night?
-No.

936
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:53,524
-Tell them yourself.
-Where are we going?

937
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:56,402
-Mom.
-That girl named Bang Eun-ju…

938
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,613
-What?
-Mom!

939
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:01,282
Didn't it seem obvious
you shouldn't answer it?

940
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:02,325
-Excuse me.
-What the…

941
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:04,452
-Why is he even your boyfriend?
-What?

942
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:07,080
A project came in from Magazine X.

943
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:09,415
This must be
about something else. What is it?

944
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:11,125
I dumped you eight years ago?

945
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:13,461
-Go home. Hurry.
-You're the one who dumped me.

946
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:14,962
It doesn't matter.

947
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,005
Damn it.

948
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:17,548
This has turned into a mess.

949
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,012
