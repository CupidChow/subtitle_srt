1
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:40,999
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

2
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,045
Are you ready?

3
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:46,796
Gyeong-tae.

4
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,299
You better not chicken out
and not jump again.

5
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:52,552
You should be able to fly
if you want to become a hero.

6
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:55,638
She's right.
After all, we're the Power Rangers.

7
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,475
Now, it's really time to go.

8
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,518
Yong-pil, turn on the music.

9
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,527
What about the music?

10
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,197
Right, I'll turn it on.

11
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,869
Here we go! Let's go!

12
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:03,850
EPISODE 5

13
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:15,653
You're wrong.

14
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,363
He's not my boyfriend.

15
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,991
Yes, I lied. So what?

16
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,952
Why did you lie to me?

17
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,539
Because I was embarrassed. Why else?

18
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,334
I was embarrassed, okay?

19
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:33,171
I should've met a guy
who was much better than you.

20
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,717
But I met a loser and ended up back here.

21
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,469
So I lied.

22
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,685
Happy? Does that make you feel better?

23
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,817
Hey, wait.

24
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:03,159
Why are you glaring
at me like that? It's scary.

25
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,621
You can't just walk away like that.

26
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,915
You haven't changed one bit.

27
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:12,627
What, should I shake your hand then?
What do you want me to do?

28
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,087
What I mean is…

29
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,261
I thought it over on my way here.

30
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,263
But there's something

31
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,015
I just don't understand.

32
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,475
What is it?

33
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,852
Why are you embarrassed?

34
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,605
What?

35
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,650
And who cares how you look?

36
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,445
Are you making fun of me?

37
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,823
No, I'm just stating the facts.

38
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,368
You're not the one who cheated.

39
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:49,372
And that guy, Chung-gi or whatever.
You didn't know he was a scumbag.

40
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,456
Those ass…

41
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:57,088
It was those scumbags
who cheated and betrayed you.

42
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,008
What I'm saying is,

43
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,427
you're the victim here.

44
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:07,390
So you shouldn't be ashamed.
The victim shouldn't be embarrassed.

45
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,267
You were wronged.

46
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:13,146
They should be embarrassed, not you.

47
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,234
I didn't mean
I was embarrassed in front of others.

48
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,906
Forget it.

49
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,159
What is it? Say what's on your mind.

50
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,994
Let me ask you something.

51
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,540
Why do you care
if I continue dating the cheater

52
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,667
or can't get over him?

53
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:45,845
I'm your friend.

54
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,516
Or I guess…

55
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,852
I'm someone…

56
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,856
who knows you better than that.

57
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,319
Whatever.

58
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:03,696
Damn it.

59
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,867
I'm your ex!

60
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,253
I'm…

61
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,173
your ex-boyfriend.

62
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:31,390
Exactly.

63
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,976
That's why it's embarrassing.

64
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,034
God.

65
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,411
What did I…

66
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,123
Damn it.

67
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,127
You idiot.

68
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:15,184
I'm home.

69
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,894
What happened to you?

70
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,690
Well…

71
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,066
Why did you--

72
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,193
We just fought as friends.

73
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,696
I know the whole town
is going to talk about us.

74
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,699
But there's nothing going on.
It didn't mean anything.

75
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,909
You fought? With who?

76
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:36,664
Don't you reek?

77
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,292
I do.

78
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,669
Soak your clothes in water
so l can hand-wash them.

79
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,547
Okay.

80
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,195
MEDICINE

81
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,478
Jeez.

82
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,104
I knew it.

83
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,899
I told you not to tell them
about studying abroad yet.

84
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,693
You had time during the break.
You could've told them then.

85
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,739
I'm the top student in my major.

86
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:54,158
So why am I the only one
who can't go abroad?

87
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,411
Just you wait and see.
I'll make my own money and go.

88
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,455
All right. I know you will.

89
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,916
Let's put some ointment on. Here.

90
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,962
How could she throw
her spoon at me when I was talking?

91
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,131
Because you guys were having a meal.

92
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,342
Come on. You know how she can be.

93
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,219
Come here. I'll apply it for you.

94
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:16,180
-I'm so annoyed.
-Come here.

95
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,643
-That hurts!
-Sorry.

96
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,273
Your mom's got a good aim.

97
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,027
Smile. Come on, now.

98
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,321
You're so pretty
when you smile. Don't scowl.

99
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:12,695
Why did I have to call myself
her ex at that moment?

100
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:22,913
I mean, she wants to forgive her boyfriend
for cheating, and I can't say anything?

101
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,499
Even a complete stranger
would dissuade her.

102
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:31,297
I mean, we're at least closer
than strangers.

103
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,091
Can't I worry…

104
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,718
Darn it.

105
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:14,024
Hey. Are you happy
your boyfriend is good to you?

106
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,318
How well does he treat you?
And not a loser?

107
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,028
And who cares how you look?

108
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,613
I'm your ex!

109
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:27,955
Crazy fool.

110
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:29,498
Lunatic.

111
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:31,709
Get out.

112
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,884
We told you to stay away from him,
and you end up having a seaweed fight?

113
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,470
What are you going to do now?

114
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:45,473
I bet everyone talked about you two
over dinner last night.

115
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,766
Yes, and they'll do so for another month.

116
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,728
I heard Yong-pil found out
that you lied too.

117
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,189
Leave me alone! Damn it!

118
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,900
Why did you even lie in the first place?

119
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,109
Do you still like him?

120
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,654
Are you crazy?

121
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:04,909
What? You don't, right? So what was
so embarrassing that you had to lie?

122
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,703
Hey, even if she forgot
or doesn't like him, it's embarrassing.

123
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:11,790
Even if she ran into a guy
she barely remembered dating,

124
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,168
if he knew her current situation,
she'd be mortified.

125
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:17,004
"I'm so embarrassed! My damn life!"

126
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,465
Are you enjoying this?

127
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,342
-You little--
-Get out.

128
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,760
-Get out!
-I'm going!

129
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:25,513
-I'm leaving!
-Get out!

130
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:29,683
I'm leaving! I was worried about her.
Okay? Weren't you too?

131
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,143
-Let her be.
-We were worried.

132
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,436
Jeez, that brat.

133
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,437
Sam-dal!

134
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,649
As long as you're in town,
don't you dare leave the house!

135
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:38,943
You'll embarrass yourself.

136
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:42,905
What's that?

137
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,954
Mom, why do you have this?

138
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,040
Are you a traffic cop too?

139
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,920
Leave.

140
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,259
Me?

141
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,513
And go where?

142
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,549
What in the world's wrong with him?

143
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,285
SAMDAL-RI GALLERY

144
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,211
What is he doing here?

145
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,896
Some refreshing mulhoe for you today.

146
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,816
Delivery from a popular restaurant
that people line up all day for?

147
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,068
We're so grateful.

148
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,445
If the people in town can't have our food,

149
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,490
there's no point in being popular. Enjoy.

150
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:54,286
Oh, right. You should eat it quickly.
It'll melt soon.

151
00:15:56,664 --> 00:16:00,042
Right, the mulhoe shouldn't melt.

152
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,503
He's even kind to the dish.

153
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:06,966
He has a great body, he's good-looking,
he has character, and he's rich.

154
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,842
He's too good to be true.

155
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,179
I wish he'd worry
about my heart melting instead.

156
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:37,663
THE STORY OF THE TWO MI-JAS,
THE TWO HAENYEOS, THE TWO WOMEN

157
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,344
What are you doing in this sacred gallery?

158
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,680
You look a bit too comfortable.

159
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,727
-Did you pay the entrance fee?
-No, and they shouldn't charge me.

160
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,522
They're displaying my mom's photo,
and it's in the main area, no less.

161
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,274
Let's be honest.

162
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,984
Before I ask them for royalties,

163
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:10,696
I should be treated as a VIP for life.

164
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:11,864
What are you talking about?

165
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:17,119
I say it every time I see this,
but your mom and Ms. Ko were so beautiful.

166
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,329
Of course. And I take after them.

167
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,623
It's a well-known fact
that they were beautiful.

168
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,294
It looks like a shot of two people, right?

169
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:27,921
But look closely.

170
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:31,133
Look.

171
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,968
There are four in the shot.

172
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,055
Sam-dal and I were in their wombs.

173
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,849
So although you can't see me,

174
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:41,894
I can grant publicity rights
to that picture too.

175
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,896
That's what I'm saying.

176
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:47,191
But you're not visible.
Are you really a college graduate?

177
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,358
You're right.

178
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,862
You're slightly smarter than me
even though you didn't go to college.

179
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:56,158
I was always smarter than you.
I just didn't have the money for college.

180
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,787
You're rich now,
so imagine if you'd went to college too.

181
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,539
By the way,

182
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,834
isn't it incredible

183
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:10,214
how those two 27-year-olds
dove in the sea while pregnant?

184
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,276
What happened yesterday?

185
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,654
What do you mean?

186
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,198
I heard you and Sam-dal fought.

187
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,783
Everyone's talking about it.

188
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,329
It wasn't anything serious.

189
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,622
We've always bickered

190
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,833
ever since we were little.

191
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,335
But things have changed.

192
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,798
Isn't it uncomfortable seeing her?

193
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,677
Should I be?

194
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,014
No.

195
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,227
Nothing's changed,
and I'm not uncomfortable.

196
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,064
Well, that's a relief.

197
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:10,649
What was that?

198
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,403
You sure you were worried about me?

199
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,823
Whatever. See you.

200
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:37,968
What is it?

201
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,888
It was in front of the door.
It's obviously for you.

202
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:44,016
In this house, you're the only one
with a bump on her head.

203
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:57,905
MEDICINE

204
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,450
Why two?

205
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,837
Ms. Cho, this reporter
went through your social media

206
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,005
and wrote another article.

207
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,840
He's the worst.

208
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,593
OLD PHOTOS OF CHO EUN-HYE!
APPEARS DRIVEN, SECRETLY A BULLY

209
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,222
I'm so sick of this.

210
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,225
You even dug through my social media?

211
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,602
REPORTER AN KANG-HYUN

212
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,565
DISLIKE

213
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:34,858
I dislike it.

214
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,485
Damn it.

215
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,121
Are you sure you heard them right?

216
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:51,208
I don't eat three meals a day for nothing.

217
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,877
While the two were cleaning up,

218
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:57,673
Sam-dal says Yong-pil dumped her,
and he says she dumped him.

219
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,216
They kept arguing about it.

220
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,551
It was such a mess.

221
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:04,096
So? Who dumped who?

222
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,514
Beats me.

223
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:09,184
How would I know something
that even they can't remember?

224
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:13,522
Are you saying Sam-dal might've been
dumped by Yong-pil before going abroad,

225
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,524
and not the other way around?

226
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,441
Exactly.

227
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,779
Does that mean
Yong-pil has been lying all along

228
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,365
about how he was dumped?

229
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,324
Goodness!

230
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:28,912
-He never actually said he was dumped.
-You're right.

231
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,623
Well, he didn't have to say it.

232
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,584
It was written all over his face.

233
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,254
You know, like the male lead
of a tragic love story.

234
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:41,550
If he was just pretending,
then he deserves an acting award.

235
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,636
That was some top-notch acting.

236
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:48,015
-You're right.
-So who dumped who?

237
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:56,023
You're having so much fun gossiping
about a couple who broke up years ago.

238
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,191
Why are you so curious about them?

239
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,776
I mean,

240
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,906
their love story is more interesting
than anyone else's we've heard.

241
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,492
They were born on the same day.

242
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,328
The kids fought like cats and dogs.

243
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,830
Then, they fell head over heels in love.

244
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,875
Then, they broke up,
and one of them was completely dejected.

245
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,794
They virtually turned
Samdal-ri upside down.

246
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,422
They weren't the ones who did that.

247
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,799
Blame it on your gossiping tongues.

248
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:24,843
Is that so?

249
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:30,265
We just thought
Sam-dal chose her career over love

250
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:32,893
and abandoned that poor boy.

251
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:35,771
If that's not the case,
then we want to support her.

252
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:36,855
-Right.
-Yeah.

253
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:40,942
Do you know who dumped who?

254
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:44,488
No, before that,
why did they break up in the first place?

255
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,615
Yes, why did they?

256
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,575
Don't ask me.

257
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:49,951
That's enough!

258
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,745
It was a long time ago.

259
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,789
Let's go clean the seabed.

260
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:54,748
-Okay.
-Okay.

261
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,041
Gosh, Ms. Ko.

262
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,417
Wait for us!

263
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,380
She doesn't know,
but why did she get all worked up?

264
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:03,757
I knew she would.

265
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,927
I'm dying of curiosity.

266
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:09,846
I'm so curious.

267
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,932
Be careful down there.

268
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,975
-Will do!
-Okay!

269
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,401
Why is it so quiet on that side?

270
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,613
Aren't Namdal-ri's haenyeos
supposed to clean their seabed too?

271
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:31,535
They're so busy
with that theme park or whatever.

272
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:34,371
They haven't been able to
catch much in the water

273
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:37,707
ever since that power plant
was built in the ocean.

274
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,585
So they're trying
to make a living by selling land.

275
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,797
It won't be easy
to switch occupations like that.

276
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,384
Those people from Namdal-ri
are obnoxious, so who cares?

277
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,468
Not me!

278
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,719
Me neither.

279
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,179
Let's go!

280
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:02,149
AS THEME PARK CONSTRUCTION CONFIRMED

281
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,624
There he is.

282
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:20,834
Take his photo.

283
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,297
He's coming out.

284
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,423
Move aside.

285
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:27,799
Move.

286
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,050
Hello, President Jeon.

287
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:33,096
Goodness. Thank you for coming
to such a humble place, sir!

288
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,514
-It's my pleasure.
-Thank you!

289
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:39,394
And now, the company
that opens up the future! AS Group!

290
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,065
-Give it to him.
-Ok.

291
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,609
Thank you.

292
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:47,360
Thank you very much.

293
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:53,074
Our theme park is going to be built here.
Of course, I had to visit.

294
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:53,992
Goodness.

295
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,245
Thank you so much for your warm welcome.

296
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,830
Now, as they say,

297
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:03,001
"The exceptionally beautiful Namdal-ri."

298
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,545
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

299
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,134
Sir, this way.

300
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,385
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

301
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,263
-Watch your step, sir.
-Thank you.

302
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,027
All right. Now that the president
of AS has arrived,

303
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,154
we will begin

304
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:36,660
the signing ceremony for the establishment
of AS Theme Park in Namdal-ri!

305
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,164
All right. Everyone, please quiet down.

306
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,832
Before we begin,

307
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:48,463
we'll all make a toast
with the alcohol that we've prepared.

308
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:49,381
Bring it over.

309
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:50,298
All right.

310
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,217
Thank you. Mr. Jeon.

311
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:53,927
Have a drink, sir.

312
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,596
-Come on, now.
-All right.

313
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,734
All right, everyone. Are we ready?

314
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,695
When I say "Cheers," everyone follow suit.

315
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:12,946
Okay.

316
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:16,408
Cheers to the construction
of AS Theme Park!

317
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,910
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

318
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,042
Our village head is the best!

319
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,131
And to go with your drink,

320
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:36,011
we have red sea cucumber, a rare delicacy
our haenyeos caught themselves.

321
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,561
What is that?

322
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:45,979
Oh, my gosh!

323
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,147
What is that?

324
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:50,066
What in the world is it?

325
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,818
It's just sea cucumber.

326
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:52,777
But why…

327
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,281
This is a very rare delicacy…

328
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,534
That hurts!

329
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:00,618
What the…

330
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,661
Gosh!

331
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,204
-Hold on!
-Sir!

332
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,498
-Sir! Don't take photos!
-Secretary Ko!

333
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,292
Stop taking photos of him!

334
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,419
Stop it!

335
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,254
Come on!

336
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,766
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

337
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,686
I can't believe this.

338
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:29,397
Are you crazy, Mom?

339
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,274
I mean…

340
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:34,444
Why do I have to do this job?

341
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:38,323
They suddenly called me in to work.
We need to clean the seabed.

342
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:41,618
-You said you'd do anything I wanted.
-Yes, I did.

343
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,496
Except for meeting our neighbors.

344
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,457
So I guess I can't do this.

345
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,126
They're bound to see me
in the middle of the road.

346
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,295
They have eyes, you know.

347
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,133
Namdal-ri.

348
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,220
It's in Namdal-ri.

349
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,934
Why work part-time in another village?

350
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,269
How many jobs does she have?

351
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,687
Let that car through!

352
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,195
I'm so busy!
Why are you blocking the road?

353
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,991
I'm really busy too, you know!

354
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,835
JEON DAE-YEONG SCARED OF RED SEA CUCUMBER

355
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,839
Have they never seen
anyone fall over before?

356
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:38,425
Was this really worth writing about?

357
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,551
And this quickly too?

358
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:43,096
They were quick
to give you a nickname too.

359
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,140
"Clumsy Dae-yeong."

360
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,391
What?

361
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:47,559
"Clumsy Dae-yeong"?

362
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,690
I mean, do they think
we're close friends or something?

363
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:56,860
Why are they giving me a nickname?

364
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,781
Did they write anything
about the theme park?

365
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,450
Thanks to Clumsy Dae-yeong,

366
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,577
those articles were all buried.

367
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,245
Clumsy… Damn it.

368
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,124
Damn it! Clumsy…

369
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,711
My father is going to kill me.

370
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:18,673
FATHER

371
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,139
Stop the cars!

372
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,057
-Stop!
-Come on!

373
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,226
Look, you bastards.

374
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,520
I know you're stealing all our tax money.

375
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,899
Why the hell are you digging up
this narrow road when we're so busy?

376
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:39,235
Probably because it's narrow
to begin with. Think about it, will you?

377
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:42,113
What did you just say?

378
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,115
Don't give me that attitude, old lady!

379
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,659
You're the one who gave me attitude first.

380
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:51,790
Also, my mom is the only person
who can call me a bastard, you bastard.

381
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,083
I don't believe… "Bastard"?

382
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,293
"Bastard"?

383
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:56,294
You crazy…

384
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:58,671
Have you lost your mind, you crazy bitch?

385
00:29:58,755 --> 00:29:59,631
What?

386
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,050
"Crazy bitch"?

387
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:07,931
This annoying little jerk.
How dare you swear at me?

388
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:11,434
I just wanted to live in peace. You think
you're the only one who can swear?

389
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:16,439
How dare you pick a fight
with me, you ugly bastard?

390
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,107
Don't make me teach you a lesson!

391
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,859
I'll gouge your eyes out and juggle them

392
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,695
and pull out your tongue
and turn it into a red carpet,

393
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,949
you despicable son of a gun!

394
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:27,200
Are you insane?

395
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:29,035
-Just go.
-Why?

396
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,245
You.

397
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:35,208
I'll turn you into dust and let the wind
take you, you little jerk!

398
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,001
-Just go already!
-Why?

399
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,380
That's Cho Jin-dal from the Rosebay Gang!

400
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:41,631
-Rosebay Gang?
-Please!

401
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:42,966
-What?
-Damn it.

402
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:46,177
I'm running into all sorts
of obnoxious idiots today.

403
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:47,720
Why…

404
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:51,099
What are you staring at, you moron?

405
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,476
Get out. I said get out, you son of a…

406
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,853
Get out of the car.

407
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,187
-Just go!
-Fine!

408
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,857
-What the hell's wrong with both of you?
-I said get out!

409
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,233
Get out of the car now!

410
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,776
-You're dead meat.
-Move!

411
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,027
Hey, stop the car.

412
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,362
Stop it!

413
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,405
Stop the car!

414
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,657
Where are you going? Hey! Stop the car.

415
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,575
Get out!

416
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:09,617
Didn't you hear me?

417
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,120
Stop right there!

418
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,914
Stop right there, you bastard!

419
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:36,060
Stop, you bastard!

420
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,063
What did you say?

421
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,525
My mom's side dishes reek?

422
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,862
Aren't you too old to be picky about food?

423
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:48,281
You bastard!

424
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:04,464
Stop right there, you bastard!

425
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:22,607
Isn't it too early to be drinking?

426
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,566
Where are you?

427
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:26,903
At the breakwater.

428
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:33,034
Buy a ton of alcohol.
I need to be passed out for a few days.

429
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,703
What's with you?

430
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,581
You can just drink at home.
Why are you there?

431
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:41,084
I might run into him
on the way. It's dangerous.

432
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:45,171
But why is he here in the first place?

433
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:51,344
But seriously, why is he here?

434
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,012
I have no clue.

435
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,893
What is she talking about?
Why is who here?

436
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,187
Jeez.

437
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:05,858
What?

438
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:07,819
Why…

439
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,571
What's that car doing here?

440
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,490
God, that's a Lambo…

441
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,868
What's this car doing in this town?

442
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,579
Why is the owner here in the boondocks?

443
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:25,586
You?

444
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,713
Hey, Sam-dal.

445
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,132
Hey!

446
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,133
Get out!

447
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,217
Get out of there!

448
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:36,723
Why are you messing
with this expensive car?

449
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,558
This?

450
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,226
-It's--
-Do you know how much it costs?

451
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,853
What if the owner saw you?

452
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:44,188
If something happens,
you'd be in big trouble.

453
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:47,150
You should just appreciate it
from a distance. Okay?

454
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,444
I'm not allowed to touch it?

455
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,862
You'll be in huge trouble.

456
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,781
-Why? Let me touch it.
-Hey!

457
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,617
You must not know
since you've never seen one before.

458
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,495
But this model is rare even in Cheongdam.

459
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,707
You should know better
than to touch it. You're not a child.

460
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,209
-Hey.
-Yeah?

461
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,461
What are you doing?

462
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,503
Back up, okay?

463
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,256
Is this car really that rare?

464
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,426
It's more than just rare.

465
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,595
Goodness.

466
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:19,849
I wonder if I'll ever be able
to ride in one of these.

467
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,434
Oh, really?

468
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,145
Take it for a spin, then.

469
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:28,274
Are you teasing me right now?

470
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,817
I'm serious.

471
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,571
Let's cross it off your bucket list.

472
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,076
What?

473
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,579
It's yours?

474
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,292
No…

475
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,461
No way!

476
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,808
Keep going!

477
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:06,687
Hey, that's dangerous! Sit down properly!

478
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:11,776
I heard your restaurant was a success.
This is insane, Sang-do!

479
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,486
Are you the same kid

480
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,822
who didn't even have
enough money to buy milk?

481
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,240
This is incredible!

482
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:19,951
Did you think I'd be poor forever?

483
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:23,663
Hey, don't forget.
I've always treated you well. Right?

484
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:24,872
I probably did, right?

485
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,583
You did. You always gave your milk to me.

486
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:31,712
Right? You better not forget
how well I took care of you!

487
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,840
But you always gave me the regular milk.

488
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,299
I liked chocolate milk more.

489
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:38,302
Hey, regular milk is healthier for you.

490
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,762
Whatever. This is amazing!

491
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,222
Step on it, Sang-do!

492
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:45,184
It feels like I'm flying away!

493
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:50,606
I posted it.

494
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:54,819
It was because the wind
was so strong. I said I posted it.

495
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,238
I'm heading to Seoul now.

496
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,367
Damn it.

497
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:04,537
Who cares what AS is up to?

498
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,581
This is so annoying.

499
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:09,625
You mean that photographer
who's been all over the news?

500
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:13,963
Yeah. That thing about bullying.
It's a mess right now.

501
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:16,924
She's the second daughter
of Samdal-ri's haenyeo leader.

502
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:20,052
Really? I heard all three
of her daughters were back.

503
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:23,556
They must've fled here
after causing trouble on the mainland.

504
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,057
You're right.

505
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,612
Yeah!

506
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:48,497
Jeez, who knew my friend
would ever drive a car like this?

507
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,875
It still feels so surreal, Sang-do!

508
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,835
But why did you come here and not home?

509
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,464
Jin-dal told me
to buy some drinks for her.

510
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,175
Jin-dal? Why is she here?

511
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:01,135
Beats me. She's insane.

512
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,137
Come on. She can't be worse than you.

513
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:08,976
Hey! I'm still the most normal one
out of the three of us.

514
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,437
How could you compare me to Jin-dal--

515
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,482
You little…

516
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:15,691
Hello, Jin-dal.

517
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:16,609
Hey.

518
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:19,820
Sang-do.

519
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,076
-So this was your car?
-Yes.

520
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,453
-I see. Give me a ride.
-Sorry?

521
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:28,537
Careful!

522
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,416
What are you doing?
You told me to buy drinks.

523
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,710
Yes, and you took your sweet time.

524
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,421
Go over there and clean everything up.

525
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,051
-What are you doing? Let's go.
-What?

526
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:44,095
By the way, can we put the top down?

527
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,180
What? Oh, would you like me to close it?

528
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,016
No, don't bother. Let's just go.

529
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,143
What should I do?

530
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:58,192
Why are you putting that over your head?

531
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,069
Leave me alone.

532
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,029
What…

533
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:04,949
What are you…

534
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,742
Okay. Bye, Sang-do.

535
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:17,461
What's up with her? She's lost her mind.

536
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,716
She drank all of this by herself?

537
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,428
What a lunatic.

538
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:45,364
Why does it have to be so pretty?

539
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:17,063
You don't have a single care
in the world, do you?

540
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,818
But then again,

541
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:26,739
you'd be insane
not to crave alcohol with this view.

542
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,784
But it's also insane to drink this much.

543
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,911
What do you want?

544
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:34,121
I already told you yesterday.

545
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,333
-I'm your ex--
-How did you know I was here?

546
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,751
Actually, it's so strange.

547
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,419
You somehow find me every time.

548
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,298
There's nothing strange about it.

549
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,467
How do you think I knew?

550
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,261
I was driving along the road
and spotted you.

551
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,346
That's how I found you.

552
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:54,433
Did you think I was stalking you?

553
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,519
In that case,

554
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,396
everyone here is a stalker.

555
00:39:58,479 --> 00:39:59,855
This neighborhood's so small

556
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:02,483
that we run into each other
dozens of times a day.

557
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,693
I guess you're right.

558
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,493
By the way…

559
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,581
when you said

560
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,252
that you were embarrassed, did you mean…

561
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,341
in front of me?

562
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:36,308
I should give you an award
for finally getting it.

563
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,770
Just go already.

564
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,606
You want me to leave?

565
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:44,817
But I just got here.

566
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:46,777
No, I'm staying.

567
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,032
You know what?

568
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,537
You shouldn't be embarrassed
in front of me.

569
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:01,959
Think about it.

570
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:05,671
When was the great Cho Sam-dal
ever embarrassed in front of me?

571
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:10,634
You didn't care about anything.
You always did whatever you wanted to.

572
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,013
You can continue
being that person with me.

573
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,432
You can do what you like.

574
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:22,229
Do you know me, Yong-pil?

575
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,314
I do.

576
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,400
Do you think you know everything about me?

577
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,195
I've known you for 30 years.

578
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,821
No one knows you better.

579
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,281
What was I like at 30?

580
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:34,200
Who did I date at 31?

581
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,285
What went through my mind at 32?

582
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:38,579
Do you know?

583
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,332
Well…

584
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:43,792
In eight years,
I've had four different boyfriends,

585
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,127
and my salary's risen tenfold.

586
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:48,464
Guess what happens when you gain
more dating experience and money.

587
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:53,344
You change.

588
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,387
People change.

589
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,516
It's not like me to pretend to be okay?

590
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,976
No, that's also a part
of who I am. So just…

591
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:06,524
Stop acting like you know
everything about me.

592
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:33,592
Damn it.

593
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,100
Why did I…

594
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:42,768
Damn it.

595
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:49,817
Are you home, Yong-pil?

596
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:55,656
Hey.

597
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:57,449
What's wrong?

598
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:00,828
-Did you have dinner?
-Yes.

599
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,080
Okay.

600
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:39,867
"Ko Mi-ja."

601
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:42,494
"Cho Pan-sik."

602
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:44,455
"Cho Pan-sik."

603
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,627
I guess this must be Cho Eun-hye's house.

604
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,019
Goodness.

605
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,605
-What do you think you're doing?
-Ms. Cho.

606
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:14,777
-Ms. Cho--
-Hey. What are you doing here?

607
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,362
Ms. Cho!

608
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,323
Who are you?

609
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:20,908
Ms. Cho!

610
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:23,619
I'm An Kang-hyun from Index Daily.

611
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:26,955
I came all the way here,
so how about doing an interview?

612
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,124
She's not doing any interviews!

613
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,292
Reporters can't do this.

614
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:33,420
You can't barge like this
to someone's house and take photos.

615
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,338
Give me the photos.

616
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,382
-What's your problem?
-Delete them.

617
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:37,591
Hey, Yong-pil.

618
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,387
Who are you? A reporter?

619
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,138
Who told you to come here?

620
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,099
Who are you? Cho Eun-hye's friends?

621
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,350
Answer my question.

622
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:48,894
Give me your camera now.
Delete the photos.

623
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:51,563
Goodness. At this rate,
you might hit a reporter.

624
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:58,946
I'll come back another time.

625
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,117
He's coming back?

626
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,911
-Stop right there, you bastard!
-Hey.

627
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:07,996
-Calm down.
-What an asshole.

628
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,249
So what if he's a reporter?

629
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:11,875
You bastard!

630
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,713
I have a big scoop.
I'll tell you about it later.

631
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,717
He's not from around here.

632
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,261
There's something about him.

633
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:24,805
I already posted that article
about AS Group.

634
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:28,058
Why do you keep telling me to cover them?

635
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,143
I'm hanging up.

636
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,062
-You must be a reporter.
-Jeez!

637
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,814
Gosh, I'm sorry.

638
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:37,401
You must be here
for that theme park in Namdal-ri.

639
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:38,777
-Yes.
-What's this?

640
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:41,572
-Wait--
-Must be the camera all reporters use.

641
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:44,032
It's really dark. There's so much dust--

642
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,909
Don't touch it. You're not supposed to.

643
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:46,994
Really?

644
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:51,915
Now we have reporters visiting
this countryside thanks to the theme park.

645
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,460
How nice.
I've never met a reporter before.

646
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:55,961
Right.

647
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:58,589
I knew you're from Seoul
as soon as I saw you.

648
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,048
Hey, Cha Eun-u!

649
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:08,182
This is a reporter who came
to cover that theme park in Namdal-ri.

650
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,725
Come over here. Hurry.

651
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:13,270
What was that scumbag's name again?

652
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:14,771
An…

653
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:16,482
An…

654
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,693
An Kang-hyun?

655
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:21,862
An…

656
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,448
Let's see.

657
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,450
Is this right?

658
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:27,784
"Index Daily."

659
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:31,163
That's definitely him.

660
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:33,749
I'll be frank with you.

661
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:38,045
Samdal-ri is a much better place
to build a theme park than Namdal-ri.

662
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:42,508
The color of their water has changed
ever since they built that power plant.

663
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:47,638
Samdal-ri's water is the epitome
of Jeju's emerald-colored sea. Isn't it?

664
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:48,722
Absolutely.

665
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:50,682
It's much better to live here or visit

666
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:53,894
-since this area is less developed.
-Exactly.

667
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:55,479
Are you from here?

668
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:57,314
-Come on.
-Come on.

669
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:59,066
We were born and raised here.

670
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:02,194
I see. Then, you must know
everything about this place.

671
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:05,572
Of course, we do.

672
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,492
Ask us anything.
I'll make sure you have an answer.

673
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:09,535
I see.

674
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,578
-In that case…
-Yes?

675
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,082
You must know Cho Eun-hye well, right?

676
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:17,000
What?

677
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:21,964
The photographer who abused her power
and almost killed her mentee.

678
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:28,095
I went to her house earlier,
but her friends kicked me out.

679
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:32,849
Her mother's the leader
of the haenyeos. You know her, right?

680
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:36,603
Oh, her!

681
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,981
She's not here right now though.

682
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:40,691
She came back.

683
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:42,943
To Jeju.

684
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:46,363
I even took photos of her.
What are you talking about?

685
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:56,206
A reporter who's like a sly rat
is on the loose. Watch out.

686
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,544
See? It's Cho Eun-hye.

687
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:02,879
It's her.

688
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:04,423
Look.

689
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,475
So you're the sly rat.

690
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,478
-What?
-Damn you!

691
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:19,563
Hey!

692
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,189
Hey, Gyeong-tae!

693
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:24,151
How could you break his camera, you idiot?

694
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:27,154
Don't step on that, Cha Eun-u!

695
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:29,948
Damn it.

696
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,284
How did he know I was here?

697
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,453
Damn it.

698
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,371
Ms. Ko!

699
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:38,957
Ms. Ko.

700
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:41,710
-Hello.
-So Sam-dal was here.

701
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:42,836
What's wrong?

702
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:44,963
Is something going on?

703
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,048
Well…

704
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,635
Sam-dal, you better stay put.

705
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:52,012
A reporter
who was covering news in Namdal-ri

706
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:54,222
got into a fight
with Gyeong-tae and Eun-u.

707
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,016
They're at the Samdal police substation.

708
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,017
What?

709
00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:00,812
He'll pester you
for an interview if he sees you.

710
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:02,814
Hold on.

711
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:06,568
Why are you here?
Shouldn't you be at the substation now?

712
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:09,488
Why would I?
It would only be humiliating for me.

713
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:14,034
Still, there must've been a reason
why Gyeong-tae got into a fight.

714
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:16,787
Come on, you know him.

715
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,873
He doesn't need a reason
to behave the way he does.

716
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:24,336
Do you understand? Stay home, all right?

717
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:35,055
SAMDAL POLICE SUBSTATION

718
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,349
They're absolute lunatics!

719
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:39,976
Sir, please calm down
and explain what happened.

720
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,646
What more do I need to explain?

721
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:47,025
He suddenly called me a sly rat
and destroyed my camera!

722
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,402
Why would I destroy it?

723
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,404
It just slipped out of my hand.

724
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:53,073
I guess I didn't wash
all the soap off this morning.

725
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:55,784
I'm going to sue you.
I'm calling my lawyer.

726
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:57,536
Be my guest. I'm not scared at all.

727
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:58,578
-Hey, Eun-u.
-Yeah?

728
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,205
-Call our lawyer too.
-Got it.

729
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:04,918
But who?

730
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:09,089
Did you forget? We know someone
who works for the government.

731
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,382
You're dead meat, buddy.

732
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,467
JEJU REGIONAL OFFICE OF METEOROLOGY

733
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:19,933
Not all civil servants
are government authorities. Come on.

734
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,436
They're not the same thing?

735
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,479
Government authority?

736
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:27,190
Tell me. How are you
going to exert that authority?

737
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:28,525
Spoil tomorrow's weather?

738
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,193
I'm not telling you, you little…

739
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,862
-That's the rat, right?
-Yeah.

740
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:32,988
We got him.

741
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:35,949
This is an expensive camera.

742
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:38,285
You'll really be sued
if you don't compensate him.

743
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:41,163
We'll just compensate him then.
That should do it, right?

744
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:45,292
Well, yes. As long as it wasn't
intentional and you compensate him.

745
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,918
Okay. I got it.

746
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:49,504
Hey, how much did this cost?

747
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:53,008
Tell me how much. I'll pay you back.

748
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,260
Why won't you answer me?

749
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:57,679
I'll give you the money. How much was it?

750
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:58,889
Cat got your tongue?

751
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:00,599
How much was this?

752
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:02,225
Eight million won.

753
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:04,978
Eight million won?

754
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:06,646
Not 800,000 won?

755
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,566
Nope. Eight million won.

756
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:13,278
Eight million won?

757
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,323
Only eight million? Was it secondhand?

758
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:18,784
-Hey.
-Yeah?

759
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:21,369
Fix it. I don't have any money.

760
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:22,579
-Fix it.
-You don't?

761
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:23,747
No. Fix it.

762
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:27,542
Here's your 40,000 won.

763
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:30,170
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

764
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:36,176
Hello.

765
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:42,599
Why would they get into a fight
with a reporter?

766
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:46,269
Damn it. They're definitely
going say something stupid.

767
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:50,315
These boys are going to be
the death of me.

768
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:57,614
Damn it.

769
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:01,368
It worked.

770
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,828
Put this in first.

771
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,871
It's not supposed to go there.

772
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,790
-This is embarrassing. Be quiet.
-Inside…

773
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:07,791
Hey.

774
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,126
You don't have any money, do you?

775
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,963
I know you don't. You look poor.

776
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:16,091
-You little…
-Birds of a feather flock together.

777
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:18,218
-We do have money.
-Are you crazy?

778
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:21,179
-I didn't get my paycheck yet.
-Then, pay for it! Get the money!

779
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:25,767
Here he is.

780
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,352
You're dead meat.

781
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:29,020
What did you say? We look poor?

782
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,191
Who's that?

783
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:35,569
It's a sliding door.

784
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:36,653
-Hello.
-Hello.

785
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:38,989
-Hey, Sang-do.
-What's up, Sang-do?

786
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:41,700
What's that? You're trying
to settle this with some drinks?

787
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:47,539
Hey. Where's the money?

788
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:49,791
Why did you bring that?

789
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,626
No. Why don't you hand them out?

790
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,920
I guess that's how
you handle things in the country.

791
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:56,923
Man, you all are so uneducated. Seriously.

792
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,486
You see this?

793
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:19,613
We're not poor.

794
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:22,324
Why did you bring so much?
It's over eight million.

795
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:24,451
-This is what I made it this morning.
-Really?

796
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:27,037
All right. Here's your eight million.

797
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,997
We look poor? Take this money.

798
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,042
Take it and don't you dare
come back. Get lost.

799
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,085
Hold on. What's this?

800
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,171
This morning…

801
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:38,423
Are you in on this too?

802
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,593
I finally get it now.

803
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:44,137
You're Cho Eun-hye's friends?

804
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,434
This is Sang-do's.

805
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:51,561
Is he here too?

806
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:55,190
That's right! We're Eun-hye's friends!

807
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:56,483
-Oh, no.
-So what?

808
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,490
They must be crazy.

809
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:05,700
What?

810
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:10,956
Why is Yong-pil there too?

811
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:12,248
Come on!

812
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:13,541
Did you see that, officer?

813
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:15,168
Are you seeing this?

814
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:17,963
They didn't break my camera by accident.

815
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:20,966
They purposely did it to stop me
from writing about Cho Eun-hye.

816
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:23,677
This is obstruction of business.

817
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,179
How is that obstruction of business?

818
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:27,847
You snuck onto private property

819
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,641
and took photos without consent!

820
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:30,558
We caught a stalker.

821
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:32,936
Your friend's the one who abused her power

822
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,896
and almost killed an innocent person!

823
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:38,149
Birds of a feather
really do flock together.

824
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,902
-What did you say?
-Why do you keep insulting us?

825
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,195
Hey!

826
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:47,075
What? Birds of a feather flock together?

827
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:50,036
How dare you compare
Sam-dal to people like us?

828
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:53,623
What was that?

829
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,875
Sam-dal abused her power?

830
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,669
Don't make me laugh.

831
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:00,714
Do you even know her? Do you?

832
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:03,591
She's totally different
from those of us stuck on this island!

833
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:06,302
Do you know anything about her?

834
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,847
Do you know how hard she's worked?

835
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:11,433
All the effort she put in
to become successful?

836
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,226
Do you know how impressive she is?

837
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:16,146
Do you even know that?

838
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:20,233
Don't you compare her to slackers like us.

839
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:22,736
It's offensive as hell.

840
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:27,240
I don't slack off. I'm a civil servant.

841
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:29,826
-I should be the one offended.
-I think he's crazy.

842
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:36,708
No, you guys aren't crazy.

843
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:37,751
What's your deal?

844
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:39,711
Are you her followers?

845
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,671
Do you worship her?

846
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:46,801
Okay, I'll write a nice article tomorrow
about the woman you admire so much.

847
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:50,388
"Cho Eun-hye fled to Jeju after abusing
her power over her mentee."

848
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:53,058
"She asked her friends
to destroy a reporter's camera."

849
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:55,060
Gosh, that's an excellent headline.

850
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:55,977
Hey!

851
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,645
You better not write that.

852
00:55:57,729 --> 00:56:00,315
We broke your camera.
Why drag someone innocent into this?

853
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:02,942
You're treating me this way
solely because of her.

854
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,028
So all I have to do is attack her.

855
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:08,615
Fine. Write about me.

856
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:14,037
Be my guest.

857
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:19,209
Long time no see, Sang-bong.
Have you been well?

858
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:21,002
What? Yes, I've been well.

859
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:24,422
I'm sorry to trouble you,
but can I report a few crimes?

860
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:26,883
Sure.

861
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,762
Someone sneaked into my yard this morning.

862
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:32,222
What kind of crime is that?

863
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:35,600
What? That would be trespassing.

864
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:38,937
Then, he went through my mailbox
and took photos of my mail.

865
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,438
That's a breach of privacy.

866
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:42,899
He took photos of me
in my bedroom without consent.

867
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:44,734
Violation of publicity rights.

868
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:46,611
Did you feel sexual humiliation?

869
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:49,280
I felt so humiliated. I was in my pajamas.

870
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,616
Then, that's sexual assault too.

871
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:54,160
Don't be absurd. I was only doing my job.

872
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,203
That's four charges.

873
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:59,499
Sir, make sure you post
that article of yours, okay?

874
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:02,377
-And I'll make sure file my lawsuit.
-Lawsuit…

875
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:05,713
Do you have proof?

876
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:06,798
Do you?

877
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:10,844
Unfortunately,
someone destroyed my SD card.

878
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,011
Do you have proof?

879
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,555
Go ahead and sue, then.

880
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:18,685
Proof?

881
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:19,602
Proof!

882
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:23,898
Here's the proof!

883
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,122
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

884
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44,085
We should've beaten him up.

885
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:46,254
I agree. We let him off too easily.

886
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:48,631
We're too kind for our own good.

887
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:50,675
You were amazing, Sang-do.

888
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:52,886
How did you remember the dashcam footage?

889
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:56,931
I guess this must be Cho Eun-hye's house.

890
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:11,237
This is hard evidence.

891
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:17,702
I always thought his car was too noisy,

892
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:20,580
but I guess it's got its uses.

893
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:23,082
You have no idea how expensive his car…

894
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,459
Forget it.

895
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:25,877
I'm sure it's expensive.

896
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:29,881
Anyway, it all worked out well
thanks to Sam-dal.

897
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:32,467
Thanks.

898
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:34,469
Don't thank me.

899
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:37,347
This all happened because of me.

900
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:39,557
Hey, Gyeong-tae.

901
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:41,017
Yeah?

902
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,936
Why are you staring at your beer?

903
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:47,815
Gyeong-tae.

904
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:53,780
I'm sorry.

905
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,449
What?

906
00:58:58,618 --> 00:58:59,619
I…

907
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:02,080
I'm sorry.

908
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,752
Gyeong-tae, what's the matter?

909
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,131
I just…

910
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,510
I missed you, that's all.

911
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:22,267
I missed you, so I meant
I was just happy that you came back.

912
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,812
I wasn't happy about your situation.

913
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,107
Why would I want you to fail?

914
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:34,904
I always felt so proud
every time I read articles about you.

915
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:37,198
Why would I want you to fail?

916
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:42,328
Hey, why are you crying?

917
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,790
It slowly seemed like you were living

918
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:49,711
in a different world from us,
so it's true that I felt sad.

919
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:51,921
But still,

920
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:54,882
we rooted for you every single day.

921
00:59:56,926 --> 01:00:00,096
Hello. My name is Cho Eun-hye,
and I'm a rookie photographer.

922
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:03,391
The theme for Magazine X's
summer photoshoot this year

923
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,269
-is mirrors.
-Look how she's nervous.

924
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:08,104
-Her lips are trembling.
-It's on set…

925
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:09,606
-The camera is--
-Be quiet!

926
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:11,357
But we used mirrors…

927
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,985
Mom, look. This is insane.

928
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:16,696
Kim Tae-hee mentioned Sam-dal.
Check this out.

929
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,323
Come on. Put that down.

930
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:19,282
Look.

931
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:22,952
She wants only Sam-dal to take her photos.

932
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:25,163
Can you believe it?

933
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:26,789
Isn't Sam-dal just incredible?

934
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:30,543
Be quiet, you brat. How many times
have I told you to clean up?

935
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,420
-You deserve a beating!
-Hey! Stop!

936
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:37,592
I'd like to buy
your biggest flower basket.

937
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:39,010
The biggest one you have.

938
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:42,180
CONGRATULATIONS ON OPENING OF 3MOON
GOOD LUCK, CHO EUN-HYE

939
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,973
Thank you.

940
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:50,897
I promise to make it big.

941
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,106
Thank you. Cheers!

942
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:53,566
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

943
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,902
-Yes, that's me.
-Flower delivery.

944
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:57,570
Thank you.

945
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,870
YOUR NUMBER ONE FAN, BU

946
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:09,082
You achieved what we all couldn't.

947
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:11,125
You're…

948
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,587
You're our pride. Okay?

949
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:16,881
You make us proud.

950
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:18,966
So why would I ever wish

951
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:21,552
for you to fail?

952
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,888
I'd never do that.

953
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:28,434
Don't cry. You're making me feel bad.

954
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:31,104
Come on.

955
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:37,151
Thanks.

956
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:45,827
Why would you cry, you fool?

957
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:47,328
Hey.

958
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:49,664
Don't cry.

959
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:53,251
Why are you suddenly being nice to me?

960
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:56,546
Stop crying, you fool.

961
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,175
JEJU REGIONAL OFFICE OF METEOROLOGY

962
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:04,303
Good morning, my foot.

963
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:07,348
The commissioner will be
at today's meeting.

964
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:09,183
-I know.
-And you know

965
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:10,685
you have to join the meeting?

966
01:02:10,768 --> 01:02:13,479
I know. I happen to be in charge today.

967
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:16,691
Don't be nervous because of him.

968
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:18,943
And don't act like you normally do.

969
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:20,403
What are you talking about?

970
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:22,280
Let's see.

971
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:24,699
What's this?

972
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:27,702
No, this isn't right.

973
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:30,246
I said it's going to rain. Okay?

974
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:32,206
Just look at the sky.

975
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:34,542
Look at it. It's so gloomy.

976
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:35,793
Right? Isn't it gloomy?

977
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:38,755
Your face is gloomier.
Just shut it and go along with this.

978
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:42,550
-Okay, we'll begin our meeting now.
-You'll really be disciplined this time.

979
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:43,551
Just go along with it.

980
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:45,511
Whatever. Just leave it to me.

981
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:46,846
You… Get out then.

982
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:48,681
-I'll take over.
-Why?

983
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:51,225
-Let's go to Jeju. Forecaster Cho?
-Get up.

984
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:53,144
-Forecaster Cho Yong-pil?
-Let me go!

985
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:54,937
Yes, I'm here!

986
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:57,648
Hello, this is Cho Yong-pil
from the Jeju Office.

987
01:02:57,732 --> 01:03:01,360
It seems things won't be much different
from what we discussed yesterday.

988
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:02,361
What do you think?

989
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:04,989
No. There's been a huge change.

990
01:03:05,072 --> 01:03:06,657
What is it this time?

991
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:08,993
If you look at Jeju's sky right now,

992
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:11,370
you'll see that it will definitely rain.

993
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:15,333
Mr. Cho, we didn't ask
for your personal observation.

994
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:17,376
Please give us clear scientific reasons.

995
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,546
Did you check
last night's upper-air observation data?

996
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,673
I took a look at it.

997
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:26,552
The dew point temperature
of the lower atmosphere increased by 3°C.

998
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:29,263
You know figures
are just for reference, not the truth.

999
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:30,973
It will definitely rain in Jeju.

1000
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:32,558
You never listen to me.

1001
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:36,395
My apologies.
We have different opinions about this.

1002
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:39,941
It won't rain. That's final.

1003
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:42,151
But I said it would rain.

1004
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,152
It's raining!

1005
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:44,904
What?

1006
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:47,281
It's raining right now.

1007
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:54,831
JEJU REGIONAL OFFICE OF METEOROLOGY

1008
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:15,393
So yes, it's raining in Jeju.
It's final then, right?

1009
01:04:15,476 --> 01:04:16,477
That'll be all.

1010
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:19,480
We're not done. Sit back down.

1011
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:29,740
Hey, Yong-pil.

1012
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:30,825
Yeah?

1013
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:37,206
I used to like Sam-dal.

1014
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:41,919
I really liked her a lot.

1015
01:04:43,462 --> 01:04:45,089
But because of you,

1016
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:47,300
I couldn't tell her that.

1017
01:04:49,802 --> 01:04:51,137
I hate you.

1018
01:04:58,477 --> 01:04:59,520
Who's here?

1019
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:08,321
Hold on.

1020
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:11,157
-Okay.
-She's heavy. Be careful.

1021
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:15,161
Here. This works the best for bruises.

1022
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:16,245
I'll take it.

1023
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:20,833
It's for a friend.

1024
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:24,795
SAMDAL PHARMACY

1025
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:36,015
MEDICINE

1026
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:39,685
Why two?

1027
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:49,820
What?

1028
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:50,780
Sang-do.

1029
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:01,791
Are you ready?

1030
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:15,388
Yong-pil. What about the music?

1031
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:30,611
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

1032
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:01,809
-Yong-pil.
-Where are you running to in the rain?

1033
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:03,561
Can I ask you something?

1034
01:07:03,644 --> 01:07:06,522
How did you know Sam-dal
didn't have an umbrella?

1035
01:07:06,605 --> 01:07:09,650
No one will listen to you,
so you're going to keep sitting by?

1036
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:13,487
-Who was that?
-Just some guy who's a bit dumb.

1037
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:17,199
Eun-bi, what am I looking at?
I need to check everything.

1038
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:18,325
Then, go to Seoul.

1039
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:20,578
-Let's go together.
-How could you?

1040
01:07:20,661 --> 01:07:23,622
How could you do that? How could you?

1041
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:25,166
Get your hands off her!

1042
01:07:27,626 --> 01:07:28,627
Are you done crying?

1043
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:33,758
