1
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:40,957
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

2
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,973
But even if we can't forget the reason,

3
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:59,809
but we could still overcome it.

4
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,686
The memories of our love…

5
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,106
are stronger
than the reason for our breakup.

6
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,859
I know

7
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,029
that whatever the reason
for our breakup was…

8
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,365
I can overcome all of it.

9
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,382
Keep your eyes on the trail.

10
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:36,137
What? You don't like
how I keep looking at you?

11
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,515
I mean…

12
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:43,102
You're making me embarrassed,
so look in front of you.

13
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,565
Come on! I said look straight.

14
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,359
Why should I?

15
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:52,695
I haven't been able to see you much,
so to make up for that,

16
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,949
I'll have to stare at you
like this for three years.

17
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,493
You'll trip and fall, you idiot.

18
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,036
Don't worry, I won't.

19
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,122
And I won't mind if I do.

20
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:17,095
By the way, Yong-pil. Did we take
a path like this on our way up?

21
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,770
Hey, where are we?

22
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,606
Hey!

23
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,024
You!

24
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,152
Where are…

25
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,612
Here it is.

26
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:36,906
We're here.

27
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:41,911
Are you okay?

28
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,330
No, I'm not.

29
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,832
Right. Of course not.

30
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,168
I'm sure it's unlikely you'd be okay.

31
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,837
Didn't I tell you
to keep your eyes on the trail?

32
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,256
I tried, I swear. But come on.

33
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,134
How could I look ahead
when you were next to me?

34
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,052
Stop being so pretty. Okay?

35
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,346
I was bewitched because you're so pretty.

36
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,098
It's because I was captivated by you.

37
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,309
What are you talking about?

38
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,685
All right. Hop in.

39
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,186
You must be hungry. Get in.

40
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,313
Let's go eat, okay?

41
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,026
My legs are trembling,
and my ankles are sore.

42
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,069
Forget it. I'm not hungry.

43
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,578
Looks like you are hungry.
Let's hurry. Watch your foot.

44
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:38,051
Anyone would be hungry if they were lost
and wandering for two hours like that.

45
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:43,306
It took us 15 minutes to go up,
but two hours to come down!

46
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,141
All right. I get it.

47
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,228
-Eat up. You said you were hungry.
-You--

48
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,520
All right.

49
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,315
At least we had a nice walk.

50
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,360
Don't you have any kimchi?

51
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,821
No. If I did, we'd be eating it.

52
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,200
Should I go steal some?
I can put it on Gyeong-tae's tab.

53
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,910
-It's fine.
-No?

54
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,413
It's not as good without kimchi though.

55
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,999
Ramyeon and kimchi
go hand-in-hand, don't they?

56
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,556
This is the only way
to stop your mother from diving.

57
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,519
I'll help you.

58
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,316
Tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.

59
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,735
A Samdal-ri theme park presentation
for residents.

60
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,363
Let's work together.

61
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,451
Is all of that Mom's medicine?

62
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,288
Yeah.

63
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,456
That sure is a lot.

64
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,167
I found where her diving suit was.

65
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,545
Ha-yul was the one who hid it.

66
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,297
Ha-yul?

67
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,801
She must've heard the ladies talking.

68
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,721
She was worried Mom
would get hurt while diving,

69
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,807
so she stashed it
in a spot next to her bed.

70
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,561
Hey. Is Sam-dal home?

71
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,564
Why isn't she back yet?

72
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,276
All right.

73
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,622
Sam-dal, let's go home. I'll take…

74
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,143
LUCKY CONVENIENCE STORE

75
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,939
Ms. Ko.
Were you at the tangerine grove?

76
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:23,192
-Yes, I just refilled the vinegar.
-I see.

77
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,902
What about you? Why are you back here?

78
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,529
I left my phone at the store.

79
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,157
I see.

80
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:33,661
By the way, are the kids still inside?

81
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,329
No idea.

82
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:37,957
Is Sam-dal still out?

83
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:42,003
She must be at the hideout then.
Let's go and check.

84
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,174
All right.

85
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,973
I always leave it here.

86
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:55,600
What?

87
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,978
The lights are on,
so they must still be here.

88
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,648
Are you guys drinking again?

89
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,692
They drink every day
ever since Sam-dal came.

90
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,155
Sam-dal, your mom's here!

91
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,241
Oh, dear!

92
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,957
I know these two like each other,

93
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,751
but in front of her mother? Goodness.

94
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,545
S-Sam-dal?

95
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,339
Sam-dal.

96
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,382
It's okay.

97
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:30,468
What?

98
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,136
Let them be.

99
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,221
What?

100
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:42,897
Ms. Ko!

101
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,324
Goodness. Ms. Ko!

102
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:57,870
You're going to let her sleep there
and not take her home?

103
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:02,124
She's an adult. Why take her home
when she's asleep?

104
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,876
She'll come in once she wakes up.

105
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,294
Bye.

106
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,776
EPISODE 12
WELCOME HOME

107
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,076
My goodness.

108
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:20,328
My gosh.

109
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,205
-My dear goodness.
-Hey, are you okay?

110
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,000
-Wait. What?
-What's going on?

111
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,710
What?

112
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,837
Did we spend the night here? Did we?

113
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,340
-We did.
-Hey!

114
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,760
You should've woken me up,
not fall asleep too!

115
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,722
Hold on. What time is it?

116
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:40,806
It's 6:00 a.m.

117
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,809
This is insane.

118
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:44,935
Oh, my god.

119
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,520
-What do I do?
-What in the world?

120
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,981
What's going on?

121
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,276
Wait. Mr. Man-su?

122
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,944
You don't have to be formal, Sam-dal.

123
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,321
All right, Man-su.

124
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,740
We just fell asleep. By accident, okay?

125
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:01,202
So don't let your imagination run wild,
and keep your mouth shut.

126
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,953
I'll keep my mouth shut. Okay?

127
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,121
Good.

128
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,378
Yong-pil, are you okay?

129
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,813
-Sam-dal!
-Oh, my God!

130
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,774
Hello. How are you?

131
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:35,027
I'm good, but I can't speak for your mom.

132
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:35,945
Sorry?

133
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,531
I get that shotgun weddings
are a thing these days,

134
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,741
but you can't do that
in front of your mom.

135
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,537
Did my mom come by here?

136
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,122
Yeah.

137
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,792
Being in love is great and all,
but you should apologize to her.

138
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,628
How can you sleep next to a man
in front of your mom?

139
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,259
Ms. Ko sure is open-minded.

140
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:02,221
Ma'am, we just fell asleep
by accident. Okay?

141
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,181
Nothing happened at all
between us. Really.

142
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,600
I'm serious!

143
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:10,563
You're adults. It'd be strange
if nothing happened between you two.

144
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:11,605
Ma'am…

145
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:12,606
Darn it!

146
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,484
I'm rooting for you two.

147
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,444
Come on!

148
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,572
Being in love isn't a sin!

149
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,088
I'm home.

150
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,426
-Cho Sam-dal.
-Yes?

151
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,763
Are you getting home just now?

152
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,682
Come home early next time.

153
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:52,521
You should've woken me up
when you came by the hideout.

154
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:58,360
Yong-pil and I've been going around
and working on a project together lately.

155
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,863
But we got lost on the way back.

156
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:04,325
So we just wanted to rest
for a bit since we were so tired.

157
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,202
But we ended up falling asleep.

158
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,329
So what you saw was--

159
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,580
Forget it.

160
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,959
What are you rambling on about?
I can't understand a word you're saying.

161
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,962
You're an adult.

162
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:20,049
You don't have to explain to me
about who you were with.

163
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,054
But…

164
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,306
it's Yong-pil.

165
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,191
So?

166
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,361
So what if it's Yong-pil?

167
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,993
Mom, is it okay…

168
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,455
if I…

169
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,375
like him?

170
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,417
Look…

171
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,628
Look, Sang-tae--

172
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,730
That's weird. I swear it was here.

173
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,484
I told you this wasn't trash.

174
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,069
Bye.

175
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,029
Dad!

176
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,198
I told you this is not trash.

177
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,411
LUCKY CONVENIENCE STORE

178
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:03,754
Sir.

179
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,506
Thanks.

180
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,549
Secretary Ko.

181
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,094
Jin-dal will probably come, right?

182
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,720
Right?

183
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,347
She will.

184
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,975
I have a hunch that she will.

185
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,102
My hunch tells me she won't.

186
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,147
What a pessimist.

187
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,859
You hear me? You need
to stop being so negative.

188
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,570
It'd be a positive thing for me
if she didn't show up.

189
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,783
If the chairman finds out about
the theme park plans for Samdal-ri…

190
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,076
My goodness!

191
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:39,915
I admire your ability
to foresee an oncoming crisis.

192
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,709
So act quickly

193
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:42,668
without him knowing.

194
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,461
Hey.

195
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,298
Ms. Cho!

196
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,844
You made it, dear!

197
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,429
I'm glad you came.

198
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,139
Don't call me that.

199
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,892
I'm afraid we'll be
seeing each other often now.

200
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,644
Then, how about

201
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,563
"honey"--

202
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,273
Don't call me that either.

203
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,483
Then,

204
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,236
"Ms. Cho"? "Jin-dal"?

205
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:11,905
Or…

206
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,824
-"Darling"?
-You little…

207
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,953
Then, what else is there?

208
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,663
Any ideas, Secretary Ko?

209
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,999
-"Hey"? "Look"?
-That sounds good.

210
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,084
I'll use "Hey," and you use "Look." Okay?

211
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,294
I see. I'll use "Hey."

212
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,504
No, I'll use "Look."

213
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,089
You'll use "Hey."

214
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,591
Are we going to go? Let's go.

215
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,176
What?

216
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,219
Wait up. My car's back there.

217
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:38,432
Look, we promise
we'll do a better job this time.

218
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:39,516
Yes, sir.

219
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,436
Don't you worry.

220
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:48,692
What do you mean I'm getting
Eun-ju work for personal reasons?

221
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,528
Eun-hye's gone, so her project
needs a new photographer.

222
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,571
Cho Eun-hye?

223
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,742
I can't tell her to come back.

224
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:01,830
What do you mean the public
has been quiet? It's just a brief lull.

225
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,415
How can you let her come back?

226
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,559
Are you done?

227
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,728
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

228
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,108
The director has high hopes for this one.

229
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,568
You're prepared, right?

230
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,032
Where in the world is it?

231
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,661
Have you seen the kimchi container?

232
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,871
Kimchi? No, I haven't.

233
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,499
Grandma.

234
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:48,460
Aunt Sam-dal took it earlier.

235
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,963
What? Why would she?

236
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,298
I don't know.

237
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,051
But at least the kimchi wasn't rotten,

238
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,680
so I'm sure she's not out to kill anyone.

239
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,323
What are you worried about?
It's just kimchi.

240
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:22,452
It's not like I packed his lunch
or embroidered something for him.

241
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,872
I'm just giving him
some of my mom's kimchi.

242
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,040
I'll have some
and so will Gyeong-tae and Eun-u.

243
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,251
We'll all share it.

244
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,546
Is this too childish?

245
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,381
It's not a big deal.

246
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,800
We're just sharing food.
What's the big deal?

247
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,555
That's hot.

248
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,640
So hot.

249
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,782
-Sam-dal!
-My goodness!

250
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,159
What are you doing down there?

251
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,578
What are you doing up there?

252
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,163
I'm having some tteokbokki.

253
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,165
Hurry up and come have some. It's good.

254
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,514
Why did you bring kimchi?

255
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,433
No reason.

256
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,561
-Wait. Is it because of yesterday--
-What do you mean?

257
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:34,233
I didn't scurry over here with kimchi
because you craved it last night, okay?

258
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:38,779
It's just that we need some kimchi
to at least eat stuff around here. Right?

259
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,906
I think you did scurry over.

260
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:44,743
Look, I didn't scurry over here.
I'm not a kid.

261
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:49,122
The ramyeon didn't taste that good
because there was no kimchi yesterday.

262
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,166
Yeah, this is for me.

263
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,376
I'm going to eat it.

264
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,086
So you're eating
ramyeon again today?

265
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,671
No, I'm not.

266
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,506
What? You're not making any sense.

267
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,801
I'm not forcing you to have it,
and you're not going to eat it.

268
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:04,096
-What's your deal? Just throw it away.
-Why would you do that?

269
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,764
In that case…

270
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,766
You can just have it then.

271
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,483
Why are you laughing?

272
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,444
-Stop laughing.
-All right.

273
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:23,949
Sam-dal, I told you yesterday
to stop being so pretty.

274
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,409
And stop being so cute

275
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,536
and so thoughtful.

276
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,038
I just can't get a grip.

277
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,707
What are you talking about?

278
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,875
Hey, I'll eat the kimchi.

279
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,127
No, you can't have it.

280
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,336
Seriously, I'll eat it.

281
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,713
Don't smile.

282
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,964
What was that for?

283
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,595
-Sam-dal…
-Hey, Gyeong-tae.

284
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,182
What's wrong, Gyeong-tae?

285
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,851
You fool…

286
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,853
What in the world did you go through?

287
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,397
-Me? What do you mean?
-What is it?

288
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,940
What do you mean "go through"?

289
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,362
What's this?

290
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,324
Hey!

291
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,242
Cho Eun-hye!

292
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,201
You little…

293
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:10,954
You scared me.

294
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:12,539
What's wrong?

295
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,503
What's the matter? What is it?

296
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,505
This is…

297
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,132
Mom, she's…

298
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:24,051
Which one of your sisters?

299
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:25,927
Jin-dal or Sam-dal?

300
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,892
Never mind.
It's nothing you need to worry about.

301
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,602
Give it to me.

302
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,812
But why? I told you it's no big deal.

303
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:36,980
I said give it to me.

304
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:40,108
Did another article
come out about Sam-dal?

305
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,652
I said give it to me now!

306
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,032
Hey!

307
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,326
Cho Eun-hye!

308
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,243
You little…

309
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,915
How dare you endanger
my hard-working daughter?

310
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:57,375
Who do you think you are?

311
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:03,173
You think I'll let you
get away with this, you bitch?

312
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,382
Huh?

313
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,636
I'll make you pay double
for what you did to her.

314
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,096
Who is this woman?

315
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,347
Who is it?

316
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,640
I'll make sure you're ruined!

317
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,141
Who is this woman?

318
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,102
I'm asking you!

319
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,312
You think you're something?

320
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:19,773
ASSISTANT'S MOTHER DISCIPLINES HER!

321
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,191
"Assistant's mother"?

322
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:26,071
Is this Bang Eun-ju's mother?

323
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:28,949
Yes.

324
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,243
Mom!

325
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:43,922
…get away with this.

326
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,175
That woman is crazy.

327
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,678
How could she hit that poor skinny girl?

328
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,055
Damn it. Bang Eun-ju.

329
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,765
She's the real evil bitch.

330
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:55,892
She'll pay for this.

331
00:23:57,435 --> 00:24:00,814

332
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:05,861
What's the matter?

333
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,407
Didn't you record this at the hospital?

334
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,034
Cho Eun-hye!

335
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,578
You little…

336
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:19,791
So?

337
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:22,294
Did you upload this?

338
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:23,962
Yeah.

339
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,298
Why would you do that now?

340
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,592
Because I was bored.

341
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,725
JEJU NEWS

342
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:40,520
CHO SAM-DAL CHOSEN
FOR JEJU AND WEATHER EXHIBITION

343
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:43,273
Let's just hear them out and say no too.

344
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,524
Right.

345
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:48,862
Jin-dal.

346
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:51,031
-Jin-dal.
-Hello, sir.

347
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:55,243
What are you doing here?
What if your mom finds out?

348
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,329
Everyone,

349
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,457
I'm here as a resident of Samdal-ri too.

350
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,918
It'd be nice if our town gets a landmark.

351
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,253
Your mom is the leader of the haenyeos.

352
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,215
She's going to be livid
if she finds out you're here.

353
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,300
-So you should go.
-Go on, now.

354
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,843
Who cares if she's livid?

355
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,345
-Watch it.
-How could you say that?

356
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:16,765
No, I mean I'd rather have her
mad at me about this.

357
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,935
Our haenyeos can't go on diving forever.

358
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,979
You've all learned
how to dive too to be like them,

359
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,148
but you don't do it because it's hard.

360
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,149
Well, that's…

361
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,776
That's true, but…

362
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,653
Right? It's so demanding.

363
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:34,282
But no one has to go diving
if they build a theme park here.

364
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,159
Why pass up such a good opportunity?

365
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:39,829
You need to think
about this carefully. Okay?

366
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:43,291
If the AS theme park
is built here in Samdal-ri,

367
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,336
it will create around 10,000 new jobs.

368
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,422
Plus, we expect that our theme park
will become recognized

369
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:52,884
as a popular tourist attraction
representing Samdal-ri,

370
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:56,096
which will greatly help
in revitalizing the town.

371
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,347
Cut to the chase.

372
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,307
What will the theme park have?

373
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,893
I need to go fertilize my tangerine grove.

374
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,228
Speed things up.

375
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:06,314
Yes, ma'am.
Please look at this slide then.

376
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:10,860
First, we plan to light up the coast
by installing lasers along it

377
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,946
to create a promenade for nighttime walks.

378
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,406
We're all in bed by 9:00 p.m.

379
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,908
It'll be too bright to sleep
with those things on!

380
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,327
-Right!
-The old ladies won't get any sleep.

381
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,662
-Right.
-They won't.

382
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:26,376
We can negotiate the details later
to lower the brightness.

383
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,920
What do you mean?
Why turn on lights at night?

384
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,880
-It'll be too bright.
-What's this?

385
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,007
Is this a joke?

386
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,342
Turn the lights off!

387
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:40,265
If their bedtime is at 9:00 p.m.,
then we should turn them off by then.

388
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:43,768
Why would anyone take
a stroll that late at night anyway?

389
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:47,647
Sir, it's a nighttime attraction.
You can't turn them off at 9:00 p.m.

390
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:54,112
Then, forget the nighttime.
Change it into a daytime attraction.

391
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,114
Yes, sir.

392
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:59,743
Then, we'll discuss this
internally a bit more.

393
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:02,329
The second attraction
is called Safari World.

394
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,372
Around 50 different species of animals,

395
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,625
-including wild animals, such as lions--
-Wild animals?

396
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,210
Are you insane?

397
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:13,882
I've seen on the news how they escape
and come into the towns.

398
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,425
You want us to live in fear?

399
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:18,178
-She's right.
-We can't live like that.

400
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:21,389
Yes, that's why we'll hire
professional zookeepers

401
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,600
who'll work in shifts around the clock.

402
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:26,978
When a pig from the next village comes in,
they turn our fields into a mess.

403
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,356
-But what? Wild animals?
-Right.

404
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,690
Yeah. He's totally right.

405
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:31,983
No wild animals!

406
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,570
-Sir.
-Take them out.

407
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,322
It's too dangerous.

408
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,532
Why keep the wild animals locked up?

409
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:40,700
Sir!

410
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,788
What kind of safari
doesn't have wild animals?

411
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,083
That idiot.

412
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:51,419
Does he want to build a theme park or not?

413
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,046
He wants to remove everything!

414
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,174
All right, everyone! Hear me out.

415
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:01,179
It won't be too bright
if we make the lights face the water.

416
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:03,056
It won't be that bright.

417
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:06,893
Frankly speaking, our village
is a bit too dark at night.

418
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,895
-That's true.
-Was it two years ago

419
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:11,106
when Famous Sangdo's was robbed at night?

420
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,816
What's the point of CCTV cameras?

421
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:15,693
They couldn't catch the thief
because it was too dark to see.

422
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:16,945
That's right.

423
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:20,115
-It was pitch black.
-Exactly.

424
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,368
And the wild animals?
Those incidents on the news are very rare.

425
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:27,330
If they do come
into our village, just call me.

426
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,456
I'll catch them.

427
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:34,003
You know how strong I am, right?
I'll catch them.

428
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,434
Look.

429
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:50,979
You should offer solutions to problems,
not just get rid of everything.

430
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,648
Who's behind this project?

431
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,608
My father…

432
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,318
I mean, the chairman.

433
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,611
Exactly. The chairman.

434
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:04,784
Do you think he'll approve of a safari
without any wild animals in it?

435
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:07,829
You're already bound to be chewed out
for moving it to Samdal-ri.

436
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:11,958
What? You're smiling?

437
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:15,670
I mean…

438
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:21,634
Watching you helping me out
brought back old memories.

439
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:27,474
You would be by my side, dear,
and guide me through everything

440
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:31,561
so I wouldn't get an earful
from my father even if I deserved it.

441
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,899
He scolds me all the time now.

442
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:44,324
Don't call me "dear." It's "Hey."

443
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,409
Right.

444
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:52,665
Cho Eun-hye!

445
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:55,668
CHO EUN-HYE GETS PUNISHED!
ASSISTANT'S MOTHER DISCIPLINES HER!

446
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:58,129
How dare you endanger
my hard-working daughter?

447
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:06,304
Hey, Sam-dal! You were hit?

448
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,972
Jin-dal, calm down.

449
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,682
It's okay. Don't make it worse.

450
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:12,560
Mom found out?

451
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:18,691
Why did Hae-dal tell her that?

452
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,985
Really, I'm fine.

453
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,237
Okay?

454
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,196
Bye.

455
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:26,908
Jeez.

456
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,953
Why is this happening now
and making a mess?

457
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,579
For crying out loud.

458
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,206
You're not fine.

459
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,500
What?

460
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,044
Well, it's all in the past.

461
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:41,673
So what if it is? It doesn't change
the fact that she hit you.

462
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:45,343
Why did you go there
by yourself? It's dangerous.

463
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:48,763
You don't know who's out there.
You should've taken someone with you.

464
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,515
I can't take someone with me.

465
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,393
Jin-dal would've caused a scene there,

466
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:55,937
and it would've been embarrassing
to bring my assistants.

467
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,981
But why did you let her hit you?

468
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,858
You're innocent!

469
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,985
Why did you let some stranger hit you?

470
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,403
You should've fought back!

471
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:07,574
I didn't know what to do at the time.

472
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,951
When I think about it now,

473
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:15,081
I regret not fighting back
and letting her hit me.

474
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,711
But it was my first time
experiencing something like that.

475
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:23,172
So don't say I was a fool
to let her keep hitting me

476
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,008
and should've done this or that.

477
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,596
Don't say those things, Yong-pil. Okay?

478
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,931
It just upsets me so much.

479
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,892
You were all alone when it happened.

480
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:37,437
You bottled things up to bear it
and cried by yourself, and that just…

481
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,444
We're all alone in this world, you know?

482
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:45,570
You're not alone.

483
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:50,909
You have your parents,
your sisters, your friends.

484
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,036
And you have me!

485
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:57,874
Right here.

486
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,709
You have me too now.

487
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,214
You're not alone.

488
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,342
So from now on,

489
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:12,472
stop going through things alone,
bottling things up, and then crying.

490
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:14,682
Got it?

491
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,186
It's not really a big deal
that I was alone…

492
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,687
Answer me. Got it?

493
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,356
Yes, I got it.

494
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,779
Why didn't you tell us she hit you?

495
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,031
Why would you let her hit you?

496
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:33,284
You should've taken us with you
if you were going to her hospital!

497
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:36,371
I'm going to make them pay.
How dare they lay a finger on you?

498
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:40,708
I wonder who uploaded that video.
It was definitely intentional.

499
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:41,709
You…

500
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:45,755
Things had been quiet online,
but they're talking about you again.

501
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:46,965
Look at this.

502
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,801
A mother's love is
the most touching thing.

503
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:51,970
-Most refreshing scene of 2023.
-I loved it.

504
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,972
She deserved it for hurting her child.

505
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,056
Goodness.

506
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:56,975
Those lunatics--

507
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,017
Mom.

508
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,603
Give me her mother's number.

509
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:02,730
Gosh, Mom. Forget it.

510
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:03,648
Do it right now!

511
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:08,361
If you don't have it,
give me Eun-ju's number.

512
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:11,656
But…

513
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,409
-How could you let her hit you?
-Mom.

514
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,493
How could you?

515
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:16,869
Mom!

516
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:21,332
Why did you let her hit you like an idiot
when you did nothing wrong?

517
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:22,291
Mom, please.

518
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,545
I didn't let you go to Seoul
to be treated like that!

519
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:27,880
Give me her number.

520
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,966
I'll do the same thing to her.

521
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,635
I'm fine, Mom.

522
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:33,970
-No, you're not!
-Mom.

523
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:37,098
-What do you mean "fine"?
-Mom, please.

524
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,559
For goodness' sake…

525
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:43,521
Hey.

526
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,565
You call this a site survey?

527
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:51,362
They're either all tourist spots
or places other photographers used.

528
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:55,116
I don't want familiar places.
I said to find the hidden gems!

529
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,454
I can't put up with this garbage anymore.

530
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:00,621
Look--

531
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,499
We at least need
a set theme to find a spot.

532
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,043
Have you lost your mind?

533
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:08,796
Despite the abuse of power,
you used to work for Cho Eun-hye.

534
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,340
So I was bearing it,
thinking I could learn from you.

535
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,677
But you're less skilled than I am.

536
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,471
You didn't think of a theme, did you?

537
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:20,141
That's why you're taking it out on us!
Come on, let's go.

538
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,143
Where are you going? You can't leave.

539
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,272
We're assistant directors,
not your personal maids.

540
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:28,149
Carry your own bags from now on.

541
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:29,859
Let's go.

542
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,652
-Where are you going?
-Hey.

543
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:32,695
Hey!

544
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,947
What did she even learn from Cho Eun-hye?

545
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,617
Look, let me sort things out first.

546
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,577
Go get some rest, and I'll…

547
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,122
Come on.

548
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,416
You can't let them leave like this.

549
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,752
What about the on-location shoot?
We need assistants.

550
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,879
That damn Cho Eun-hye.

551
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,006
How dare they mention her name?

552
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:53,758
Eun-ju…

553
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:55,635
Eun-ju!

554
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:58,387
We've already changed ADs
three times this month.

555
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:01,015
If this shoot flops, even I'll get fired.

556
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,518
The team's coming next week,
and you have no theme.

557
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:13,194
Where are we going to shoot tomorrow?
We don't even have a theme.

558
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,453
You're not alone.

559
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:26,624
You have your parents,
your sisters, your friends.

560
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,127
And you have me!

561
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,837
Right here.

562
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,131
Mom.

563
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,347
Did it hurt?

564
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,770
You must've been so shocked alone.

565
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,321
It did hurt.

566
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,781
I was shocked

567
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:42,992
and scared.

568
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,829
It felt like no one
in the world was on my side

569
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,498
and I was left all by myself.

570
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:51,876
I was scared.

571
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:03,054
I shouldn't have let you go
to the mainland.

572
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:06,891
Mom?

573
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,853
I wasn't done talking yet.

574
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:14,232
Back then. I was scared back then.

575
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:16,317
But I'm really okay now.

576
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,444
You're here with me now. On my side.

577
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:28,746
So stop being so upset.

578
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:31,582
You're making this house
feel so gloomy, Ms. Ko.

579
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,004
All right.

580
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,272
SAMDAL POLICE SUBSTATION

581
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,439
Look at this!

582
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,857
This is downright assault.

583
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,317
In broad daylight!

584
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,944
She assaulted her out in public!

585
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:02,196
How is this "discipline"?
It's assault! See?

586
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,365
Yes, she could clearly
charged for assault.

587
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:06,367
They obviously posted
this video maliciously.

588
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,494
They didn't even blur out Sam-dal's face!

589
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:12,331
He's right! Why didn't they blur out
her face? We have publicity rights too!

590
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,416
Goodness!

591
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,419
-You can sue her for all that.
-Right.

592
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,087
I can't believe I'm saying this,

593
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:22,133
but for Sam-dal's sake,
I think you shouldn't do anything.

594
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,759
-Why not?
-Why not?

595
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,595
Public opinion
is totally against her right now.

596
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,391
You know it.

597
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:33,936
Things have died down a bit now,
so she can finally breathe.

598
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,064
Exactly! Things settled down,
and then this upset us again!

599
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,816
-Sang-bong!
-What?

600
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:39,984
What are you doing here?

601
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:44,030
What's that called?
We'd like to report an assault.

602
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:51,037
Damn it. Cheon Chung-gi
and Bang Eun-ju are the problems.

603
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,206
We should've beaten them up last time,
Yong-pil.

604
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,916
I completely agree. Damn it.

605
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,753
-What? You saw them?
-Yeah, when we went to Seoul.

606
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:02,381
Then, go back in and get
a facial composite. You too, Yong-pil.

607
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:05,509
Hey, there are loads of photos
of Bang Eun-ju online.

608
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:06,427
Really?

609
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,780
Dolphins suffer in aquariums.

610
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:26,989
Please protect them.

611
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,074
OCEAN AQUARIUM

612
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,412
Hey, kid. I mean, Ha-yul.

613
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,171
Please release the dolphins into the sea.

614
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:46,842
FREE THE DOLPHINS

615
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,976
Ha-yul, are you seriously
going to stay out here and not go in?

616
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:00,606
Yes. Like he said,
it's nice to watch dolphins,

617
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:03,401
but it's more meaningful to protect them.

618
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,782
I mean, she seemed
to really love dolphins,

619
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:12,535
so I just taught her
the correct way to care for them.

620
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,288
Hey, mister.

621
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:21,085
Is it true that dolphins in aquariums
really don't live as long?

622
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,879
Yes, dolphins can live
up to 40 years in the sea.

623
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,632
But many of them in captivity
only live for four years.

624
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:27,800
Why's that?

625
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:32,680
Well, how would you feel
if you were always stuck in a small room?

626
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:34,348
I'd be stressed out.

627
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,599
Right?

628
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,393
Dolphins are meant for the vast ocean,

629
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:39,728
so sticking them
in a small tank stresses them out.

630
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,481
I see.

631
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:46,360
Stress sure is the root of all illnesses.

632
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,905
You're very knowledgeable, Ha-yul.

633
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:50,990
You're so smart.

634
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,616
By the way, mister,

635
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,119
who made these?

636
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:59,748
These? They were made
by volunteers at the Dolphin Center…

637
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,460
Would you like to come visit?

638
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,003
Yes, I would.

639
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:05,629
Hey.

640
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:17,057
Why did you agree to go
with him to the Dolphin Center?

641
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,728
It's okay. He's not a stranger.

642
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:22,605
So,

643
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,858
you're the president, right?

644
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,362
Aren't you busy then?
You don't have to do this for us--

645
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:31,405
It's my job.

646
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,493
Didn't we agree to speak casually
when we met at that bar?

647
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:39,371
What? My goodness,
when did I agree to that?

648
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:42,333
Excuse me, sir,
but why would I speak casually?

649
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,001
Are you crazy? We're not even friends.

650
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,796
It's not true.

651
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:53,010
Mister, why did you become Namchun's dad?

652
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:55,971
Me?

653
00:41:58,724 --> 00:41:59,808
Because if I didn't,

654
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:03,854
no one in this world
would've protected her.

655
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:10,319
JEJU DOLPHIN CENTER

656
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,948
This place is nice and cozy.

657
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,616
You said you wouldn't speak casually.

658
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:21,080
I only said that because you mentioned
going to a bar in front of her.

659
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,667
This place used to be abandoned.

660
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,378
I opened it after a year
of cleaning and fixing it up.

661
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,422
You've done a great job.

662
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,550
I had no idea it was abandoned.

663
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,135
Nothing's impossible for a father.

664
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,471
I'm Namchun's dad, after all.

665
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:39,974
Right.

666
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:43,519
When and how did you first meet Namchun?

667
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:48,148
When I was 21,
I worked part-time at an aquarium

668
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,025
to go backpacking across Europe.

669
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:51,402
That's when we first met.

670
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:55,656
What? So does that mean
Namchun was in captivity then?

671
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:56,949
Yes.

672
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:02,871
Then one day, she stopped eating

673
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:07,751
and started slamming her body against
the wall whenever I went inside to clean.

674
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,338
At first, I thought she was just playing,

675
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:17,052
but I soon found out
she was hurting herself to end her life.

676
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,472
What? Are dolphins capable of doing that?

677
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:24,059
Yes. It's called stranding,
and it's not uncommon in other countries.

678
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:28,147
It's when dolphins end
their own lives due to stress.

679
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:33,777
She was pregnant with Oryong at the time.

680
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:37,364
Dolphins born in aquariums
usually don't live very long.

681
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,451
I think Namchun was aware of that.

682
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:46,915
She wanted to die with her baby
rather than have it live in captivity.

683
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,042
Right.

684
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:55,215
That's when I realized I was
the only person who could protect Namchun.

685
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,010
I see.

686
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,513
I think I know how you felt.

687
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,725
I don't want to!

688
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,771
It's my baby! Why do I have to do that?

689
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:10,606
You're only 21.

690
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:13,067
She has no father.
How will you raise her alone?

691
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,444
-We'll raise her instead.
-Exactly!

692
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:18,197
She doesn't have her father,

693
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,949
so she should at least have her mother!

694
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,578
Are you two her mother. Are you?

695
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:27,623
If she and I were drowning,

696
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:30,250
you two would save me first.

697
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:38,676
No one in this world
can protect her like I can.

698
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:43,222
So who will protect her if I don't?

699
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:03,534
Ha-yul is…

700
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:06,036
Last time, she was crying by the shore.

701
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,705
I'd never seen
such a thoughtful 9-year-old.

702
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:10,457
What…

703
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:13,669
She was crying? Why?

704
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,423
Isn't your mother
the leader of the haenyeos?

705
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:21,385
I ran into Ha-yul
when your mother's accident happened.

706
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:26,473
She was crying, saying who would
protect her mother if her grandma died.

707
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:28,976
What?

708
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:34,064
What if the sea takes away my grandma?

709
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:37,276
What will happen to my mom?

710
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,573
She's so thoughtful.

711
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,207
Hey, why are you crying?

712
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,006
Ha-yul.

713
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,260
Why are you crying, Mom?

714
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,387
Did someone make you cry?

715
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:09,892
Is that why you hid Grandma's diving suit?

716
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:12,728
Because you were afraid

717
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:17,149
there would be no one to protect me
if something happened to her?

718
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:22,529
Why would you worry
about something like that?

719
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:26,617
You should only worry
about what games to play

720
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:30,120
and what food
you're going to eat the next day.

721
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:35,876
I'm still a kid so I can't protect you!

722
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:41,465
I don't need anyone to protect me.

723
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,676
I have someone to protect.

724
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,053
I have you.

725
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:49,139
Even if there's no one to protect me,

726
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,518
I'm ten times stronger than anyone else.

727
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:56,855
Those who have others to protect
are always much stronger.

728
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,150
Ha-yul…

729
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:03,862
You don't have to worry about such things.

730
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:09,618
I don't want you
to worry about those things.

731
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:22,589
Mom, this is…

732
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:23,882
Seriously, I…

733
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:28,387
Jin-dal.

734
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:33,225
Did you go to the theme park presentation?

735
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:35,561
No.

736
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,604
Why would I go there?

737
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,648
Sam-dal, hurry up and come out.

738
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:41,233
Okay! I'm coming!

739
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:44,194
Tell him to take it back to Namdal-ri.

740
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:47,406
What is she talking about?

741
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,200
God, this reeks.

742
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,451
This is too much.

743
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:52,828
-Gosh.
-Jeez.

744
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:55,122
-Why do we still do this?
-Gross.

745
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,420
What is this?

746
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:03,964
It really is the boondocks.

747
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:07,467
You said we're doing a site survey.
Why did we come to this town?

748
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,219
This is Eun-hye's hometown.

749
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,180
How did you know?

750
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,393
I'm her ex.
I know her real name, Cho Sam-dal.

751
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:21,398
When she got drunk, she'd always say
she'd never return to Samdal-ri.

752
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:24,693
We need to find a spot fast.
Why did we come here?

753
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:27,112
That's exactly what we're doing here.

754
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:30,073
You're going to pick a spot here?

755
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,074
Yeah.

756
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:36,622
Don't you think we'll find
a lot of hidden gems with retro vibes?

757
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:39,791
Ms. Cho, the retro theme is amazing.

758
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,793
-Not bad, right?
-Totally.

759
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:46,048
Since it's supposed to be a countryside
how about your hometown? Jeju Island.

760
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:49,509
Well, my hometown sure does
have hidden spots that are retro.

761
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,596
But I don't want to go there.

762
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:57,934
Hey. What if you run into her?

763
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,270
She hates her hometown.

764
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,105
She'd never come
even if her career's done.

765
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,274
Pull over somewhere.

766
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,360
Let's walk around and explore the place.

767
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:10,906
This is out of my hands now.

768
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,414
WHY BANG EUN-JU EXPOSED CHO EUN-HYE:
"I WANTED RESPECT"

769
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:21,166
Look at her.
She looks downright evil.

770
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:23,418
And you look so ugly.

771
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,462
Why are you picking on me?

772
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:26,505
Mom, look at this.

773
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:30,801
This is Bang Eun-ju,
the girl who tormented Sam-dal.

774
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:35,555
What an evil brat.

775
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:40,185
-What was that for?
-Pass it on to her.

776
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:42,938
How am I going to do that?

777
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:44,314
-Hello.
-Hello.

778
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:46,024
Gosh, it's hot.

779
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:53,990
What?

780
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:58,787
It can't be.

781
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:11,883
It is her.

782
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,094
Gyeon-tae…

783
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:17,931
Gyeong-tae, come out. Hurry up!

784
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:20,016
I took this a while ago.

785
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,101
I see.

786
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,187
It kind of looks like her.

787
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,189
Take a good look.

788
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,316
She looks a bit different to me.

789
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,111
Women from Seoul all look similar.

790
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:34,030
No wonder you're single.

791
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:43,248
Her hair is…

792
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,460
-I said hurry up, Eun-u.
-Come, come!

793
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:53,884
But why would she come here?

794
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:55,218
Exactly.

795
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,888
Right? She wouldn't willingly come
into the lion's den.

796
00:50:57,971 --> 00:51:00,599
Maybe she's here
to give Sam-dal more trouble.

797
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:01,558
-What?
-That little…

798
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:03,769
-Hey, did you call Sang-do?
-Yeah.

799
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:05,729
Let's confront them once we're sure.

800
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:06,730
-Okay.
-All right!

801
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:08,648
Keep it down.

802
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:11,568
Mom, we got them mixed up.

803
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,491
-Let's go.
-Okay.

804
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,451
They're leaving. What should we do?

805
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:22,370
-What do we do?
-What should we do?

806
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:24,456
Hey, Cheon Chung-gi and Bang Eun-ju!

807
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,918
-You grabbed my collar last time.
-It's them.

808
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:32,380
-So they did walk into the lion's den.
-What?

809
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:35,675
-How dare you set foot here?
-So you're that idiot?

810
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:38,053
How dare you two come here?

811
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:40,514
-Who are these people?
-Why are you doing this?

812
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,057
"Why are you doing this?"

813
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:43,683
What about you?

814
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,894
Why did you do that to our Sam-dal?

815
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:47,062
Hey, Bang Eun-ju.

816
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:50,190
Your mother hit our dear Sam-dal,
so where is she?

817
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:53,819
I told you to stay away from her.

818
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:55,904
I've had enough of this.

819
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:57,656
Hey!

820
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,158
Run.

821
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,201
Get them!

822
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,452
-Get them!
-Hey!

823
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,996
-Stop right there!
-Come back here!

824
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:09,709
Damn it.

825
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:19,010
Hey.

826
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:22,138
Hey, Bang Eun-ju
and that Chung-gi guy are here.

827
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:24,683
Why would they come here?

828
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:26,476
I don't know. We just lost them.

829
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,646
Who knows what they'll do
to Sam-dal, so go to her right now.

830
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:31,147
All right.

831
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:37,946
Sam-dal, where are you?

832
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,073
Really?

833
00:52:40,156 --> 00:52:42,742
Just stay there. Don't go anywhere.

834
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:43,910
I'll be there soon.

835
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:48,832
What's up with him?

836
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:55,881
Yuck! This vinegar reeks.
It's giving me a headache.

837
00:52:56,548 --> 00:53:00,969
The odor of the vinegar has to be strong,
so it keeps the birds away.

838
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:02,053
You're right.

839
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:03,930
Gosh.

840
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,892
Nothing works better than vinegar.

841
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,651
Hey, I'm in the grove.

842
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:18,862
What is it?

843
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,866
I'm refilling the vinegar in the groves.

844
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:33,501
Okay.

845
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:39,424
Why did we have to come
to Eun-hye's hometown?

846
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:42,636
-Why run? We didn't do anything wrong.
-Bang Eun-ju.

847
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,721
Didn't you see their faces?

848
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:47,766
They were defending Sam-dal
and threatening to kill us!

849
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:01,488
Mom, we're done. We can go now.

850
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:03,239
Mom.

851
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:05,241
Mom, have a tangerine.

852
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:09,454
You know, at this point,
you're obsessed with Eun-hye.

853
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:12,290
Coming to her hometown?
Posting that old video?

854
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:14,751
-Things had finally been quiet for a bit.
-What?

855
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:17,295
You couldn't wait
to hand over my project to her?

856
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:20,632
Wait a minute.

857
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:26,054
People were starting to ask
to work with her again,

858
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:27,889
so you posted the video?

859
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:31,393
Bring her back? After what she did to me?

860
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:36,940
I just stomped on her to make sure
she'd never get up again.

861
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,609
You think my daughter's a cockroach?

862
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,194
Pardon me?

863
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:47,158
What?

864
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:49,494
What's this smell?

865
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:51,037
-Mom!
-Mom!

866
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:51,955
What…

867
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:53,415
-It's Eun-ju!
-What's this smell?

868
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:54,958
It's Bang Eun-ju!

869
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:57,210
God, what's this smell?

870
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,339
Have you lost your mind, lady?

871
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,343
Why are you two here?

872
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:06,720
Well…

873
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:07,721
Yes.

874
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,306
I have lost my mind.

875
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:14,686
What kind of mother would be sane
after what her daughter went through?

876
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:15,770
No mother would!

877
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:22,527
I understood why your mother was upset
by what happened to her daughter.

878
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:24,070
But what did you say?

879
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,406
Stomp on her to make sure
she'd never get up again?

880
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:31,244
I heard you lied
about what happened to you.

881
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:34,247
I heard you denied it yourself!

882
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,499
But why did you do that?

883
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:38,209
Why did you lie?

884
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:44,132
-Still, throwing the vinegar was--
-You think she can't get back up?

885
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:46,384
Go ahead and stomp on her again.

886
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:47,385
Ma'am, please…

887
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,137
I never taught her how to fall,

888
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:53,016
but I did teach her how to get back up.

889
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:55,810
She'll get back up every single time!

890
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:59,230
Make sure to tell your mother this.

891
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:03,401
I'll pay her back
for what she did to my child.

892
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,446
She has a mother too!

893
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,201
-Ma'am…
-Mom.

894
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:13,411
Eun-hye, hold on. Let me explain.

895
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:15,121
How dare you touch her?

896
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,790
You bastard.

897
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:19,292
Don't you touch her. You got that?

898
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:20,418
You got a death wish?

899
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:21,878
Hey.

900
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:24,214
You're the guy who came to our office.

901
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:26,800
That's right. It's me, you bastard.

902
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:29,886
You're getting on my nerves.
Okay? You're irritating me.

903
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:32,055
-Do you get me?
-What do you mean?

904
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:34,891
It means stay out
of my sight, you bastard.

905
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:37,519
You better get lost.
You'll regret it if I see you again.

906
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:38,603
-One minute--
-Damn it!

907
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:40,230
-Gosh!
-Cho Eun-hye!

908
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:43,191
Do you think I'll let this go?

909
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:45,860
Mom, give me a minute.

910
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:50,281
Go ahead and post this too.

911
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:52,200
What?

912
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:54,494
Film this and post it online too.

913
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:59,415
What? You're losing the work you got
pretending to be the victim,

914
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:01,334
so are you afraid I'll take your jobs?

915
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:04,087
I'm not a thief,
so why would I steal from you?

916
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,297
I have other ways to support myself.

917
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:09,717
How could you be so brazen and come here?

918
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:16,516
-Is this your territory or something?
-Yes, it is.

919
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,060
I may have had no power in Seoul,

920
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:21,187
but this is my turf.

921
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,189
So you should watch out.

922
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,734
If you play around here, you'll regret it.

923
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:27,652
Got that?

924
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:30,697
Let's go, Mom.

925
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,535
You.

926
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:39,747
You would be dead by now
if it wasn't for my mom.

927
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:43,877
Mess with my sister again, and I'll…

928
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:45,670
Jeez.

929
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:56,264
Gosh.

930
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,312
Why did you bring this in here?

931
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:03,938
What's wrong?

932
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:14,699
I won't tolerate anyone
who mistreats our daughters anymore.

933
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:21,080
I won't put up with people
who give Sam-dal a hard time either.

934
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,541
Just you wait and see.

935
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:27,545
Mom, is it okay,,,

936
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:30,590
if I…

937
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:33,635
like him?

938
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:44,854
What's the matter?

939
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:55,365
What is it?

940
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:04,415
I've been giving Sam-dal a hard time too.

941
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:09,087
I'm going to deal with myself first.

942
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:16,844
Goodness.

943
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,472
Your mom is impressive.

944
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:22,475
It'll take them two weeks
to get rid of that vinegar smell.

945
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,394
Tell me about it.

946
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:27,188
My mom has such a temper.

947
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:29,607
What is it? You look happy.

948
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:32,151
Is it because she got revenge
against Eun-ju for you?

949
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,528
No.

950
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:38,491
To be honest, I've been happy all day.

951
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:43,788
I was terrified even to think about it
when I was back on the mainland.

952
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:48,501
But now that I'm here,
when I saw that video,

953
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:51,087
I felt fine.

954
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,088
Why?

955
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:58,511
Do you know that feeling

956
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:03,099
of being the sole survivor
of your team during dodgeball?

957
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:06,519
You're surrounded by the opposing team,

958
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:11,107
and they're glaring at you as they think
about which part of me they want to hit.

959
01:00:11,649 --> 01:00:13,860
That's exactly how I felt back in Seoul.

960
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:16,446
But…

961
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:22,076
I finally started to see it
once I came back to Jeju.

962
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:25,622
In between the crowd of the opposing team,

963
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:29,792
I could see my team waving
and telling me they were here for me.

964
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,128
Yeah, my team…

965
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:34,631
After I realized that,

966
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:37,216
I think that's when I started
to feel better.

967
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:42,972
I'm proud of you, Sam-dal.

968
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:48,019
These days, I think
it was wise of me to come here.

969
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:52,857
I can't believe the aunties
went and scared them as well.

970
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,442
What do we do with them?

971
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:56,486
Do you remember?

972
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:59,822
It feels like yesterday
when you came back here as a failure.

973
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:01,741
But look how well you're doing now.

974
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:04,452
Hey, I told you I didn't fail.

975
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:07,080
I just returned to my hometown.

976
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:09,374
You're right.

977
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:12,710
I guess Bang Eun-ju's video
was a big help to you.

978
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:16,047
That did nothing for me.

979
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,256
What was it then?

980
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:19,467
Well,

981
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:23,638
I remembered what you told me last time.

982
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,265
You told me I wasn't alone.

983
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:36,234
So it must've been me who was waving
in the midst of the enemy.

984
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:41,030
-Yeah.
-Right.

985
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:42,115
I see.

986
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:48,663
If the industry wants you back,

987
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:50,957
would you return to Seoul?

988
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:52,959
No.

989
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:57,213
Finding Cho Sam-dal is no longer my goal.

990
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:58,214
Then, what is it?

991
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:03,261
Now, it's to achieve things
as Cho Sam-dal.

992
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:05,263
What things?

993
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:08,933
Things that Cho Sam-dal
couldn't do or achieve.

994
01:02:10,768 --> 01:02:11,978
Anything.

995
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:29,662
Present arms.

996
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:31,456
Oh, you're here.

997
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:35,668
The pork here is great.

998
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:39,839
Here. Eat up.

999
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,299
What is it this time?

1000
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:43,509
Yong-pil doesn't want
to join headquarters.

1001
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,553
And his transfer isn't up to me.

1002
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:48,014
For colluding with you,

1003
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:51,601
that punk's about to report me to HQ
for trying to coerce his transfer.

1004
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:53,478
He's my punk.

1005
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:55,730
Not yours.

1006
01:02:56,522 --> 01:03:00,234
Why do both of you
keep having a change of heart?

1007
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:01,694
What's going on?

1008
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:05,072
He refused to join HQ,
and you refused to send him there.

1009
01:03:07,658 --> 01:03:08,618
So?

1010
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:12,163
But he suddenly
became interested in going.

1011
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:14,791
Then, he changed his mind again.

1012
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:17,543
He was interested before?

1013
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:21,088
-When?
-I can't remember. A while ago.

1014
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:24,342
But he hasn't thought of going ever since.

1015
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:26,135
He's very busy right now.

1016
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:29,138
All forecasters have the same job.

1017
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:30,598
What's there to be busy about?

1018
01:03:31,265 --> 01:03:33,351
Goodness, haven't you heard?

1019
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:38,105
I shouldn't tell you this.

1020
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:40,942
-What is it?
-Yong-pil…

1021
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:43,110
is serving his punishment.

1022
01:03:44,278 --> 01:03:45,321
For what?

1023
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:47,573
Punished for what?

1024
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:49,534
What did he do wrong?

1025
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:51,911
What is this?

1026
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:53,871
Are you planning to crochet a scarf?

1027
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,291
Don't you recognize it?

1028
01:03:58,042 --> 01:03:59,001
Take a closer look.

1029
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:01,838
It's just a ball of yarn.

1030
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:05,091
Do you really not remember?

1031
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:06,008
Unravel it then.

1032
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,678
You want me to unravel this?

1033
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:10,012
Just do it.

1034
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,056
Here.

1035
01:04:12,139 --> 01:04:13,140
Okay, unravel it.

1036
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:14,642
-This?
-Yes, pull it.

1037
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:16,853
-This is going to take ages.
-Just do it.

1038
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:19,981
Pull it.

1039
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:21,607
-Like this?
-Yes. Faster.

1040
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:25,194
-You want me to keep going?
-Yeah, it'll take about two hours.

1041
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:26,737
It's going to take forever.

1042
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:28,447
Faster.

1043
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:32,827
That floral pattern buoy.
I think it belonged to the haenyeo leader.

1044
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:34,412
On the day of her accident,

1045
01:04:34,495 --> 01:04:36,163
he ran out in the middle of work,

1046
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:38,499
so he was disciplined for that.

1047
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:40,585
What did you say?

1048
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:43,588
Who was it for? The haenyeo leader?

1049
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:44,589
Yeah.

1050
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:48,551
He went to the Weather Service division,
and he's busy helping a photographer.

1051
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,177
Right.

1052
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:52,972
I heard the photographer who was chosen

1053
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:56,350
is also the daughter
of the haenyeo leader.

1054
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:00,396
They must be very close.

1055
01:05:11,532 --> 01:05:14,327
Sang-tae, where are you going?

1056
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:15,620
You're all done now.

1057
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:18,414
-There you go.
-What's this?

1058
01:05:18,497 --> 01:05:19,415
Take a look.

1059
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:38,225
Hey, Yong-pil.
I think I like you. What should I do?

1060
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:40,686
Hey!

1061
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:42,563
Gosh, it worked!

1062
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:44,565
I did it!

1063
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:46,943
Yes!

1064
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:48,486
It worked!

1065
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:53,866
Do you remember now?

1066
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:58,579
You've kept this all these years?

1067
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:00,331
Yes. So what?

1068
01:06:07,004 --> 01:06:09,590
I gave this to you as a scarf.
What happened to it?

1069
01:06:12,426 --> 01:06:15,221
You unraveled it
after we broke up, didn't you?

1070
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:18,808
Of course, I unraveled it
after we broke up.

1071
01:06:19,725 --> 01:06:22,478
If you don't like it,
turn it back into a scarf for me.

1072
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:27,274
But I forgot how to crochet.

1073
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:29,860
What about gloves then?

1074
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:31,570
That's even harder to make.

1075
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:41,038
Dad, what are you doing here?

1076
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:51,757
You…

1077
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,760
I begged and pleaded.

1078
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:57,513
I told you

1079
01:06:57,596 --> 01:07:01,350
I couldn't live without my son.

1080
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:03,978
I begged you eight years ago.

1081
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:06,397
So why did you come back?

1082
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:08,482
Why did you come back?

1083
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:16,240
How could I possibly bear
to see you, Sam-dal?

1084
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:21,037
How could I bear to see you
with this grudge I have in my heart?

1085
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:24,123
I can't live without Yong-pil.

1086
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:27,460
I can't live without my son either.

1087
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:29,879
Mr. Cho, please!

1088
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:36,302
Sir, I--

1089
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:41,182
Dad, what are you talking about?

1090
01:07:41,265 --> 01:07:43,309
You promised me.

1091
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:47,313
Why come back and cause
another rift between me and my son?

1092
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:48,272
Why?

1093
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:52,568
Hold on.

1094
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:55,196
Dad, what are you talking about?

1095
01:07:55,279 --> 01:07:57,198
Please, just leave.

1096
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:00,201
Go back to the mainland!

1097
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:03,704
Dad!

1098
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:19,095
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

1099
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:47,373
I don't want a one-sided love.

1100
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:50,126
I did it for eight years.
I can't do it anymore.

1101
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:52,044
I can never overcome him.

1102
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:53,921
Let's not talk about Yong-pil.

1103
01:08:54,004 --> 01:08:56,006
Can you hear me out instead?

1104
01:08:56,423 --> 01:08:58,592
I'm here to upset you.

1105
01:08:58,676 --> 01:09:01,345
I'm going to keep upsetting you,
so that I can take care of you.

1106
01:09:01,428 --> 01:09:04,140
Dad, I know ever since the day Mom died,

1107
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:05,766
you've never been able to move on.

1108
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:07,643
Mother!

1109
01:09:07,726 --> 01:09:09,645
What are you doing here?

1110
01:09:09,728 --> 01:09:11,480
Where did she go today?

1111
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,399
Sagyemul? Today?

1112
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,401
Cho Sam-dal!

1113
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:23,659
