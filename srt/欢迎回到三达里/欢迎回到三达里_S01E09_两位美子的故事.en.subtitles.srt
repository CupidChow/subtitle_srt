1
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,957
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

2
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:48,923
The water wavers

3
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:56,473
Memories waver

4
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:01,644
A girl

5
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:05,440
Dances

6
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:11,196
She was in her youth

7
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:19,537
One day, that sea

8
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:26,377
Became a mother

9
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,506
My tears

10
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,175
Mi-ja! Ko Mi-ja!

11
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,762
And my smile

12
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:41,768
It embraced all of them

13
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,359
I am the sea

14
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:56,157
I am a mother

15
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,408
Can you share some?

16
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,451
Later.

17
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:03,915
I'm a girl

18
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:12,298
I am a haenyeo

19
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:28,314
THE STORY OF THE TWO MI-JAS,
HAENYEOS, AND WOMEN

20
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,526
EPISODE 9
THE STORY OF THE TWO MI-JAS

21
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,407
BU MI-JA

22
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:51,713
She's from the mainland,
and she just got married

23
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,381
to Suk's son, Pan-sik.

24
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:56,885
Suk will be teaching her how to dive.
Take good care of her.

25
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,013
Pan-sik went to the mainland
to get a driver's license

26
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,514
and he came back with a wife?

27
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,474
-Right.
-Right.

28
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,231
Do I have to wear this too?

29
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,858
It looks so funny.

30
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,568
-It's like a tire.
-What?

31
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,987
-A tire?
-You think this is funny?

32
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,697
Hey, you.

33
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,990
I'm Ko Mi-ja.

34
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,034
What's her problem?

35
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,870
Mi-ja, don't shake her hand.

36
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,538
What? Is your name Mi-ja too?

37
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,459
That's right. My name's Mi-ja too.

38
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,086
Bu Mi-ja.

39
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:41,471
Goodness, how will you ever put on a tire?
You can't even touch an octopus.

40
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,682
Bu Mi-ja, why did you do that?
My goodness!

41
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,232
Are you crazy?

42
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,776
Put your head back in right now!

43
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:55,860
Get back in there!

44
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:56,819
Now!

45
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,573
Is it because she's wearing a tire?
She's so dense.

46
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,325
Be quiet.

47
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,494
She'll be living with us in this town.

48
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,412
I told you to get along with her.

49
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,249
Mom, who said
I was going to stay here forever?

50
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,875
I'm going to go to the mainland.

51
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,212
And I'm going
to get married to Cho Yong-pil.

52
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,423
Goodness. Cho Yong-pil, my foot.

53
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,635
Just marry Cho Sang-tae.
He's head over heels for you.

54
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:21,970
There he is now.

55
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,181
Mom, come on!

56
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:30,979
By the way, Mi-ja always talks
about how much she likes Cho Yong-pil.

57
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:34,691
But Nam Jin is the Korean Elvis Presley.

58
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,484
What are you talking about?

59
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:40,029
Na Hoon-a is the Korean Elvis Presley.

60
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,572
-It's Nam Jin.
-Goodness.

61
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,491
-On that green field
-Green field

62
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,784
What are you talking about?

63
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:49,580
Cosmos bloomed

64
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,124
It's Na Hoon-a.

65
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,834
Na Hoon-a is the superstar.

66
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,294
No, it's Nam Jin.

67
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,420
Mom.

68
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:59,465
I'll never be friends
with a rude and impolite girl like her.

69
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,425
Okay?

70
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,305
What did you just say?

71
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,683
Are you deaf?

72
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,685
What did you just say?

73
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,022
It's Cho Yong-pil.

74
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,690
He's the Korean Elvis Presley.

75
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,567
What's this all of a sudden?

76
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,901
I don't know.

77
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:24,824
Yong-pil is both Korea's Elvis Presley
and the biggest superstar.

78
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,993
Not Nam Jin or Na Hoon-a.

79
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,370
-Is she a Cho Yong-pil fan too?
-She must be.

80
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:35,293
There was a girl who once gave me
A bouquet of flowers

81
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,837
Only Yong-pil can sing such a classy song.

82
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,255
So all those titles are his!

83
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:44,719
Her short hair was neatly combed
Like grass wet from…

84
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,945
Yong-pil!

85
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,741
No, no! Get back down there!

86
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,584
Good job!

87
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,754
One, two…

88
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,090
Three.

89
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:23,925
Open your eyes.

90
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,178
It's exactly like mine.

91
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,807
When will you catch anything?

92
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,729
What are you doing?

93
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,066
With 983 votes,

94
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,777
it's Cho Yong-pil!

95
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:45,696
Yong-pil is crying.

96
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,078
Yes, like that.
Those at the back, look at me.

97
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,288
-Look at the camera.
-Congratulations.

98
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,541
Could the bride's side look here?

99
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,755
Please!

100
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,090
It's me.

101
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:06,843
Yong-pil!

102
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,719
What?

103
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,221
What's wrong?

104
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,556
Mom!

105
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,515
Mom!

106
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:25,695
You two are

107
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,822
always joined at the hip.

108
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,574
Is that why you gave birth together?

109
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,826
We'll be by each other's side forever.

110
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,286
When they grow up,

111
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,579
we'll become in-laws.

112
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,038
Right, my in-law?

113
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,875
Being that close isn't enough,

114
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,793
so you want to become family too?

115
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,214
Goodness.

116
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,382
Mi-ja.

117
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,428
Are you really going to become my in-law?

118
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,139
Then, we'll really be a family.

119
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,932
Of course.

120
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,059
Did you think I was lying?

121
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,520
Let's become in-laws,

122
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,856
stay by our kids' sides,

123
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,734
and protect them
for the rest of our lives.

124
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,403
What if the kids refuse?

125
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,406
They might want to marry other people.

126
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,161
Well, that could happen.

127
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:19,165
We would like to,
but they might not like it.

128
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,667
Then…

129
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,214
let's become joint mothers.

130
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,466
Joint mothers? What's that?

131
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:33,513
Yong-pil's mothers
are Bu Mi-ja and Ko Mi-ja.

132
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,849
Sam-dal's mothers
are Ko Mi-ja and Bu Mi-ja.

133
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,685
Wouldn't this make our bond stronger
than just by marriage?

134
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,020
You're right.

135
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,231
If they have two moms,

136
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,609
even if I pass away first

137
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,153
or if you pass away first,

138
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,573
they wouldn't become motherless children.

139
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:53,783
That's true.

140
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:59,622
If I die first, will you stay
by Sam-dal's side forever?

141
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,040
Of course.

142
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,625
I'll take care of Jin-dal too.

143
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,045
If I die first,

144
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:09,048
I want you to stay
by Yong-pil's side forever.

145
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,926
Of course I will. He's my son, after all.

146
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,011
And she is my daughter.

147
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,689
Yong-pil!

148
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,444
Mom, don't overwork yourself!

149
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,613
Don't mind Grandma, okay?

150
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,574
-Hey.
-What is it?

151
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:38,619
Grandma keeps nagging Mom
about how she catches less than others,

152
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:42,331
so she's overworking.
But the currents are strong and dangerous.

153
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,041
Don't worry.

154
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:48,337
She has Bu Mi-ja with her,
Jeju's best haenyeo. Don't worry.

155
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,507
Bu Mi-ja would never put
Ko Mi-ja in danger.

156
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,801
Of course. I know that.

157
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,061
Bu Mi-ja.

158
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,272
Ko Mi-ja.

159
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,151
-How are you doing?
-I'm good.

160
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,118
Okay, let's just go.

161
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:22,121
We can come out
as soon as the currents get stronger.

162
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:25,333
Goodness, we can't. I told you.

163
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:29,795
In this weather,
the currents will rush in instantly.

164
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,422
Why are you being persistent?

165
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,090
Hurry on and go back.

166
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,884
Okay? Let's go.

167
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,930
Listen to her. The sea looks calm now,

168
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,516
but it can get rough
in the blink of an eye.

169
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,018
There's always tomorrow.

170
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,939
I didn't catch anything yesterday either.

171
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,613
You head back first.

172
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,740
I'll work just a bit more.

173
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:01,410
If the currents turn bad,
I'll come out immediately. Go on.

174
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,662
Gosh.

175
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,956
She'll scold you.

176
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,167
Hey, Ko Mi-ja.

177
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,210
Wait for me.

178
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,507
Hey, just go back.

179
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,176
We'll come out
when the currents get strong, okay?

180
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:18,803
Okay.

181
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,388
I'll be quick.

182
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,981
Sang-tae!

183
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,235
Hurry! Come quick!

184
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,779
What? What happened?

185
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,031
Go to the shore right now!

186
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,158
Your wife…

187
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,451
Your wife!

188
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,494
My wife?

189
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,287
What about my wife--

190
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,106
They found her!
In the waters near Samdal-ri.

191
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,566
How is she? Is she okay?

192
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,944
They said "rescued,"
so I think she's alive.

193
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,196
They're taking her
to Halla University Hospital.

194
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:44,740
Hey, where…

195
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,575
There he goes again.

196
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,787
Can we release the weather advisory?

197
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:54,333
Yes, HQ just gave their approval.
They finally said to announce it now.

198
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,709
What do you mean…

199
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,503
What's with that sarcastic tone?

200
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,004
This storm weather advisory.

201
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,924
Yesterday, Forecaster Cho
reported all the areas and times

202
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,842
and requested
a weather advisory in advance.

203
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,012
Headquarters told him wait and see
and delayed approval.

204
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,932
Had it been released in time…

205
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:11,684
What?

206
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:16,855
Goodness. He's going to
lose his damn mind again.

207
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,698
You all must've been so upset.

208
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,575
Are you okay?

209
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:31,287
Why wouldn't we be okay?

210
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:35,875
I hope Ms. Ko is fine.

211
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,336
She wandered into the reef yesterday too.

212
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,005
Why wasn't she more careful?

213
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:45,509
Would the sea change
if we were more careful?

214
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,179
Whenever there's an accident,
I get so scared.

215
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,808
You think you're the only diver
who's afraid of the sea?

216
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,269
Forget it. Let's get up and go.

217
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,772
Who's that over there?

218
00:14:58,856 --> 00:14:59,857
Isn't that Sang-tae?

219
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,901
Yes, it's Sang-tae.

220
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,862
He doesn't come often
to the rest area though.

221
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,156
-I wonder what brings him here.
-Right.

222
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,162
Honey, what are you doing here?

223
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,248
Did the sea take someone away again?

224
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:20,294
Mother, it's still cold.
Why did you come here?

225
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,754
You'll catch a cold.

226
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:25,758
Hey, Ok. He's Sang-tae, not your husband.

227
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:26,926
Cho Sang-tae.

228
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,719
Your son-in-law.

229
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,389
Who are you, mister?

230
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:33,974
I'm leaving.

231
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,732
What happened?

232
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,443
Nothing. You should go with her.

233
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,527
All right.

234
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:19,353
I told you it was dangerous.
Why didn't you listen to me?

235
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,864
Mom… What are we going to do?

236
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,410
Poor Mom!

237
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,038
It's okay.

238
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:47,715
Hello?

239
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,591
Sam-dal, where are you? Where's Mom?

240
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,427
Well…

241
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,430
Mom… Mom's on the way to the hospital now.

242
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,350
Dad is with her.

243
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,854
-Sam-dal.
-There was no room in the ambulance--

244
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,148
Cho Sam-dal, are you okay?

245
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,775
-Pull yourself together.
-What?

246
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,903
Okay.

247
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,614
Sam-dal, listen to me.

248
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,119
Mom will be fine.
Nothing will happen to her.

249
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,414
So don't worry too much
or be anxious, okay?

250
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,875
Sam-dal. Trust me.

251
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,210
Nothing will happen to her. Okay?

252
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,838
It's fine. Do you understand?

253
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,549
All right, okay.

254
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,146
Mom! What are we going to do?

255
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,650
Hae-dal, it's okay.

256
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,360
It'll be fine.

257
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,284
A heart condition?

258
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,203
No way.

259
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:02,748
She had an accident while diving.
What do you mean heart condition?

260
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,542
I think you got the wrong information.

261
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,961
No. That was what I was told.

262
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:08,921
You're right.

263
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,799
She has a heart condition.

264
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:12,800
Dad.

265
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,676
Heart condition?

266
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,137
It's arrhythmia.

267
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,057
Her heart

268
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,768
beats faster than others.

269
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,478
What was it called?

270
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,814
I suddenly can't remember.

271
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,398
What about the medicine she takes?

272
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,277
Medicine? It was medicine for her heart.

273
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,072
Dad, what's this about a heart condition?

274
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,698
Was Mom sick?

275
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,117
Be quiet!

276
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,201
It's atrial fibrillation.

277
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,538
She's taking arrhythmia medication.

278
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,749
She's been taking anticoagulants
for about eight years too.

279
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,460
And she's been seeing a cardiologist here.

280
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,878
His name is…

281
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,089
Cardiologist Dr. Kim Hyung-jun.

282
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:55,384
Page Dr. Kim Hyung-jun
and ask if he can see her now.

283
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,677
-Yes, Doctor.
-Goodness.

284
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,305
How could you let her dive
when she has arrhythmia?

285
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:03,976
Excuse me.

286
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,353
How is my mother? Is she okay?

287
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,355
Yes, for now.

288
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,150
It could have been dangerous,

289
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,153
but thankfully, the paramedics knew
she had a heart condition,

290
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,821
so they took good care of her.

291
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,615
Let's monitor her ECG

292
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,242
and wait for her to wake up.

293
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,451
Okay, thank you.

294
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,620
-Doctor.
-Yes?

295
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,293
I can't believe it.

296
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:33,255
Were we the only ones
who didn't know that she was ill?

297
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,385
Why did this…

298
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,180
She took regularly medication.

299
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:49,479
Mom.

300
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,773
Are you awake?

301
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:52,691
-Mom.
-Wait.

302
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,985
-Mom, are you okay?
-Excuse me, ma'am.

303
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,028
Ma'am, excuse me.

304
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,362
-I'll take a look first.
-Okay.

305
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,282
Ma'am, can you hear me?
You're at the hospital now.

306
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:03,869
She's regained consciousness.

307
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,331
Mom.

308
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,750
Mom, are you okay?

309
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:13,962
Here are Sam-dal's things.

310
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,547
Thanks.

311
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,841
She must've been so scared.

312
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:21,011
She was shaking throughout
the drive to the accident scene.

313
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:24,556
She was trying so hard not to cry
in front of me. Don't get me started.

314
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:29,561
When we got here, she said I could go,
but she left her phone and things behind.

315
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,741
Mom went back to sleep.

316
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,202
I see.

317
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,328
Right. Here.

318
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,706
Thank you.

319
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:52,960
You should go too.

320
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:56,255
We'll stay here. You can go.

321
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,174
Are you okay?

322
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:44,970
Goodness.

323
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:49,891
How is…

324
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,352
How is Ms. Ko? Is she all right?

325
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,022
No idea. He only dropped her off
at the hospital.

326
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,565
I think she is awake.

327
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,941
I don't know the details.

328
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,484
What about Sam-dal?

329
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,028
She's still at the ER, right?

330
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,030
Hey, where are you going?

331
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,823
The whole family is very upset.

332
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,491
You'd only be disturbing them.

333
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,201
I guess you're right.

334
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,078
Yong-pil's there so he'll call.

335
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,585
Yong-pil's with them?

336
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,046
Of course. He rushed to the ER right away.

337
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:20,922
Hey, sit down.

338
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,674
Just wait with us and don't overreact.

339
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:26,845
What's with you two?

340
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:29,765
What?

341
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,476
If I go, it's overreacting,
but if Yong-pil goes, it's not?

342
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,435
I mean…

343
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,646
They have a special bond.

344
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,775
What's so special?
You're the ones making it seem that way!

345
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,782
He's been acting weird since yesterday.

346
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:51,328
Whenever we talk about Yong-pil
and Sam-dal, he yells at us.

347
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,829
I can't even say anything.

348
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:03,423
What on earth are you doing, Bu Sang-do?

349
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,309
You said you didn't know.

350
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,396
You said you knew nothing.

351
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,318
The missing haenyeo…

352
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,821
suffers from a heart condition.

353
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,782
Please check her pulse
and heart rate as soon as you find her.

354
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,535
Check her heart first, please.

355
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,161
I…

356
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,582
I mean, why?

357
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,881
Sam-dal, I'm sorry.
But I really had no choice--

358
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:48,510
Even in normal situations,
I often don't understand you.

359
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,929
But I really don't understand this.

360
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,850
Couldn't you have at least told me
when I asked you?

361
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:59,563
Even if I seemed like a daughter
who was too busy with her own life

362
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,022
to take care of her mother,

363
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,732
and even if I seemed

364
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,069
like I wasn't a good daughter,

365
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,781
shouldn't you have still told me?

366
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:11,616
I'm her child.

367
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,536
That's not the reason
why I didn't tell you.

368
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,871
-See--
-Then, what is it?

369
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,539
Tell me.

370
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,168
Why didn't you tell me?

371
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:23,920
Sam-dal did?

372
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,882
So, did you tell her?

373
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:29,718
I couldn't.

374
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,345
You made all that fuss
and told me not to tell her.

375
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:34,848
But, Mom,

376
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,727
shouldn't your children know
their mom is sick?

377
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,771
If they find out later, imagine how much
they'd blame themselves.

378
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:43,690
So, Mom,

379
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,775
let's tell them now.

380
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:46,902
Forget it.

381
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,196
Don't tell anyone about this.

382
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,572
Mom.

383
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,283
I'll tell them myself
if I decide to. Okay?

384
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:56,786
You're right.

385
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:00,665
I know I should've told you. I know.

386
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,712
But this is Mom we're talking about here.

387
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:08,924
So I couldn't ignore her decision
and act on my own.

388
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:12,636
Still.

389
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,680
You should still have told me.

390
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,434
She isn't supposed to go diving.

391
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,520
Someone with arrhythmia going into water

392
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,565
is like going into water with a time bomb.

393
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:29,569
No one stopped her. Not even Dad or you.

394
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,948
She dangerously went
into the water every day.

395
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:34,950
Do you think

396
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,702
we didn't try to stop her?

397
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:44,125
You're right. As her child,
you should've been told.

398
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,878
I get why you're angry. But you know what?

399
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,881
If you had come home for the holidays,

400
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,008
or even at least once a year,

401
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,136
you would've found out that Mom was sick.

402
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:56,596
No.

403
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,975
You would've stopped her from diving.

404
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,102
But you never came.

405
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,562
That was why you didn't know.

406
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,984
I asked you to find Cho Sam-dal, right?

407
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,488
Mom was a part of it.

408
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,503
Forget it. Let's go, okay?

409
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:29,838
Let's go. Mom--

410
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:38,596
You don't know why I couldn't come back.
Or who it was because of.

411
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,775
Hello?

412
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,361
No.

413
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,488
I don't need it.

414
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,616
What do I need
a credit card for in this town?

415
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,618
They keep asking me to get one.

416
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,828
Goodness.

417
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,790
I'm going to worry to death
from waiting around like this.

418
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:10,587
At least she's awake.
That means she's out of danger, right?

419
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,546
Yes.

420
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,506
Goodness.

421
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:19,137
I don't know why I keep thinking
about Yong-pil's mom today.

422
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,055
Hey.

423
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:23,099
Why would you bring up Yong-pil's mom now?

424
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,017
Don't be absurd.

425
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:27,312
It's not like something happened
to Ms. Ko.

426
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,148
I'm worried that something might.

427
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,859
Two years ago it was Yeong-ae.

428
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,613
And Jeong-sun
and Yong-pil's mom before that.

429
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:40,241
It's not like we knew
something would happen to them.

430
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:46,748
Whenever we're about to forget,
the sea takes more people away.

431
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,543
What?

432
00:27:58,676 --> 00:27:59,677
Ha-yul.

433
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:04,808
Your grandmother and mom
will call us soon, okay?

434
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:07,685
Just stay with these ladies a bit longer.

435
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,270
Okay.

436
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:12,857
In Seoul, when my mom
and aunts would come home late,

437
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,609
I often slept at Byeol's house.

438
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:16,236
-I see.
-I see.

439
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,406
I'm telling you,
you don't need to worry about me.

440
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,241
Is that so?

441
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:22,909
Goodness, what a sweet girl.

442
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:27,372
It's time for the dolphins to come out,
so I'll make a quick visit to the sea.

443
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:28,832
Sure. Go ahead.

444
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,750
Don't go too far though.

445
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:31,668
Okay.

446
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,088
Goodness.

447
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,048
I can't believe you.

448
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,967
Don't say that in front of the child.

449
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,678
How would she know
what I was talking about?

450
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,555
She's just a kid.

451
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:44,931
Goodness.

452
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:46,099
My goodness.

453
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:51,062
She's very mature for a child.
She's like an adult.

454
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:54,149
DOLPHINS ARE NOT FISH

455
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,494
You're here again?

456
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:10,498
It's Ha-yul, right?

457
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,545
Who told you about
when the dolphins would come out?

458
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:16,671
Not everyone knows.

459
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,673
My grandma.

460
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,886
Grandma knows everything about the sea.

461
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,304
I see.

462
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:25,889
She must be a haenyeo.

463
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,016
Lucky you.

464
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,268
I wish I could be friends
with the haenyeos.

465
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:32,729
Mister.

466
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,564
Yes?

467
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:40,695
Namchun stays by Oryong's side
and protects her child.

468
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,656
Yes, since Namchun is Oryong's mom.

469
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,076
Then what if,

470
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,662
by some chance,

471
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,166
Namchun dies?

472
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:55,543
What happens to her child Oryong then?

473
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:59,297
Who will protect baby Oryong?

474
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,381
What?

475
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,220
Well…

476
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:16,731
Bottlenose dolphins
practice something called co-parenting.

477
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,692
Other mommy dolphins
look after the baby dolphins

478
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,861
that have lost their mothers.

479
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,613
I see.

480
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:31,037
Then, if the sea takes away my grandma,

481
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,707
who will protect my mom?

482
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,126
What?

483
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:41,214
I can't live without my mom.

484
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:47,345
And just like me,
my mom can't live without my grandma.

485
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,056
What if the sea…

486
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:55,395
What if the sea takes away my grandma?

487
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:58,606
What will happen to my mom?

488
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:12,370
My dear, that's enough.
You'll run out of breath.

489
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:19,878
Grandma, how do you
hold your breath for so long underwater?

490
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,213
I can't even hold it for ten seconds.

491
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,882
Because I'm a haenyeo.

492
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,342
I can hold my breath for a long time.

493
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:27,802
Gosh.

494
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,971
Aren't you scared of the sea?

495
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,973
I am.

496
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,391
How can it not be scary?

497
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:35,393
Of course, I'm scared of the sea too.

498
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,395
Are you really scared of the sea too?

499
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,105
But you're a haenyeo.

500
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,024
Haenyeos are humans too.

501
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:46,696
The sea is the scariest thing
in the world for me.

502
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:53,369
The sea took away my mother-in-law,

503
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,831
my younger sister…

504
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,251
and…

505
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:09,469
it took away my old friend as well.

506
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:11,930
I'm very scared of it.

507
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:20,355
What if the sea takes away my grandmother?

508
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,608
What is my mom going to do?

509
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:38,706
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
ARRHYTHMIA

510
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,665
Morning, Secretary Ko.

511
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,083
Sir,

512
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:25,753
the chairman wants you to call
Dr. Cha of Halla University Hospital.

513
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:26,671
Why?

514
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:31,759
President Jeon Dae-ho of AS Electronics
broke his ribs and was hospitalized.

515
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,598
Mr. Ko,

516
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:41,310
you've delivered such fun
and satisfying news early in the morning.

517
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,021
That's just the way I like it.

518
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,065
How many did he break?

519
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,443
Not just one rib, right?

520
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,485
Sir?

521
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,446
Stop talking.

522
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:55,324
-Please call him.
-No. Why should I?

523
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,952
Do you know how many times
he's humiliated me?

524
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:01,039
Just tell Father that I called him.

525
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:04,333
It's not like that old geezer
is going to check if I really did.

526
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,668
What was that, you brat?

527
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:07,754
What did you just say?

528
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,256
-Old geezer?
-Father…

529
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:13,551
What on earth have you been doing
on Jeju Island these days?

530
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:17,388
You idiot. This is why
you're the black sheep of the family.

531
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,640
Buy some flowers and go to the hospital!

532
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,476
Mom.

533
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,393
Mom.

534
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,025
No, not yet.

535
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,693
It hurts!

536
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,282
Stop being so loud.
People are going to cuss us out.

537
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,035
Mom, you almost died yesterday!

538
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:43,081
You're not going anywhere.
You need to rest.

539
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,666
Then what? I need to act
like I'm on my death bed?

540
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,920
I'll get only sicker if I stay here.

541
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:50,463
I can rest at home.

542
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:53,925
Mom, you're sick.

543
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:57,470
You need to take medication
your whole life for arrhythmia.

544
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,103
Come on.

545
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:08,272
Everyone takes some kind
of medication around my age.

546
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,859
Gyeong-tae's dad
takes blood pressure medication,

547
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,404
Eun-u's dad takes cholesterol meds,
and Sang-do's mom takes thyroid meds.

548
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:19,117
Everyone has medication
they need to take for their whole lives.

549
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,245
I'm sure nine out of ten people my age
have arrhythmia.

550
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,163
It's nothing serious.

551
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,331
Don't make a fuss.

552
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:26,791
Mom, please!

553
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,960
It is serious!

554
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:32,088
You go diving,
but they said it's dangerous!

555
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,005
Hey.

556
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,551
Mom, just stay here a few days, okay?

557
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,886
Get some tests done
and then go home. Okay?

558
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,221
For crying out loud.

559
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,473
I told you I know my own body best!

560
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,101
-Give me that.
-No.

561
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,186
Mom, why are you being like this?

562
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,063
-Mom.
-Don't give it to her.

563
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,232
-What are you doing?
-Hey!

564
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:53,025
Ko Mi-ja!

565
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,902
For once, just listen to them!

566
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:58,948
It won't kill you to stay here
a few more days!

567
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:01,367
You can't just treat
your own body that way!

568
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:05,413
Stop being stubborn and listen
to your daughters, who stayed up all night

569
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,165
because they were worried!

570
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:10,084
And listen to your husband too! Please!

571
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,670
Just listen to us, will you?

572
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:23,890
-Mom.
-Mom.

573
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:26,309
-Mom.
-I'm sorry.

574
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,186
I'll close the door.

575
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:33,608
But it worked
at least a little bit last time.

576
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:45,661
One call would've settled it.

577
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,915
You sure have a talent
for complicating things, sir.

578
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:55,213
Thanks to that, you must visit a nemesis
in the hospital with this flower basket.

579
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:07,475
Mr. Ko, your choice
of flowers is terrible.

580
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,479
JEON DAE-YEONG
WISHING YOU A SPEEDY RECOVERY

581
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:16,525
Chrysanthemums and "a speedy recovery"?

582
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:19,111
Are you kidding me? Is this my funeral?

583
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:22,823
Have you gone insane or something
since you got divorced?

584
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:23,866
Hey, get lost.

585
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:27,328
Get… Get out now.

586
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:28,788
Really?

587
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:30,748
But I just got here.

588
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,794
Well, I guess I'll leave
since you asked me to.

589
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:42,677
Right. Dae-ho.

590
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,389
Is it just your ribs?
Is the rest of your body okay?

591
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:47,306
Why?

592
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,975
What do you mean "Why?"

593
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,476
Since you're here already,

594
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:54,605
it's better that you're really hurt
so the hospital fee doesn't go to waste.

595
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:57,358
-Hey.
-I'll get going.

596
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,734
You get over here.

597
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,361
That lunatic.

598
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,779
My ribs!

599
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:05,783
Secretary Ko.

600
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:07,702
Did you see his face?

601
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:13,708
Mom.

602
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,293
Keep quiet. Stand up straight.

603
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,253
Stand up and look forward.

604
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,102
Mr. Ko.

605
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,646
It's such a small world in Jeju, isn't it?

606
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,234
Or is this fate?

607
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,493
Let's go.

608
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:24,862
THE LATE BU MI-JA

609
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:14,495
Taxi.

610
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:15,704
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye.

611
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,375
Take your mom home safely.

612
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:20,584
-We will.
-Okay.

613
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:21,919
-Bye, Dad.
-I'll be home early.

614
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,879
-Okay.
-Drive safely.

615
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:31,762
Who was it?

616
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,682
Who paid our hospital bill for us?

617
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:35,975
It must be Yong-pil.

618
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:36,934
Yong-pil?

619
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:40,229
Why would he pay Mom's hospital bill?

620
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:41,564
Why do you think? Because of…

621
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:44,900
He and Mom are close.

622
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,528
They're extremely close
from what I saw yesterday.

623
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:53,409
Mom, you heard
what the doctor said, right?

624
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:55,453
Rest at home. No diving.

625
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,912
I got it.

626
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,290
Don't be so casual about it.

627
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,167
I'm serious. Okay?

628
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,461
See? I told you it was Yong-pil.

629
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,764
What? No, it wasn't me.

630
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,642
Why would you pay my hospital bill?

631
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:20,394
It wasn't me.

632
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,105
Give me your account number.
I'll wire it to you.

633
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:26,525
Mom, it wasn't me. Didn't you hear me?

634
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,152
It wasn't me.

635
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:30,988
Someone must've mistakenly paid
your hospital fee.

636
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,866
What kind of idiot
would make such a mistake?

637
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,160
Exactly.

638
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,376
It wasn't me.

639
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,220
-Gosh.
-Shouldn't they be here by now?

640
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,304
Yes.

641
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:57,389
-She left the hospital.
-Gosh, Ms. Ko!

642
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,934
-My goodness!
-Ms. Ko!

643
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:00,976
Goodness!

644
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,021
Be careful.

645
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:06,440
How are you feeling? Be careful.

646
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,566
Here.

647
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,778
-Be careful.
-Were you in a lot of pain?

648
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,446
Are you really okay?

649
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,157
I couldn't sleep a wink last night!

650
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,993
-Still, I'm grateful.
-Yes.

651
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,703
-We're so relieved.
-Right.

652
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,914
-My goodness.
-Stop making a fuss.

653
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:24,792
I could dive and catch
five or six octopuses right now.

654
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,544
-Mom, seriously!
-Mom!

655
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,295
You just came back.

656
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:29,922
Right.

657
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:32,800
Well, they're right.

658
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,802
They said you can't, Ms. Ko.

659
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:35,928
Just rest a bit more.

660
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:38,013
-Yes.
-Right. Listen to your daughters.

661
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,641
Where's Ha-yul though?

662
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,767
Ms. Ko!

663
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,061
-Hey.
-Hey. Goodness.

664
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,521
She's fine.

665
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:46,730
My goodness.

666
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,942
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

667
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:51,902
Are you still in pain?

668
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,028
I'm fine.

669
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,239
Ha-yul, did you behave yourself
with the aunties?

670
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:58,200
I'm not a baby. I just stayed put.

671
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,884
Don't worry about me.

672
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:18,262
I'm perfectly fine,
so go back to your work.

673
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,598
Tomorrow seems like a good day to dive.

674
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,099
-Okay.
-Mom!

675
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:23,559
-Will you stop it?
-Mom--

676
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:25,185
Okay, all right.

677
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,771
Goodness, we'll take care of it.

678
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:30,649
Yes. Ms. Ko, go and rest.

679
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:31,650
Listen to them.

680
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:32,776
-Yes.
-Yes.

681
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:36,614
Goodness.

682
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:39,783
I think Mom's going to keep diving.

683
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:41,619
She will.

684
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:44,622
The doctor's been trying
to stop her for eight years now.

685
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,332
You think she'll listen to us?

686
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:49,376
Jin-dal, what should we do? What do we do?

687
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:52,671
What do you think?
We need to try and stop her.

688
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:53,672
-Goodness.
-Yes.

689
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:55,591
We need to find a way.

690
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:58,844
Seriously.

691
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,889
-Hey, Sam-dal.
-Whoa. What?

692
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:04,350
You.

693
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,101
Yong-pil dumped you.

694
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,853
Why suddenly bring that up now?

695
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:09,688
When you broke up eight years ago,

696
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:12,691
you said that he dumped you.

697
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,779
That's right. So what about it?

698
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:18,822
I don't get it.

699
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,616
I see.

700
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,118
Did he regret dumping her?

701
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,412
No matter how I look at it,

702
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:29,792
Yong-pil's behavior,
words, actions, and so on all…

703
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,378
All what?

704
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,588
-Seems like love.
-Damn it.

705
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,048
What are you talking about?

706
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:38,300
I think he still likes you.

707
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:41,261
-Don't be ridiculous!
-Look. Think about it.

708
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,056
Since she came back,
he's always hanging around her.

709
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:45,599
Cheon Chung-gi, that jerk.

710
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:49,269
He mistook him for your boyfriend
and caused a huge ruckus.

711
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,813
He even followed you to Seoul.

712
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:54,191
If that isn't love,

713
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:56,151
I don't know what is.

714
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:58,445
-Am I right?
-Yeah.

715
00:44:58,529 --> 00:44:59,988
I knew it from the beginning.

716
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:02,324
She's the only one who doesn't know.

717
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:03,867
What are you talking about?

718
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:07,371
I bet Yong-pil regretted
dumping you so much.

719
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:09,706
Why? Because in a breakup,

720
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,793
the one who dumps their partner
suffers more later on.

721
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:15,587
But she had a really hard time
when she was dumped.

722
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:20,175
All right. Let's not rub salt
into each other's wounds.

723
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,593
She sounds so awkward!

724
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:22,886
-It doesn't hurt!
-You see her?

725
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,430
Don't laugh. It doesn't hurt.

726
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:25,597
It doesn't. I'm fine.

727
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:26,765
-I'm fine.
-Look.

728
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:27,975
I apologize.

729
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:30,811
Forget it! It doesn't hurt.
What's with you?

730
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:35,566
Still, whatever it is,
I felt really grateful to Yong-pil.

731
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:39,236
While we were causing trouble
without even knowing about her condition,

732
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:42,448
Yong-pil found the hospital
and referred her to the doctor.

733
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:47,536
He discovered Mom's condition
and took her there eight years ago too.

734
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,624
-We're all guilty.
-Right.

735
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,460
-We are.
-Yeah.

736
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:55,961
Enough about that.

737
00:45:57,504 --> 00:45:58,505
From now on,

738
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:02,217
let's find a way to keep her
out of the water for good. Okay?

739
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:04,178
-Let's do it.
-Yes. Okay.

740
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,305
We have to find a way, okay? Cheers.

741
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:07,306
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

742
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,975
What if we give her a monthly allowance?

743
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:13,896
I already mentioned it,
but she said she'd never accept it.

744
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:15,272
-She won't take it?
-Why not?

745
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:19,610
I don't know. She went on about how
she hadn't done anything to deserve it.

746
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:21,195
You know what she always says.

747
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,574
AS THEME PARK CONSTRUCTION CONFIRMED

748
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:28,202
Secretary Ko.

749
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,287
Yes, sir?

750
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:33,332
Why is our theme park located

751
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:39,171
in Namdal-ri of all places
on an island as large as Jeju?

752
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:41,006
Who decided this?

753
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:42,716
The chairman, I presume.

754
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:44,927
I see.

755
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:49,223
There could be a better place though.

756
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:53,810
Should we finalize this so hastily?

757
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,949
Why didn't you tell me?

758
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:09,701
No one stopped her.

759
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:10,911
Let's go. Mom--

760
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:21,547
I was a bit mean, wasn't I?

761
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:23,840
Right.

762
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:27,511
I'm mad at him because I was angry
that he didn't tell me.

763
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:29,388
But being grateful is separate from that.

764
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:32,641
After all, he did take care of Mom
when we weren't around.

765
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:34,851
I should tell him I'm grateful for it.

766
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:37,980
CHO YONG-PIL

767
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,857
But why didn't I come to visit?

768
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,443
No, it's not that I didn't. I couldn't.

769
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,904
That's right!
I couldn't come because of him.

770
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:47,614
Darn it. Forget it. I won't do it.

771
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,123
Hey, come on out.

772
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,209
My goodness!

773
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:02,546
How did you come out so fast?

774
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:03,672
It was telepathy.

775
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,050
What are you talking about?

776
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:10,721
Well…

777
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:12,806
Since you're here…

778
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,311
Can we talk?

779
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:20,522
Before that, let's go somewhere.

780
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,483
What? Where…

781
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:28,405
Forecaster Kang.

782
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,950
Why isn't the flower-print buoy
in Samdal-ri today?

783
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,870
It belongs to the haenyeo
who was in that accident.

784
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:36,288
Really?

785
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:39,333
I see. That's why Yong-pil was so…

786
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,793
Sir, how did you know
about the head haenyeo's buoy?

787
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,295
She's the head haenyeo?

788
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:45,464
Yong-pil's the guardian of that buoy.

789
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,674
-What?
-What?

790
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,761
Mr. Cho always watches
the flower-print buoy on that screen.

791
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:53,555
That's partially why
she was rescued quickly.

792
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:11,948
I became a forecaster
to protect my loved ones.

793
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,285
Hey, come here.

794
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:27,881
What a gaudy buoy.

795
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,010
Still, it looks pretty and unique.

796
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:37,432
What's this?

797
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:40,644
Dad!

798
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:44,564
I thought we agreed on
not touching each other's stuff.

799
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:55,867
Sang-tae, are you getting off work?

800
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:56,993
Yes.

801
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,996
That's a pretty buoy.

802
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:00,956
Whose is that?

803
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:03,458
It's Ms. Ko's buoy.

804
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:04,960
When she had that accident,

805
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:07,838
it floated to Namdal-ri's rest area,
so I brought it back.

806
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:13,552
Does anyone else use
a buoy with floral patterns on it?

807
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:17,097
In Samdal-ri, Ms. Ko is the only one.

808
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:19,933
See you!

809
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:20,892
Sure, bye.

810
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:33,029
Gosh, Yong-pil…

811
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:37,951
So he changed Ms. Ko's buoy
to a floral pattern to keep an eye on her?

812
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:39,244
So that she'd stand out?

813
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:42,581
And he was the only one who knew
she had a heart condition.

814
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:45,000
He must've been worried
she'd get sick in the water.

815
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:49,296
That means he didn't move
to Seoul because of Ms. Ko.

816
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:55,469
Does Yong-pil still like Sam-dal?

817
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:58,638
Are you serious? Come on,
you and I know the answer to that.

818
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,141
Would you give up
on your dreams and stay here

819
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:04,811
to protect the mother
of a girl who you didn't even like?

820
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:08,899
I didn't think it was true, but he really
hasn't moved on for eight years.

821
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:11,193
Yong-pil's so…

822
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:16,072
By the way, she must've dumped him
because she didn't like him then.

823
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,491
But what about now?

824
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:21,536
Right, I don't think
Sam-dal dislikes Yong-pil.

825
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,996
-Right?
-Yeah.

826
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:25,874
But why are they beating around the bush?

827
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:29,169
I'm so frustrated.
There hasn't been any progress.

828
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:30,212
Jeez.

829
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:34,591
I think there's something
really big getting in their way,

830
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:35,884
but you don't know, do you?

831
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:21,346
That's strange. Based on the currents,
it should be somewhere here, but it's not.

832
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:23,682
Let's just go up until the end there.

833
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:27,644
Stop looking for it.
She's not going to dive anymore.

834
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:29,521
She doesn't need a buoy.

835
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:33,191
Did you throw away your cameras
because you quit photography?

836
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:36,152
Are you insane? They're so expensive.
I'm keeping them well.

837
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:38,321
Exactly. Whether Mom quits or not,

838
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:42,284
it's her buoy, so you should
let her decide what to do with it.

839
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:47,706
If you don't, she'll be running around
all over the place here starting tomorrow

840
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:48,790
in her current state.

841
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:55,672
-Hey…
-You…

842
00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:59,050
Are you…

843
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,094
still mad at me?

844
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:06,433
No, of course not. I'm just…

845
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:10,020
I'm sorry.

846
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:16,192
I didn't tell you about her condition.

847
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:18,904
I'm sorry.

848
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:22,866
Actually, if it were me,
I would've been very angry too.

849
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,200
But yesterday,

850
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:27,412
I was so upset about Mom

851
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:31,666
that I said the wrong things.

852
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:32,709
I'm sorry.

853
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:34,377
But…

854
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:37,756
it's not your fault.

855
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:42,010
You've been worried over that?

856
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,639
Of course. How could I not be?

857
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:48,725
After hearing what I said,
I bet you were mad and blamed yourself.

858
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:49,976
It's pretty obvious.

859
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:54,898
Thanks.

860
00:53:57,233 --> 00:53:58,777
You are grateful, aren't you?

861
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,820
I'm the only one who understands you.

862
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,489
No.

863
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:06,409
I mean, thanks for staying
by my mom's side and protecting her.

864
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,245
Whatever the reason was
for not telling me,

865
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,082
I'm grateful for what you've done.

866
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:15,126
If you were in my place…

867
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:19,422
If my mom were sick,
you would've done the same.

868
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:23,259
Your mom is my mom.

869
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:24,970
My mom is your mom.

870
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:31,935
What? Is it a bit cringeworthy
to hear it again after all this time?

871
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:36,106
But we heard it all the time
up until we were in high school.

872
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,443
Exactly.

873
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,407
Cho Yong-pil, don't do that again. Okay?

874
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:49,077
All three of her daughters are back.
We'll take care of her now.

875
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,580
You can stop worrying about
and taking care of my family.

876
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:54,416
If you don't stop…

877
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:58,378
You know how awkward it is between us now.

878
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,803
How could you say that?

879
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,139
You're mean.

880
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:11,391
You're so mean. Jeez.

881
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,811
Right. You paid her hospital bill too.

882
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:16,771
-That's--
-Why would you pay my mom's bill?

883
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:18,606
I told you it wasn't me.

884
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,817
Stop lying. What's your account number?

885
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,319
Maybe I really should've paid the bill.

886
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:25,321
Fine. Pay me back.

887
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,115
-Yeah. Tell me.
-Give it. Pay me back.

888
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,033
Your account number.

889
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:31,578
My account number is…
I'll use this instead. This works, right?

890
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,621
What are you doing? Give it. Stop joking.

891
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:35,540
No, I'm going to use it to pay myself.

892
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:37,208
What are you doing? Give it back!

893
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:39,002
What? You said you'd pay me back.

894
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:40,712
My phone. Give it back now.

895
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:42,172
-I don't want to.
-Stop.

896
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:43,798
I'm not going to give it back.

897
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:45,467
-You'll regret it.
-No, I won't.

898
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:48,053
-I told you. You'll regret it.
-I'm going to buy shoes.

899
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:53,933
I told you you'd regret it.
What did I say?

900
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,727
You should've given it when I asked.

901
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:59,731
-Let it go.
-Why?

902
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:01,733
You just ate one. Be fair. This is mine.

903
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:03,777
No, I didn't eat one.

904
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,236
-You did!
-I didn't.

905
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:09,741
It's mine.

906
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:11,910
I told you to let it go, didn't I?

907
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:13,953
You… Get over here.

908
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:16,873
What are you going to do?

909
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:18,166
I've got you now!

910
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:20,919
Let me go! Don't!

911
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:21,920
Give it to me now.

912
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,506
-Give it!
-Stop!

913
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:27,509
Park Ji-sung shoots. Goal!

914
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:30,178
Hey, they scored!

915
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:31,554
Goal!

916
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:43,650
Get over here.

917
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:46,152
-Why are you running? Why?
-Damn it. Hey!

918
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:55,453
What is this? Tell me. What is this?

919
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,290
Well, it's obvious.

920
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:01,042
It's just cloth.

921
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:02,127
Cloth?

922
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:04,587
Just cloth?

923
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,256
Not cloth for Ko Mi-ja's buoy?

924
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:13,304
Dad, this is--

925
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:17,225
Why would you make a buoy for her?

926
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:20,687
Forget it. Pack your things.

927
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:22,814
Pack up your things now.

928
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:23,773
Go to headquarters.

929
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:25,817
Go to headquarters in Seoul!

930
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:29,863
What was it?

931
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:33,366
"Do you still resent her?"

932
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:36,244
Yes.

933
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:38,037
I hate her!

934
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:39,956
Until the day

935
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,417
I close my eyes,

936
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:44,461
until the day I die,

937
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:45,837
I'm going to hate her!

938
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,132
If you hate her…

939
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:54,512
do I have to hate her too?

940
00:57:59,017 --> 00:57:59,934
What?

941
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:03,980
You should hate her.

942
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:07,650
You should hate her too.

943
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:10,945
Your mom… Why did your mom die?

944
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:12,655
Who was the one to cause her death?

945
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,407
She didn't die because of anyone!

946
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:16,159
Dad.

947
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:21,289
She didn't die because of anyone.
You know it's not true!

948
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,167
Dad, I…

949
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,670
I've never hated her.

950
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:31,299
When Mom died,
and when I broke up with Sam-dal,

951
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:34,093
I've never hated her.
No, I can't bring myself hate her.

952
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,264
You…

953
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:40,475
Don't you see me?

954
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:44,812
When I think about that day,
my heart still sinks.

955
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:49,609
My heart keeps breaking for your mother!

956
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:50,985
What about me?

957
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:54,781
You think I'm okay, Dad?

958
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:59,327
I am also cramming everything in here.

959
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:02,038
I'm holding it in. It almost pops out
a dozen times a day,

960
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:04,374
but I cram it in every day like this.

961
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:07,126
I'm holding it in every day.

962
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:14,133
But what? I can't even do this?

963
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,095
Can't you at least let me do this?

964
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:19,347
Goodness.

965
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:21,391
You…

966
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,017
Don't tell me

967
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:25,728
you still like her.

968
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:31,359
Is that why?

969
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:36,406
Hey.

970
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:38,992
It's been eight years.

971
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:41,035
Okay?

972
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:45,540
For eight long years,
he's kept Cho Sam-dal

973
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:48,376
in his heart.

974
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:50,378
Gosh, seriously.

975
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,839
Our Yong-pil…

976
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:57,719
didn't even show it to us once.

977
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:00,888
What a fool.

978
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:03,266
He's the biggest fool in the world.

979
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:07,979
Why in the world are you so drunk?

980
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:13,568
Unrequited love is a really painful thing.

981
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,487
"Unrequited love"? No.

982
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:19,824
It's only love if you can see it.

983
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:23,786
He looks at her in secret
and becomes heartbroken.

984
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,204
He hides, looks again,

985
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:28,416
and gets heartbroken.
That's not unrequited love.

986
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,001
But…

987
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:33,921
for eight years,

988
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:36,257
Yong-pil didn't see Sam-dal even once.

989
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,134
Why?

990
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:39,510
She didn't visit.

991
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:41,054
She didn't come here.

992
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:44,474
Continuing to like a girl
you don't see for a while?

993
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:46,976
He's a pervert.

994
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:49,896
Love doesn't always need to be visible.

995
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:54,776
Men love with their hearts,
not their eyes.

996
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:57,737
He's a pervert. I'm sure of it.

997
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,572
-Who's a pervert?
-My goodness.

998
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:01,616
Why are you so startled?

999
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:03,368
Wait.

1000
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:05,870
Am I the pervert?

1001
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:08,247
No. It's not that.

1002
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,499
-Really?
-It's nothing.

1003
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,751
What brings you here though?

1004
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:14,212
-To buy some beer.
-I see.

1005
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:15,755
It's still early. What's with him?

1006
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:17,048
He's drunk.

1007
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:18,883
It's Cho Sam-dal.

1008
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:25,431
She made a man's heart
ache for eight years.

1009
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:26,432
It's Cho--

1010
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:29,477
You're so drunk.
You must be tired. Go to sleep.

1011
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,436
There you go.

1012
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,063
Aren't you going to go buy beer?

1013
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,315
I'll just stay and drink here.

1014
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:37,860
I felt bad drinking around my mom,
so I'll just have a can here.

1015
01:01:38,736 --> 01:01:39,612
Sure.

1016
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:46,452
So…

1017
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,037
-Sam-dal.
-Yeah?

1018
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:51,457
Why didn't you come
to Jeju for eight years?

1019
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,292
You didn't even visit your parents.

1020
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:55,378
Right.

1021
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:59,507
Mom and Dad came to Seoul often
to make side dishes for me.

1022
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:01,759
That's right.

1023
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:04,554
Ms. Ko and Uncle Pan-sik
went to the mainland often.

1024
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:06,222
-Yeah.
-That's right.

1025
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:12,812
Why did you cut off
contact with all of us?

1026
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:16,941
That's…

1027
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:20,361
It's not that I did it on purpose.

1028
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:25,408
I was pretty busy,
and it just ended up like that.

1029
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:32,749
It wasn't because you didn't want
to see Yong-pil,

1030
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:34,834
was it?

1031
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:38,254
Come on.

1032
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:41,799
Why would I stop contacting you guys
because of Yong-pil?

1033
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:43,259
-No way.
-Right?

1034
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:46,012
Because of Yong-pil?

1035
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:48,681
Listen, because of you,

1036
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:56,481
he gave up on joining HQ
and was stuck here for eight years.

1037
01:02:58,107 --> 01:02:59,108
His heart…

1038
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:02,987
His heart was absolutely destroyed.
Did you know?

1039
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:04,197
I'll put him to bed.

1040
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,907
Wait. Leave him be.

1041
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:09,035
What do you mean?

1042
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:13,289
THE PRIDE OF SAMDAL-RI!
CHO YONG-PIL IS HERE!

1043
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:33,351
CHA EUN-U

1044
01:03:45,446 --> 01:03:48,157
What are we going to do about Sam-dal?

1045
01:03:49,742 --> 01:03:51,953
Gyeong-tae couldn't keep
his big mouth shut.

1046
01:04:36,455 --> 01:04:37,540
What did he say?

1047
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:41,836
He said you were stuck
in Jeju because of Sam-dal.

1048
01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:48,801
What do you mean he was stuck here?

1049
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:51,137
Our pure-hearted Cho Yong-pil,

1050
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:54,849
the guy who only had eyes for Cho Sam-dal,

1051
01:04:56,642 --> 01:04:59,979
wanted to protect your mom, Ms. Ko,

1052
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:02,106
so he gave up his dream

1053
01:05:03,524 --> 01:05:04,984
of going to Switzerland,

1054
01:05:06,777 --> 01:05:07,820
and he's been stuck here.

1055
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:15,328
What are you talking about?

1056
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:19,749
What do you mean he gave up
his dreams to protect my mom?

1057
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:21,334
The flower buoy.

1058
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:25,421
Do you know
why Ms. Ko's buoy has a floral pattern?

1059
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:31,302
Because Yong-pil has put that cloth
on her buoy for eight years.

1060
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:32,386
Why?

1061
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:36,349
So it would stand out
on the Meteorological Center cameras.

1062
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:40,394
He gave up all his dreams and kept…

1063
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:44,065
He's kept this up for eight years.

1064
01:05:59,997 --> 01:06:00,998
Are you okay?

1065
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:10,716
What's the matter with you?

1066
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:14,428
Why do you keep asking me that?

1067
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:19,100
Why do you keep asking if I'm okay?

1068
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:21,727
Why would you ask?

1069
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:25,439
Why do you keep worrying about me?

1070
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:26,691
Why…

1071
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:31,696
Why did you give up
on your dreams for my mom's sake

1072
01:06:32,446 --> 01:06:35,783
and stay stuck here? Why?

1073
01:06:35,866 --> 01:06:39,912
Why? Why would you do that?

1074
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:46,419
You're drunk. Get a hold of yourself.
We'll talk about this later.

1075
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:50,131
You should get a hold of yourself.

1076
01:06:51,048 --> 01:06:53,384
You, Cho Yong-pil.

1077
01:06:53,467 --> 01:06:55,386
Come to your senses.

1078
01:06:58,389 --> 01:06:59,390
Do you know

1079
01:07:00,057 --> 01:07:02,351
why I didn't return to Jeju?

1080
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:06,689
Do you know who made it impossible
to come to Jeju?

1081
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,443
Do you know why I stopped contacting
Gyeong-tae, Eun-u, and Sang-do

1082
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:13,654
and isolated myself?

1083
01:07:15,656 --> 01:07:16,657
Do you know?

1084
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:29,795
WANG GYEONG-TAE
LET'S DRINK UP~

1085
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:52,318
CHA EUN-U
ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE THEM! FRIENDS FOREVER

1086
01:07:55,696 --> 01:07:57,948
UNFOLLOW

1087
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:15,174
I tried so hard to forget you.

1088
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:17,384
I tried so hard to erase you
from my memories.

1089
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,639
Why do you keep asking if I'm okay?

1090
01:08:23,557 --> 01:08:25,226
Why do you keep worrying about me

1091
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:28,813
and taking care of me?

1092
01:08:29,814 --> 01:08:30,898
Why do you keep…

1093
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,777
making me waver?

1094
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,240
This is so embarrassing.

1095
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:41,742
Hey, Sam-dal.

1096
01:08:43,702 --> 01:08:44,995
Are you okay?

1097
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:47,623
Let's find the real Cho Sam-dal.

1098
01:08:48,415 --> 01:08:49,416
Get your hands off her!

1099
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:55,673
Cho Sam-dal, are you okay?

1100
01:08:56,632 --> 01:08:58,968
Trust me. Nothing will happen to her.

1101
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:00,594
Are you okay?

1102
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:06,600
What are you going to do
if I really do lean on you?

1103
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:27,413
Wait.

1104
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:54,083
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

1105
01:11:22,194 --> 01:11:23,862
Cho Sam-dal, what did you say?

1106
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:25,155
By any chance…

1107
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:27,491
Is it because of what happened yesterday?

1108
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:29,660
It did happen.

1109
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:31,495
Actually, I saw something amazing.

1110
01:11:31,578 --> 01:11:33,205
-What?
-What was it?

1111
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:35,082
Hey!

1112
01:11:35,165 --> 01:11:36,292
You think you know

1113
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,377
Cho Jin-dal as well as I do?

1114
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:40,296
I've never stopped liking Sam-dal either.

1115
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:42,506
This time, I'll do whatever my heart says.

1116
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:44,842
Stop seeing her.

1117
01:11:45,342 --> 01:11:47,636
I'll never accept Sam-dal.

1118
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:49,763
You confessed.

1119
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:51,140
You said you liked me.

1120
01:11:51,223 --> 01:11:52,808
And I said I liked you too.

1121
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:58,355
