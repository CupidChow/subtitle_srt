1
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:40,999
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

2
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,031
Mi-ja…

3
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:19,537
There was a time when our lives
were consumed by sadness.

4
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,087
Honey! Where are you going?

5
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,341
Honey, this isn't the time. Not now…

6
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,550
Mom.

7
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,139
Honey, please don't…

8
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,934
Let go of me.

9
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,062
Sang-tae…

10
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:46,940
Sang-tae.

11
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,902
Please let me go inside.

12
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:55,490
Please let me say good-bye to Mi-ja.

13
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:56,574
Sang-tae…

14
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,455
Sang-tae.

15
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,124
Just once.

16
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,960
Please give me one chance
to say goodbye to her.

17
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,838
I want to see her one last time!

18
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:14,676
Please let me say
goodbye to her, Sang-tae.

19
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,638
You should've died by yourself!

20
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:21,432
Why did you kill my daughter?
You should've died by yourself!

21
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:26,813
Why did you take my daughter? Why?

22
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,109
Get out! I said get out!

23
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,361
-Ms. Yang.
-Why?

24
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,658
-Get out!
-Ms. Yang.

25
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:41,661
-I'm sorry, Ms. Yang.
-Get out!

26
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:42,912
-Ms. Yang.
-Oh, God!

27
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,831
I don't want to see you! Get out!

28
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:50,295
FUNERAL

29
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:11,441
I can't go on without you!

30
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:15,111
I can't go on, Mi-ja!

31
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:20,533
Enduring this sadness
in our own ways was difficult,

32
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:34,672
and we didn't have the strength
to embrace each other's pain.

33
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,140
BU MI-JA, KO MI-JA

34
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,768
BU MI-JA

35
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:57,320
Our sadness simply left
too much pain back then.

36
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:10,625
EPISODE 14
WHEN YOUR TEARS DRY OUT

37
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,186
Unbelievable.

38
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,647
He's still acting like that?

39
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,234
He let out all that anger
on Mom back then.

40
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,945
She kneeled and begged him
for forgiveness for years.

41
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,239
That's right.

42
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,741
I was young at the time,
but I still remember.

43
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,327
She felt so guilty
she couldn't leave the house for years.

44
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,955
And he's been like this ever since.

45
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,291
That's not true.

46
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:55,586
He acted this way eight years ago
so Yong-pil and Sam-dal would break up.

47
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,589
Then, he'd been quiet for some time,

48
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,091
but now he's started again.

49
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:04,095
Dad, what did you say? Eight years ago?

50
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:08,516
Does that mean they didn't want
to break up with each other?

51
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,435
It was because of Mr. Cho?

52
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,604
Seriously? Holy cow.

53
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,816
So is he angry again now
because of those two?

54
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,444
Because they still
clearly like each other?

55
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:25,575
Can you two also tell
they like each other again?

56
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,702
It's not "again."

57
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:31,539
It looks like they never stopped
liking each other.

58
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,919
I knew it was strange that Sam-dal
could never meet a decent guy

59
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,629
after breaking up with Yong-pil.

60
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,007
I heard Yong-pil's been single
all this time.

61
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,967
So isn't it obvious, Dad?

62
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:47,430
They weren't an ordinary couple.
They've always been together since birth.

63
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,932
It must've been too hard to move on.

64
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,146
I feel terrible for Mom.

65
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,522
That no-good…

66
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,107
-Hold on.
-Where are you going?

67
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,069
I'll end this matter with him
once and for all.

68
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,654
Dad, please. Just stay put for now.

69
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,490
Mom's already tried once.

70
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:06,616
Didn't you see her?

71
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,533
She's right.

72
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,369
I've never seen her
confront Mr. Cho like that before.

73
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,455
She'd felt so bad
she couldn't even talk to him.

74
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:15,374
Mr. Cho seemed pretty surprised too.

75
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,709
Of course, he was.

76
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,005
It was the first time in 20 years
I heard Mom mention Ms. Bu.

77
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,467
It wasn't her choice
to not mention her for 20 years.

78
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,470
She just couldn't.

79
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,849
She couldn't dare to.

80
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,800
CHO YONG-PIL HAS DONE IT
FIRST CONCERT AT OPERA HOUSE

81
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,677
You think you're the only one in pain

82
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,846
and the only one who's grieving her?

83
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,224
I'm in just as much pain as you are.

84
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,353
And I miss her just as much as you do.

85
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,688
I do too!

86
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,024
I miss Mi-ja too!

87
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,938
If the tide had been slightly higher,
you would've been in huge trouble.

88
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:46,567
What possessed you
to go there during high tide?

89
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,486
Didn't you see the warning sign?

90
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,456
Yong-pil, we need to talk.

91
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,218
Yong-pil.

92
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,678
Yeah?

93
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,347
When we were kids,

94
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:22,395
remember how I'd always cut my tongue
eating candy because I forgot to chew it?

95
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,024
Of course, I do.

96
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,404
That's why I always told you
when to chew it.

97
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,406
Right.

98
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,743
We always did that
ever since we were kids.

99
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,372
But after we broke up,

100
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,543
I realized I still hadn't learned to chew.

101
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,339
I guess I thought
you'd always be around to tell me.

102
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,679
So did you keep cutting your tongue?

103
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:58,848
No.

104
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,309
I stopped eating candy after that.

105
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,812
Because every time I cut my tongue…

106
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,150
it would remind me of you.

107
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,237
And then, it would hurt again.

108
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,115
So I just stopped eating candy.

109
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,659
I worked like a dog

110
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,995
and avoided anything
that was related to you.

111
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,292
Well, it didn't really work out.

112
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,346
But you were different.

113
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:40,806
What do you mean?

114
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,517
It seems you didn't try to avoid…

115
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,313
or forget about me.

116
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:54,695
The theme for Magazine X's
summer photoshoot this year

117
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,073
is mirrors.

118
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:08,459
It feels like there was never a moment…

119
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,378
CHO YONG-PIL

120
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,922
when you weren't a part of my life.

121
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,757
FIRST PHOTOGRAPHER OF 2023, CHO EUN-HYE

122
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,265
Weren't you in pain?

123
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,146
I was.

124
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,194
It hurt.

125
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,656
But…

126
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,870
What if I tried so hard to forget you…

127
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,002
that I really did forget you?

128
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,676
What if I missed you

129
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,052
and wanted to see you so much

130
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,180
that I tried to remember your face…

131
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,437
but couldn't remember it?

132
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,234
You mean so much to me.

133
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,408
Sam-dal, you see,

134
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:27,496
I didn't want to be without you
for a single moment in my life.

135
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,622
That's why…

136
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,711
I didn't forget about you.

137
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,694
Yong-pil…

138
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,199
I don't want a one-sided love.

139
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,203
No, I won't do it.

140
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:12,124
We tried to move on for eight years,
but it didn't work. So what can we do?

141
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,252
Isn't a one-sided love so unfair for us?

142
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,421
So let's just…

143
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:20,716
Let's do it.

144
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,885
Let's just be together.

145
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,641
Let's just be in love, okay?

146
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:35,606
Okay.

147
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,029
Let's do that.

148
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,365
Love.

149
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,410
Let's be in love.

150
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,043
-Sam-dal.
-Yes?

151
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,839
Even if my dad keeps refusing to
accept us,

152
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,887
you can't let me go like eight years ago.

153
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:07,888
I won't.

154
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:09,848
I won't let you go now.

155
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:13,310
I'll never let you go again.

156
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,313
By the way…

157
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,859
Even if your dad
never gives us his blessing,

158
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:26,073
let's always hold onto
each other even if it hurts.

159
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,285
-Okay?
-Okay.

160
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,246
Okay.

161
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,397
I'll get going now. Bye!

162
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,577
What's this pity party
you're throwing by yourself?

163
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,288
Pour me a drink too.

164
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,631
Sang-do.

165
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,093
How about just confessing
your feelings to Sam-dal?

166
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,931
I know everything. I've always known.

167
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,517
You're so persistent too.
How many years has it been?

168
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,394
Jeez.

169
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:38,896
Gyeong-tae thinks

170
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:42,191
Yong-pil and Sam-dal
are trying to get back together.

171
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,693
So tell her before it's too late.

172
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,320
Tell her?

173
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,615
-What happens if I do?
-If she says no, then that's that.

174
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:53,077
It'll be at least better
than suffering alone for a decade.

175
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,121
I'll feel better,
but Sam-dal will feel terrible.

176
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,122
That's…

177
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,670
That's something she'll have to deal with.

178
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,464
You know what?

179
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,843
When I said I liked someone,
she was so eager to help me.

180
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,223
She's never had feelings for me.

181
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,018
If I tell her I've had feelings for her,

182
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,188
she'll be the one who has to deal

183
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,899
with feeling sorry and uncomfortable.

184
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,445
That'd be so selfish of me.

185
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,531
Come on, Sang-do.

186
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,451
I never had a chance.

187
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:39,123
I mean, after around 30 years,
even the most well-built buildings

188
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,250
are bound to form cracks too.

189
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,335
So how is it possible…

190
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:46,839
that I still…

191
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,302
don't have even the slightest opening

192
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,097
to get in between them?

193
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,073
AS Group…
I'm the one who hates them the most!

194
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,285
Just the thought of them
sends chills down my spine!

195
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:25,836
I see…

196
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,756
Okay, I understand.

197
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:36,805
What is it?

198
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,348
Isn't it a system error?

199
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:42,186
My credit cards were working
just fine this morning.

200
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,146
Sir…

201
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,191
I think things have tipped over the edge.

202
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,734
What?

203
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,906
What do you mean?
You're making me nervous.

204
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,451
What's wrong, Secretary Ko?

205
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,163
What? Are you talking about Mom?

206
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,248
Yeah.

207
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,795
We were shocked too. I've never seen her
act that way towards him.

208
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,632
Where's Mom? Outside?

209
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,009
And what exactly is your plan?

210
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,094
To console her?

211
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,889
Look, just play dumb.

212
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,474
Don't be ridiculous.

213
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,809
For crying out loud.

214
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,939
Then what? Are you going to
break up with Yong-pil again?

215
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,526
-What?
-Just play dumb

216
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,028
and get back together with him.

217
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,074
I see.

218
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:38,617
Think about it.

219
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,746
She spoke her mind to Mr. Cho
for the first time in 20 years.

220
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,831
She faced him head-on.

221
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,749
Don't you know why she did that?

222
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,084
It's obvious to me.

223
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,213
If you guys break up again,

224
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,632
Mom will feel eternally guilty about it.

225
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,009
Do you understand?

226
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,096
Yes.

227
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,142
I know it worries you,

228
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,937
but leave this matter to the elders.

229
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:10,065
And don't blame them later on.

230
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,361
Look at you acting like a big sister.

231
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,530
I was always the big sister.

232
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:20,325
If you understood, go tell Yong-pil now
that you want to get back together.

233
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,828
What are you talking about…

234
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:28,709
Hey! If you want to persuade Mr. Cho,
you need to be in a relationship first.

235
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:34,131
Are you going to get back together
only after he gives you his blessing?

236
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,384
Go now. Go and say
you want to get back together.

237
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,929
-If you can't, I'll do it.
-Are you crazy? Why would you do that?

238
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,724
-Yong-pil!
-We're already back together!

239
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,476
What did you say?

240
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,979
We already got back together.

241
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,023
What? You're back together? Why?

242
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,357
I mean, since when?

243
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,985
-Yesterday.
-Yesterday?

244
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,529
God, I feel so betrayed.

245
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,991
Were you two being all lovey-dovey
while we were in chaos yesterday?

246
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,452
My goodness, look at her smile.

247
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,162
Tell us.

248
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,205
Unbelievable.

249
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,623
Come on!

250
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,707
About what?

251
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,125
Does it feel good?

252
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:11,585
Yeah.

253
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:19,009
CHO YONG-PIL 6TH ALBUM
WHEN YOUR TEARS DRY OUT

254
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,606
What is it?

255
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,567
Yong-pil and I are back together.

256
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,863
I won't force myself to hold back anymore.

257
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,366
We'll never be apart again.

258
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,288
So Mom,

259
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,332
don't feel guilty about us.

260
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,543
Don't be sorry.

261
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:02,803
Good job.

262
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:06,932
You did well.

263
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,571
-Quick.
-Are you sleeping outside?

264
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,156
Huh?

265
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,076
You said these were useless and heavy.

266
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,955
Hey, when did I say that? I like items
that make things cozy like these too.

267
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,790
You're going with Sam-dal, aren't you?

268
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,543
Just how many collars
are you wearing? Look at this fool.

269
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:35,752
Two.

270
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,087
See you.

271
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,215
Look at him skipping away. Jeez.

272
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,760
I'm so jealous.

273
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,554
So jealous!

274
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,523
By the way, why did you go to Sagyemul?

275
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,609
Was it because you could see
the Tyndall effect well?

276
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:00,652
Yeah.

277
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,446
How did you know?

278
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,614
There's nothing I don't know.
I know everything.

279
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:10,454
But the Tyndall effect is best seen
during sunrise on oreum volcanic cones.

280
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,747
Really?

281
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,124
Should we go see it
the day after tomorrow?

282
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,168
The clouds will be low,
so you'll see it well.

283
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:20,672
We'll have to go up early
in the morning for the sunrise.

284
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,674
Right, since the sun's rising.

285
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:23,759
Or how about this?

286
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,845
Why don't we go camping tomorrow?

287
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,765
-Camping?
-Yeah.

288
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:30,849
So…

289
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,769
You want to spend the night there?

290
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:34,686
Yeah.

291
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,438
Just the two of us?

292
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,275
Should we invite Gyeong-tae?

293
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:43,820
Hey, why would you
bring him along when it'll be us two?

294
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,697
Let's go.

295
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,967
What else do I need?

296
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,429
It'll be cold,
so I should bring hand warmers.

297
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,347
Let's see…

298
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,809
I think they were here. Where are they?

299
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,978
Here they are.

300
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:21,942
But would I really need them?

301
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,243
It's still warm.

302
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:33,995
And they're really heavy.

303
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,283
What in the world are you doing?

304
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,412
What are you doing in my house?

305
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:16,997
What? Mom?

306
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,083
Sit down and eat, Yong-pil.

307
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,128
-It's sea urchin and seaweed soup.
-What?

308
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:31,178
Why are you standing there?
Aren't you going to eat?

309
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:34,264
Have you gone insane?

310
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,893
Why would I eat this?
Leave while I'm asking nicely.

311
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,353
If not, then go to your room.

312
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:43,148
I'm here to feed him.

313
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:44,858
Sit down, Yong-pil.

314
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,484
What?

315
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:49,863
Okay.

316
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:54,618
You little…

317
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,747
Why are you making food for my son?

318
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,082
Sang-tae,

319
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,503
he's my son as well.

320
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:06,671
Don't you remember?

321
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,885
Just like how my three daughters
are also Bu Mi-ja's daughters,

322
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,846
Yong-pil's my son too.

323
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,098
Mi-ja and I made a promise.

324
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,185
Can't a mother feed her own son?

325
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,313
You're his mother?

326
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,316
You killed his mother!

327
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,318
I never killed her!

328
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,780
If so, then why am I still here?

329
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,823
I would've been locked up ages ago!

330
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,494
Have you lost your mind?

331
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:42,165
Have you decided to forget
everything you've done and act out?

332
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:45,543
I've been begging you
for forgiveness for 20 years.

333
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,129
After that long,
how could I possibly be sane?

334
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,841
Since I lived like a sinner,

335
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,594
it turned my children into sinners too.

336
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,763
I won't live like that anymore.

337
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:58,390
For Mi-ja's sake

338
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,433
and for our children's sakes,

339
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,811
I'm not going to do that anymore.

340
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:08,483
My goodness, you really have gone crazy.

341
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:09,567
Goodness.

342
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:15,615
I'll put soup in the fridge.
Heat it up and have it for dinner!

343
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,461
It's been bottled up for 20 years.

344
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,132
Yong-pil,

345
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:37,721
don't resent your father,
no matter what he does.

346
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:44,936
I won't be able to face your mother
if you do. You got that?

347
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,938
Goodness. Like mother, like daughter.

348
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,815
Sam-dal said the same thing.

349
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,900
I got it, so don't worry.

350
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,030
Eat up.

351
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,574
-Put the rest in the fridge.
-Okay.

352
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,200
-I'm going.
-Okay.

353
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,079
Thank you for the food.

354
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,142
Dad.

355
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,563
What is it?
Are you happy that she cooked for you?

356
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:30,315
Yes, I'm pretty happy.

357
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:35,987
You should come out and take a look.
See who she made the food for.

358
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:41,326
Who likes top shells without cucumbers,
sea urchin and seaweed soup, and bracken?

359
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:43,953
They're your favorites, not mine.

360
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:47,749
It's obvious
that she made all of it for you.

361
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:51,336
Dad, don't throw out the food anymore.

362
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,297
Okay?

363
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,478
Sam-dal!

364
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,856
-Cho Sam-dal!
-Coming!

365
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,691
-Ms. Cho!
-Ms. Cho!

366
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,944
What in the world?

367
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,530
-My goodness!
-Ms. Cho!

368
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,323
How are you here?

369
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,742
What are you doing here?

370
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,037
Wait, what happened?

371
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:10,081
We said we'd come join you
after helping you.

372
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,917
No matter how small
the exhibition is, you still need ADs.

373
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:13,835
That's right.

374
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:18,339
But there's not much to do right now.
I've only been taking photos.

375
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,760
I'm glad we came.
I knew this would happen.

376
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:25,263
You're taking the photos
all by yourself without any help.

377
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:26,181
That's right.

378
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,226
I'm not exactly alone.

379
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,062
They did provide someone
who's a sort of helper.

380
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:49,412
It would've been so much better
if I'd known you were coming today!

381
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,541
So this is your house.

382
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,502
I've never seen you like this before.

383
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:58,588
You looked so sophisticated
and cool back in Seoul…

384
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,717
What? Do I look uncool now?

385
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:09,098
No, now you just seem
like a neighborhood friend.

386
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,393
Then, treat me like one.

387
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,604
-No, I can't do that.
-Right.

388
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:16,356
Oh, right!

389
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,441
For just in case,

390
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:22,654
I brought filming equipment and props
just in case you needed them.

391
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,572
What should we do first?

392
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:28,201
Hey, you just got here.
Why are you so eager to work?

393
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:30,912
You have nothing to do today.
First, just rest. And then--

394
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,330
Sam-dal, we have to go work!

395
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,002
He said, "We have to go work."

396
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,045
Well…

397
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:41,339
Give me a minute.

398
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,092
-Just rest. And eat this.
-Okay.

399
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,134
I'll be back.

400
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:49,848
I won't be long.

401
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,182
Let's go work.

402
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:55,144
Hey, they're here to work with me,
so you can't mention that.

403
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,855
But we agreed to go--

404
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,524
I'll try to slip out after
telling them to rest.

405
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,984
-Just wait a bit, okay?
-But--

406
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:04,320
-Timing's--
-Ms. Cho, we're ready to work.

407
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:15,248
Girls, you can't go camping
on your first day. It'll be exhausting.

408
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,167
She's right.
You won't be able to sleep well.

409
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:21,254
And there's no place to wash up,
so it's a bit uncomfortable.

410
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:22,171
Exactly.

411
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,090
The two of us will handle it today.

412
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:26,551
There's a lot of pretty coffee shops
along the beach.

413
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:28,678
-Go there and--
-Ms. Cho, that's enough.

414
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,390
We came to Jeju to work,
not do a tour of coffee shops.

415
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:35,310
You're the one who said,
"Hey, Eun-bi. Let's go to work."

416
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:37,979
Right.

417
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,316
Why did I do that?

418
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,319
And it's normal not to shower or sleep.
It's a on-location shoot.

419
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:48,197
By the way,
this KMA exhibition is amazing.

420
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,241
They even paired you with an employee.

421
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,661
The weather's so nice.

422
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,550
Look how well-behaved she is.

423
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:14,474
Is she really the same ferocious Ms. Yang
from yesterday?

424
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:17,226
She seems to calm down quick
after throwing a fit.

425
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,186
-Right.
-Right.

426
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,395
Goodness.

427
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:23,900
I don't know if it's her dementia
messing with her memory

428
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:29,197
or if it's because of how much
she misses her daughter.

429
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,032
-Goodness.
-Probably both.

430
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,744
Goodness. By the way,
I wonder how Ms. Ko is doing.

431
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:38,581
Ms. Yang pulled a fistful
of her hair out yesterday.

432
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:43,628
The good news is
she's always had a lot of hair.

433
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:44,587
For goodness' sake.

434
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,923
Fortunately, she didn't lose all her hair.

435
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,977
-Is she okay?
-Hey, Sang-tae.

436
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:44,981
Wasn't she shaken up yesterday?

437
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:47,525
She wasn't, but I was.

438
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,696
Has she been taking her medication?

439
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,448
Maybe I have dementia too.

440
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,158
I keep forgetting to give it to her.

441
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,497
Mother, make sure to take your medication.

442
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,250
-I'll head to work.
-Okay.

443
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:07,795
Sang-tae.

444
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:12,884
Mi-ja…

445
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:17,305
Don't resent her too much.

446
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,809
Why would I resent my wife?

447
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:23,519
Don't worry.

448
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:39,535
Yes, I sent it through express mail.

449
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:40,995
Are you sure there's a vacancy?

450
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,289
Yes, they're only hiring
those with experience.

451
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:46,125
So you have a shot
as long as AS doesn't get in the way.

452
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,002
You had a high performance rating too.

453
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,421
Of course, I did. I was at the top.

454
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,342
But I'm not sure.

455
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:57,762
I know you want to
return to work, Jin-dal.

456
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,224
Yeah, I do.

457
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:06,479
Anyway, thanks.
I'll treat you once I'm back.

458
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,872
SAMSONGJANG MOTEL

459
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:31,587
Wait. Why is he coming out of that place?

460
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:34,674
Secretary Ko.

461
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:36,509
Yes, sir?

462
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:42,640
I'm paying you three times more
than what my brother used to pay you.

463
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,142
That's right.

464
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,602
So how could you make me
spend the night here?

465
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,981
My back is killing me.

466
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,774
I said I'd pay you back in Seoul.

467
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:56,279
Still, I'm not rich enough
to spend 500,000 won on a hotel room.

468
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,572
This was the best I could do.

469
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,865
You have a credit card.

470
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:03,077
As soon as the words "motel"
or "hotel" appear on my credit statement,

471
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,495
my wife will kill me.

472
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,706
But if just you tell her the truth--

473
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:09,792
If I told her the truth about how my boss

474
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:13,754
was caught trying to secretly move
the theme park from Namdal-ri to Samdal-ri

475
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,715
and was abandoned by the chairman,

476
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:18,009
then I'll probably
be looking for a new job.

477
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,386
The chairman didn't abandon me.

478
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,224
How did my father find out so quickly?

479
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,734
Hey. I'm glad you're here, Jin-dal.

480
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:39,238
-Hello, sir.
-Everyone left this morning.

481
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,448
Where did they go?

482
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,533
-Back to Namdal-ri.
-What?

483
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,493
All the townspeople are upset.

484
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:47,246
They feel betrayed.

485
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,957
How could he ask busy people
to take time out to meet

486
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,667
and then just leave like that?

487
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,294
I'll look into it.

488
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,837
Gosh.

489
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:57,882
Jeez.

490
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,428
There he is.

491
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,890
Secretary Ko.

492
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:09,143
Keep driving. Don't stop.
Don't stop the car.

493
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:10,728
What?

494
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,146
Hey, what in the world?

495
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,482
-Hey, Jeon Dae-yeong!
-Okay.

496
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,539
Sir, you can't run away like this forever.

497
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,376
Ms. Cho deserves an explanation.

498
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:40,967
How can I explain after I boasted
about how she could trust me?

499
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:44,387
Then, going back to Seoul
and persuading the chairman…

500
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:48,182
He even froze my corporate card.
Don't you know what that means?

501
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,810
He wants me off this project.

502
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,436
What's your plan then?

503
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,688
What do you think?

504
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:58,484
I have to bring the project
back to Samdal-ri at all costs.

505
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,490
-I love it here!
-Me too!

506
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,118
-It's so pretty!
-This is so nice!

507
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:09,912
Well…

508
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:14,333
Your friends over there from the mainland…

509
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,251
are so innocent.

510
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,463
-So pretty!
-Does it look good?

511
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,798
I want to take one too.

512
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:28,639
I guess they're not the considerate type
who think about how others feel.

513
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:29,890
Yeah…

514
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:34,312
By the way, how many tents did you bring?

515
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,523
I brought two of them.

516
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:40,568
But we have to split into pairs.

517
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,320
Three people can't fit into one.

518
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,322
Ms. Cho, come here quick!

519
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,406
Hurry up!

520
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:48,659
Let's do it.

521
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,871
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

522
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,419
This is my first time
drinking wine outdoors.

523
00:38:58,502 --> 00:38:59,837
Tell me about it.

524
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,506
I can't believe you brought wine.

525
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,799
Well, the idea was

526
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:05,676
to have a cozy time--

527
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,511
It's totally cozy and the mood's amazing.

528
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,266
All of this must've been
very heavy to carry.

529
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,269
That's right. It was really heavy
when I was carrying all this.

530
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,897
I also carried the tents,
so my shoulders are--

531
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,065
-Really?
-Yeah, right here.

532
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,274
Want me to massage them?

533
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,942
-Yeah, right there.
-Here?

534
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:23,486
Here.

535
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:24,737
Here?

536
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:29,408
Ms. Cho, you seem to have changed
a lot after moving back to your hometown.

537
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:30,785
Me?

538
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,828
She's right. You've definitely changed.

539
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,705
You even speak differently.

540
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,041
Don't be ridiculous. I'm still the same.

541
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,459
No. Back in Seoul,

542
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:42,755
you always looked tense and focused
because you didn't want to make a mistake.

543
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:46,217
But you look so much at ease here.

544
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:49,512
We're drinking,
and you're not even recording.

545
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:53,349
You even recorded yourself
out of caution when you drank alone.

546
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:57,395
Come to think of it,
I've never recorded myself in Jeju.

547
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,357
Maybe it's because you're with someone
you're comfortable with.

548
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:04,068
Hey, I was comfortable with you too.

549
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,569
-Really?
-Of course.

550
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,488
-It's true, right?
-Cheers to that.

551
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,369
It's cold though, isn't it?

552
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,079
-I think so.
-You're cold? Hold on.

553
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:20,751
You can use this.

554
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,795
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

555
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:24,296
Thank you.

556
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,381
Here's your blanket.

557
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:34,515
What is it?

558
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:37,435
What?

559
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,352
Nothing.

560
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,149
By the way,

561
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:46,986
I'm guessing you two
didn't get new jobs at other studios.

562
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:52,241
We did receive all kinds of offers.

563
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:56,370
If you've worked under Ms. Cho,
you gain a lot of respect in our industry.

564
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,288
I see.

565
00:40:57,913 --> 00:41:01,125
So why are you waiting for me?
Who knows when I'll go back to Seoul?

566
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,460
Find another job already.

567
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:03,627
We don't want to.

568
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,005
We're only going work for you.

569
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:08,466
Your house seemed pretty spacious earlier.

570
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:09,467
We could clean it.

571
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,010
-I'm in.
-Are you insane?

572
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:13,554
Why would you give up
on your careers? Don't quit!

573
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:15,848
We won't, and we'll always stick with you.

574
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:16,932
Me too.

575
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,477
Jeez.

576
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:23,564
Who told you to come here
and say such moving things?

577
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:26,692
Cheers.

578
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:27,693
Cheers.

579
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,269
LUCKY CONVENIENCE STORE

580
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,354
Hey, Sang-tae.

581
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,482
Dae-seong, where are you headed?

582
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:07,566
To the restaurant.

583
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,527
-They need some change.
-I see.

584
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,321
Are you drinking by yourself again?

585
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:17,785
Let's drink together. I'll come back
after I give them the money.

586
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,954
Sit here and drink, okay?

587
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:21,539
-Okay.
-Okay.

588
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:23,290
All right.

589
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,202
Get lost before I beat you up.

590
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,524
Yong-pil and Sam-dal

591
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:33,902
didn't see each other
for eight years. Not even once.

592
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:35,613
Don't provoke me.

593
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:39,074
But they still liked each other
that whole time.

594
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:43,245
Like father, like son.

595
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:44,330
What did you say?

596
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,999
Have you lost your mind and want to die?

597
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:48,208
I have!

598
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:51,295
You only thought about your late wife,

599
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:54,590
and you ignored your son's suffering
for the past eight years.

600
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,511
What?

601
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:02,306
How dare you be so brazen?

602
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:08,062
What more do you want?

603
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:13,901
After your wife passed,
every night for ten years,

604
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:16,236
my wife cried by herself under a blanket!

605
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,696
-Okay?
-You little…

606
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:22,618
She couldn't tell anyone
because of her guilt.

607
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,662
And she cried under a blanket!

608
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:25,871
How dare you, Pan-sik?

609
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:28,749
Do you really want to die tonight?

610
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,420
-Damn it.
-You bastard.

611
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,505
Pan-sik, you little…

612
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,215
What do you know?

613
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:38,467
And you?

614
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:42,638
How about you? What do you know?

615
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:44,014
Pan-sik, you little…

616
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:48,060
How dare you, Pan-sik?

617
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,941
Why are you guys fighting?

618
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,151
Why you…

619
00:44:58,821 --> 00:44:59,780
You know nothing.

620
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:03,659
My vision keeps getting blurrier,

621
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,786
and my memory falters.

622
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:09,915
Some days,

623
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,544
I can't remember what she looks like,

624
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:18,257
so I stare at her photo all day.

625
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,468
So what do you know?

626
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:24,096
You don't know anything!

627
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,159
All done.

628
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:59,506
Enjoy. The tangerines should be good.

629
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:04,052
Everything's set.
Excuse yourself from the uninvited guests.

630
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:08,932
It's him, right?

631
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,435
The Paris Magazine Gallery's
sole visitor, Cho Yong-pil.

632
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:14,605
You're childhood friends?
And you're doing the exhibition together?

633
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:18,233
Are you two dating by any chance?

634
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,151
Hey!

635
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:22,696
She came here
after what Cheon Chung-gi did to her.

636
00:46:22,779 --> 00:46:24,406
You think she'd want to start dating?

637
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,910
-Right.
-Right?

638
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:29,244
I'm sorry.

639
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:33,540
Should we call it a night?

640
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,751
It's late. Just leave this here and go in.

641
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:37,002
-Is that okay?
-Of course.

642
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:37,920
Okay.

643
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:41,840
It's cold, so make sure to wrap
your sleeping bags around you, okay?

644
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:42,883
Good night.

645
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,176
Ms. Cho, wait!

646
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,012
-What?
-Isn't Forecaster Cho in there?

647
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:51,767
Yeah, but this tent is for two people.
So I'll just sleep here.

648
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,143
What?

649
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:56,230
We've known each other
for 38 years. It's okay.

650
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,273
You can relax and go to sleep, okay?

651
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:00,567
But still, that's not right.

652
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,528
We're both slim, so just squeeze in.

653
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:03,946
I sleep on my side anyway.

654
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:06,490
Squeeze in for what?
Just relax and sleep. It's okay.

655
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:08,325
Don't make it uncomfortable on yourself.

656
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:09,952
-Let's just sleep together.
-Girls.

657
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:10,911
Really. I'm okay.

658
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,746
-We're okay too.
-But I'm--

659
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:14,540
-No.
-I said I'm fine!

660
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:15,958
I'm okay!

661
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:18,502
-It's okay!
-Girls!

662
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:20,379
We're dating.

663
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,512
We're dating.

664
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:29,805
So it's okay.

665
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:12,097
Gosh.

666
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:33,619
I'm sorry.

667
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:38,373
I had no idea they'd suddenly come here.

668
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,084
I'm sorry, okay?

669
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:44,087
What's their problem, anyway?

670
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:46,423
We said we're dating,
but why did they stop us?

671
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:47,966
Just why would they do that?

672
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:51,970
I told them we'd only been a couple
for two days, so they--

673
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:54,306
It doesn't matter how many days it's been.

674
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:57,517
I bought wine and hung up lights
for the first time in my life.

675
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,102
I pulled out all the stops.

676
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:01,396
Come on, I said I was sorry!

677
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,399
I was excited too. I didn't even bring
hand warmers on purpose.

678
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:05,484
Why not?

679
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:11,198
Because I have you to keep me warm.

680
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,411
Let's go again another day, okay?

681
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:18,872
All right.

682
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:21,249
But are they going to tag along again?

683
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:24,044
No, we'll leave them behind
no matter what.

684
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,338
Really?

685
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:27,881
Yeah, let's leave them behind.

686
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:31,551
Let's dispose them on
Hallasan Mountain so deer can use them.

687
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:37,140
I know they seem a bit clueless,

688
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:39,851
but they're really special to me.

689
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,144
I could tell.

690
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:43,146
They really like you.

691
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,231
They do.

692
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,316
They're great,

693
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,277
and yet I left them behind.

694
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:57,077
Get on Bus 7780 headed for Bongsan
and get off at Samdal-ri.

695
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:35,949
Hello, Mr. Cho.

696
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:01,641
Even though

697
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:04,853
I said how against it I was…

698
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,649
do you have to keep seeing her?

699
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:13,570
Yes.

700
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,286
Why?

701
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,580
Because…

702
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,042
Sam-dal's the only one for me.

703
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,964
Just like how Mom
was the only one for you.

704
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:38,678
I…

705
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,974
can't live without Sam-dal.

706
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:47,145
Bu Mi-ja is the woman
you'll forever love and remember.

707
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:50,816
And for me, that's Sam-dal.

708
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,445
So,

709
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:58,782
even if it's not as much as Mom…

710
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:05,247
could you think about me too now?

711
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:03,972
What…

712
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,724
What's up with your head?

713
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:07,559
Cho Yong-pil's hair.

714
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:09,519
Doesn't it look the same as his hair?

715
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:11,104
My dear friend…

716
00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:13,899
It makes me want to crush your head.
Are you crazy?

717
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:15,442
Don't look anything like him.

718
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:17,152
Really?

719
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:21,281
Too bad, I spent a lot of money
so you like it.

720
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:24,409
Hey, Cho Sang-tae

721
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:26,703
Why do you like me so much?

722
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,082
I don't know. I just love everything
about you.

723
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:34,252
I like you from head to toe. Everything.

724
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:36,254
There's no reason for liking someone.

725
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:39,341
My heart belongs to Cho Yong-pil.

726
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:43,136
There's no place for you in my heart.

727
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:44,304
I'm fine with that,

728
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,598
because you are in my heart.

729
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:49,476
Even though your heart is
full of Cho Yong-pil for now,

730
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,103
I might eventually have some chance

731
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:53,897
to get into your heart.

732
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:57,859
What if you never get the chance?

733
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,028
Well…

734
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:02,614
I can't help it.

735
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:19,631
Let's go, Ha-yul…

736
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:21,049
What?

737
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:22,258
Where did she go?

738
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:23,969
Cha Ha-yul!

739
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:27,722
Why are you coming from there?

740
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:29,432
Wear this.

741
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,269
This is Aunt Jin-dal's.

742
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,271
Why would I wear it?

743
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,232
You need a necklace around your neck.

744
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:39,317
Really?

745
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,320
Then I'll wear mine. I have one too.

746
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:43,863
Just wear it.

747
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:45,448
It's pretty.

748
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:54,624
JEJU DOLPHIN CENTER

749
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,343
What is she so focused on drawing?

750
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:08,513
HA-YUL'S DREAM IS…

751
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,058
I told you she'd have fun.

752
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:13,727
Thanks.

753
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,563
Hey, that's a pretty necklace.

754
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:18,565
This?

755
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:20,066
It's…

756
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:24,404
Thanks.

757
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,073
What's that?

758
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:28,533
This?

759
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:31,119
A gift for Ha-yul.

760
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:34,497
The placards Ha-yul made
for us last time were a total hit.

761
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,082
Everyone wanted to hold them.

762
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,460
I think she has a talent for art.

763
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:40,837
Really?

764
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,173
She donated her talents
to a good cause then.

765
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:46,009
-So this is for her?
-Yeah.

766
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:49,804
I was going to make placards
to protest against the theme park.

767
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,931
But did they move it back to Namdal-ri?

768
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:54,768
Yeah.

769
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:58,229
Why are you sighing?
Isn't that a good thing?

770
00:55:58,313 --> 00:55:59,814
I heard all the haenyeos voted "No."

771
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:03,568
The theme park needs to be built here
to stop my mom from diving.

772
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:07,530
Well…

773
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:11,409
My mom has a heart condition,
so she shouldn't be diving.

774
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:13,495
But she still insists on doing it.

775
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:16,206
At least the theme park
would prevent her from diving.

776
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:17,290
I see.

777
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:21,044
I didn't know she had a heart condition.

778
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:22,796
Yeah.

779
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:27,801
What about you? Were you against it
because of the dolphins?

780
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:29,010
That's right.

781
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:32,180
Loud noises can be dangerous for them.

782
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:35,558
Construction would be so noisy.

783
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:42,023
My mom is extremely stubborn.

784
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,777
She could put herself
in danger while diving.

785
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:49,864
She doesn't even think about
her concerned daughters.

786
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:55,662
You can just dive with her then.

787
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:57,580
What?

788
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:59,874
You can just dive with her
if you're worried.

789
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,000
You were a swimmer.

790
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:05,213
Well, that is true.

791
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:10,135
No, that's ridiculous. I'm not a haenyeo.

792
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:13,847
Then, become one. What's stopping you?
You said you're worried about her.

793
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,599
That's true.

794
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:19,477
Mom.

795
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:21,855
Hey, Ha-yul.

796
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:23,815
Come, sit down.

797
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:31,698
All right.

798
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,324
Here, this is for you.

799
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:37,203
This is for drawing
the placards so nicely.

800
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:40,206
I see. Thank you.

801
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,293
You wanted to grow up fast, right?

802
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:45,295
Then, drink that so you can grow tall.

803
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,130
Okay.

804
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:50,341
Ha-yul, I want to keep you
small like this.

805
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,260
I don't want you to grow up fast.

806
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:57,182
Mom, it would be terrifying
if I remained this size forever.

807
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:13,406
SUBMIT YOUR APPLICATION
FOR THE WORLD METEOROLOGICAL ORGANIZATION

808
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:16,910
Gosh. You're dying to go, aren't you?

809
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:18,995
Hurry and sign up.

810
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:21,456
Forget it. I'm not going.

811
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:25,084
Don't you think it's a waste
of your skills to be stuck here in Jeju?

812
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:28,922
Soon, you'll be too old to go.

813
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:31,299
I said forget it. I'm not going.

814
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:34,093
What do you have to lose? Just sign up.

815
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:44,312
Hello?

816
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,314
Hi, how are you?

817
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:49,234
Mr. Cho suddenly requested leave
and didn't come to work.

818
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:51,611
Is something going on?

819
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,196
What? My dad?

820
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:58,159
Dad.

821
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:01,287
Dad.

822
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,360
What?

823
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:34,946
What are you doing here then?

824
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:37,448
Do you have any idea
where he could have gone?

825
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,453
Yong-pil.

826
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:47,000
I know where he went.

827
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,087
I think he went to my mom.

828
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:55,341
Then, that means

829
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:57,969
he's at the temple?

830
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:00,638
Yeah.

831
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:04,726
I just called them.

832
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:06,811
They said he was there.

833
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:10,273
I think he packed up
and went this morning.

834
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:19,532
You know what?

835
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:25,955
I had gotten my hopes up.

836
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:31,628
I thought maybe he'd finally care
about my feelings.

837
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,257
But I was wrong.

838
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:41,971
Get up. Let's go pick him up. Okay?

839
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:46,142
I don't know what to do.

840
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:51,272
He's built this big wall around himself.

841
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:53,483
And it just won't break down.

842
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:57,904
Now,

843
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:02,033
I don't know what to do anymore.

844
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:08,956
Yong-pil.

845
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:57,231
What is it?

846
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:01,527
Did you come here by yourself
to get an earful from me?

847
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:07,575
You can give me an earful if you want.

848
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:13,289
Don't you resent me?

849
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:15,833
Aren't you afraid of me?

850
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:18,419
No.

851
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:22,340
I've never resented or been afraid of you.

852
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:24,550
How come?

853
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:29,430
Because I know you don't actually hate me.

854
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:34,185
You just…

855
01:03:36,437 --> 01:03:39,357
loved Ms. Bu very much.

856
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:45,655
I remember how much you adored me.

857
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:51,494
When I was young, you'd always say,
"Be my daughter, Sam-dal."

858
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:52,912
You used to say that.

859
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:02,922
What made me sad was

860
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:08,177
the same man who adored me so much…

861
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:12,557
became someone who resent me overnight.

862
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:17,144
You just changed.

863
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,231
It really broke my heart.

864
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:30,116
Didn't you come here to persuade me?

865
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:34,579
I just came here to whine.

866
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:42,295
It's just something
I've always wanted to say.

867
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:47,383
You can resent me all you like,
but I'd never do the same to you.

868
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:52,972
Because I know why you feel that way.

869
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:03,900
I'm going to wait.

870
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:07,737
I'll hold Yong-pil's hand tight and wait.

871
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,577
I'll wait for you, Mr. Cho.

872
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:25,087
Sam-dal.

873
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:27,715
Yes?

874
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:32,595
You really can't live without Yong-pil?

875
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:37,558
You know the answer.

876
01:05:39,393 --> 01:05:41,771
I've always had feelings
for only Yong-pil.

877
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:46,067
And I'll probably only love him forever,

878
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:48,736
until the day I die.

879
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,833
You see this hackberry tree?

880
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:04,293
Think of me as this tree.

881
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:05,753
What are you talking about?

882
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:08,756
Even if none of the townspeople
care about it,

883
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:12,218
it still shields us from the wind
and gives us shade.

884
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:15,930
Just like this hackberry tree,
even if you don't love me back,

885
01:06:16,013 --> 01:06:18,516
I'll love you forever.

886
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:21,310
You mean it?

887
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:22,645
Of course.

888
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:25,356
I'll love you forever
until the day I die.

889
01:06:25,856 --> 01:06:27,191
I'll only cherish you

890
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:28,359
and…

891
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:29,735
only love you.

892
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:33,364
Oh, dear.

893
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:40,371
My goodness.

894
01:07:37,344 --> 01:07:38,345
Sam-dal.

895
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:42,683
What are you doing here?

896
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:46,687
Did you meet my dad?

897
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:49,607
Yes.

898
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:14,507
Sam-dal!

899
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:21,764
Mr. Cho.

900
01:08:28,687 --> 01:08:29,814
You two

901
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:31,315
have my blessing.

902
01:08:34,693 --> 01:08:35,569
Sorry?

903
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:41,700
You can be together!

904
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:04,014
Go ahead.

905
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:48,934
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

906
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:03,532
Cho Sam-dal…

907
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:06,410
CHO SAM-DAL CHOSEN
FOR THE JEJU AND WEATHER EXHIBITION

908
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:23,344
Hello, are you the reporter?

909
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:25,846
How are you?

910
01:10:57,378 --> 01:10:58,879
-Ms. Cho!
-Ms. Cho!

911
01:10:58,963 --> 01:11:00,965
What do we do with our exhibition?

912
01:11:01,048 --> 01:11:03,842
I don't know how the reporters found out,
but it's chaotic.

913
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:05,970
-But canceling--
-I won't do the exhibition.

914
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:08,180
I don't need to do it.

915
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:10,516
I found it! I found it!

916
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:11,642
It's Bang's alt account.

917
01:11:11,725 --> 01:11:14,186
You're in huge trouble now.
Let's part ways here.

918
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,980
-Part ways?
-Hey, Eun-hye…

919
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:18,649
-Please save me.
-Are you seriously out of your mind?

920
01:11:18,732 --> 01:11:21,694
Why do you intentionally become
the black sheep by helping me out?

921
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:23,654
Because I love you.

922
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:25,281
I love you.

923
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:28,200
Why would you give up in your hometown?

924
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:29,702
Let's have the exhibition here.

925
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:32,162
-Have it here?
-Yes, let's do it.

926
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:33,580
Let's not give up.

927
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:39,753
