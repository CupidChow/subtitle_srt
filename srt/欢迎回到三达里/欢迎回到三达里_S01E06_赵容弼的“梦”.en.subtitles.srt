1
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:40,999
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

2
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,214
Did you really

3
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:50,633
do that because of me?

4
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,620
CHO EUN-HYE SWARMED
BY PRESS FOR ABUSE OF POWER

5
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,126
You startled me.

6
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,961
What's wrong?

7
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,881
What are you looking at?

8
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,926
Just… That…

9
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,469
What is it?

10
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:37,972
Go home, will you?
Why are you always here?

11
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,224
Go home. Right.

12
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,310
I'm going home. See you.

13
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,732
Bye. Hey, I'm leaving.

14
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:48,817
Bye.

15
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:51,820
That nut job…

16
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,657
Hold on. What is she doing?

17
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,494
What? No, wait.

18
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,999
She sure found
her go-to place for drinking.

19
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,172
Sorry I'm late.

20
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,716
Why are you so late?
I've been dying to go home.

21
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,510
-I'm sorry.
-Bye!

22
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:16,469
Bye.

23
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,908
EPISODE 6
"THE DREAMS" BY CHO YONG-PIL

24
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:57,844
Gosh.

25
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,847
Oh, no. It's raining.

26
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,356
Gosh.

27
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:12,650
What?

28
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,736
Sang-do.

29
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,161
What are you doing here?

30
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,204
You'll go bald if you get rained on.

31
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,809
The forecast never said it'd rain today.

32
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,479
You've totally become a mainland person.

33
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,981
People from Jeju
never rely on weather forecasts.

34
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,775
Jeez.

35
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:56,402
Sang-do, my once kindhearted friend.

36
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:59,239
I've spent half of my life
on the mainland.

37
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,242
-Right.
-Eighteen years make me a native there.

38
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,661
Fine, you can be a mainland person then.

39
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,663
Did you know?

40
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:07,914
What?

41
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:10,124
My ideal woman used to be
a mainland person.

42
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,584
Really?

43
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,129
Wait. I'm a mainland person.

44
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,468
By the way, how did you know I was here?

45
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,806
Well, let's just say it was telepathy.

46
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,101
What are you talking about?

47
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,562
Where are you going this time?

48
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,023
It's going to rain! Put the top up!

49
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:21,571
Sang-do, your shoulder
is completely drenched!

50
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,365
It's okay.
As long as our mainland VIP stays dry.

51
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,285
Whatever. You'll blame me
if you catch a cold.

52
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,953
Lean it more to your side.

53
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,581
Or come in closer so we both stay dry.

54
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,210
Right. Okay.

55
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,222
Yong-pil.

56
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,724
Hey.

57
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,226
Funny running into you here.

58
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:55,772
Where are you going?

59
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,232
What about you?

60
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,447
Where are you running to in the rain?

61
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,907
Gosh, you're completely drenched.

62
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,200
Oh, me?

63
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:11,037
I just felt like running today, so…

64
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,996
What?

65
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:18,336
Anyway, why aren't you carrying
an umbrella in this weather? Take this.

66
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,253
Okay.

67
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,216
But why do you have two umbrellas?

68
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:24,884
What?

69
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,303
I thought…

70
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:33,101
I might run into someone
who needed an umbrella while running.

71
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:36,854
You know, it's nice.

72
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,525
What are you talking about?

73
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:44,070
Work on your forecasts instead.
You said it wouldn't rain.

74
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:47,532
Hey, I said it'd rain.
They just didn't believe me.

75
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:50,076
You need to earn their trust.

76
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,370
They don't trust you at all,
so they don't listen.

77
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,789
That's not true.
I actually have the best forecasts.

78
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,625
Yeah, right.
I'm sure they'd beg to differ.

79
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:03,714
Of course, I know
Ms. Cho would never do that.

80
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,927
She once asked about our magazine's
study abroad program.

81
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:09,929
She wanted to put Eun-ju in it.

82
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,890
So why would she do that?

83
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,392
Tell me about it.

84
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:18,646
It's so unfair how they terminated
the contract just from what Eun-ju said.

85
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:24,068
Could you talk to the magazine for us--

86
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,654
They're sensitive about it.
The truth doesn't matter.

87
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:29,365
If there's a hint of trouble,
all companies become wary.

88
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:33,870
Or maybe you could at least do
an interview and defend Ms. Cho?

89
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:34,829
Girls,

90
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,540
instead of this, look for new jobs
with another studio.

91
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,461
Sure, I know Ms. Cho
would never do such a thing, but…

92
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,046
you just never know.

93
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,634
I should get going. By the way,

94
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,428
that Magazine X project?

95
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,472
Apparently, Chung-gi did help
Eun-ju get it.

96
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,392
This is as far as I can help, okay?

97
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,522
Chung-gi cheated
and was humiliated for it.

98
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,819
How could he be such a loser
and take revenge for that?

99
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,907
Honestly, I can't believe
that editor either.

100
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,951
Ms. Cho declined
all the other magazines to work with her.

101
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,953
She even got a promotion for that.

102
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,747
But she can't say a word to help Ms. Cho?

103
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,916
It's not just her who's like that.

104
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,001
They're all hiding to avoid any issues.

105
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,127
By the way,

106
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,130
why isn't Ms. Cho doing anything?

107
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:29,717
She could sue Eun-ju
for defamation or something like that.

108
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,094
So why is she just sitting on her hands?

109
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,640
Who knows?

110
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,141
Let's go.

111
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,484
What?

112
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:47,485
What are you doing?

113
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:49,654
This is Ms. Cho's.

114
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,113
What?

115
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,412
Who are you?

116
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,541
Why are you touching my stuff?

117
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:06,587
I'm sorry. But this portfolio
is from our studio.

118
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:07,505
Excuse me?

119
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,465
It's ours.

120
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,760
It's ours. I recognize the jungle gym.

121
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,555
Ms. Cho's playground theme
for the Magazine X project.

122
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,973
That's the portfolio.

123
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:17,932
What?

124
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,685
PHOTOGRAPHER BANG EUN-JU

125
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:21,769
That dirty little thief.

126
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,479
I can't believe she stole from us.

127
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,190
That was the day
she came to pack up her stuff.

128
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,445
They have a meeting
about this today, right?

129
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,639
I haven't seen that reporter
from yesterday at all.

130
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,018
I bet he can't tell anyone I'm here.

131
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:02,977
Exactly.

132
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:07,398
But why did you get involved
when you came here to avoid reporters?

133
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,110
You're still just as short-tempered.

134
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,445
You haven't changed.

135
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:13,404
Right, Yong-pil?

136
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:14,822
She hasn't change one bit.

137
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,035
What? Right.

138
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,039
Guess what happens when you gain
more dating experience and money.

139
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:24,790
You change.

140
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,084
People change.

141
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,295
Stop acting like you know
everything about me.

142
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,256
People don't change that easily.

143
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,425
I don't think
she's changed one bit either.

144
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:37,970
If people changed in every situation,
they might as well be Transformers.

145
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:39,847
Hey, Sang-do.

146
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,809
That's not true.
It wasn't because of my temper.

147
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,687
Come on.
You've always been short-tempered.

148
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:50,274
Listen. That was the old me.

149
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,318
I'm not short-tempered anymore.
I've grown up.

150
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,987
I didn't lose my temper.
It was all by design.

151
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,989
I was planning to stand up for myself.

152
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:00,076
It was planned? Even the dashcam footage?

153
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,495
All by design? Man, you're incredible.

154
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,288
That's right! All by design!

155
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,290
Bye, Sang-do. I'll see you later.

156
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,417
What's up with her?

157
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,461
She lost her temper again.

158
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:12,838
People don't change.

159
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:14,965
She's so irritable.

160
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,260
I can't stand Yong-pil.

161
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,346
He hasn't changed either.

162
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,014
He's so obnoxious.

163
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,455
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR KO EUN-BI

164
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,375
Eun-bi.

165
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,794
What am I looking at?

166
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,587
It's your playground portfolio.

167
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,214
Eun-ju stole it.

168
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,467
She's using your portfolio
to do the Magazine X project!

169
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,094
She's unbelievable.

170
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:03,681
Eun-ju lied through her teeth
about the abuse of power and everything.

171
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:07,435
She put on an act to steal your work
and bring you down to take your place!

172
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,311
Unbelievable!

173
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,586
Sang-do!

174
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,505
Hey, why did you come back?

175
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,050
I'm sorry, but can you drive me
to the airport?

176
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,720
What for?

177
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,097
I need to go back to Seoul.

178
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,349
But why all of a sudden?

179
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,353
I need to check something.

180
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,815
Is something wrong? Check what?

181
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:56,984
Everything.

182
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:58,819
Every single thing.

183
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:05,326
I think I can finally ask Eun-ju now.

184
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,246
Then, go to Seoul.

185
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,373
Let's go together.

186
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:18,422
I'll come with you. Don't you think
it would be dangerous for you?

187
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,966
Forget it. Why would you need to go?

188
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,010
-I'll go with you.
-What's wrong with you?

189
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,595
Who knows what'll happen?

190
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,430
Sang-do, don't mind him and just go.

191
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:30,351
I'd like to,
but the engine isn't turning on.

192
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:47,284
I told you to give me the car keys,
not take me there.

193
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:49,703
The same goes you.

194
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,789
I have a lot of free time.

195
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,503
Just drop me off at the airport.

196
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,092
Sam-dal.

197
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,430
You weren't staying here
to avoid the reporters, were you?

198
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,594
Why did they break up in the first place?

199
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,761
Hey!

200
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,054
Can't I worry…

201
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,222
Darn it.

202
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,306
Come on!

203
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,560
Goodness!

204
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,938
What's the matter?

205
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,397
My goodness.

206
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,485
I can't believe
I celebrated giving birth to her.

207
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,071
Jeez.

208
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,584
You lunatic.

209
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,473
Stop the car.

210
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,308
Get out!

211
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,603
Stop right there, you bastard!

212
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,946
Come on, Mom!

213
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:33,325
I told you I didn't want to do this!

214
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,202
I didn't want to do it!

215
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,830
Seriously.

216
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,206
Damn it.

217
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,217
Wait.

218
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,176
Hold on.

219
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,137
What's the problem? What is it?

220
00:16:54,805 --> 00:17:00,227
Just talk to me. How will you
make a living if you just leave like this?

221
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:03,981
Hey.

222
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,235
You must really think I'm pathetic
because of the way I had to act here.

223
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,739
I'm Cho Jin-dal. Remember?

224
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,867
Do you know how many airlines
want to recruit me?

225
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,870
Wait, that's not what I meant--

226
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:18,954
This family…

227
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:26,712
Listen carefully.

228
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,048
From now on,

229
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,010
I'm going to follow my heart.

230
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,553
I'm not going to ever do…

231
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,098
anything I don't want to do.

232
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,449
SAMDAL-RI'S MASCOT
SAM-DAL'S HOUSE

233
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,077
Is your name Samdal too?

234
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,080
That's my aunt's name.

235
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:07,628
Your life must be as tough as hers.

236
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,840
You must be Ha-yul.

237
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,759
You're Hae-dal's daughter, right?

238
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,140
Goodness. You've grown so much.

239
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:24,561
We carried her on our backs
at the rest area when she was a baby.

240
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:28,398
I don't remember, but thank you.

241
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:35,155
Still, Hae-dal raised her well
by herself, didn't she?

242
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,949
All by herself. Poor thing.

243
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,535
They should've done the ritual back then.

244
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,412
But Ms. Ko refused and never budged.

245
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:47,209
You're right. The shaman suggested it.
She said the father wouldn't live long.

246
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,753
You should always heed a shaman's words.

247
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,256
That's right.
They should've done the ritual.

248
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,215
Ma'am.

249
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:57,511
Did my dad die because of my grandma?

250
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,680
What? No.

251
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,056
Of course not.

252
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,559
But that's what you just said.

253
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:07,437
You said my dad died,
because my grandma didn't do the ritual.

254
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,565
My goodness.

255
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,025
Sweetie, that's not what we meant.

256
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:17,739
My dad just left a little early,
because his time was up.

257
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,867
It wasn't anyone's fault.

258
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,828
If my grandma heard you say those things,

259
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,206
imagine how sad she would be.

260
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,584
Ha-yul, we're sorry.

261
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,377
We shouldn't have said that.

262
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:31,962
We're sorry.

263
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,505
What were we thinking?

264
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,090
We're sorry. Goodness.

265
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,578
Have you never seen a dolphin before?

266
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,539
Hi.

267
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,960
Why would an adult like you
use binoculars to look at dolphins?

268
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,838
They can be seen without them.

269
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:19,218
But I wouldn't be able
to tell them apart then.

270
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:23,388
Do you try to tell fish apart
before you eat them?

271
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,766
Dolphins are all the same.

272
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,143
Hey, kid.

273
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,896
I'm not a kid. I'm in the second grade.

274
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:34,107
Okay, kid in the second grade.
Dolphins are different from fish.

275
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,192
They have an IQ of 90,

276
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,277
and their emotional intelligence
is like ours.

277
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:41,323
They can sympathize and empathize
like you and I can. Okay?

278
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:43,659
I see.

279
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:49,915
Did you see the dolphin
that just leaped out? That's Namchun.

280
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,917
The one next to it is Palbong.

281
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,335
They're a couple.

282
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:57,756
And if you look closely,
you can see a baby dolphin named Oryong.

283
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,050
He's their son.

284
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,677
I see.

285
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,553
Oryong?

286
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,389
Namchun is always very playful.

287
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,391
I bet Oryong is too.

288
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:11,186
You must be close friends with Namchun.

289
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,522
Of course. We're best friends.

290
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,364
Cha Ha-yul!

291
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,037
Hey, kid. Be careful.

292
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:38,088
Have fun watching Namchun's family then.

293
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:41,925
Bye.

294
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,556
Who was that?

295
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,686
Just some guy who's a bit dumb.

296
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,564
Hey, don't hang out with weird strangers.

297
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,946
Let's go.

298
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,627
-One ticket to Gimpo, please.
-One ticket to Gimpo.

299
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:18,754
No, make that two.

300
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:21,089
What are you two doing?

301
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,841
Are you coming too?

302
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,803
-It's my day off tomorrow anyway.
-And I have a lot of free time.

303
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,431
Okay. Thank you.

304
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,642
Just go while I'm being nice, okay?

305
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:36,438
Can you pay for mine?
I'll send you the money later. Love you.

306
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,355
Hey…

307
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,232
Okay. Thank you.

308
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,446
PHOTOGRAPHER BANG EUN-JU

309
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,199
I love this concept.

310
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:50,243
It's giving off a Y2K vibe.

311
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,370
The colors will stand out too.

312
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:56,208
The jungle gym colors will be changed
to match the colors of the outfits.

313
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,627
-Sounds great.
-Gosh, Eun-ju.

314
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,629
I mean, Ms. Bang.

315
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,507
I didn't know you were this good.

316
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,593
You have great skills. Why didn't you
strike out on your own sooner?

317
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,428
I just put this together last minute.

318
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:12,641
And it's this good?
Now, you're just bragging.

319
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,184
She's being humble.

320
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:17,395
-Come on, you're too humble.
-You are.

321
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,314
-I love this concept.
-Me too.

322
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,406
About that theme, is it really…

323
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:31,785
yours?

324
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:37,457
Of course, it is.

325
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,585
Right.

326
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:44,548
Really?

327
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:45,590
What's the matter?

328
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,552
You think I stole it?

329
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:49,719
No.

330
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,267
Eun-ju, take your coffee with you.

331
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,268
I…

332
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,186
I'll put it on your desk.

333
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:02,649
I'm going to fill the slide with flowers.

334
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,943
I like it.

335
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:09,030
And I'm going to mix a variety of flowers
to make it more colorful.

336
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:09,948
-I see.
-I see.

337
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,658
With the same colors?

338
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,702
Yes, it'll be similar to this photo.

339
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,080
Isn't that Cho Eun-hye?

340
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,457
-It is.
-It's her.

341
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,153
-Hey, Yong-pil.
-Yeah?

342
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,074
No, I'll ask later.

343
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,660
Maybe we should've gone inside with her.

344
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,746
No, there's no need for that.

345
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:01,333
She'll be fine. It's Seoul.
And she's not a kid.

346
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:02,792
Right?

347
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:05,003
Wasn't that Cho Eun-hye?

348
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:06,296
Yeah, I saw her too.

349
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,256
Why is she here?

350
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,800
Could it be
because of editor Cheon Chung-gi?

351
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,010
Holy cow.

352
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,011
You're right.

353
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,847
-Her assistant is working with him.
-Right.

354
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,307
She must be here to confront them.

355
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,914
MAGAZINE X PROJECT PORTFOLIO
PHOTOGRAPHER BANG EUN-JU

356
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,188
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

357
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,898
Where is Mr. Cheon's meeting?

358
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,192
The meeting room down there.

359
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,319
Thank you.

360
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,408
Why did you tell her? Eun-ju is there.

361
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,326
What do we do? Should we stop her?

362
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:23,623
What about the models' hair,
makeup, and props?

363
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,792
It'll be your job to come up with them.

364
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,003
-What?
-What?

365
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,797
Hold on.

366
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,967
You need to tell us
the overall concept so we can prepare.

367
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:34,884
That's right.

368
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,136
Just come up with your own.

369
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,097
I know you'll do well.

370
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,516
Wait. Why do we have to come up with…

371
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,976
Do you have any ideas--

372
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:54,779
Goodness.

373
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:56,364
Ms. Cho?

374
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,408
Cho Eun-hye.

375
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,618
It's been a long time.

376
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,830
What brings you here?

377
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,058
I came to ask you some questions…

378
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,894
but I already know the answer to one.

379
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,521
Let me ask the other question.

380
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,902
-Eun-ju--
-Ms. Cho!

381
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,945
Please calm down…

382
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:40,533
Eun-hye, let's talk outside.

383
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:41,576
Stay out of this.

384
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:43,411
You can't cause a scene here like this.

385
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,621
Cause a scene?

386
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:47,582
Excuse me, Mr. Cheon.

387
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:52,212
Playground, jungle gym, slide, flowers.

388
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,048
Ring any bells?

389
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,634
Well…

390
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,846
You see…

391
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:07,268
People could have similar ideas.

392
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,396
They can come up with similar things…

393
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,236
What do you want to ask?

394
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,324
Ms. Cho.

395
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,375
Why isn't she picking up?

396
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,001
This is where they work?

397
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,461
-You didn't know, right?
-No.

398
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,965
I can't believe they had an affair
and even stole her work.

399
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:40,427
Sang-do, you check that side.
I'll check this side.

400
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,636
Okay.

401
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,311
What?

402
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,733
Do you think I stole your work?

403
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:05,618
You must still think
I can't hold a candle to you.

404
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:08,329
I can come up with
good ideas like these too.

405
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:27,348
That was just…

406
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:31,603
for reference.

407
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,397
It was for reference…

408
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,359
You came to confront me with this?

409
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,239
No, that's not why I'm here.

410
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,700
I'm here to ask you.

411
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,245
Did you…

412
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,249
really try

413
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,544
to kill yourself because of me?

414
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,051
What?

415
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,887
You came here to ask me that?

416
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:07,972
Why now?

417
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:09,557
"Why?"

418
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:14,020
Isn't it obvious? Because of me,

419
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,357
someone tried to kill herself.

420
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,988
Was it really because of me?

421
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,575
Because I gave you a hard time?

422
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,912
You should know the answer to that.

423
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,249
Yes.

424
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,210
I do.

425
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:38,962
It wasn't because of me.

426
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,006
I never mistreated you.

427
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,759
No matter how hard I think back,

428
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:48,304
I've never done anything
that would make you

429
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,432
want to take your own life.

430
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,270
I kept thinking to myself,

431
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:57,897
"Why would she do that?"

432
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,233
Why?

433
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,278
Was it really because of me?

434
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,372
No one will listen to you,
so you're going to keep sitting by?

435
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:19,502
Go back to Seoul and sue her.
I heard you could sue for defamation.

436
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:23,464
Why aren't you doing anything?
You said you never bullied her.

437
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,091
That's right. I didn't.

438
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,136
But…

439
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:31,973
who knows?

440
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,351
"Was it really because of me?"

441
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:39,230
"Did I bully her without realizing it?"

442
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:44,986
"Did my words hurt her feelings
to trigger her that day for some reason?"

443
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,364
"What if that was true?"

444
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,074
"What if…

445
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,746
she really tried to take
her own life because of me?"

446
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,377
If it wasn't because of me,

447
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,839
there wouldn't be any reason
for you to have done this.

448
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,884
My head was about to explode.

449
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,095
But…

450
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,974
when I saw you had stolen my work,

451
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,436
it made me think in a different way.

452
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,687
That maybe…

453
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,318
you just wanted
to bring me down to take my place.

454
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,744
Would knowing that change anything?

455
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,164
No one's willing
to hear you out right now.

456
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:40,917
It doesn't matter
if others won't believe me.

457
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,419
At least I should know the truth, Eun-ju.

458
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,007
Was it really because of me?

459
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,386
Did you really try…

460
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,599
to kill yourself because of me?

461
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:01,771
No.

462
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,985
You can't do this, Eun-ju!

463
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,737
Let's talk about this. Okay?

464
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,489
Eun-ju. Bang Eun-ju.

465
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,709
It wasn't because of you.

466
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,187
I don't think…

467
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,314
Shouldn't you go in there?

468
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,109
What should we do?

469
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:55,908
Hey!

470
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,368
Hey!

471
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,040
Hey, Eun-hye!

472
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,417
What did you do?

473
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,918
How could you?

474
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,546
How could you do that?

475
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,757
-How could you?
-Hey.

476
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:12,884
Get your hands off her!

477
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:27,356
Let's go.

478
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:30,443
Who are you?

479
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,780
Don't touch me, you piece of shit.

480
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,574
Unless you want to die.

481
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,135
It wasn't because of me.

482
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,305
She didn't do it because of me.

483
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,600
She admitted it wasn't me.

484
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,394
It wasn't me.

485
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,571
It wasn't because of me.

486
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,005
Did he find her yet or not?

487
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,121
Is it fun?

488
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:50,333
Do you brush your teeth because it's fun?

489
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,627
You do it because you have to.

490
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,296
Hey, you're only in second grade.

491
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,298
Look at this.

492
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:00,343
You don't have to do
a workbook for third graders.

493
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,719
I do.

494
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,055
Aunt Sam-dal said so.

495
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:08,434
She said I should work harder than others
if I want to achieve my dreams.

496
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,730
But you never tell me
what you want to become.

497
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:15,274
I'm going to secretly read
your diary when you're asleep.

498
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,192
Mom!

499
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,777
So tell me.

500
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,696
What do you want to be?
Your mom should know.

501
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,656
No.

502
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:22,823
Why not?

503
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,867
I'll tell you when the time is right.

504
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:27,745
I hate people
who are all talk and no action.

505
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,624
I can't become someone I hate.

506
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:34,460
Jeez.

507
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,838
You're so stubborn. Fine, I give up.

508
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:41,342
Come on. Don't bother her
when she's studying.

509
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,053
I'm not bothering her.

510
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,766
Gosh, those are tricky questions.

511
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:50,726
You're so smart.

512
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:54,230
What did you do today, Ha-yul?

513
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,273
I walked around town.

514
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,108
Did you really?

515
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,111
You must've walked
around the entire neighborhood.

516
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,029
Was it quiet and nice?

517
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,657
No, I don't like this neighborhood.

518
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,741
What?

519
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:07,618
Why not?

520
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:12,373
Is it because we don't have
those indoor playgrounds you like?

521
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,167
I'm too old for those now.

522
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,252
Then why?

523
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:21,007
Why do you not like this neighborhood?

524
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,425
What's the matter?

525
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,554
-Grandpa.
-Yes?

526
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:32,143
All the people in this neighborhood
pity me whenever they see me.

527
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,269
That's why.

528
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,292
-Are you done crying?
-What?

529
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,377
-What?
-Yeah.

530
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,087
Sorry about that.

531
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,055
Hey!

532
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,476
I didn't know you guys were here.

533
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,811
Yeah, we just ran into each other.

534
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,646
Right.

535
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:18,564
Here.

536
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,108
Hold this over your eyes.

537
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,069
Right.

538
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,571
And you can just drink it.

539
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,365
Okay.

540
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,621
Let's go back to Jeju if you're done here.

541
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:37,541
-You guys go ahead. I'm not done here.
-What?

542
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:41,504
Hey, Sam-dal.

543
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:49,553
I swear I've heard his voice before.

544
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,389
Is that really important right now?

545
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,933
It's infuriating how he glared at me.

546
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,727
Were you aware of this?

547
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,150
I'm still pushing forward with this theme.

548
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,653
Just pretend we came up with it first.

549
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:08,364
But you stole it.
You said there's even proof.

550
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,324
Just say she stole my idea.

551
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:14,245
-And I only went there to confirm it.
-But that's--

552
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,747
Why would I steal your idea?

553
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,292
What? What's going on?

554
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,671
And who was that guy from earlier?

555
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,423
Is he the guy from…

556
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,219
Do you still have questions to ask?

557
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,720
No, I have something to say.

558
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:34,640
Just like I did with him,

559
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,518
I'll give this to you too.

560
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,104
With my theme,

561
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:43,232
and with the same cameras,
lighting, and staff,

562
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:44,942
give it a try.

563
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,447
You think I can't do it?

564
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,116
Eun-ju,

565
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,870
I've never once thought

566
00:40:55,995 --> 00:41:00,708
that you couldn't do as well as me
or come up with good ideas.

567
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,880
But after today,
I can't help but feel that way.

568
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:06,964
What?

569
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:09,258
How far do you think
you'll get with stolen ideas?

570
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,637
-How long do you think that will last?
-Why drag me…

571
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,432
I can't believe
you're still being arrogant.

572
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,477
You're in no position to say that.

573
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,562
All your wonderful connections
abandoned you.

574
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,856
And you're still acting confident?

575
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:24,940
You're right.

576
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,943
I've lost everything thanks to you.

577
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,904
And it's really tough right now.

578
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,615
But no matter how tough things are

579
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,408
or how things don't go my way,

580
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:36,952
I'll always have a clear conscience.

581
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,250
Thanks.

582
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,212
I've learned many things thanks to you.

583
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,756
From you

584
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:50,382
to him

585
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,511
and everything else.

586
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,554
Every single thing!

587
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:59,225
I would've lived my life
without knowing all of this was fake.

588
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:05,773
Go ahead and take my theme
to see how far you can get.

589
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:11,695
Also, you should take out the flowers
from the slide. It's a bit tacky.

590
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:23,916
Hold on, sir!

591
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,545
-There's still someone inside.
-Sorry?

592
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,673
I just checked. Everyone's gone home.

593
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:33,133
Someone went in earlier
and hasn't come out yet.

594
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,218
That's right.

595
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,970
Maybe they went out the back door.

596
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,889
-There's more than one exit.
-But sir…

597
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,518
What should we do?

598
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,604
Where's the back door?

599
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,486
The back door was locked too.
Where did she go?

600
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,281
She's not picking up either.

601
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:57,241
Maybe she went home or to her studio.

602
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,618
Because of the reporters there,
I doubt it.

603
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,788
There aren't any flights now,
so I doubt she went back.

604
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,041
I don't know Seoul well,
so I have no clue.

605
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:09,420
Do you have any idea where she might be?

606
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:11,797
SEOUL BANK

607
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:15,134
Hold on, Sang-do.

608
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,469
-What?
-Call me if you see her.

609
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:19,638
Hey, Yong-pil!

610
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,690
Where has she gone to this time?

611
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,291
Please, Mom.

612
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:50,419
Can you please buy me a camera?

613
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:53,714
I really want to become
a photographer, Mom.

614
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,424
Mom, I promise

615
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:58,218
I'll make it one day
and give you a comfortable life. Okay?

616
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:02,097
Mom, please.

617
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:05,768
Please buy me a camera.
I'll work really hard.

618
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:09,021
I swear I'll do my best,
so please buy me one.

619
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:11,023
Please!

620
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:15,027
See? I told you
I was good at taking photos.

621
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,655
Even my university acknowledged my talent.

622
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:21,033
It was all thanks
to your grades, not your talent.

623
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:25,829
How will you compete
against those bright kids on the mainland?

624
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,623
Don't be ridiculous.

625
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:31,210
Even photographer Seo Hui-ju
is from South Gyeongsang Province.

626
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:28,642
Hey, Sam-dal.

627
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,103
What's wrong? Why are you crying?

628
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:33,272
What's wrong? Who made you cry?

629
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:35,190
I want to go home.

630
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:37,776
I want to go back to Jeju.

631
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,737
I hate it here. It's too hard for me.

632
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,990
Okay, don't cry. Come here.

633
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:47,619
I couldn't even sleep
for the past three days.

634
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:53,250
But I still get scolded every day
and don't even have time to eat.

635
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:58,881
Even my camera broke.
What am I going to do?

636
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:04,219
Yong-pil, I want to go home.

637
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:07,806
All right. Don't cry. Okay?

638
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:08,807
Let's go home.

639
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:11,101
Let's just stop everything here, okay?

640
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,519
Just stop. Quit.

641
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,229
Why go through all this trouble?

642
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,606
Why let them torment you?

643
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:18,609
Don't bother becoming
a stupid photographer!

644
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:21,904
Why would you leave your parents
and come to Seoul just to suffer?

645
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,281
Sam-dal, you know what?

646
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:27,910
I'm always ready
to go back to Jeju with you. Okay?

647
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:30,412
Don't bother being a stupid photographer.

648
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:33,081
What's the point of doing
this crap? Stop. Just give up.

649
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,709
It's not stupid.

650
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,797
Then, are you going to still
become a stupid photographer?

651
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,300
Yeah, I will.

652
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,470
You just wait and see.

653
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:51,266
I'm going to do whatever it takes
to become a really good one.

654
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,644
A really good, stupid photographer.

655
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:57,898
And here I thought I'd finally had
a chance to return to Jeju thanks to you.

656
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,150
I told you that would never happen.

657
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,570
Just watch. I'm not going back to Jeju.

658
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,490
So tell me.

659
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:09,159
Did you cry because you missed
your mom that much?

660
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,577
That's not why.

661
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:11,745
Don't lie.

662
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:14,248
You were just crying
because you missed her.

663
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,041
-No, I wasn't.
-You weren't?

664
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:17,960
All right. Then, I've prepared

665
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:20,629
something special today
for our little crybaby Sam-dal.

666
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:21,588
-Okay?
-What is it?

667
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:25,801
In front of Jeju Sarang Bank,
the pride of Jeju, Cho Yong-pil is here.

668
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:26,927
What are you doing?

669
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,595
I came to a spectacular city

670
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,305
After dreaming about it

671
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:32,724
Yong-pil, stop it! Please stop singing!

672
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:35,602
It was a cold and dangerous place

673
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:36,520
What are you doing?

674
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:41,400
After losing my way
I find myself by a shabby door

675
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:45,487
And I shed these sad tears

676
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,743
Smile a little bit.

677
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:55,998
That's nice.

678
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:01,086
Hey, Cho Eun-hye!

679
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,007
How can you doze off at work?

680
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:05,924
I'm sorry.

681
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,051
Pack your things
if you want to sleep. Get out!

682
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,303
I'm sorry, ma'am.

683
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:14,766
-Eun-hye!
-Yes, Ms. Seo?

684
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,810
-We need more light up here.
-Yes, ma'am.

685
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:32,534
Cho Eun-hye.

686
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,746
Okay, I'm coming.

687
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,211
Oh, no. Oh, my gosh!

688
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:45,213
What do I do?

689
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:47,674
This can't get wet.

690
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:10,781
Hello, Ms. Seo.

691
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,058
Why aren't you picking up?

692
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:22,060
Where in the world did he go?

693
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:24,688
How ridiculous.

694
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:27,190
She'll let you have me?

695
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:29,484
What am I, some kind of object?

696
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:33,405
I hate her so much.

697
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,951
Why is she so laid-back
even after losing everything?

698
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:40,912
You know she's not the type
to get worked up so easily.

699
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,210
Cho Eun-hye is just ridiculous!

700
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:50,172
How dare she be so laid-back
when she has nothing? Right?

701
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:51,757
Goodness.

702
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,092
CHEON CHUNG-GI

703
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,052
Who are you?

704
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:58,221
Cheon Chung-gi, you bastard!

705
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,599
-Who are you? What are you doing?
-Who are you?

706
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:02,934
I'm Cho Eun-hye's brother, you bastard.

707
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:03,935
Call the police.

708
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,270
I should just…

709
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:06,855
You little…

710
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,357
You'd better stay away from her.

711
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,358
Or I'll kill you.

712
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:16,198
What's his problem?

713
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,034
That little…

714
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:27,250
So?

715
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:31,087
Did you go back and destroy them?

716
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:36,802
What's the matter? You went back
looking like you'd tear the place down.

717
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,720
You should've done just that.

718
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:41,097
Why didn't you? It's unlike you.

719
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,311
It's unlike me?

720
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:50,482
Then, what's like me?

721
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,737
Grabbing them by the hair
and losing my temper?

722
00:51:57,739 --> 00:51:59,157
If I did things like that,

723
00:52:00,116 --> 00:52:02,077
I wouldn't have come this far.

724
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,040
I suppressed my anger all the time.

725
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,961
I pretended to be okay and confident.

726
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:15,298
That's how I came this far.

727
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,219
But then I realized

728
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:22,931
that I'd changed so much.

729
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:29,229
So I was scared to confront Eun-ju.

730
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:33,525
Why? In case it turned out
you really did bully her?

731
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:36,528
Yeah.

732
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:41,491
Just in case
I did something without realizing it.

733
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:45,537
Didn't you say you were still you
despite having changed?

734
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:48,707
It's true. Think about it.

735
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:51,835
You can change all you want,
but you'll still be Cho Sam-dal.

736
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:53,003
But you know what?

737
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:55,171
Cho Sam-dal

738
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:58,758
isn't someone who'd hurt others.

739
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:01,011
So don't worry.

740
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:03,930
Have some faith in yourself.

741
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,270
Why are you making that face?

742
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:12,230
I'm giving you good advice.

743
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:13,273
I mean it.

744
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:17,027
I'm not just saying these things
to make you feel better.

745
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,820
I'm only telling the truth.

746
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,661
How did you know I was here?

747
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:28,788
Don't you remember?

748
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:33,376
You'd always sit here and grit your teeth,
saying you'd never go back to Jeju.

749
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,671
Did I?

750
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:37,714
What?

751
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:41,384
Was this the only place
in Seoul that felt like home?

752
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:44,262
Of course not.

753
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,389
It just reminds me of myself.

754
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,016
What do you mean?

755
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:53,521
A Jeju Sarang Bank
in the middle of Seoul seems odd.

756
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:57,484
I'm sure people in Seoul
wonder why this bank is here.

757
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,527
The bank itself must feel awkward too.

758
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:02,781
Look at it just brazenly standing here.

759
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,743
It has no one to rely on in Seoul.

760
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:09,996
I pity it.

761
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:13,583
And you're like that?

762
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:17,170
Back then, I was.

763
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,258
And even now too.

764
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:27,639
I really did my best
to brazenly hang on here,

765
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:31,393
but I still have no one to rely on here.

766
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:35,772
The editor who worked with me for 13 years

767
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:39,067
ignored my calls
as soon as the news came out.

768
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:42,988
Even the celebrities
who only wanted to work with me

769
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:44,322
turned their backs on me.

770
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:47,867
We worked together for over a decade.

771
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:53,957
But not a single one asked me
if it was true or wanted to support me.

772
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,627
No one asked how I was doing.

773
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:00,880
No one cared to ask.

774
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:06,261
I'm no longer a successful photographer,
so they don't need me.

775
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,473
I worked like a dog to come this far.

776
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:14,811
But it all feels meaningless now.

777
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:51,765
This is strange.

778
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:53,767
Why does the town feel so empty?

779
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:55,602
The town?

780
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:57,228
It looks the same.

781
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:58,271
You're wrong.

782
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:03,193
It feels like someone's left the island.
Sang-do hasn't driven by today, right?

783
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:05,195
-His car broke down.
-What?

784
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:07,447
-He left the roof open in the rain.
-Hey.

785
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,617
The car must've been flooded.

786
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:13,411
Serves him right. It was so noisy.
What about Yong-pil?

787
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:15,705
I heard he went to Seoul
yesterday on his day off.

788
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:17,832
See? I knew it. What for?

789
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:20,126
Yong-pil? Why would he go to the mainland?

790
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,087
-Hello.
-Hey.

791
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:25,048
I don't know either.
I just heard from the office.

792
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:26,883
Mom, can you give me a pack of ramyeon?

793
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:28,093
Is that so?

794
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:30,053
RAMYEON

795
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:33,223
Why would Yong-pil go to the mainland?

796
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:34,432
Beats me.

797
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:37,185
Why would he go there?

798
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:38,728
Bye, ma'am.

799
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,980
Mom, I said give me some ramyeon!

800
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,398
Am I invisible to you?

801
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:02,919
UNDERSTANDING PHOTOGRAPHY

802
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:31,739
I'm going to achieve my dreams
and become an inspiration to people.

803
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,159
Look out, everyone! Let's go!

804
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:40,457
I dedicated the past 20 years
to photography.

805
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,876
But now that it's gone, I feel lost.

806
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:46,171
I don't know what to do when I wake up.

807
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,757
I don't know
what to talk about with others.

808
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,927
Before I became a photographer…

809
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:02,228
I don't remember what I used to do.

810
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:06,858
Hey, Sam-dal.

811
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:12,280
Let's look for her. We can do it.

812
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,033
Not the photographer Cho Eun-hye.

813
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:16,701
Cho Sam-dal.

814
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:18,786
What?

815
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:20,622
Think about it.

816
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:24,042
Your dream may have disappeared,
but you haven't.

817
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:25,877
So let's find her.

818
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,547
Instead of photographer Cho Eun-hye,
let's find the real Cho Sam-dal.

819
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:28,982
Mom, I'm hungry!

820
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:53,006
Where were you all night long,
and now you're hungry?

821
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:55,091
-You didn't eat anything?
-Nope.

822
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:57,135
There was nowhere to eat.

823
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:00,680
Sam-dal, did you go to Seoul?

824
01:00:02,473 --> 01:00:04,684
Why would you go through my stuff?

825
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,940
Why did you go there?

826
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:12,984
The date was yesterday.

827
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,612
Mind your own business.

828
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:24,287
It's nothing. I just had something to do.

829
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:26,623
So I went and had some fun there.

830
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:33,463
Ok. Eat up then.

831
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:35,256
Want anything else?

832
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:39,052
More rice.

833
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:44,098
You told me not to send any side dishes
when you were on the mainland.

834
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:47,185
Do you have an appetite
now that you're struggling?

835
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:49,354
It's not like that.

836
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:50,521
Don't deny it.

837
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:55,151
You threatened not to eat anything
I sent you. You said you'd throw it away.

838
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:56,736
Goodness.

839
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:00,948
It's not that I didn't want
to eat it. I couldn't.

840
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:03,159
I had no time to eat.

841
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:06,871
I was lucky if I even came home
at night, let alone eat your food.

842
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:10,667
You think I was happy
whenever I had to throw away rotten food?

843
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:12,835
You don't even know.

844
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:21,511
I want more of everything.
I'm going to eat it all now.

845
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:23,888
To make up for
what I couldn't eat back then.

846
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:36,025
What's this?

847
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:48,329
What is this?

848
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:50,415
What?

849
01:01:53,584 --> 01:01:54,627
Dad!

850
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:58,214
I thought we agreed on
not touching each other's stuff.

851
01:01:58,297 --> 01:02:02,385
My goodness. I'll go through your stuff
when I'm cleaning too if you're like this.

852
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:04,679
What? Are you threatening me?

853
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:06,973
Why do you have that here?

854
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:09,851
You don't have to know
everything about me.

855
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:11,310
We're too busy for that.

856
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:14,772
Mind your own business
and stay out of my room.

857
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:17,024
Dad!

858
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:20,319
I told you this is not a trash.

859
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:22,947
My goodness.

860
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:27,368
Don't throw this away! The red…

861
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,120
The red yarn.

862
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,834
What's gotten into him?

863
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,620
Goodness, Ms. Ko.

864
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:12,663
Yong-pil told you to keep that on.

865
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:14,874
Gosh, just leave it on.

866
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:17,084
Yong-pil will be hurt if he sees that.

867
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:19,670
Why? It's too worn out.
I should take it off.

868
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:23,466
By the way, where is he?
I haven't seen him since yesterday.

869
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:24,884
Yong-pil?

870
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,886
He went to the mainland yesterday.

871
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:27,929
He took a half day off.

872
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:28,888
-What?
-He did.

873
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:31,599
Why would he need
to take a half day and go there?

874
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:32,517
Beats me.

875
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,311
Eun-u heard it at the office.
He doesn't know why either.

876
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:36,687
-Eun-u said that?
-Yeah.

877
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:39,607
I thought the Power Rangers
knew everything about each other.

878
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:41,484
I thought they knew nothing at all.

879
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:46,489
Goodness, you startled me. What is it?

880
01:03:47,114 --> 01:03:47,949
Nothing.

881
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:50,034
I'll get going first.

882
01:03:50,117 --> 01:03:52,453
Make sure to wrap up and go home.

883
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:53,371
What?

884
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:55,039
-Why are you leaving?
-Ms. Ko!

885
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,210
What's going on?

886
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:07,969
Sam-dal, where did you…

887
01:04:13,474 --> 01:04:15,059
What's going on?

888
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:28,823
He went to the mainland yesterday.
He took a half day off.

889
01:04:46,507 --> 01:04:48,384
-What are you doing?
-What?

890
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:50,052
Why did you kill that octopus?

891
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:56,642
Your mother worked
so hard to bring them in alive,

892
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,769
and you go ahead and kill it.

893
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:06,277
-Could you scoot in a bit?
-Hello.

894
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,445
Hello.

895
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:09,530
Let's have you two sit here.

896
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:10,823
Yong-pil.

897
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:12,074
Hey.

898
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:13,451
What are you doing?

899
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:15,244
I came just a bit ago.

900
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:18,331
Your employee went to eat, so I took over.

901
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:20,291
What for?

902
01:05:20,374 --> 01:05:21,876
They'll be coming back.

903
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:23,502
It's just that…

904
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:26,464
Can I have a cup of coffee?

905
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:31,177
I wanted to beat him up so bad.

906
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:33,304
"Call the police."

907
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:35,348
Why bother beating him up?

908
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:37,433
I'm glad you didn't waste your energy.

909
01:05:37,516 --> 01:05:42,480
By the way, this coffee
from your vending machine is really good.

910
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:47,526
Did you hire an employee
to work inside the machine too?

911
01:05:48,402 --> 01:05:49,570
What are you talking about?

912
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:56,869
By the way, where was Sam-dal yesterday?

913
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:00,289
There's this place she always goes to.

914
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:07,213
You still know everything about her.

915
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:12,426
Is that you, Mom?

916
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,014
What are you doing?

917
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:23,187
Why do you have that?

918
01:06:25,856 --> 01:06:27,650
Can I ask you something?

919
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:29,735
What is it?

920
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:31,779
Yesterday…

921
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:36,534
how did you know Sam-dal
didn't have an umbrella?

922
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:43,374
Anyway, why aren't you carrying
an umbrella in this weather? Take this.

923
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:45,960
Okay.

924
01:06:57,346 --> 01:06:59,515
You're still not over her, are you?

925
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:07,106
SEOUL

926
01:07:12,611 --> 01:07:13,779
Sam-dal,

927
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:16,949
do you still have feelings for Yong-pil?

928
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,379
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

929
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:33,424
KOREA SINGS
JEJU

930
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:41,140
Yong-pil.

931
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:45,478
You should have big dreams as a man
and not be content with a small stream.

932
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:46,896
Come on, Sang-tae.

933
01:07:46,979 --> 01:07:50,858
What's wrong with a small stream?
Yong-pil, I'm just like you.

934
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:51,901
I like Jeju.

935
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:53,944
That's right. It's okay.

936
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:56,655
It's okay if you don't have a dream.
Take your time.

937
01:07:56,739 --> 01:08:00,493
Mom, I said I liked small streams.
It doesn't mean I don't have a dream.

938
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:01,702
Is that so?

939
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:04,205
Then, what's your dream?

940
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:07,041
It's you and Sam-dal.

941
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:08,584
What?

942
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,630
We're your dream?

943
01:08:12,713 --> 01:08:15,257
Yes. Your dream
doesn't always have to be a job.

944
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:18,385
You two are my dream.

945
01:08:19,136 --> 01:08:21,972
Once your dreams
come true, mine will as well.

946
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:42,159
Perhaps, dreams
aren't supposed to be achieved

947
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:44,745
but to be protected.

948
01:08:52,336 --> 01:08:53,546
And perhaps,

949
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:55,965
my dream…

950
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:02,054
still has hope
of being something beautiful.

951
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:35,379
Hey, where you going?

952
01:09:35,462 --> 01:09:37,923
I'm going to find
Sam-dal instead of Eun-hye.

953
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:40,342
The Olle Trail? That's where she went?

954
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:42,344
-Just don't let me see him.
-Honey! I…

955
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:43,929
Have you been well?

956
01:09:44,471 --> 01:09:47,850
Excuse me! Do you have 500 won?

957
01:09:48,642 --> 01:09:51,687
So it's okay that I like her?
I've always liked her.

958
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:53,230
Sam-dal's come back?

959
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:54,899
To live in Jeju?

960
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:58,694
Don't tell my mom that
we went to Seoul together.

961
01:09:58,777 --> 01:10:01,363
Sam-dal and Yong-pil are back together.

962
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:02,489
What?

963
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:04,200
What are you doing?

964
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:10,748
