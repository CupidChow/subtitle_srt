1
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:40,999
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

2
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:53,178
At least help us with hair and makeup.

3
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,180
We can't shoot without help.

4
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:58,016
No one wants to work with Ms. Bang.

5
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:01,186
Word's already out
that she has no talent and she's haughty.

6
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,605
-Come on.
-You're out of time.

7
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:06,066
Replace her right away,
or this will be a flop!

8
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,150
I'm aware of that.

9
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,153
But where can I find
an available replacement?

10
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,114
This is driving me nuts too.

11
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,657
Okay, bye.

12
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,954
This place doesn't look good either.

13
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,247
Isn't there any other place?

14
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,665
I'm not your assistant.

15
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,961
You've been searching for days.
Do you even have a theme?

16
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,588
No, that's not the main issue.

17
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:31,424
None of the staff wants to work with you.

18
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,843
You said you were confident
about shooting in Jeju,

19
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,512
so I made it happen for you.

20
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,723
But the deadline is next week.
What am I supposed to do now?

21
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,016
What do you want me to do?

22
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,309
What?

23
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:43,978
They refused to work with me,
so what do you want from me?

24
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,898
You yell at them over nothing.

25
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:50,360
And you yell because you're afraid
they'll see how incompetent you are.

26
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,278
So who'd want to work with you?

27
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:55,115
Good photographers
don't just take good photos.

28
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,075
They also communicate with the staff.

29
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:59,536
-Didn't you learn anything from Eun-hye?
-Hey!

30
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,413
I told you not to mention her.

31
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:07,168
You cheated on her with me.
Do you miss her now because of her skill?

32
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,545
Of course, I do!

33
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,879
I'm about to get fired!

34
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:10,922
That's your problem.

35
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:12,507
Fine, then.

36
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:13,925
I quit.

37
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:15,802
What?

38
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,847
I quit. I just won't do it.
You can find a replacement.

39
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,809
How can I find a replacement
who can work now?

40
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,699
Darn it.

41
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,671
CHO SAM-DAL CHOSEN
FOR KMA'S JEJU AND WEATHER EXHIBITION

42
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:53,548
Cho Sam-dal?

43
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,109
Hello, are you the reporter?

44
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,695
How are you?

45
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,906
-So cute!
-Stop!

46
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,616
-Stop it.
-My princess.

47
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,242
-Stop it.
-All right.

48
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,119
-I'll stop.
-That's enough.

49
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:24,454
Okay.

50
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,622
-You're so cute.
-What?

51
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,248
-What are you doing?
-Goodness.

52
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,125
My Sam-dal, you're so adorable.

53
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,377
Okay.

54
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,546
What is it?

55
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,593
Are you guys back together?

56
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,845
Why are you so surprised?

57
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,181
It's not the first time you've seen this.

58
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:46,893
We'll leave it up to you.
You can decide for yourself.

59
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:50,230
See? What did I say?
I told you they got back together.

60
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,397
Right?

61
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,274
And this isn't a first.

62
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,444
Fifteen years ago at Sam-dal's place.

63
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:59,155
I've been regretting that day
for eight years now.

64
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,450
They were dating and being
all lovey-dovey back then too.

65
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,618
Then, they broke up.

66
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,663
Then, she cut ties with me.

67
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:07,664
You rotten…

68
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,333
Gyeong-tae, I won't cut ties
if we break up this time.

69
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,459
So don't worry.

70
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,044
-Okay?
-We're going to break up?

71
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,545
No, I won't allow it.

72
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,631
-Just cut ties with him.
-All right.

73
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,258
Anyway, congratulations.

74
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,509
Congratulations, my foot.

75
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,386
Hey, you two.

76
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,304
I want a written promise.

77
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,056
What? Don't be ridiculous.

78
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,140
It's not ridiculous.

79
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,685
"We won't break up
until our gray hair turns old."

80
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,020
Write that down. I'll get this notarized.

81
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,315
Gyeong-tae, the saying is
"until our hair turns gray."

82
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,652
-Yeah.
-Whatever. It's still your hair. Write it.

83
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,612
Jeez, can you just go away?

84
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:43,533
Why are you overreacting?
We're trying to spend some quality time--

85
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,285
Then, just get a room somewhere.

86
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,120
Why are you doing this here?

87
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,664
We just reunited as the Power Rangers.

88
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,083
We'll have to part ways again
if you break up!

89
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,712
Relax. That won't happen ever again.

90
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:56,963
-Really?
-Yes.

91
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,214
Then, just get married.

92
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:04,345
Are you crazy? That's absurd.
What do you mean "get married"?

93
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,597
-All of a sudden?
-Well…

94
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:10,143
Getting married
isn't all that absurd, is it?

95
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,771
By the way, where's Sang-do?

96
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,733
You're right. I haven't seen him
in a while. Where is he?

97
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,276
He doesn't come by often.

98
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:21,112
Write this promise now and get married
so you won't break up.

99
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,238
Just get married!

100
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,242
-Please have some.
-Thank you.

101
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,746
Where has Sam-dal gone
after inviting her friends here?

102
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,165
She's probably on a date.

103
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,417
She's right.

104
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,670
We're okay.

105
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,340
We have the theme,
so we just have our own jobs to do.

106
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,716
-I see.
-Yes.

107
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,677
I'm sorry we took your room.

108
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,804
No, that's fine.

109
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:50,308
You don't need to stay at a hotel
when we have a room here.

110
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,810
My sisters and I can sleep in that room.

111
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,813
So don't worry about us,
just make yourselves at home.

112
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,774
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

113
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:58,733
It's my pleasure.

114
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,319
By the way, how did you find our house?

115
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,945
There are so many houses here.

116
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,448
We asked the worker
at the convenience store

117
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,991
near the edge of town.

118
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,493
-Bye, Gyeong-tae.
-Bye.

119
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,454
-Sam-dal.
-What is it?

120
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,580
What?

121
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,248
Well…

122
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,167
Never mind.

123
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,085
-Bye.
-Okay, bye.

124
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,670
-Wait, Sam-dal.
-What is it? Just spit it out.

125
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:23,508
Those two women
who are staying at your house…

126
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,218
Who are they?

127
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,762
Eun-bi and Ji-eun? They're my ADs.

128
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:31,474
Eun-bi? Is she the one
with those big eyes?

129
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,392
-Yeah.
-I see.

130
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,602
How do you know her?

131
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:37,021
What? I just…

132
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,856
I ran into her by coincidence.

133
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,946
LUCKY CONVENIENCE STORE

134
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,532
Excuse me. Do you know
where Ms. Cho Eun-hye lives?

135
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,575
Reporters again.

136
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,244
No one by that name lives here.

137
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,388
I see.

138
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,349
That's strange.
I'm sure we're in Samdal-ri.

139
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:15,393
Then, do you know
where Ms. Cho Sam-dal lives?

140
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,272
What?

141
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,608
What was the question again?

142
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,695
Do you know Cho Sam-dal?

143
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,659
Over there?
I think he's saying over there.

144
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:32,910
-I see.
-Over there?

145
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:33,995
There?

146
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,204
I see.

147
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,289
Thank you.

148
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,924
-What's wrong?
-You mean Wang Gyeong-tae?

149
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,217
He's Sam-dal's friend.

150
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,011
I see.

151
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,848
By the way,
does he have difficulties speaking?

152
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,809
What do you mean? He's very chatty.

153
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:01,147
I've never seen his mouth closed
in my entire life.

154
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,690
It's true.

155
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:03,941
You're right.

156
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,611
-Then, what was that?
-That's strange.

157
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,863
He didn't seem too good with words.

158
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,031
-Right?
-Yeah.

159
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,501
You can just dive with her then.

160
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,961
You can just dive with her
if you're worried.

161
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,129
You were a swimmer.

162
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,841
No, that's ridiculous. I'm not a haenyeo.

163
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:32,178
Then, become one. What's stopping you?
You said you're worried about her.

KOREAN SWIMMING CHAMPIONSHIPS

JEJU DOLPHIN CENTER

166
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,846
Ha-yul's dream

167
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,599
is to become a professional swimmer.

168
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,027
What are you doing?

169
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,824
Missing your rising star days?

170
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,743
I wasn't a rising star.

171
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,745
Yes, you were.

172
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,206
You were accepted
to Korea National Training Center.

173
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,960
You're right. I was pretty talented.

174
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:49,338
They say you were crazy
about swimming since day one.

175
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,758
Come to think of it,

176
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,094
she really doesn't take after you,
does she?

177
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,887
She hates the water.

178
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:00,224
You're right. She didn't improve
no matter what I taught her.

179
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,644
What's with that look?
You want to start again?

180
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,646
-Swim.
-Stop it.

181
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,523
Stop it. You'll wake her up.

182
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,649
Be quiet.

183
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,028
Fine, I'll be quiet.

184
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,366
Gosh. Is this actually real?

185
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,492
What is?

186
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,785
What? You can't believe it?

187
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:20,911
Should I pinch you?

188
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,998
-Should I? How is it?
-No. It's not that I can't believe it.

189
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:25,916
There's no reason.

190
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:28,669
By the way,

191
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,130
what did you say to my dad?

192
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,592
Well, what could have I said?

193
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,763
I just said you and I would wait for him.

194
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,057
That's all that you said?

195
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,141
What?

196
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,023
I also said I'd love you forever.

197
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,608
Until the day I die.

198
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,151
-Forever?
-Yes.

199
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,527
-Seriously?
-Yes.

200
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,363
But you're not up for marriage?

201
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:57,948
What?

202
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,910
I mean Gyeong-tae told us to get married,

203
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,412
and you were totally against it.

204
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,583
I wasn't totally against it.

205
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,752
Then, what were you?

206
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,339
Hey, we just got back together.

207
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,466
Why are you in such a hurry?

208
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,760
Let's take it slow.

209
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,136
All right. Go on in.

210
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,972
-No, you go in first.
-Why?

211
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,099
-Go in.
-After you.

212
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,351
-I'll go home once you do.
-I don't want to.

213
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:28,145
-I want to see you off, so go.
-I'm not going first.

214
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,398
-Me neither. Just go.
-Rock, paper, scissors

215
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,860
-Rock, paper, scissors!
-Scissors!

216
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,571
You lost, so go in first.

217
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,449
Okay, I'll go in first.

218
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,659
Okay, bye.

219
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,121
-I'm going in.
-Bye.

220
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,373
-I'm really going in.
-Okay. Go on in.

221
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,439
Hey, did he really give his blessing?

222
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,109
Gosh.

223
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:22,032
I must have given him
too good of a beating last time.

224
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:27,955
You took more of a beating.

225
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:28,998
What?

226
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,499
Didn't you look in the mirror?

227
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,503
No. I hit him as much
as he hit me, more or less.

228
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,215
I seriously went easy on him.

229
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,300
All right.

230
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,844
Let's check on Sam-dal.

231
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,890
What are you…

232
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:54,732
Cho Sam-dal.

233
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,318
Cho Yong-pil!

234
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,197
What in the world?

235
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,073
My goodness. Hey.

236
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,617
Dad. Mom.

237
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,743
Mr. Cho.

238
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,500
Your father gave his blessing,
so you think this is okay. How dare you?

239
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,461
Mr. Cho, it's not what you think.

240
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,589
Yong-pil!

241
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,257
What is it?

242
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,176
What?

243
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,802
What are you doing?

244
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,137
-Where are we going?
-Hurry.

245
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,972
Hey, wait. Hey!

246
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,726
Is anyone there?

247
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,438
That way.

248
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,773
My shoes.

249
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,528
My shoes.

250
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,616
There's always a cold draft in here.

251
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,117
Gosh, I feel so warm.

252
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,746
-Sam-dal.
-Yeah?

253
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,582
This feels great.

254
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:00,172
But if your parents find out,
they might kill me.

255
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,511
My parents are more open-minded
than you think.

256
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:09,223
And we're just cuddling.
There's nothing wrong in that.

257
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:13,060
-You're right. But only cuddling?
-Yeah.

258
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,105
Cuddling and nothing else?

259
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,400
I mean,

260
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:22,027
I waited eight long years for you.

261
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,696
But we're just going to cuddle?

262
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,698
I really had my hopes up.

263
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,992
We're not kids.
We can do more than cuddle.

264
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,536
Are you crazy? We can't do it here.

265
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,706
What were you thinking about?

266
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,916
I wasn't talking about doing anything.

267
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,084
Just…

268
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,335
I just wanted this.

269
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,588
Just that.

270
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,258
Hey!

271
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,386
So embarrassing.

272
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,855
We didn't do anything.

273
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,983
Mom, we just slept together…

274
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,153
You slept together?

275
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,988
No, that's not what I meant.

276
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,032
-Hey!
-Dad!

277
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,783
Stop him!

278
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,161
Dad, don't hit him!

279
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,829
-Hey!
-Mr. Cho!

280
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,414
I brought him in, Dad!

281
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:37,978
Come to the pull-up bars.

282
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,714
Why did you want to see me this early?

283
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,174
It's busy today.

284
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,719
You're making me nervous.

285
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,099
Hey. Why would you feel nervous?

286
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,266
I'm not sure.

287
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,230
You always text me the same thing,

288
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,108
but it made me anxious today
for some reason.

289
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,904
I had to force myself to come out
after I washed up.

290
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,951
-Hey, Sang-do--
-Are you guys dating?

291
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,507
I see.

292
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,937
You didn't do anything wrong.
What's with you?

293
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,148
Right, I didn't do anything wrong. So why…

294
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:08,152
So why do I feel so bad in front of you?

295
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,237
You're the one who said not to feel bad.

296
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,198
And was that easy for you to do?

297
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,116
Was it?

298
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,997
You're always so quick.

299
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,498
Ever since we were kids.

300
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:26,503
I'd always get a head start,
but you'd still be ahead of me.

301
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:31,216
While I was worried about things
and hesitant because of people around me,

302
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,386
you didn't about think anything
and moved forward.

303
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,182
There was no way I could catch up.

304
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,852
I was never that quick.

305
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,812
You're quicker than me at times.

306
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,900
You're a faster runner than me, you know?

307
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,701
I know you two have always been close.

308
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,622
I also know that she'll never fall for me.

309
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,459
But you said they're my feelings.

310
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,796
I'll go at my own pace,

311
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:14,551
whether my feelings for her
remain or disappear.

312
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,972
Yeah, they're your feelings,
so do as you wish.

313
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:20,974
But Sang-do…

314
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,687
are you still going to have
coffee with me?

315
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,612
I mean, forget about me dating Sam-dal.

316
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:34,696
Are you going to…

317
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:40,869
keep drinking your restaurant's
vending machine coffee

318
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,204
with me?

319
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,206
What do you think?

320
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,132
We sell raw seafood.

321
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,884
You should have that instead.

322
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,095
It's not a coffee shop,

323
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,805
but that's all you have.

324
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,187
-Can you deliver it to my workplace?
-Damn it.

JEJU REGIONAL OFFICE OF METEOROLOGY
CHO YONG-PIL

328
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,211
What?

329
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,505
This is Forecaster Cho, right?

330
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,840
Did you see it?

331
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,259
You did! It's him!

332
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,345
Jeju Regional Office of Meteorology,
Cho Yong-pil!

333
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,432
I knew he'd make it!

334
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,518
I applied for him.
This is what I'm capable of.

335
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,688
Unbelievable.
He was up against hundreds of others.

336
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,231
It really happened?

337
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:55,194
I can't believe someone
from our office is joining WMO.

338
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,737
He's incredible.

339
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,114
He's going to be ecstatic
when he finds out.

340
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,116
We should tell him. Should I call him?

341
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,826
Don't. When he comes in later…

342
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:11,919
Han Seok-gyu speaking.

343
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,463
What?

344
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,216
Eun-bi!

345
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,258
What's wrong?

346
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,426
What do we do?

347
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,303
What is Ms. Cho going to do?

348
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,430
What? What is it?

349
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,140
There are tons of news articles.

00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,103

-God.

353
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,899
Damn it.

355
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:45,869
What is this?

356
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,204
Come on!

357
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:48,997
Yes?

358
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,919
No, we had no idea.

359
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,213
We evaluated them
solely based on their work.

360
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:59,258
-We'll replace her as soon as we can.
-We apologize.

361
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,512
We're not in charge of it, so…

362
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,639
We apologize. Here's the main number.

363
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,683
We're sorry. We apologize.

364
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,395
We haven't received any information.

365
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,272
Calls are still coming in.

366
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,607
-Hold on. Okay.
-Gosh, what is this mess?

367
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,537
-Ms. Cho!
-Ms. Cho!

368
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,581
-Ms. Cho!
-You startled me. What is it?

369
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,585
What is it? What's the matter?

370
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,547
Just a second.

371
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,756
JEJU METEOROLOGICAL CENTER

372
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,800
What do we do about the exhibition?

373
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:44,886
I don't know how the reporters
found out, but it's a mess.

374
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,646
CHO EUN-HYE SHAMELESSLY RETURNS
WITH REAL NAME

375
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,908
Are those articles true?

376
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,328
It's too early to come back.

377
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,996
You should've laid low longer.

378
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:15,042
You'll get carsick
if you look at your phone so much.

379
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,170
You should appreciate the view
if you came to Jeju.

380
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:20,672
Right.

381
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,499
Why are they making such a big deal

382
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:58,418
about a tiny, local exhibition
and if it's a comeback or not?

383
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:02,255
I'm certain that someone posted this
with malicious intent.

384
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:03,840
Who?

385
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:07,135
It's obvious. Someone who knows
her real name and is in Jeju.

386
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,012
Probably Cheon Chung-gi and Bang Eun-ju.

387
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:12,099
You're right. They've kept promoting
the exhibition here.

388
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,935
How else would reporters
in Seoul find out?

389
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:20,065
Those damn little rats.

390
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,400
-Damn it.
-Sam-dal is here.

391
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,652
Sam-dal.

392
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:26,154
Hey, you.

393
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,032
Don't get discouraged.
You did nothing wrong.

394
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,867
He's right. Keep your head up.

395
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:33,745
Okay. Bye.

396
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:34,955
Bye.

397
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,998
Stand up straight, okay?

398
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,960
Don't look back. Look straight ahead.

399
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,509
The exhibition's canceled?

400
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,387
Look, ma'am.

401
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,223
Yes, she is Cho Eun-hye.

402
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:57,185
But the report of that incident
was one-sided.

403
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:01,231
And if you search online,
there are articles explaining everything.

404
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,775
Even the accusers denied it themselves.

405
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,986
All I'm saying is that she has no reason

406
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:09,781
to hide her identity
and deceive anyone for this exhibition.

407
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,993
The abuse of power rumors are false.

408
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:19,332
There's absolutely no proof,
so why should we disqualify the winner?

409
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:22,252
We're not disqualifying her.

410
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,547
We've decided
to just cancel the exhibition.

411
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,341
But we've been working so hard
to prepare for it.

412
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:31,303
This is a promise we made to the winner.

413
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:35,473
Canceling the event like this
would be abusing governmental authority.

414
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,518
I understand what you're saying,

415
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:41,021
but look at what's happening right now.

416
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,939
-We apologize.
-One minute, please.

417
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,441
-Yes.
-We'll correct it.

418
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:47,611
We've been getting complaints
all morning due to the articles.

419
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,988
The Forecasting Division
is even flooded with calls.

420
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:54,701
Our website went down, so people are mad
they can't check the forecast.

421
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,869
This is the KMA.

422
00:24:56,578 --> 00:25:00,498
We can't let an exhibition hinder
our work in forecasting the weather.

423
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,084
I understand, ma'am.

424
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,628
But canceling--

425
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:08,006
I won't do the exhibition.

426
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,302
Everyone's having
a hard time because of me.

427
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:13,553
I'm sorry about that.

428
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,389
Gosh, Ms. Cho.

429
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:20,352
This is the Forecasting Division.
Please call the Weather Service.

430
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:23,688
Director Han.

431
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,983
I can't get any work done.
We need to do the short-term forecast.

432
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,611
How did they even get our number?

433
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,613
Call Yong-pil for help.

434
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,740
No, forget it. That brat's here, right?

435
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,162
Wait.

436
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:40,789
Hold on.

437
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,208
Why won't you do it?

438
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,293
Why quit the exhibition?

439
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,255
There you are!

440
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:51,299
Yong-pil, come and prepare
the short-term forecast right now.

441
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,385
It's been hectic all morning!

442
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,512
Hey, go on and do your work.

443
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:58,139
Work isn't the concern right now.

444
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,808
She was right though.

445
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:03,270
This exhibition is just a KMA event.

446
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:06,273
We can't let something like this
affect your forecasting.

447
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,692
I'm inconveniencing them too much.

448
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,110
No, you're not.

449
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:13,363
Anyway, see you later at home.
I'm leaving.

450
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:14,447
No, wait…

451

JEJU AND WEATHER PHOTOGRAPHY EXHIBITION
CHO SAM-DAL

452
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,505
Ms. Cho!

453
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:33,008
The advertising agency
wants to cancel our contract.

454
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:36,303
Magazine X and Bobble
have both canceled the cover shoots.

455
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:39,014
No matter how much I said it wasn't true,

456
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,183
they're all backing out
because of public outrage.

457
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,042
Mother.

458
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:12,797
Do you miss Mi-ja as much as I do?

459
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,804
Everyone else has moved on.

460
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:25,393
Am I the only one who's stuck in the past?

461
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:36,946
Sang-tae.

462
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:43,536
Don't resent Mi-ja.

463
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:48,124
Mother, why do you keep saying that?

464
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,753
Do you think I resent your daughter?

465
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,671
Not my daughter.

466
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:55,548
Mi-ja.

467
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:57,884
Ko Mi-ja.

468
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,346
Mother.

469
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,939
Forgiving her…

470
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:16,403
doesn't mean you'll forget your wife.

471
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,544

475
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,331
Wait, Sang-tae.

476
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:57,128
You don't have to forgive me.

477
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,173
I'm just grateful

478
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:03,259
that you gave our kids your blessing.

479
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:14,938
Have you really missed
Mi-ja all these years?

480
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,532
When do you miss her the most?

481
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,371
I miss her every time I dive into the sea

482
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:34,541
and every time I look at Yong-pil.

483
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,886
Right, your seaweed soup.

484
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,096
I finished all of it.

SAMSONGJANG MOTEL

488
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,083
Jeon Dae-yeong.

489
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,254
So you refuse to answer my calls?

490
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:13,973
You should get that.

491
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,351
It's better to get it over with quick.

492
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,561
Or you'll only make her angrier.

493
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:22,523
I don't want to, Mr. Ko.

494
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,319
I'll find a way to persuade
my father at all costs.

495
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:30,198
Yes. I'll see her
after I take care of this.

496
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,660
And what if you fail?

497
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,331
Are you going to just vanish?

498
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,252
How did you know I was here?

499
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:47,840
Explain yourself.

500
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,010
Well, you see…

501
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:53,888
I…

502
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:57,558
I'm sorry.

503
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,269
My father and I had
a difference of opinions.

504
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:04,440
But I'll make sure
to bring the project back to Samdal-ri.

505
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:08,361
-So don't worry too much--
-I'm not talking about the theme park.

506
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:18,329
Why are you staying here
and looking so shabby?

507
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,480
The theme park in Samdal-ri

508
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:50,737
wasn't going to work, but you went
overboard because of me, right?

509
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,906
That's why you were kicked out.

510
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:06,669
You can't sleep on cheap mattresses
because of your bad back.

511
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,547
And you can't wear

512
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,383
the same shirt twice.

513
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:15,553
I mean, why…

514
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,017
It's been years since our divorce.

515
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,895
Why are you still so intent on helping me?

516
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,696
Go and persuade Jin-dal.

517
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:37,867
No, I'm going to let her
do what she wants.

518
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,953
If the public learns of this,
don't you know

519
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,789
what'll happen to your mother and brother?

520
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:43,873
Father…

521
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:49,796
She felt as if she had sold
her soul for the past five years.

522
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,965
She saw all the abuse the workers received

523
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:55,510
and had to turn a blind eye to it.

524
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:56,886
She's the type of person

525
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:01,057
who leaps into action even when she sees
students being bullied in the street.

526
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,060
So imagine…

527
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,106
how terrible our family must've been.

528
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:13,986
Are you seriously going to let your wife
bring our family and company down?

529
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:15,947
The company will go down!

530
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,907
If it did wrong, then it deserves to!

531
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:20,326
I don't care about the company!

532
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,786
I'm going to just support her.

533
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,539
You crazy fool!

534
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,957
Are you out of your mind?

535
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,167
Mom and Dae-sik are the guilty ones!

536
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,419
Jin-dal didn't do anything wrong!

537
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,839
Why do you voluntarily
keep trying to help me

538
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,883
and make yourself the black sheep? Why?

539
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:39,929
Because I love you.

540
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:48,688
That's right.

541
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:50,982
Because I love you.

542
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:58,656
I can just wear this shirt
two days in a row.

543
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:03,369
If my back hurts, then I can just stay up.

544
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,872
If my dad beats me…

545
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:11,210
Well, it wouldn't be
his first time, so I'll just take it.

546
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,089
It's not that important.

547
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:23,264
I love you. So what if I become
the black sheep?

548
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,560
I couldn't care less.

549
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,658
Hey, Eun-ju.
Are you behind these articles…

550
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:43,743
What? Where did she go?

551
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,830
MR. MA FROM MARKETING

552
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:48,748
"Mr. Ma"?

553
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,376
-Hello?
-Hi, Ms. Bang.

554
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,046
You said you'd promote
our product in Magazine X this time.

555
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:57,673
We paid you ages ago.
How much longer will it take?

556
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:01,135
You haven't been keeping your word
since we gave you the scarf.

557
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,262
Why did you answer my call?

558
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,264
Hold on.

559
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,266
What's this about?

560
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,435
"Promote in Magazine X"?

561
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:10,519
Scarf…

562
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:16,651
Have you been taking money
in exchange for promoting products?

563
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,529
Is that why you've insisted on adding

564
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:23,407
those scarves, earrings, and hats
that didn't fit the theme?

565
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,620
Yeah. So what?

566
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,413
Again with the "So what?" Damn it!

567
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,083
You're out of your mind.

568
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,295
How could you personally take money
to secretly promote items

569
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,755
unrelated to our magazine?

570
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,966
And what? "So what?"

571
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,801
It wasn't easy for me either.

572
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:47,098
They wanted their money back,
and Eun-hye never uses what she dislikes.

573
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,140
It drove me insane.

574
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:53,187
Did you get our product?
It has to be in the shoot this time.

575
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,773
It'd be better to tidy up here a little…

576
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,823
Ma'am, what's this scarf?
It wasn't included during our meeting.

577
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,449
Well…

578
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,869
Right. You see, it's…

579
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,037
I added it.

580
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,248
What?

581
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,085
What's that?

582
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,964
I told you to remove that!

583
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,092
You're unbelievable.

584
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,262
I wanted to make this work
with you at all costs,

585
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,389
but I just can't handle it.

586
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,016
Eun-ju,

587
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,101
let's part ways here.

588
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,395
Part ways?

589
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:39,984
You want to fail the shoot and get fired?
It's next week. You have a backup plan?

590
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:41,819
It would fail with you here anyway.

591
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:46,824
I can't believe I left Eun-hye
for someone like you.

592
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:47,992
What?

593
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:51,287
I must've been insane. I was crazy!

594
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,497
Get out. Leave, you bastard!

595
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,082
I was going to leave anyway!

596
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,211
Damn it.

597
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:17,104
I told you to wait a little longer.
I'm trying to promote it.

598
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,856
There's no shoot, so what do you expect?

599
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:23,110
Nothing's going my way,
so what do you want me to do?

600
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,654
You should've given me
some better looking items!

601
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,948
No one wants to use your shitty products!

602
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,914
Damn it!

603
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:39,210
Eun-ju should focus on her solo career.
Why does she keep bothering us?

604
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,587
Should we just go
and grab her by the hair?

605
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:44,048
That won't change anything.

606
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,009
We need to find a way
to bring her down in one go.

607
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:50,429
-By the way, Eun-bi.
-Yeah?

608
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:53,891
That scarf from back then
has been bothering me.

609
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:54,975
What about you?

610
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,270
Not only has it been bothering me

611
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,981
but it's been frustrating me too.

612
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:06,028
Damn it. I think
something fishy's going on.

613
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:06,946
Me too.

614
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:08,697
The exhibition got canceled?

615
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,493
You guys should've tried harder
to convince the KMA.

616
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:16,497
Apparently, Sam-dal said she'd drop out.

617
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,706
Why would she do that?

618
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,209
She probably didn't want to be a nuisance.

619
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:22,920
Complaint calls came in all day,
so our offices were a mess.

620
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:23,921
Hey.

621
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:29,135
This is exactly what happened
when she was accused of abusing power.

622
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,470
She's innocent,
but no one's hearing her out.

623
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,557
Right? Everyone's turning their backs
on her to save themselves.

624
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,392
Articles explaining things get buried.

625
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,644
That's exactly what the KMA is doing.

626
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,857
The issue isn't about persuading the KMA.

627
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,900
-Then?
-What's the issue then?

628
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:49,989
We need to go back
to the root of all this.

629
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:52,158
Cho Sam-dal didn't abuse Bang Eun-ju.

630
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,994
We need to prove that
to settle this once and for all.

631
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:58,664
We know Eun-ju made it all up,
but how do you prove that?

632
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:01,834
How do I know how to prove it?
I'm not a genius.

633
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:06,422
If we find anything fishy,
we should do all we can to dig into it.

634
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:07,631
-The scarf!
-The scarf!

635
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,936
So you're Sam-dal's assistant directors.

636
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,272
What was she like in Seoul?

637
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:24,523
Ms. Cho?

638
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:27,943
Well, she loved her job.
That's all she knew. She was a workaholic.

639
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,069
-What?
-What?

640
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:32,198
She's very professional. And very cool.

641
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:35,117
-I see.
-We were used to seeing that side of her.

642
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:38,746
But after coming to Jeju, she's shown us
a side of her we didn't know.

643
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,790
-Well, it is her hometown after all.
-Right.

644
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,216
By the way, Gyeong-tae.

645
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:53,594
-Yes?
-Why are you suddenly being so quiet?

646
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,348
What? What are you talking about?

647
00:41:57,431 --> 00:42:00,184
Right. Thank you for giving us
directions the other day.

648
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:01,769
Right. Yes.

649
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,187
Yes, the other day…

650
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:06,482
Right, when we met then.

651
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,567
-Yes.
-Gyeong-tae.

652
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,362
Are you stuttering?

653
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,113
What…

654
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:17,618
Shut up, you bastard.

655
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,126
Shouldn't we stop him?

656
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,003
It's been 20 years since his first love.

657
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:45,187
So on the day she clashed with Sam-dal
after insisting on adding the scarf…

658
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:47,940
She told her about the affair,
argued with her,

659
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,525
and did that act the next day.

660
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:53,946
And after she became a director,
she kept insisting on adding the scarf.

661
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:56,448
She also kept adding items
that didn't match the theme,

662
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,617
so she always fought with the stylists.

663
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:02,454
That's it. The scarf.
She got paid to put it in.

664
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,456
I have a sharp nose for these…

665
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,251
things.

666
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:09,837
-Do you know her social media account?
-Of course.

667
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,339
Let's search her social media
and online communities

668
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,633
for anything suspicious
related to sponsors.

669
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:15,718
-All right.
-Okay.

670
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:22,850
Here it is.

671
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,769
This is her account.

672
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:30,733
Thank you.

673
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:33,819
This is her account.

674
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:36,572
LAYOUT FOR KMA EXHIBITION

675
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,640
We'll inform you of the exhibition
after an internal meeting.

676
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:04,516
I'm sorry. Goodbye.

677
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,855
We've decided
to just cancel the exhibition.

678
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:11,899
I won't do the exhibition.

679
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:15,277
Everyone's having
a hard time because of me.

680
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:16,570
I'm sorry about that.

681
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,494
Thanks for helping out
the Forecasting Division.

682
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:25,245
Here. For your troubles.

683
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:29,166
ACCEPTED FOR WMO SWITZERLAND POST
CHO YONG-PIL

684
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:35,923
Wait. What's this?

685
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,633
Congratulations, Mr. Cho.

686
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,051
He sure is incredible.

687
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,594
I applied for you.

688
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,681
What did I tell you? I said you'd make it.

689
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,309
Forget it. I'm not going.

690
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,228
Whatever. This isn't important.

691
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:51,355
What are we going to do
about the exhibition?

692
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:52,523
I mean, we…

693
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,818
Is the commissioner in?

694
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:59,405
Hey, Yong-pil!

695
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:00,531
What is it?

696
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:02,741
You got accepted to the WMO.

697
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,785
Your long-held dream has come true.

698
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,329
How many times
do I have to tell you? I'm not going.

699
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:10,249
Why not? Others would kill to go.

700
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:12,584
Yong-pil, this is your dream.

701
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,378
Whatever. Send someone else.

702
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:20,008
Life is so hard.

703
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,393
-Cheon Chung-gi!
-My gosh!

704
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,647
What are you doing?

705
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:38,152
We have no reason to talk
to each other, so why are you here?

706
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:39,695
What is it?

707
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,948
About that news article, Eun-hye…

708
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,201
It was Eun-ju.

709
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:54,960
You never change, do you?

710
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,004
And so?

711
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,755
I wasn't a part of it.

712
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:02,968
I had no idea
she was lying about everything.

713
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:05,179
I actually asked her if you really did it.

714
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:07,055
I get it. So what?

715
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:13,312
What are you doing? Have you gone insane?

716
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:14,563
Please help me.

717
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,857
Please help me just this once.

718
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:20,819
The project is due next week,
but I have no theme or staff.

719
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:23,655
I told my boss how confident I was
about shooting in Jeju,

720
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:26,200
but I'm about to get fired. No, wait.

721
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,285
I don't care about that.

722
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:30,913
But our magazine's going to have
blank pages next week.

723
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:32,289
That would be a real fiasco.

724
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,459
Are you seriously out of your mind?

725
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:40,964
Even if you fully prepared in Seoul,
it's not enough time. Are you an amateur?

726
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,508
I wasn't in my right mind.

727
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:45,219
Eun-ju kept telling me
that she could do this.

728
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,054
You two are really something.

729
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,097
We've known each other for ten years.

730
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,266
We went through so much together.

731
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:54,144
So for old times' sake,
help me just this once.

732
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,772
I know you can come up with
themes in two days

733
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:59,274
and do the shoot
with just your assistant directors.

734
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:01,693
CHO SAM-DAL

735
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:05,072
Man, why isn't she picking up?

736
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,366
Where in the world is she?

737
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,664
What? Why is she with that bastard?

738
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,208
Hey, Sam-dal!

739
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,711
Hey, Sam-dal!

740
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:21,588
Sam-dal!

741
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:24,299
Why are you with this bastard?

742
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:25,676
Don't talk to this punk.

743
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:27,844
-Let's go. Hop in.
-You little…

744
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,304
-What?
-Jeez.

745
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:31,848
Let me finish talking to him.

746
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,101
Anyways, enough with your nonsense.

747
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,852
Go look for another photographer.

748
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:38,855
People are already complaining
that I'm trying to come back

749
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:40,774
by doing the KMA exhibition.

750
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:43,902
So shooting for your magazine?
You think you can handle it?

751
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,363
That's something I could take care of.

752
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:48,615
Please. No, you can't.

753
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:52,703
There's a way for you to come back
while being welcomed like a hero.

754
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:54,204
I have a plan, you know?

755
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:55,247
What is it?

756
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,374
-Tell me.
-You stay right there.

757
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,334
In any case, I have a plan.

758
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,379
I'll tell you if you agree to help me.

759
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:03,755
Jeez.

760
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,591
-Let's go.
-Let's go. He has no plan.

761
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,676
-I know you don't.
-Yes, I totally do. Okay?

762
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:09,720
Eun-hye, call me. I'll be waiting.

763
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:11,013
Okay? Just this once.

764
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,391
Help me just this once. Okay? Please.

765
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:26,945
By the way…

766
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,030
Yeah?

767
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:33,869
Do you want to do it?

768
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:36,330
What?

769
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,542
Wasn't that jerk asking you

770
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:44,087
to take photos for his magazine?

771
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:47,883
Yeah, he was.

772
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:51,219
You'd be making a comeback if you did it.

773
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,264
Don't you want to?

774
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:58,060
It's not that I want to make a comeback.

775
00:48:58,935 --> 00:49:01,688
It'll be a huge mess
if it's due next week.

776
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,858
And he won't be able to find
any photographers in Jeju right now.

777
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:07,653
But why are you concerned?

778
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:12,616
So what if it becomes a mess?

779
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:15,410
So what if he gets fired
or the magazine folds?

780
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:16,828
What's it to you?

781
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:20,499
Well…

782
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:24,461
This would be a huge disaster
in this industry.

783
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:26,463
I've been through it, so I know.

784
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:29,216
I guess that's why I was concerned.

785
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:32,511
Exactly. Why would you
be concerned about that?

786
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:36,390
You gave up so easily on our exhibition,
so why are you worried about this?

787
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,981
Is this because
I dropped out of the KMA exhibition?

788
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,777
Yes. That's right. So what?

789
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:52,114
I know it's a similar situation
to the Paris Magazine incident.

790
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:53,949
So I know why you're hesitant too.

791
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:55,242
But this is different.

792
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,035
How is it different?

793
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,537
Because this is Samdal-ri.

794
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,249
Why would you give up in your hometown?

795
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:07,671
Hey. Who said I was giving up?

796
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:10,841
-You dropped out of our exhibition.
-Yes, I did.

797
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,884
Exactly. Doesn't that mean you gave up?

798
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:14,678
Hey.

799
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:19,599
My goal is to have
my own first exhibition as Cho Sam-dal.

800
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,309
I never said it was the KMA exhibition.

801
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:23,395
What?

You know what?

807
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:16,156
Yes?

808
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,366
The Bongsan-eup Community Center
has a warehouse.

809
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,076
Why don't you ask them about it?

810
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,204
Really?

811
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:24,164
CITIZEN'S FRIEND, JEJU CITY

812
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,540
-Hey.
-Mr. Cho.

813
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:28,084
What is it?

814
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,843
I already have all the photos.

815
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:39,221
I don't have to hold
an exhibition at the KMA.

816
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:43,058
Do you know how many times I climbed
that oreum just to take a single shot?

817
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:44,142
I'm not giving up.

818
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:45,435
You're not?

819
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:48,605
-Really? You're not giving up?
-I'm not.

820
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:50,357
Come on. You should've told me sooner.

821
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,693
I thought you'd given up.
I had so much running through my mind.

822
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,320
Like what?

823
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:57,447
The situation felt
so similar to last time.

824
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:00,116
So I thought,
"What should I do? What should I say?"

825
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,828
"Should I get a switch?"
That's what I thought.

826
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:04,329
You were going to punish me?

827
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:07,749
You know what I mean.
I was worried about you.

828
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:12,754
What?

829
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:18,593
What?

830
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:22,889
Hey.

831
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,766
I found it!

832
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,142
I found it!

833
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:28,061
-What?
-Did you find something?

834
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:29,187
What did you find?

835
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:31,773
Look. This is her alternate account.

836
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:33,400
Check out this comment.

837
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:36,570
"Ms. Bang, if you don't pick up,
I'll let it out."

838
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:39,322
He commented on an old post too.

839
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,032
"Hello, Ms. Bang from 3MOON STUDIO."

840
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:44,494
"I'm Ma from Valen Marketing.
I'd like to propose a sponsorship."

841
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:47,330
So I went into his account.

842
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:49,499
-Eun-bi! It's this, right?
-It is!

843
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,001
-It's the scarf.
-It's this one?

844
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:53,003
Yes, it is. Hold on. What is this?

845
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:54,838
This hat, bracelet, and necklace.

846
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:57,382
These are things Eun-ju
added to our shoots.

847
00:52:57,465 --> 00:52:58,550
Exactly.

848
00:52:58,633 --> 00:52:59,801
Even these earrings.

849
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,970
-Damn it.
-I can't believe her.

850
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:05,599
So she was secretly getting paid for this
while working under Ms. Cho?

851
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:06,850
You did it, Sang-do!

852
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:08,268
-I found it!
-How did you?

853
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,812
-He's incredible!
-Are you a hacker or what?

854
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:12,439
-How did you find this?
-What?

855
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:16,985
We found it!

856
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:23,533
Did you hear?

857
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:24,534
What?

858
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:27,621
There were new articles about Sam-dal.

859
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:28,872
-What?
-What?

860
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:31,082
It's about her KMA exhibition.

861
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:35,921
Reporters somehow found out
Sam-dal was Cho Eun-hye,

862
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,881
and it's a big mess.

863
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:43,511
For crying out loud. No matter how much
she denies it, they won't hear her out.

864
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:46,473
Look. Who are those people?

865
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:53,563
Gosh, I was wondering
where Cho Eun-hye was hiding.

866
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:56,524
-She was in her hometown all along.
-Tell me about it.

867
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:59,069
I wasted all my time
in front of her house in Seoul.

868
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:01,279
Is she doing the KMA exhibition?

869
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:03,406
Beats me. There hasn't been any news.

870
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:05,784
-Then, she might still do it.
-Right.

871
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:10,872
Then, let's search this entire town
until the exhibition.

872
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:13,041
-Right.
-It's a tiny village.

873
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:14,751
-So we'll find her soon.
-Right.

874
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:16,294
-Are they here?
-Are they close?

875
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:17,545
-They're here?
-They're close?

876
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:18,630
Hello, ladies.

877
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:20,048
-Hello.
-Hello.

878
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:21,967
Can we ask you something?

879
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,635
Where does Ms. Cho Eun… No.

880
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:27,222
Where does Ms. Cho Sam-dal live?

881
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:34,187
Goodness! Did you come
from the mainland to find Sam-dal?

882
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:36,189
Yes, we're here to see Sam-dal.

883
00:54:36,272 --> 00:54:38,024
Sam-dal's so lucky.

884
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:41,861
She has so many visitors
from the mainland.

885
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:44,572
Ma'am, so…

886
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:46,866
Where is her house?

887
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,076
Over there.

888
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,328
Over there?

889
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:51,371
Over there!

890
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,498
-Over there?
-Yes, over there.

891
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:54,582
Over there?

892
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:58,169
If you walk 400 meters,
you'll see stone walls.

893
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:00,672
Then, if you take a right
and walk 500 meters…

894
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:01,798
That's her house, right?

895
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:03,758
You'll see a tangerine grove.

896
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,802
-Right.
-Right, a tangerine grove.

897
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:11,349
Then, keep going straight.

898
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:12,600
And then?

899
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:14,394
You'll find her house.

900
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:15,478
Thank you, ma'am.

901
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,063
-Thank you.
-Have a great day.

902
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,606
-We wish you the best.
-Goodbye.

903
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:22,110
-Crowds of reporters are here.
-Where's Sam-dal?

904
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:23,194
Don't tell them.

905
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,487
-Where?
-Don't tell them.

906
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,197
-Where is she?
-They're all here.

907
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:28,116
-I'll go there.
-Don't say where she is.

908
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:33,329
She definitely told us to turn left.

909
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:34,539
-I know.
-Over there.

910
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:35,790
It's over there.

911
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:39,878
-What?
-Where is it?

912
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:42,964
-Jeez.
-I'm sure it's somewhere here.

913
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:47,093
Why are there so many people around today?

914
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:51,056
The neighboring village
must be having an event.

915
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:52,515
There's a swarm of people.

916
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,893
Really? Why come here?
There's nothing to see.

917
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:56,478
By the way,

918
00:55:57,270 --> 00:56:00,231
are you going to do the KMA exhibition?

919
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:02,400
Wouldn't it attract a bunch of reporters?

920
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:06,237
That's why I'm going to do it
secretly in Samdal-ri.

921
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:08,281
Samdal-ri? Where?

922
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:10,784
The Bongsan-eup Community Center.

923
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:14,871
Does that mean
Sang-tae gave you permission?

924
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:16,331
Yes.

925
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:19,751
Then, that should work.

926
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:23,797
The reporters won't know
if you do it quietly in town.

927
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,341
-Ms. Ko!
-What? Who is it?

928
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:28,093
-Hi, Ms. Oh.
-Hey, Geum-sul.

929
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:30,386
Sam-dal! The reporters!

930
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,806
A crowd of reporters have come here.

931
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,432
-What?
-Don't go outside.

932
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:35,850
What? No.

933
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:37,185
What do I do?

934
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:39,771
Does that mean they'll be here soon?

935
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:43,108
In that case,
no one should leave the house. Okay?

936
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:44,984
Don't you worry.

937
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,695
-They'll never find you.
-What?

938
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:49,447
What do you mean?

939
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:55,161
I mean, this is a big town. How will they
find you if we don't tell them?

940
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:56,913
Leave it up to us.

941
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:59,040
Just stay indoors, okay?

942
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,169
That's good, Ms. Ko.

943
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,254
But Ms. Oh…

944
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:09,926
Goodness. So you went all the way there.

945
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:11,636
No, you got it all wrong.

946
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:13,930
No, let me tell you. Listen up.

947
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,432
Go straight,

948
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:21,438
turn, turn again,
go all the way around, then go straight.

949
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,898
-I see.
-I see. So that's why you got lost.

950
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,318
That's not the right way.
Listen closely, okay?

951
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:28,236
-Okay.
-Okay.

952
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,195
Go straight.

953
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,698
Right, right, left, right,
straight, left, and then…

954
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,825
-It's the yellow roof.
-Right, right, left…

955
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:34,742
Yellow roof?

956
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:36,995
Where's the yellow roof?

957
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:37,912
That one's blue.

958
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:38,955
Is that it?

959
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,043
Where are we?

960
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:46,379
-That's a dead end!
-Sorry?

961
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,673
Damn it. Let's go back.

962
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:50,008
I don't think this is it.

963
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:51,468
Me neither.

964
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:52,969
Is this the same village?

965
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:54,596
-Hey, you go over that way.
-Okay.

966
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:57,056
It's this way.

967
00:57:58,183 --> 00:57:59,684
-Take a right here…
-No.

968
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,186
-Forget it. Let's go.
-Hey.

969
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,104
What is it?

970
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:04,439
Did you find it?

971
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:06,858
What?

972
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:07,942
What's this?

973
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:09,027
What?

974
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:21,581
What do we do?
Why did they have to come here?

975
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:27,837
My dad told me
they even visited his office.

976
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:30,924
What's the matter with these people?

977
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:31,883
Hey, Sam-dal!

978
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:33,384
-Hey!
-What?

979
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:34,719
They might hear you. Quiet.

980
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:35,803
-What?
-Sam-dal!

981
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:38,473
Check this out, Sam-dal.

982
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:42,435
She's been illegally promoting items
from small online shopping malls.

983
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:45,271
They paid her to insert
these things into your shoots.

984
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:49,776
You used them at times if they looked okay
even if they weren't from the sponsor.

985
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:53,154
I knew it. I wondered where she got
the money to buy luxury items.

986
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:58,076
So she's continued to do this
even when she worked for me, right?

987
00:58:58,159 --> 00:58:59,994
-Right.
-Yes, the entire time.

988
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:06,626
I had no idea
she'd do something like this.

989
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:15,552
Why do you guys look…

990
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:17,887
so exhausted?

991
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,514
Hey.

992
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:22,850
Hey, what's wrong? Are you okay?

993
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:25,562
Sang-do, your eyes are bloodshot.

994
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:29,732
We were searching and only slept
for two hours. He stayed up all night.

995
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:34,696
You shouldn't have stayed up
to do that for me.

996
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:37,490
We needed to find something quick
to put an end to this.

997
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,867
There's a ton of reporters outside.

998
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:42,662
We'd chase them out
if it were just a few of them.

999
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:43,663
But it's a mob.

1000
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,874
They're gone now.
I guess they get cold at night.

1001
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:48,251
Really?

1002
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:49,335
By the way,

1003
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:51,713
was this why you came to Jeju?

1004
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:55,633
They must've done
the same thing to you in Seoul.

1005
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:06,561
-What is it?
-Did anyone see you?

1006
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:08,396
-No.
-No one.

1007
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:10,315
-Let's go.
-Let's hurry.

1008
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:20,700
Why would they all come here?

1009
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:24,078
Exactly. Give them a few days…

1010
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:25,163
Come sit.

1011
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:26,122
-Hey.
-Come.

1012
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:27,915
-They'll stop soon.
-Hello.

1013
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:30,251
That's what we thought too.

1014
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:33,588
But I don't know how long
we can keep your house a secret.

1015
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:37,342
Goodness, I'm so worried they'll find out.

1016
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:41,179
This is crunchy and good.

1017
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:45,808
Sam-dal can't hide at home forever.

1018
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:49,562
Ms. Ko, what if we report this
to the town or district office?

1019
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:53,983
We can't just report them
when they haven't done anything to us.

1020
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:56,069
That's true.

1021
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:59,572
What if we just tell
the reporters that it's not true?

1022
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:02,784
Dad, if that worked,
we wouldn't be here in the first place.

1023
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:03,868
Exactly.

1024
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:08,748
Right now, no matter what we tell them,
they'll only write negative articles.

1025
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:10,875
Then, what about this?

1026
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:14,379
A distant relative of mine
is a reporter in Jeju.

1027
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:18,925
Let's write another article
that defends you.

1028
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:23,930
Doesn't that relative work
in the classifieds?

1029
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:25,807
-Yeah.
-I see.

1030
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:28,309
Why don't you hire a lawyer, Ms. Ko?

1031
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:31,187
My husband has a relative who's a lawyer.

1032
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:34,440
-But isn't he a divorce lawyer?
-Yes.

1033
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:35,858
-Gosh.
-What do we do?

1034
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:37,819
She can't keep hiding forever.

1035
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:41,197
Why do that when she's innocent?

1036
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,825
-That's right.
-Then, how about this?

1037
01:01:43,908 --> 01:01:47,161
Should we pick them off one by one
and lock them in our homes?

1038
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:48,246
-What?
-But how?

1039
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:49,831
-We can seduce them!
-What?

1040
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:51,457
-Yes!
-Isn't that a crime?

1041
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:58,673
With your looks? Are you sure?

1042
01:01:58,756 --> 01:02:01,342
Geum-sul.

1043
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:02,802
Where is she?

1044
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:04,512
Goodness.

1045
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:10,893
That's enough.

1046
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:12,311
-Bye.
-Gyeong-tae.

1047
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,563
-We're leaving.
-Gyeong-tae.

1048
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:14,522
-Bye.
-Gyeong-tae.

1049
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:16,065
-Bye.
-Gyeong-tae.

1050
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:17,150
-Gyeong-tae.
-Bye.

1051
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,277
-Come on.
-Okay, let's go!

1052
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:21,446
-Yong-pil.
-Yes?

1053
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:27,201
You think she can do the KMA exhibition?

1054
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:28,536
Why do you ask?

1055
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:30,288
Please make sure she can.

1056
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:35,835
I'd like to see my face
among the photos at her exhibition.

1057
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:38,796
You took a photo of me, right?

1058
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:42,842
-Bye.
-Put up my photo too.

1059
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:45,595
-Mine too.
-Don't forget mine.

1060
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:47,472
Bye, ladies.

1061
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:48,431
Good night.

1062
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:50,141
-I bet you'd look good.
-Right.

1063
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:52,226
You looked great when you were young.

1064
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:54,812
Do you think you're a model?

1065
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:56,689
That's my son.

1066
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:57,732
Hey, Sam-dal.

1067
01:02:58,357 --> 01:02:59,317
What is it?

1068
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,068
Hold on.

1069
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:04,071
We can hold the exhibition here
as long as they don't know.

1070
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,574
That's right.

1071
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:10,578
But the reporters are everywhere here.

1072
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:13,498
They'll all come here
if the KMA exhibition is canceled.

1073
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:14,916
We're bound to get caught.

1074
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:18,002
Then, we can just send them
all to the meteorological center.

1075
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:22,840
We could, but is that possible?

1076
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:25,384
Doing it here means
the KMA has canceled theirs.

1077
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:27,929
Then, all the reporters
would come over here.

1078
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:31,098
Then, we make the KMA not cancel theirs.

1079
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:33,309
Right? Let's hold the exhibition here.

1080
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:35,645
Should we?

1081
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:36,687
Yeah, let's do it.

1082
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:37,730
I'll make it work.

1083
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:38,981
Let's try our best.

1084
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,277
You're right.

1085
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:44,987
-Of course.
-We should try our best.

1086
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:47,198
-Definitely.
-We can't just sit by.

1087
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:48,115
-Right.
-Right?

1088
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:49,033
But…

1089
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:52,787
I left all my photos
at the meteorological center.

1090
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:55,414
Don't you worry.

1091
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:59,126
CONGRATULATIONS
WINNER: CHO SAM-DAL

1092
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:05,091
Guys.

1093
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:08,511
Don't listen to the villagers
starting from today.

1094
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:12,431
I think they're toying with us.

1095
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:16,519
So is the KMA exhibition canceled or not?

1096
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:19,647
It's the day of,
but they haven't said anything.

1097
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:21,607
I'm sure it's canceled.

1098
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:25,111
That's why we're all here.

1099
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:28,197
An exhibition? There's no way.

1100
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:30,533
Sir, this…

1101
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:31,951
I think it's happening.

1102
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:34,203
-Don't be ridiculous.
-Let me see that.

1103
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:35,413
-Hey!
-Hey!

1104
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:37,915
-The KMA!
-The meteorological center!

1105
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:39,709
Get in the car!

1106
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:41,127
Hurry up!

1107
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:45,548
Hurry and get in!

1108
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:51,137
What?

1109
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:53,514
Damn it. Okay.

1110
01:04:54,515 --> 01:04:56,350
The KMA's holding the exhibition.

1111
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:57,268
Let's go.

1112
01:04:57,351 --> 01:04:58,769
-What?
-What is it?

1113
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:37,642
All the reporters have left Samdal-ri.

1114
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:40,436
My dad left the gate open,
so let's go get the photos.

1115
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:44,315
By the way, what did you do
at the meteorological center?

1116
01:05:44,398 --> 01:05:45,942
What do you mean?

1117
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:48,027
We didn't announce the cancellation.

1118
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:51,364
That's how much pull I have at work.

1119
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:54,784
Cho Yong-pil!

1120
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,080
When you pick up,

1121
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:03,250
what will you say, sir?
That the exhibition is canceled?

1122
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:05,378
It has been canceled. So--

1123
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:08,214
We canceled the exhibition
despite the winner being innocent.

1124
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:10,132
We can't even do this favor for her?

1125
01:06:11,008 --> 01:06:13,344
They asked us
not to announce the cancellation.

1126
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:17,348
Just don't announce the cancellation.

1127
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:20,059
We'll hold it somewhere else
so it won't bother our offices.

1128
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:22,979
But honestly,
we need some preparation time.

1129
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:25,815
So can you hold back
the reporters for a bit?

1130
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:28,317
This isn't a police station.
We can't hold them back.

1131
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:29,402
God.

1132
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:33,531
Shouldn't the KMA
keep their promise to the people?

1133
01:06:33,614 --> 01:06:37,034
I mean, sure. We're not gods,
so our forecasts can be wrong at times!

1134
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:40,204
But we promised to hold
the exhibition and then canceled it!

1135
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:42,248
That's wrong!

1136
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:46,168
Either hold the exhibition
or do me this one favor.

1137
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:51,632
We can't hold the exhibition.

1138
01:06:51,716 --> 01:06:55,219
Headquarters said we absolutely cannot.
So what power do I have?

1139
01:06:55,302 --> 01:06:58,889
Exactly. So let's at least
do this for them, sir.

1140
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,183
Jeez.

1141
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:04,311
Director Han.

1142
01:07:05,646 --> 01:07:07,023
Make sure Forecaster Cho

1143
01:07:08,482 --> 01:07:11,235
joins the WMO in Switzerland.

1144
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:14,572
He'll be the death of me!

1145
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,742
I can totally relate, sir.

1146
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:27,501
Can she really have the exhibition here?

1147
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:30,337
They'll definitely see her.

1148
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:32,548
No one could get through that.

1149
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,303
My hunch tells me it's not here.

1150
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:42,224
There will be tons of reporters there.
Do you think we can get the photos out?

1151
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:45,102
Of course, we can. Don't worry.

1152
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:46,979
We have enough backup.

1153
01:07:47,938 --> 01:07:50,232
You're right. We can overcome all of them.

1154
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:11,295
Sam-dal! Yong-pil!

1155
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:14,507
Just count on us!

1156
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:35,861
We'll join you as soon as we're done.

1157
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:44,245
-Ms. Cho!
-You can do it!

1158
01:08:44,328 --> 01:08:45,538
-You can do it!
-You can do it!

1159
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:48,290
Yong-pil once told me

1160
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:52,169
no dragon can rise
from a small stream by themselves.

1161
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:58,300
They get help from the loaches,
mandarin fish, and frogs in the streams.

1162
01:09:03,764 --> 01:09:07,685
EPISODE 15
IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO RAISE A DRAGON

1163
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:11,105
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

1164
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:39,884
Are you really going to hold
Ms. Cho's exhibition here?

1165
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:43,804
All right, then. How about we head
to your first exhibition, Ms. Cho?

1166
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:47,474
Let's put pressure on Chung-gi.
He definitely knows something.

1167
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:49,059
What's going on?

1168
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:52,521
Do you love me? Did you miss me?
That's what I want to know.

1169
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:55,941
Then, you can hang out with me.
That means we could go out.

1170
01:09:57,651 --> 01:09:58,694
The WMO…

1171
01:09:58,819 --> 01:09:59,904
in Switzerland.

1172
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:01,906
You sure you won't regret not going?

1173
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:05,075
So just like how
you've supported my dream,

1174
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:07,828
can't I do the same for you?

1175
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:15,711
