1
00:00:59,067 --> 00:01:00,150
Hello?

2
00:01:01,401 --> 00:01:04,024
Is this Back Sun-ju of MBS?

3
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,234
Yes, this is she. May I help you?

4
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:11,609
Hello?

5
00:01:12,276 --> 00:01:14,109
I'd like to request an interview.

6
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,401
What is this concerning?

7
00:01:17,943 --> 00:01:21,150
I killed 11 people.

8
00:01:22,276 --> 00:01:24,943
What do you mean?

9
00:01:25,568 --> 00:01:27,109
Could you repeat that?

10
00:01:28,568 --> 00:01:29,734
I am...

11
00:01:31,693 --> 00:01:33,276
a serial killer.

12
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,025
SKULL CAVED IN BY BLUNT OBJECT

13
00:01:46,526 --> 00:01:48,818
APPEARS TO BE HIGHLY INTERESTED
IN THE ACT OF KILLING ITSELF

14
00:01:55,192 --> 00:01:56,943
PREMEDITATED RETALIATORY HOMICIDE

15
00:02:05,818 --> 00:02:08,443
WEAPON OF CHOICE IS A SERRATED KNIFE

16
00:02:12,025 --> 00:02:14,693
CAUSE OF DEATH IS DETERMINED
TO BE CYANIDE POISONING

17
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:33,651
MURDER REPORT

18
00:02:38,317 --> 00:02:43,484
A heavy rain advisory has been
issued for Seoul this afternoon,

19
00:02:43,568 --> 00:02:47,151
with expected rainfall
exceeding 100 mm per hour.

20
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,900
Be prepared for potential damage,

21
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:53,860
as the rain may be
accompanied by strong winds...

22
00:02:53,942 --> 00:02:55,693
I don't like the sound of that.

23
00:02:56,526 --> 00:02:57,443
What?

24
00:02:58,151 --> 00:02:59,735
I think it'll rain a lot.

25
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:02,942
Ye-rin didn't take an umbrella.

26
00:03:03,443 --> 00:03:04,860
Are you serious?

27
00:03:04,942 --> 00:03:07,234
She'll buy one. She's old enough.

28
00:03:09,693 --> 00:03:11,276
Is something bothering you?

29
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,067
It's just that...

30
00:03:14,735 --> 00:03:16,067
she's been weird lately.

31
00:03:16,735 --> 00:03:17,776
How so?

32
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:20,900
She doesn't talk and she looks gloomy.

33
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:22,109
Yeah?

34
00:03:22,651 --> 00:03:26,192
I was suspicious so I checked
her bag a few days ago.

35
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,693
I found a razor blade.

36
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,109
A razor blade?

37
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:33,026
Yeah.

38
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,942
If it bothers you so
much, should I talk to her?

39
00:03:39,317 --> 00:03:40,484
Could you?

40
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:45,651
Yeah, she's more open with
you. I think that's a good idea.

41
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:47,317
All right.

42
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:51,568
You really are something.
Thinking about her right now?

43
00:03:51,651 --> 00:03:55,609
He said he killed 11 people.
Aren't you even scared?

44
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,192
I am.

45
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:00,859
I'm scared that a lunatic
gave me a false tip.

46
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:02,026
I know.

47
00:04:02,526 --> 00:04:05,859
Aren't you overreacting
to a lunatic's bluff?

48
00:04:06,735 --> 00:04:08,735
It's not too late. I can
still report to the HQ.

49
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:11,151
I'll arrest him and confirm
whether he's telling the truth...

50
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:12,234
And if it's the truth?

51
00:04:13,735 --> 00:04:16,108
You think my company
will give me this story?

52
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:18,401
Don't you know the
amount of crap I'm under?

53
00:04:18,484 --> 00:04:20,984
I'm about to get sacked because
of the Ilsin Group story!

54
00:04:23,318 --> 00:04:27,359
I know how you feel more than anyone.

55
00:04:27,443 --> 00:04:29,693
But this is too random.

56
00:04:29,776 --> 00:04:33,900
I couldn't find any connections
between the 11 cases he mentioned.

57
00:04:33,984 --> 00:04:36,067
There's no evidence that it
was all done by one person.

58
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,359
Don't you think it's weird?

59
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:39,526
What is?

60
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:44,234
Hundreds of details in these
cases do not cross over at all.

61
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:46,443
That feels almost intentional.

62
00:04:46,526 --> 00:04:47,900
Something's fishy here.

63
00:04:47,984 --> 00:04:52,067
Even if you're right, this
is excessive coverage.

64
00:04:52,151 --> 00:04:54,900
You'll get heat for
crossing the line for a scoop.

65
00:04:58,192 --> 00:05:00,359
I plan to kill someone
in three days at midnight.

66
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:04,401
If you comply with the interview,

67
00:05:04,484 --> 00:05:07,359
you will be given a
chance to save the hostage.

68
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:10,610
This isn't about getting a scoop.

69
00:05:10,693 --> 00:05:12,651
It's about saving someone.

70
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:17,651
Drop me off here.

71
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:19,693
He may spot us if we get any closer.

72
00:05:32,401 --> 00:05:36,318
Sun-ju, will you be okay? Why
are you so confident about this?

73
00:05:37,026 --> 00:05:38,151
His voice.

74
00:05:39,276 --> 00:05:40,192
What?

75
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:44,568
Never mind. Please
just do as I asked you to.

76
00:06:11,693 --> 00:06:15,901
Could you check if 2701 is
reserved under Back Sun-ju?

77
00:06:15,984 --> 00:06:17,984
Yes, ma'am.

78
00:06:27,234 --> 00:06:30,359
Suite 2701 is reserved
under your name, ma'am.

79
00:06:30,443 --> 00:06:32,775
Is there some construction going on?

80
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,734
We're replacing security cameras
due to a circuit malfunction.

81
00:06:36,318 --> 00:06:38,484
- The entire hotel?
- Yes.

82
00:06:38,568 --> 00:06:41,276
They'll be fixed soon, so
you don't need to worry.

83
00:06:50,568 --> 00:06:54,692
I'm going to act as if
everything he said is true.

84
00:06:57,067 --> 00:06:59,067
Use this for comms.

85
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,650
This is the key to the
room for your stakeout.

86
00:07:03,318 --> 00:07:06,526
I already checked in, so
head on up from the parking lot.

87
00:07:07,901 --> 00:07:08,984
And your key?

88
00:07:25,817 --> 00:07:28,026
Going up.

89
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:31,109
Going up.

90
00:09:01,734 --> 00:09:03,901
Sun-ju, I'm in.

91
00:09:03,984 --> 00:09:06,817
Install spy cams first
so that I have visuals.

92
00:09:33,026 --> 00:09:34,817
I got visual and audio.

93
00:09:35,485 --> 00:09:37,525
It's not too late to change your mind.

94
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:38,942
I can take over.

95
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,567
I can do this.

96
00:11:15,651 --> 00:11:16,943
Ms. Back Sun-ju?

97
00:11:18,193 --> 00:11:21,026
Yes, are you the one who called me?

98
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,525
May I come in?

99
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:32,525
Yes.

100
00:11:44,943 --> 00:11:48,817
Is the suite to your liking?
I chose it to my preference.

101
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,692
Yes, it's not bad.

102
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:57,859
A modern artist named Roth McWilder
designed the interior himself.

103
00:12:24,609 --> 00:12:26,526
I thought it was
fitting for the interview.

104
00:12:30,276 --> 00:12:31,400
Hmm...

105
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,609
Is this where I sit?

106
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:37,651
Yes.

107
00:13:15,442 --> 00:13:17,235
I get embarrassed
if you stare like that.

108
00:13:19,151 --> 00:13:21,901
Why, do I look odd?

109
00:13:23,193 --> 00:13:24,818
- No.
- Or...

110
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,984
do I look very different
from how you imagined?

111
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:32,609
No, I may sound forward,

112
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:36,275
but you look exactly how I imagined.

113
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:38,776
Is that so?

114
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:42,567
You claim to have committed 11 murders,

115
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:47,068
but not a single hair sample
was found at the scene.

116
00:13:47,651 --> 00:13:52,068
You weren't captured in any
of the security cams nearby.

117
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:59,651
I thought someone so meticulous
would surely manage himself well.

118
00:14:00,901 --> 00:14:05,526
That is, if what you claim is true.

119
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:12,317
Good, verify his statement first.

120
00:14:16,234 --> 00:14:20,151
Are you asking me to
prove that what I said is true?

121
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:23,567
I do not like to waste
my time on a false report.

122
00:14:24,943 --> 00:14:26,442
As you wish.

123
00:14:27,193 --> 00:14:31,442
But you may find it unnerving to watch.

124
00:15:10,068 --> 00:15:13,526
I have other videos so
please watch and check.

125
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:32,901
Sun-ju, is it real?

126
00:15:32,985 --> 00:15:34,110
Give me a signal.

127
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,317
He's for real?

128
00:16:02,776 --> 00:16:04,109
Is that enough to verify?

129
00:16:06,401 --> 00:16:07,234
Yes.

130
00:16:11,109 --> 00:16:12,901
We're all good then?

131
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,567
Am I verified?

132
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:24,484
May I start recording?

133
00:16:36,442 --> 00:16:41,234
I'd like to confirm your identity
before starting the interview.

134
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:44,609
Please state your name and age.

135
00:16:52,901 --> 00:16:55,317
Are you refusing to
provide your identity?

136
00:16:55,401 --> 00:16:57,359
It's not a refusal at all.

137
00:16:58,401 --> 00:17:01,317
I just don't think that's important.

138
00:17:01,401 --> 00:17:02,859
We have his face.

139
00:17:03,442 --> 00:17:04,943
Go ahead with the testimony.

140
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,943
Okay, we'll move on.

141
00:17:09,026 --> 00:17:16,026
You claim to be a serial killer who
committed 11 murders in two years.

142
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,276
Is this true?

143
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,609
Yes.

144
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:23,400
If you are being truthful,
I'm getting more curious.

145
00:17:24,024 --> 00:17:25,984
Why did you request this interview?

146
00:17:26,651 --> 00:17:29,276
I wanted a chance to reassess myself,

147
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:33,192
whether my actions thus
far have been justified.

148
00:17:33,276 --> 00:17:37,568
Do you believe your acts of
murder are ethically justified?

149
00:17:39,442 --> 00:17:41,317
Why are you asking such a question?

150
00:17:42,067 --> 00:17:46,860
Because most of your
victims had criminal records,

151
00:17:46,943 --> 00:17:49,609
or had generally questionable conduct.

152
00:17:50,568 --> 00:17:54,568
In light of this, it seems that you
carried out vigilante acts of murder...

153
00:17:54,651 --> 00:17:57,526
In the name of purging society.

154
00:17:59,025 --> 00:18:00,442
Is that your conclusion?

155
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,693
If so, you couldn't be any
further from my intention.

156
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:10,192
I did not commit murders with
the goal of social purification.

157
00:18:10,276 --> 00:18:13,651
Instead, it began with a
simple objective of therapy.

158
00:18:13,734 --> 00:18:15,734
Aren't they the same thing?

159
00:18:15,818 --> 00:18:18,192
The justification of
healing a sick society...

160
00:18:18,276 --> 00:18:19,609
No.

161
00:18:20,192 --> 00:18:22,151
It is not an abstract justification,

162
00:18:23,276 --> 00:18:25,734
but a medical practice for treatment.

163
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:28,192
I'm...

164
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:37,067
a psychiatrist.

165
00:18:43,818 --> 00:18:44,734
A doctor?

166
00:18:45,818 --> 00:18:47,067
The people I killed...

167
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:51,942
I mean, to be precise, they're tumors.

168
00:18:53,151 --> 00:18:56,443
I merely removed tumors
which inflicted wounds

169
00:18:57,609 --> 00:19:00,359
on my patients' souls and treated them.

170
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:02,860
What you're saying is,

171
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:07,734
you killed those who caused
psychological harm to your patients?

172
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,776
You are precisely correct.

173
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,317
I'm even more confused now.

174
00:19:14,651 --> 00:19:19,192
If it's true, more people
are tied to these cases,

175
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,818
why take the risk of exposing
yourself with this interview?

176
00:19:25,234 --> 00:19:30,693
There are tasks in the world that must
be carried out despite inherent risks.

177
00:19:31,192 --> 00:19:32,359
Am I wrong?

178
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,651
Then why did you agree to
this despite the inherent danger?

179
00:19:38,735 --> 00:19:41,484
I concluded that it's
a job I had to perform.

180
00:19:42,151 --> 00:19:46,942
And because you promised
my safety for confidentiality.

181
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:59,317
Did you maintain confidentiality?

182
00:20:06,317 --> 00:20:07,151
Yes.

183
00:20:16,984 --> 00:20:18,276
That's good.

184
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,276
I knew I made the right choice.

185
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:24,359
I knew you were the most trustworthy.

186
00:20:25,234 --> 00:20:26,067
Huh.

187
00:20:26,609 --> 00:20:30,359
Why the blind trust
in me? On what basis?

188
00:20:30,443 --> 00:20:32,818
You've been impressive
since your early years.

189
00:20:33,693 --> 00:20:38,151
Sharp insight, unwavering
sense of duty, and even courage.

190
00:20:38,234 --> 00:20:41,735
There is no one better
than you as my interviewer.

191
00:20:42,776 --> 00:20:44,443
That's why I decided

192
00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:47,317
to give you an exclusive.

193
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:52,318
It's a good opportunity for you too.

194
00:20:54,443 --> 00:20:55,735
Wouldn't you agree?

195
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:04,900
No, I didn't come here with
opportunistic judgment like that.

196
00:21:06,026 --> 00:21:09,151
I'm here because you
blackmailed me with a person's life.

197
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:14,192
And to save that person
you threatened to kill tonight.

198
00:21:14,276 --> 00:21:16,192
To that end,

199
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:20,735
until I can confirm their
identity and their safety,

200
00:21:20,817 --> 00:21:23,026
I cannot proceed with the interview.

201
00:21:24,401 --> 00:21:25,526
Please tell me.

202
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,817
Hmm...

203
00:21:29,526 --> 00:21:30,693
I don't want to.

204
00:21:31,568 --> 00:21:32,735
Pardon?

205
00:21:34,067 --> 00:21:35,775
I do not want to.

206
00:21:52,443 --> 00:21:54,984
Let's call it off then.

207
00:21:55,067 --> 00:21:57,359
I'll give you this footage.

208
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,026
Walk out of there. I'll take over.

209
00:22:04,443 --> 00:22:07,067
If you leave now, my
hostage will die immediately.

210
00:22:11,693 --> 00:22:13,484
I told you,

211
00:22:13,568 --> 00:22:17,359
I wanted to give you a
chance to save a person.

212
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:20,901
In other words, you
could lead to their demise.

213
00:22:23,318 --> 00:22:26,526
As soon as you walk out of this suite,

214
00:22:29,775 --> 00:22:31,192
they are dead.

215
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:36,817
Does he have an accomplice?

216
00:22:36,901 --> 00:22:38,234
Confirm it.

217
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:40,859
You have an accomplice?

218
00:22:43,984 --> 00:22:47,151
You think my hands are
tied if I'm in here with you?

219
00:22:49,651 --> 00:22:51,109
I promise you,

220
00:22:52,568 --> 00:22:55,318
if you finish the interview,

221
00:22:55,401 --> 00:22:58,193
I'll reveal who it is
and where they are.

222
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:02,526
And give you an
opportunity to save them too.

223
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:05,775
Forget it, just come
out. Let's arrest him first.

224
00:23:08,942 --> 00:23:12,610
Can I trust that promise?

225
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:13,775
Of course.

226
00:23:24,318 --> 00:23:26,193
That stubbornness of hers!

227
00:23:26,817 --> 00:23:27,942
Damn it!

228
00:23:35,026 --> 00:23:38,610
Please keep your promise.

229
00:23:39,692 --> 00:23:40,692
Absolutely.

230
00:23:43,692 --> 00:23:46,193
Then I'll continue this interview.

231
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,359
Thank you for complying.

232
00:24:05,984 --> 00:24:09,610
Catch the perp, get the exclusive,

233
00:24:10,568 --> 00:24:13,692
and save the hostage.

234
00:24:18,776 --> 00:24:23,359
All right, Sun-ju. Get
me that promotion.

235
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:33,359
Let's proceed with questions
related to the incident.

236
00:24:34,776 --> 00:24:40,151
You said your acts of murder were
intended for therapeutic purposes,

237
00:24:40,234 --> 00:24:43,609
and to establish the
justification, this interview...

238
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:44,984
Wait a moment.

239
00:24:47,401 --> 00:24:49,526
You're not being yourself.

240
00:24:50,734 --> 00:24:51,609
Pardon?

241
00:24:52,485 --> 00:24:56,485
Please proceed aggressively
and straightforward as usual.

242
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:58,942
I told you already,

243
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:04,068
I want to reassess myself
through this interview.

244
00:25:05,817 --> 00:25:08,776
So assertive questioning would be

245
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:11,109
more effective, no?

246
00:25:16,193 --> 00:25:17,276
Very well.

247
00:25:18,443 --> 00:25:19,817
Let me rephrase that.

248
00:25:22,234 --> 00:25:25,734
What was your motive
behind these gory murders?

249
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,817
Motive for murder...

250
00:25:31,567 --> 00:25:33,984
This could be long and dull.

251
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:37,401
That's okay, we have plenty of time.

252
00:25:38,609 --> 00:25:43,068
Good, I'll make it easy
for you to empathize with.

253
00:25:43,734 --> 00:25:47,817
Imagine it as your own story.

254
00:25:50,859 --> 00:25:52,401
There was a woman.

255
00:25:53,234 --> 00:25:55,984
She was a kind woman
who lived a normal life.

256
00:25:56,817 --> 00:25:59,485
She married at the age of 29,

257
00:25:59,567 --> 00:26:02,525
and became pregnant the following year.

258
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:14,609
She believed that her remaining
life would be filled with happiness.

259
00:26:15,443 --> 00:26:17,984
She more than deserved such a life.

260
00:26:20,068 --> 00:26:22,901
But God did not grant her that wish.

261
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:54,068
Thankfully, the perp was
caught and the baby was born,

262
00:26:54,776 --> 00:26:56,984
but the memory of that
day did not let her go.

263
00:26:57,068 --> 00:26:59,276
It's a delusion that
only exists in your mind.

264
00:27:00,026 --> 00:27:04,193
I know, doctor, but my baby's eyes...

265
00:27:05,484 --> 00:27:07,276
look identical to that bastard's.

266
00:27:08,068 --> 00:27:10,151
I still remember his face vividly.

267
00:27:12,442 --> 00:27:13,984
His dirty seed...

268
00:27:16,651 --> 00:27:18,817
spilling inside me.

269
00:27:18,901 --> 00:27:24,442
She fell into the delusion that
her baby carried the rapist's blood.

270
00:27:25,943 --> 00:27:30,984
No matter what, she couldn't
erase that filthy delusion.

271
00:27:45,567 --> 00:27:47,360
And with the baby in her arms...

272
00:27:48,651 --> 00:27:50,943
she jumped to her death.

273
00:27:58,776 --> 00:28:02,901
Is this story about your wife?

274
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:18,734
I tried to be objective,
but you caught me.

275
00:28:21,318 --> 00:28:23,400
Call it a psychology-led
physiological response.

276
00:28:25,776 --> 00:28:30,776
No matter how much you try
to hide it, your body cannot lie.

277
00:28:32,276 --> 00:28:35,901
Indeed, keen journalistic intuition.

278
00:28:36,484 --> 00:28:39,567
It's my duty to filter out the lies.

279
00:28:43,109 --> 00:28:48,567
Since the cat is out of
the bag, I'll speak freely.

280
00:28:50,068 --> 00:28:52,984
After her death, despair was all I had.

281
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:59,526
The guilt of not being able to treat
her erased my self-esteem as a doctor.

282
00:29:00,109 --> 00:29:01,235
But...

283
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:08,109
ironically, a clear
purpose in life emerged.

284
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:13,235
Revenge.

285
00:29:13,317 --> 00:29:17,359
Defendant Won Il-young is
sentenced to four years in prison.

286
00:29:31,526 --> 00:29:34,776
I had to wait just four
years to be able to kill him.

287
00:29:34,859 --> 00:29:37,109
Due to the claim of
being mentally unstable,

288
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:41,193
the court kindly sentenced
him to only four years.

289
00:29:42,068 --> 00:29:42,901
HUMAN ANATOMY

290
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,734
I researched every day to
seek the most agonizing revenge.

291
00:30:00,193 --> 00:30:03,193
This desire for revenge
made time flow faster.

292
00:30:04,651 --> 00:30:06,651
Then his release day arrived.

293
00:30:27,984 --> 00:30:33,484
But as always, God
did not grant my wish.

294
00:30:34,776 --> 00:30:36,317
DETECTIVE KIM TAE-SIK

295
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:40,734
The day before his release,
he died from an electric shock.

296
00:30:42,901 --> 00:30:47,234
The autopsy suggested a quick
death, taking only a few seconds.

297
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:54,526
It must've been anticlimactic.

298
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:01,901
"Panic state" would be a
more accurate diagnosis.

299
00:31:04,901 --> 00:31:06,859
I did not have a reason to live.

300
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:12,693
No, I had a reason to die, in fact.

301
00:31:13,275 --> 00:31:18,359
But as a psychiatrist, weren't
you able to find a coping method?

302
00:31:20,151 --> 00:31:24,151
I did, as a psychiatrist.

303
00:31:29,151 --> 00:31:31,776
I've been telling my patients,

304
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:35,651
"You must have the will
to recover on your own."

305
00:31:36,859 --> 00:31:39,192
But I realized that
it was all bullshit.

306
00:31:44,234 --> 00:31:45,943
At least I felt much better,

307
00:31:47,693 --> 00:31:50,609
knowing that I'd be
joining my family soon.

308
00:31:54,026 --> 00:31:58,192
Then how did you recover from that?

309
00:32:01,068 --> 00:32:04,275
I was given a second
chance as a doctor.

310
00:32:22,484 --> 00:32:23,943
You're the doctor, right?

311
00:32:27,026 --> 00:32:28,609
Who was he?

312
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:31,192
He was an honest, hardworking man.

313
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:37,234
The head of a household
that loved his family dearly.

314
00:32:39,192 --> 00:32:41,234
At least, until the incident.

315
00:32:42,192 --> 00:32:44,567
Had I gone home a bit earlier...

316
00:32:44,651 --> 00:32:49,734
He lost his wife to a
lunatic drunk driver.

317
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:53,234
And his 8-year-old boy
ended up in a vegetative state.

318
00:32:55,317 --> 00:32:58,234
A few years later, their
paths crossed once more.

319
00:33:00,026 --> 00:33:02,317
The one who destroyed his family.

320
00:33:13,693 --> 00:33:15,526
He wanted to kill him right away.

321
00:33:20,776 --> 00:33:21,901
But...

322
00:33:24,901 --> 00:33:27,651
he couldn't do it, for his son's sake.

323
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:37,317
It's all my fault.

324
00:33:38,693 --> 00:33:41,734
I felt his agony as if it was my own.

325
00:33:41,818 --> 00:33:45,026
- It's all my fault.
- That agony...

326
00:33:46,317 --> 00:33:48,985
I knew it all too well.

327
00:33:50,651 --> 00:33:52,401
Further consultation was meaningless.

328
00:33:52,484 --> 00:33:58,609
The diagnosis was made, and
the prescription was a unique one.

329
00:34:01,401 --> 00:34:04,943
Did the patient agree to
this treatment you speak of?

330
00:34:05,024 --> 00:34:06,985
He was taken aback at first.

331
00:34:08,025 --> 00:34:09,150
"Should I..."

332
00:34:09,234 --> 00:34:10,818
...kill him for you?

333
00:34:11,609 --> 00:34:13,317
That's what I said.

334
00:34:15,484 --> 00:34:17,358
But when he heard my story,

335
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:20,359
he felt a sense of kinship.

336
00:34:22,401 --> 00:34:24,943
There's nothing more
important than that in treatment.

337
00:34:26,067 --> 00:34:29,192
The trust between a
doctor and his patient.

338
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:38,359
You know what happened afterward.

339
00:34:39,401 --> 00:34:40,942
So that's why.

340
00:34:41,693 --> 00:34:44,192
The reason why the police were lost.

341
00:34:45,024 --> 00:34:47,568
According to my research,
following the murder,

342
00:34:48,233 --> 00:34:51,025
your patient was on
the list of suspects.

343
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,818
But he had a bulletproof alibi.

344
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,943
Everything was...

345
00:34:57,025 --> 00:34:57,984
Yes.

346
00:34:59,276 --> 00:35:00,693
I planned it all.

347
00:35:47,484 --> 00:35:48,484
So...

348
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:53,234
was the treatment effective?

349
00:35:54,984 --> 00:35:56,151
It was perfect.

350
00:35:57,484 --> 00:36:01,484
The prognosis was better than
any case I had handled before.

351
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:13,651
It was the most satisfying
moment of my professional career.

352
00:36:17,234 --> 00:36:20,984
It sounds like revenge was
some kind of cure-all medicine.

353
00:36:21,693 --> 00:36:23,984
As I told you about my wife,

354
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:28,276
it is almost impossible
to erase painful memories.

355
00:36:28,984 --> 00:36:32,484
However, it is possible
to alleviate the pain.

356
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:37,900
And the most effective
method is revenge.

357
00:36:41,651 --> 00:36:42,568
Very well.

358
00:36:44,025 --> 00:36:45,942
Let's get to the next question.

359
00:36:47,234 --> 00:36:51,484
You mentioned feeling satisfied
through the patient's treatment,

360
00:36:52,484 --> 00:36:54,942
but is that truly from
a doctor's perspective?

361
00:36:57,276 --> 00:36:58,568
What do you mean?

362
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:02,609
It sounds like a
killer's rationalization

363
00:37:02,693 --> 00:37:05,067
from someone who has
forgotten his duty as a doctor.

364
00:37:05,151 --> 00:37:08,984
Duty as a doctor...

365
00:37:10,609 --> 00:37:11,609
Hmm...

366
00:37:13,026 --> 00:37:16,192
I've perfectly fulfilled my
mission as a medical professional.

367
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,234
I practiced according to my conscience,

368
00:37:19,818 --> 00:37:22,651
prioritizing my patient's
health above all else.

369
00:37:22,735 --> 00:37:27,900
Was that truly the pure intention
of a medical professional?

370
00:37:27,984 --> 00:37:30,568
Or were you simply in
need of a target to kill?

371
00:37:30,651 --> 00:37:31,693
Yes.

372
00:37:32,568 --> 00:37:33,900
How are you so sure?

373
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,859
Well...

374
00:37:39,984 --> 00:37:41,817
I know my intentions the best.

375
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:53,109
Then are you fulfilling your
duty as a member of the press?

376
00:37:54,859 --> 00:37:55,776
Pardon?

377
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:58,651
Journalists should adhere to ethics,

378
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:02,192
uphold social justice, and
prioritize the safety of citizens.

379
00:38:02,817 --> 00:38:06,026
Aren't you, as a journalist,
contradicting yourself by being here?

380
00:38:06,776 --> 00:38:10,443
If your priority is a citizen's safety,
you should've called the cops first.

381
00:38:10,526 --> 00:38:14,109
I thought we went over that.

382
00:38:14,192 --> 00:38:19,026
I only complied with this interview
when you threatened to kill...

383
00:38:19,109 --> 00:38:20,151
No, no.

384
00:38:22,651 --> 00:38:27,568
I'm just wondering what
your real intentions are.

385
00:38:28,234 --> 00:38:31,984
It seems like you agreed to
this not to save a person's life,

386
00:38:32,067 --> 00:38:33,651
but rather...

387
00:38:34,817 --> 00:38:37,859
to use their life as a means
to obtain an exclusive.

388
00:38:52,775 --> 00:38:57,568
Are you really here
to save a person's life?

389
00:38:59,109 --> 00:39:01,443
No greed for exclusives?

390
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:05,817
I told you, I'm not
interested in any exclusives.

391
00:39:09,276 --> 00:39:12,901
Good, allow me to confirm that.

392
00:39:19,443 --> 00:39:23,526
Look in my eyes and answer me.

393
00:39:25,026 --> 00:39:29,401
Ms. Back Sun-ju, did you come here

394
00:39:30,192 --> 00:39:33,775
to save a life regardless
of an exclusive?

395
00:39:36,526 --> 00:39:37,651
Yes.

396
00:39:38,318 --> 00:39:44,067
I came here to save a life,
not to chase an exclusive.

397
00:39:49,401 --> 00:39:52,484
Dilated pupils, trembling lips,
subtle tension on the forehead,

398
00:39:53,443 --> 00:39:55,109
heart rate increased by 30%.

399
00:39:55,901 --> 00:39:58,443
These are typical physiological
responses to stress.

400
00:39:59,026 --> 00:40:03,151
In other words, you're lying to me.

401
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:07,193
No, I only told you the truth...

402
00:40:07,276 --> 00:40:09,193
No, it's okay.

403
00:40:09,817 --> 00:40:13,067
I completely understand,
so you don't need to worry.

404
00:40:14,234 --> 00:40:18,151
Journalism is a cutthroat job.

405
00:40:18,234 --> 00:40:21,276
Isn't that how the media operates?

406
00:40:21,817 --> 00:40:24,359
Lives are at stake
because of exclusives.

407
00:40:25,276 --> 00:40:27,485
In such a fierce environment,

408
00:40:28,276 --> 00:40:31,859
undesirable habits
may arise for survival.

409
00:40:33,193 --> 00:40:37,067
And without knowing how
fatal the consequences might be.

410
00:40:47,401 --> 00:40:48,901
That would be room service.

411
00:40:49,734 --> 00:40:51,650
I ordered some food on the way up.

412
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:12,318
Where should I put these?

413
00:41:12,984 --> 00:41:13,984
Over there, please.

414
00:41:16,568 --> 00:41:17,609
Where were we?

415
00:41:18,734 --> 00:41:20,485
Right, habits.

416
00:41:21,984 --> 00:41:24,276
Undesirable habits for survival

417
00:41:25,526 --> 00:41:29,234
eventually lead to fatal outcomes.

418
00:41:30,443 --> 00:41:32,151
It can make you lose your reason.

419
00:41:33,151 --> 00:41:36,109
And sometimes, even a
hint of greed can lead to ruin.

420
00:41:37,443 --> 00:41:39,901
Sir, it's ready.

421
00:41:40,859 --> 00:41:41,776
Thank you.

422
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:43,567
Ah.

423
00:41:50,817 --> 00:41:51,859
Thank you.

424
00:42:01,401 --> 00:42:02,234
Thank you.

425
00:42:06,068 --> 00:42:09,776
Normally, you're idle at work,
but you don't hesitate to volunteer

426
00:42:10,692 --> 00:42:12,692
for suite room service calls.

427
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:16,401
Because of the
temptation of a few bucks.

428
00:42:17,151 --> 00:42:18,776
Am I right, Mr. Yoon Jae-sik?

429
00:42:19,443 --> 00:42:20,525
What?

430
00:42:22,151 --> 00:42:23,151
Do you know me?

431
00:42:24,443 --> 00:42:27,984
That nasty habit of yours
has led to this fatal outcome.

432
00:42:28,068 --> 00:42:30,485
I asked, do you know...

433
00:42:33,443 --> 00:42:35,776
Son of a bitch! What is he doing?!

434
00:43:05,567 --> 00:43:07,901
- Why did you...
- Huh?

435
00:43:08,692 --> 00:43:11,443
You didn't ask why I requested
to have the interview at this hotel.

436
00:43:12,567 --> 00:43:16,901
He extorted a woman for three
years after raping her and filming it.

437
00:43:19,193 --> 00:43:21,318
It broke off her
marriage to her fiancé.

438
00:43:22,817 --> 00:43:25,484
I wanted to take care of it
while doing the interview.

439
00:43:27,443 --> 00:43:29,651
Thankfully, the surgery went well.

440
00:43:33,401 --> 00:43:38,193
But you said you'll kill tonight...

441
00:43:38,276 --> 00:43:39,484
Yes, that's right.

442
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:44,151
I will kill again tonight.

443
00:43:45,193 --> 00:43:47,026
You just have to...

444
00:43:49,692 --> 00:43:53,151
focus on my future victim.

445
00:44:16,109 --> 00:44:18,193
Shit, we're fucked.

446
00:44:37,901 --> 00:44:38,776
Ms. Back?

447
00:44:41,068 --> 00:44:42,068
Ms. Back?

448
00:44:44,151 --> 00:44:47,859
Can't do much about the dead.
You should focus on the living.

449
00:44:49,276 --> 00:44:50,817
Remember our promise?

450
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,734
You must conduct the interview properly

451
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:58,484
in order to have a chance
to save my hostage.

452
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,526
You look too nervous.

453
00:45:08,984 --> 00:45:10,442
Shall we change the mood?

454
00:45:22,609 --> 00:45:24,109
Go on with the interview.

455
00:45:24,193 --> 00:45:25,859
I'll try something on my end.

456
00:45:30,651 --> 00:45:31,692
Afterwards...

457
00:45:32,235 --> 00:45:37,692
I mean, after the first
murder, what did you do?

458
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,984
Afterwards...

459
00:45:45,151 --> 00:45:47,235
Hmm...

460
00:45:55,026 --> 00:45:58,235
I decided to seek out new patients.

461
00:45:58,317 --> 00:45:59,734
Shit.

462
00:46:01,276 --> 00:46:02,692
What am I supposed to do?

463
00:46:05,776 --> 00:46:10,151
Waiting for patients at the hospital
felt like neglecting my duties.

464
00:46:10,235 --> 00:46:13,442
I decided to be proactive.

465
00:46:15,026 --> 00:46:16,193
How?

466
00:46:16,734 --> 00:46:18,276
It was quite easy.

467
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:22,859
I volunteered at various
counseling centers.

468
00:46:22,943 --> 00:46:27,026
And one by one, I found those
who desperately needed my help.

469
00:46:27,109 --> 00:46:29,901
That bastard touches me every night.

470
00:46:29,984 --> 00:46:32,776
- He peed on my lunch...
- It still feels like he's inside me.

471
00:46:32,859 --> 00:46:35,692
- ...and told me to eat it!
- I can't breathe whenever I think of it!

472
00:46:35,776 --> 00:46:39,400
He took my kidney
and my family's as well!

473
00:46:40,359 --> 00:46:45,151
There were plenty of people
with deep pain like my first patient.

474
00:47:08,442 --> 00:47:10,193
And I began to treat them.

475
00:47:10,984 --> 00:47:14,901
I always did my best.

476
00:47:17,818 --> 00:47:22,567
Was the treatment effective?

477
00:47:23,193 --> 00:47:24,401
Of course.

478
00:47:26,151 --> 00:47:29,359
Everyone had a favorable prognosis.

479
00:47:47,317 --> 00:47:49,026
The body just moved.

480
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:51,943
- He could be alive!
- It's just postmortem rigidity.

481
00:47:52,859 --> 00:47:55,317
It'll stop soon, so
don't worry about it.

482
00:48:01,192 --> 00:48:02,192
What is it?

483
00:48:04,651 --> 00:48:06,818
Do you feel a sense of guilt?

484
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:22,651
Guilt?

485
00:48:24,567 --> 00:48:26,401
Was there ever a sense of guilt?

486
00:48:26,859 --> 00:48:29,192
Of course not.

487
00:48:30,026 --> 00:48:32,943
As I told you, I was fulfilling
my duty as a doctor...

488
00:48:33,026 --> 00:48:37,068
No, not you, your patients.

489
00:48:38,734 --> 00:48:40,567
A void comes after revenge.

490
00:48:41,192 --> 00:48:44,442
And guilt normally fills that void.

491
00:48:45,484 --> 00:48:47,317
Your patients must've felt it.

492
00:48:48,442 --> 00:48:51,442
Certainly a few must have felt guilt...

493
00:48:51,526 --> 00:48:53,026
There were.

494
00:48:54,275 --> 00:48:55,943
What a keen observation.

495
00:48:59,985 --> 00:49:02,818
Some of them expressed
distress over guilt.

496
00:49:02,901 --> 00:49:08,442
Which implies that your
treatment is ultimately imperfect.

497
00:49:12,275 --> 00:49:15,609
There is a distinctive
reaction to every treatment.

498
00:49:15,693 --> 00:49:18,359
It is a side effect of recovery.

499
00:49:19,526 --> 00:49:24,776
A doctor who addresses that flaw
is deemed genuinely patient-centric.

500
00:49:25,693 --> 00:49:31,734
Are you saying you
treated their side effects too?

501
00:49:32,359 --> 00:49:33,192
Yes.

502
00:49:45,109 --> 00:49:48,484
How was that possible?

503
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:53,693
I'm quite proficient in hypnotherapy.

504
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:01,234
Everyone finds it unfamiliar at first.

505
00:50:01,317 --> 00:50:06,401
Hypnotism is a simple
therapeutic treatment.

506
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:09,484
People typically...

507
00:50:12,317 --> 00:50:15,401
live by showing only one
side of consciousness.

508
00:50:16,067 --> 00:50:17,276
However, what's important is...

509
00:50:22,401 --> 00:50:23,818
the flip side.

510
00:50:24,693 --> 00:50:29,609
Hidden desires, instincts, and sincerities
that lie within the subconscious.

511
00:50:30,442 --> 00:50:36,276
Hypnosis examines and reconstructs
the flip side of this coin.

512
00:50:39,067 --> 00:50:41,651
Let me give you an example.

513
00:50:42,734 --> 00:50:45,484
Do you know the
composer named Paganini?

514
00:50:53,484 --> 00:50:58,693
I particularly like Caprice No. 24...

515
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:01,526
One moment.

516
00:51:06,776 --> 00:51:08,276
Sun-ju, can you hear me?

517
00:51:08,943 --> 00:51:11,234
I'll just take care of him.

518
00:51:12,067 --> 00:51:14,526
We already confirmed
that he's a serial killer,

519
00:51:14,609 --> 00:51:15,943
so we have nothing to lose.

520
00:51:16,025 --> 00:51:18,693
I'll enter through the
door, so just stay put.

521
00:51:34,442 --> 00:51:37,984
One of my younger patients
really loved this piece.

522
00:51:39,276 --> 00:51:42,192
He was a violin prodigy.

523
00:51:42,276 --> 00:51:46,025
He lived with his
grandmother in a poor home,

524
00:51:46,109 --> 00:51:48,526
but never lost hope.

525
00:51:49,609 --> 00:51:55,776
He practiced with a cheap violin
and mastered all of Paganini's music.

526
00:51:55,860 --> 00:52:01,860
But a bully in his class was
uncomfortable with his talent.

527
00:52:02,776 --> 00:52:04,651
The bully harassed him for a year.

528
00:52:05,693 --> 00:52:06,609
I'm outside the door.

529
00:52:06,693 --> 00:52:08,276
I'm coming in. Be ready.

530
00:52:09,276 --> 00:52:10,609
The bully beat him,

531
00:52:11,317 --> 00:52:12,401
again,

532
00:52:13,568 --> 00:52:15,067
and again...

533
00:52:16,109 --> 00:52:17,025
Three.

534
00:52:19,317 --> 00:52:21,860
This left hand that he
used to grab the bow...

535
00:52:23,568 --> 00:52:24,568
Two.

536
00:52:25,651 --> 00:52:27,484
...was destroyed.

537
00:52:27,568 --> 00:52:28,609
One!

538
00:52:28,693 --> 00:52:29,651
Boom!

539
00:52:48,067 --> 00:52:49,401
The keycard doesn't work.

540
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,151
Continue with the interview for now.

541
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:56,151
Looks like you were very
immersed in the story.

542
00:52:57,151 --> 00:53:01,526
Well, I have a child too.

543
00:53:01,609 --> 00:53:03,025
I see...

544
00:53:06,109 --> 00:53:07,192
Please continue.

545
00:53:08,776 --> 00:53:10,651
What is the matter with this?

546
00:53:22,317 --> 00:53:24,526
You said you have a child.

547
00:53:26,568 --> 00:53:27,568
Yes.

548
00:53:28,151 --> 00:53:31,026
If this patient was your child,

549
00:53:31,776 --> 00:53:33,234
what would you do to the bully?

550
00:53:34,359 --> 00:53:35,942
Wouldn't you want to kill them?

551
00:53:36,026 --> 00:53:39,067
They shattered your child's dream.

552
00:53:43,276 --> 00:53:46,067
You have to answer
honestly. You know that, right?

553
00:53:48,859 --> 00:53:49,776
Yes.

554
00:53:50,693 --> 00:53:54,443
Right, anyone would think that way.

555
00:53:54,526 --> 00:53:57,776
Therefore, I formulated
a plan to do just that.

556
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:00,443
And I'll be carrying it out now.

557
00:54:00,526 --> 00:54:01,693
What?

558
00:54:02,234 --> 00:54:03,984
I'll kill them.

559
00:54:04,859 --> 00:54:06,234
The bully.

560
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:08,859
What the hell is he doing?

561
00:54:08,942 --> 00:54:10,276
But...

562
00:54:12,067 --> 00:54:13,276
How...

563
00:54:13,942 --> 00:54:15,026
Hypnosis.

564
00:54:16,401 --> 00:54:19,900
I have been hypnotizing
the bully over the phone.

565
00:54:20,984 --> 00:54:24,526
I first made contact by
offering a gift for taking a survey.

566
00:54:25,693 --> 00:54:29,817
Then I used a keyword to control
their subconscious with every call.

567
00:54:33,484 --> 00:54:34,776
Don't be surprised.

568
00:54:35,484 --> 00:54:37,318
It's quite simple.

569
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:42,776
The space and an image
to focus on the hypnosis.

570
00:54:43,568 --> 00:54:45,526
These two conditions are all we need.

571
00:54:47,859 --> 00:54:50,234
Where in school fulfills that?

572
00:54:50,859 --> 00:54:53,610
Somewhere they can focus alone.

573
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,484
A place where they can
bask in serene blue light.

574
00:55:00,526 --> 00:55:01,817
The rooftop?

575
00:55:05,775 --> 00:55:10,109
That place should be the
bully's dream space now.

576
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:14,526
Should they choose to,
they could even fly at will.

577
00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:18,942
One text from me,

578
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:22,526
and they will soar into the sky.

579
00:55:25,817 --> 00:55:29,651
Must you go this far?
They are still a child.

580
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:31,651
That's precisely why.

581
00:55:32,401 --> 00:55:35,484
A child like that could grow
up to become a monster.

582
00:55:41,109 --> 00:55:42,276
Oh, yeah.

583
00:55:43,234 --> 00:55:47,484
Aren't you curious about what
happened to my patient's hand?

584
00:55:51,026 --> 00:55:53,026
It was mutilated with a razor blade.

585
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:58,775
Razor blade?

586
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,651
To make sure it's unrecoverable...

587
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:08,192
Here...

588
00:56:08,901 --> 00:56:09,817
and here.

589
00:56:11,151 --> 00:56:12,484
They severed it all.

590
00:56:17,817 --> 00:56:19,401
Isn't it cruel?

591
00:56:24,067 --> 00:56:25,942
Shall I send that text?

592
00:56:26,026 --> 00:56:27,401
Wait, wait!

593
00:56:28,109 --> 00:56:29,276
Stop it.

594
00:56:30,109 --> 00:56:32,984
Didn't you agree to this?
As a parent of a child?

595
00:56:33,067 --> 00:56:37,276
No, I was talking about it
from an emotional aspect.

596
00:56:38,984 --> 00:56:40,984
There's a long way
to go before sundown.

597
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:42,984
I told you this already.

598
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:46,901
The one you can save
will be killed at night.

599
00:56:49,942 --> 00:56:51,109
This one is up to me.

600
00:56:51,193 --> 00:56:52,984
Stop! Stop it!

601
00:57:02,151 --> 00:57:03,859
Why are you so worked up?

602
00:57:06,318 --> 00:57:08,984
Could you explain your emotional state?

603
00:57:10,067 --> 00:57:12,901
The bully...

604
00:57:15,276 --> 00:57:16,234
Is it...

605
00:57:19,151 --> 00:57:20,984
my daughter?

606
00:57:37,859 --> 00:57:39,109
No, it's not.

607
00:57:44,067 --> 00:57:47,026
This happened between male students.

608
00:58:03,151 --> 00:58:04,984
Are you relieved?

609
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:10,609
You mentioned your daughter.

610
00:58:14,485 --> 00:58:17,234
Are you experiencing
any problems with her?

611
00:58:24,609 --> 00:58:25,817
Ms. Back?

612
00:58:28,609 --> 00:58:29,567
Ma'am.

613
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:52,109
Please pay close attention.

614
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:55,443
Relax as much as possible.

615
00:59:04,443 --> 00:59:06,276
Do you feel relaxed?

616
00:59:11,485 --> 00:59:12,984
Sun-ju, what's wrong?

617
00:59:13,068 --> 00:59:13,942
Back Sun-ju!

618
00:59:14,485 --> 00:59:16,650
Can you hear me?

619
00:59:17,692 --> 00:59:19,567
All right, shall we talk about it?

620
00:59:21,234 --> 00:59:23,193
Is there something
wrong with your daughter?

621
00:59:26,109 --> 00:59:28,817
I think she's hiding something from me.

622
00:59:30,193 --> 00:59:32,109
Since when?

623
00:59:32,942 --> 00:59:34,567
Six months ago.

624
00:59:35,318 --> 00:59:39,151
Did something special happen back then?

625
00:59:40,068 --> 00:59:41,318
A few months before that,

626
00:59:44,151 --> 00:59:47,817
my ex filed a custody lawsuit.

627
00:59:47,901 --> 00:59:49,068
And?

628
00:59:50,109 --> 00:59:51,234
I think...

629
00:59:53,068 --> 00:59:55,609
she wants to live with her dad.

630
00:59:57,109 --> 00:59:58,817
Why do you think so?

631
01:00:00,984 --> 01:00:02,984
Because he's more capable,

632
01:00:04,234 --> 01:00:05,901
financially and otherwise.

633
01:00:07,401 --> 01:00:08,401
And...

634
01:00:10,734 --> 01:00:13,234
she's resembling him more and more.

635
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:15,068
Resembling her dad?

636
01:00:16,609 --> 01:00:19,151
She's egotistical and selfish.

637
01:00:21,276 --> 01:00:23,484
She doesn't open up to me.

638
01:00:24,984 --> 01:00:26,360
I struggled so much...

639
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,318
raising her.

640
01:00:33,109 --> 01:00:34,360
Even now...

641
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:39,859
if she knew what I
put up with at work...

642
01:00:41,525 --> 01:00:45,318
What is your feeling towards her now?

643
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:47,984
Do you detest her?

644
01:00:51,484 --> 01:00:53,276
Be honest with me.

645
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:55,692
You do, don't you?

646
01:00:57,651 --> 01:00:58,776
Am I right?

647
01:01:01,984 --> 01:01:03,235
Tell me.

648
01:01:03,318 --> 01:01:06,235
Do you detest her? Do you loathe her?

649
01:01:25,235 --> 01:01:26,651
Mom!

650
01:01:34,692 --> 01:01:36,609
What did you do to me?

651
01:01:38,525 --> 01:01:39,901
Nothing.

652
01:01:41,484 --> 01:01:43,943
I simply asked some questions.

653
01:01:46,359 --> 01:01:50,734
It looked like you had a lot to say.

654
01:01:52,776 --> 01:01:55,609
Sun-ju, can you hear
me? Have you come to?

655
01:01:59,734 --> 01:02:01,442
This guy is no joke.

656
01:02:02,026 --> 01:02:05,235
He'll eventually find
out about our plan.

657
01:02:05,318 --> 01:02:07,567
You'll have to walk out
of there on your own.

658
01:02:07,651 --> 01:02:09,984
You still have what I gave you, right?

659
01:02:10,068 --> 01:02:12,151
Use it to knock him
out and get out of there.

660
01:02:12,734 --> 01:02:15,526
I'll take care of the rest.

661
01:02:27,235 --> 01:02:28,109
Then...

662
01:02:29,526 --> 01:02:30,734
Shall we continue with the...

663
01:02:30,818 --> 01:02:31,818
No!

664
01:02:34,651 --> 01:02:38,567
I don't think I can continue like this.

665
01:02:40,484 --> 01:02:41,317
Pardon?

666
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:45,859
Please tell me who you
are planning to kill tonight.

667
01:02:47,193 --> 01:02:49,901
I said I'll tell you
after the interview.

668
01:03:02,235 --> 01:03:08,275
I understand how exceptional
and formidable you are.

669
01:03:09,609 --> 01:03:11,068
So please stop.

670
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:14,776
Why did you suddenly become so urgent?

671
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:20,151
Is there a sudden surge of
desire to save that person?

672
01:03:25,526 --> 01:03:28,692
Why did your behavior change?

673
01:03:30,776 --> 01:03:31,984
Tell me.

674
01:03:33,859 --> 01:03:36,110
So that I can decide
whether to disclose it or not.

675
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:38,359
Okay?

676
01:03:40,193 --> 01:03:44,026
Stop playing with people's lives.

677
01:03:47,110 --> 01:03:49,526
Sun-ju, now. Do it!

678
01:03:58,943 --> 01:04:00,193
Very well.

679
01:04:02,026 --> 01:04:03,110
I'll tell you.

680
01:04:04,484 --> 01:04:07,818
Please relax and sit down.

681
01:04:08,734 --> 01:04:11,401
Sun-ju, why aren't
you knocking him out?!

682
01:04:27,026 --> 01:04:30,026
Since you're so
desperate, I'll tell you.

683
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:36,151
But how effective would it
be to tell a journalist about it?

684
01:04:36,776 --> 01:04:41,151
Wouldn't it be better
to tell the police?

685
01:04:42,317 --> 01:04:44,901
What do you...

686
01:04:44,984 --> 01:04:48,651
I made an appointment
to meet a detective today.

687
01:04:49,693 --> 01:04:52,401
He's been waiting
downstairs for a while now.

688
01:04:52,484 --> 01:04:54,234
What's he saying?

689
01:04:54,317 --> 01:04:56,151
He'll be coming up soon.

690
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:07,275
Hang on, I'll be right over.

691
01:05:14,776 --> 01:05:15,609
What the hell?

692
01:05:44,901 --> 01:05:46,068
Hello?

693
01:05:58,192 --> 01:05:59,068
Hello?

694
01:06:01,901 --> 01:06:03,567
What the hell?

695
01:06:15,109 --> 01:06:17,026
Why do you look so tense?

696
01:06:17,693 --> 01:06:18,818
You can tell me.

697
01:06:19,317 --> 01:06:23,526
Was there something
you found unpleasant?

698
01:06:27,776 --> 01:06:31,401
Or are you expecting someone?

699
01:06:32,401 --> 01:06:33,442
For example...

700
01:06:34,943 --> 01:06:37,734
your lover, Lt. Han Sang-woo?

701
01:06:41,693 --> 01:06:44,568
Hmm. That's too bad.

702
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:47,901
He should be sound asleep by now.

703
01:07:03,484 --> 01:07:06,067
Psychiatrists have incredible reflexes.

704
01:07:07,734 --> 01:07:11,359
You never know when a
patient might suddenly act out.

705
01:07:15,109 --> 01:07:17,401
I think you need to calm down for now.

706
01:07:55,943 --> 01:07:57,150
Are you awake?

707
01:08:01,818 --> 01:08:03,651
I was forced to inconvenience you.

708
01:08:13,024 --> 01:08:14,733
Didn't I...

709
01:08:18,901 --> 01:08:20,234
ask you nicely?

710
01:08:22,651 --> 01:08:25,484
To keep...

711
01:08:28,817 --> 01:08:30,109
my promise.

712
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:35,442
I... I'm sorry.

713
01:08:42,401 --> 01:08:43,568
Not at all.

714
01:08:45,818 --> 01:08:49,983
Since I lied to you, I'll
turn a blind eye this time.

715
01:08:51,442 --> 01:08:52,443
What?

716
01:08:53,234 --> 01:08:56,276
I had a different reason
for requesting this interview.

717
01:08:57,734 --> 01:09:00,776
The truth is, I'm not the
subject of this interview...

718
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:06,150
you are.

719
01:09:10,025 --> 01:09:13,276
There was something I
needed to check in person.

720
01:09:17,025 --> 01:09:18,860
You look confused.

721
01:09:19,484 --> 01:09:20,609
Why?

722
01:09:22,567 --> 01:09:23,693
Are you scared?

723
01:09:25,024 --> 01:09:27,276
Do you think I'll hurt you?

724
01:09:38,192 --> 01:09:41,191
Is there something that
burdens your conscience?

725
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:47,234
Something that would give
me a reason to harm you?

726
01:09:47,818 --> 01:09:48,776
No.

727
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:53,192
I didn't lead a bad life for
me to be someone's target.

728
01:09:58,818 --> 01:09:59,984
Are you sure?

729
01:10:27,859 --> 01:10:30,359
Relax and think about it again.

730
01:10:30,443 --> 01:10:32,984
Is your life truly flawless?

731
01:10:36,317 --> 01:10:39,443
Nothing in your heart bothers you?

732
01:10:43,401 --> 01:10:44,359
Is this about...

733
01:10:45,984 --> 01:10:48,984
the Ilsin Group case?

734
01:10:51,151 --> 01:10:53,026
Ilsin Group?

735
01:10:55,359 --> 01:10:56,693
What's that about?

736
01:11:33,484 --> 01:11:36,192
Lt. Han, I think it'd
be best if you stay put.

737
01:11:37,109 --> 01:11:40,234
Your actions may put
Ms. Back in danger.

738
01:11:49,026 --> 01:11:50,484
Shall we continue?

739
01:11:51,735 --> 01:11:53,276
What happened?

740
01:11:59,234 --> 01:12:00,526
A year or so ago...

741
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:04,817
I got a call from a man named Min.

742
01:12:05,651 --> 01:12:06,735
Who was that?

743
01:12:07,276 --> 01:12:10,526
He was the head of Ilsin
Group's IS Bio finance team.

744
01:12:12,901 --> 01:12:16,817
He wanted to blow the
whistle on his company.

745
01:12:18,526 --> 01:12:23,109
About 10 years ago, an incident led
to discharging hazardous substances

746
01:12:23,192 --> 01:12:26,526
into the Yeongsan River
due to lax management.

747
01:12:27,401 --> 01:12:30,484
The company bribed the prosecution
and politicians to cover it up,

748
01:12:31,109 --> 01:12:34,568
and he was in charge of
slush funds for this purpose.

749
01:12:35,984 --> 01:12:37,734
He sounded like a just person.

750
01:12:38,276 --> 01:12:40,859
It must've been a critical
blow to the company.

751
01:12:41,984 --> 01:12:47,693
There was a rapid increase in pediatric
cancer rates near the discharge area.

752
01:12:49,109 --> 01:12:51,109
He felt guilty about it.

753
01:12:51,901 --> 01:12:54,151
Then what did you do?

754
01:12:54,984 --> 01:12:57,526
I gathered evidence
through my investigation.

755
01:12:58,610 --> 01:12:59,775
But...

756
01:13:00,443 --> 01:13:02,610
when I was about to go to the press...

757
01:13:03,276 --> 01:13:08,276
the ledger I had hidden
at home was stolen.

758
01:13:14,610 --> 01:13:17,443
And that night...

759
01:13:22,151 --> 01:13:23,109
Mr. Min...

760
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:27,193
died in a hit-and-run.

761
01:13:30,359 --> 01:13:31,817
That must've put you in a spot.

762
01:13:33,568 --> 01:13:38,151
My sole witness and
evidence disappeared instantly.

763
01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:41,109
And what happened next?

764
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:53,650
The report was abandoned.

765
01:13:54,568 --> 01:13:55,901
But a month ago,

766
01:13:56,984 --> 01:14:00,067
my company's audit
team received a phone call.

767
01:14:01,610 --> 01:14:06,318
They claimed that I colluded
with Ilsin and stole their ledger.

768
01:14:06,401 --> 01:14:07,942
I told you already!

769
01:14:08,026 --> 01:14:09,942
I'll do whatever it takes
to uncover the truth.

770
01:14:11,026 --> 01:14:13,318
It was a tip without any evidence,

771
01:14:14,109 --> 01:14:17,276
but they put more weight in an
anonymous call than my words.

772
01:14:19,485 --> 01:14:22,026
It looked like they wanted me gone.

773
01:14:23,151 --> 01:14:24,359
Fascinating.

774
01:14:25,817 --> 01:14:30,401
Cornering an employee
with a baseless tip.

775
01:14:32,776 --> 01:14:36,901
A dog who lost a fight
is just a hunk of meat.

776
01:14:36,984 --> 01:14:38,276
But...

777
01:14:41,026 --> 01:14:43,234
are you certain about your innocence?

778
01:14:45,193 --> 01:14:48,485
Perhaps you believe that
someone contracted me to kill you,

779
01:14:49,193 --> 01:14:55,692
because they believe that you
colluded with a conglomerate.

780
01:14:58,901 --> 01:15:00,276
Be honest.

781
01:15:02,234 --> 01:15:03,401
Are you innocent?

782
01:15:04,609 --> 01:15:07,068
Yes, I'm innocent.

783
01:15:07,859 --> 01:15:11,193
Please think carefully
before answering.

784
01:15:12,026 --> 01:15:14,068
Are you really innocent?

785
01:15:15,734 --> 01:15:16,942
I am.

786
01:15:19,942 --> 01:15:22,901
Can you swear on your daughter's life?

787
01:15:25,443 --> 01:15:27,359
Don't you dare bring her up.

788
01:15:28,734 --> 01:15:30,443
I'm innocent!

789
01:15:40,026 --> 01:15:41,567
Don't get so worked up.

790
01:15:42,942 --> 01:15:45,401
I know very well that you're innocent.

791
01:15:46,485 --> 01:15:49,567
And I know that tip was fake as well.

792
01:15:49,650 --> 01:15:50,817
Because...

793
01:15:55,234 --> 01:15:56,776
I made that call.

794
01:15:59,525 --> 01:16:00,776
You?

795
01:16:03,276 --> 01:16:04,193
Why?

796
01:16:04,276 --> 01:16:06,901
To bring you here.

797
01:16:07,485 --> 01:16:08,401
Think about it.

798
01:16:08,485 --> 01:16:15,401
Had I not made that call,
would you be sitting here?

799
01:16:18,484 --> 01:16:25,318
I did not invite you here to hurt you.

800
01:16:30,525 --> 01:16:32,401
It's to treat you.

801
01:16:33,651 --> 01:16:38,609
To treat me?

802
01:16:39,817 --> 01:16:40,859
Yes.

803
01:16:52,318 --> 01:16:55,443
Before we begin the treatment...

804
01:17:04,901 --> 01:17:06,318
Lt. Han Sang-woo.

805
01:17:07,026 --> 01:17:08,651
Why are you squirming like that?

806
01:17:09,525 --> 01:17:11,859
It'll take forever for you to escape.

807
01:17:12,567 --> 01:17:14,609
Or should I come down and help?

808
01:17:16,026 --> 01:17:17,567
Sang-woo has nothing to do with this.

809
01:17:17,651 --> 01:17:19,318
I planned it all!

810
01:17:20,651 --> 01:17:22,817
You two must be very close.

811
01:17:25,193 --> 01:17:28,859
He's an old friend.

812
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:32,151
And someone I love.

813
01:17:38,609 --> 01:17:39,734
Right.

814
01:17:41,984 --> 01:17:43,235
Then...

815
01:17:46,484 --> 01:17:49,193
why do you think he's so
desperate to break free?

816
01:17:50,943 --> 01:17:52,817
To come here and rescue you?

817
01:17:53,901 --> 01:17:58,442
No, if it was for you,
he should stay put.

818
01:17:58,525 --> 01:18:02,109
I sternly warned him that
he could put you in danger.

819
01:18:06,859 --> 01:18:08,235
The answer is simple.

820
01:18:11,567 --> 01:18:14,901
The one who stole
the ledger was Lt. Han.

821
01:18:17,235 --> 01:18:20,026
But how...

822
01:18:20,692 --> 01:18:22,984
Who knew you were
investigating Ilsin Group

823
01:18:23,068 --> 01:18:26,068
and that you were hiding
their ledger at home?

824
01:18:26,151 --> 01:18:29,109
Lastly, who knew you'd be
coming home late that night?

825
01:18:29,193 --> 01:18:31,193
Who could this person be?

826
01:18:32,776 --> 01:18:34,442
Right, there was only one person.

827
01:18:35,442 --> 01:18:36,692
That's impossible.

828
01:18:37,276 --> 01:18:40,068
- He's a man of integrity...
- He was.

829
01:18:40,151 --> 01:18:43,151
And a very capable
violent crimes detective.

830
01:18:44,109 --> 01:18:47,984
That's why he was a thorn
in the side of the syndicates.

831
01:18:49,235 --> 01:18:53,526
So they laid traps.

832
01:18:54,984 --> 01:18:56,817
Oh, come on.

833
01:19:00,276 --> 01:19:02,026
Are you kidding me?

834
01:19:05,943 --> 01:19:07,442
I'm sorry.

835
01:19:08,151 --> 01:19:10,151
I'm so sorry.

836
01:19:12,068 --> 01:19:14,359
He couldn't have imagined back then.

837
01:19:14,442 --> 01:19:16,901
He probably thought it
was just a coincidence.

838
01:19:16,984 --> 01:19:22,734
But all of that was a carefully
crafted trap to catch Lt. Han.

839
01:19:26,943 --> 01:19:30,276
Unfortunately, he
foolishly took the bait.

840
01:19:54,526 --> 01:19:56,859
In the end, he became a hunting dog,

841
01:19:56,943 --> 01:20:00,943
sneaking investigation reports
for the criminal organization.

842
01:20:10,651 --> 01:20:12,526
What a fucking moron.

843
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:26,359
Even if that's true, why
did he steal the ledger?

844
01:20:26,442 --> 01:20:28,234
He had plenty of reasons.

845
01:20:28,818 --> 01:20:33,234
Ilsin Group, who was tailing
you, approached Lt. Han.

846
01:20:35,401 --> 01:20:39,567
They leveraged connections
with the police commissioner

847
01:20:39,651 --> 01:20:41,859
to negotiate a favor in
exchange for the ledger.

848
01:20:43,484 --> 01:20:46,151
In return, he wanted a promotion at HQ.

849
01:20:46,234 --> 01:20:47,484
Looking forward to our future.

850
01:20:50,234 --> 01:20:54,609
He thought he could demolish the
criminals who had him on a leash.

851
01:20:55,776 --> 01:20:58,901
Wait. There's an
inconsistency in your story.

852
01:20:59,526 --> 01:21:01,275
He never received that promotion.

853
01:21:01,359 --> 01:21:04,567
He was removed from the promotion list.

854
01:21:05,234 --> 01:21:06,818
You're very naive.

855
01:21:08,359 --> 01:21:11,151
Do you think the conglomerates

856
01:21:11,234 --> 01:21:14,026
became what they are
by keeping promises?

857
01:21:19,068 --> 01:21:22,110
Ilsin Group already knew
about Lt. Han's corruption.

858
01:21:22,192 --> 01:21:26,984
They took the ledger and walked away.

859
01:21:35,317 --> 01:21:36,442
In the end,

860
01:21:36,943 --> 01:21:40,317
he became a dog chasing the wind.

861
01:21:49,693 --> 01:21:54,484
Can you prove this story?

862
01:21:55,401 --> 01:21:56,609
Of course.

863
01:22:00,776 --> 01:22:07,317
All it takes is this little device
to reveal a man's life nowadays.

864
01:22:09,567 --> 01:22:12,526
My patients are from all walks of life.

865
01:22:13,567 --> 01:22:17,651
One of them is a top-tier programmer
exhausted by his CEO's tyranny.

866
01:22:18,734 --> 01:22:22,234
I was able to find out about
your plan thanks to him.

867
01:22:23,234 --> 01:22:26,859
So the ledger...

868
01:22:27,818 --> 01:22:30,734
was taken by Han Sang-woo...

869
01:22:30,818 --> 01:22:33,526
Han Sang-woo was
behind the entire thing.

870
01:22:34,734 --> 01:22:38,734
But what's important is that
it's not the end of the story.

871
01:22:41,401 --> 01:22:43,192
This case has a witness.

872
01:23:00,150 --> 01:23:05,651
You have to stay strong
as you listen to the next part.

873
01:23:07,651 --> 01:23:12,985
Han snuck into your home
thinking that it'd be empty.

874
01:23:20,609 --> 01:23:24,943
He ransacked the place to
make it look like a home burglary.

875
01:23:26,734 --> 01:23:29,651
But an unexpected person entered.

876
01:23:31,317 --> 01:23:33,442
Ye-rin was feeling unwell...

877
01:23:33,526 --> 01:23:35,859
What are you doing?

878
01:23:35,943 --> 01:23:38,317
...and came home early
from after-school classes.

879
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:45,568
Han needed to shut her
up in any way possible.

880
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:57,568
So he raped her.

881
01:23:57,651 --> 01:23:58,776
Stop!

882
01:24:09,150 --> 01:24:10,234
That's impossible.

883
01:24:11,025 --> 01:24:12,526
Why would he...

884
01:24:14,025 --> 01:24:16,067
She looked up to him like her own dad.

885
01:24:16,150 --> 01:24:18,693
Because he knew so much about her.

886
01:24:21,651 --> 01:24:25,901
He knew she didn't want to go
live with her dad no matter what.

887
01:24:26,568 --> 01:24:28,609
That's why he did what he did.

888
01:24:28,693 --> 01:24:31,359
If word of her rape got out,

889
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:34,985
she knew she would
be taken away from you.

890
01:24:39,234 --> 01:24:41,651
No, no...

891
01:24:41,734 --> 01:24:43,109
It's all a lie!

892
01:24:44,401 --> 01:24:46,401
How could I believe a lunatic like you?

893
01:24:53,192 --> 01:24:54,943
I told you clearly.

894
01:24:56,234 --> 01:24:58,317
That you should stay strong.

895
01:24:59,067 --> 01:25:00,359
Then what is this?

896
01:25:01,151 --> 01:25:02,901
What is this insanity?!

897
01:25:04,151 --> 01:25:05,860
Call it a psycho drama.

898
01:25:07,526 --> 01:25:11,984
I push patients to the extreme to
help them confront their inner selves.

899
01:25:13,734 --> 01:25:17,901
I made it so that rational people
like you could react honestly

900
01:25:19,151 --> 01:25:20,609
to the current situation.

901
01:25:23,025 --> 01:25:23,901
What?

902
01:25:26,860 --> 01:25:29,109
That waiter's victim...

903
01:25:30,443 --> 01:25:32,443
works at this hotel's security team.

904
01:25:33,776 --> 01:25:38,443
Thanks to her, I have access
to security cameras and locks.

905
01:25:42,818 --> 01:25:44,984
You must've seen a razor
blade in Ye-rin's bag.

906
01:26:25,942 --> 01:26:27,860
If you do not believe me,

907
01:26:29,776 --> 01:26:31,609
ask your daughter yourself.

908
01:26:46,693 --> 01:26:49,067
MY SWEETHEART

909
01:27:22,942 --> 01:27:24,609
Hi, Mom.

910
01:27:25,192 --> 01:27:29,735
Hi, Ye-rin. It's me.

911
01:27:30,568 --> 01:27:34,484
Mom, is everything okay?

912
01:27:39,651 --> 01:27:43,151
I'm okay, but...

913
01:27:44,568 --> 01:27:47,568
Ye-rin, did you...

914
01:27:51,192 --> 01:27:52,276
by any chance...

915
01:27:52,359 --> 01:27:56,443
Mom, are you with the doctor?

916
01:27:58,318 --> 01:28:03,651
I'm sorry, Mom. I
wanted to tell you but...

917
01:28:21,693 --> 01:28:22,900
Hi, Ye-rin.

918
01:28:25,859 --> 01:28:30,109
I'll take care of your mom,
so please head on home.

919
01:28:31,775 --> 01:28:32,775
Okay?

920
01:28:44,109 --> 01:28:46,359
The final choice is the
only thing that remains.

921
01:28:49,484 --> 01:28:50,610
What would you like to do?

922
01:28:52,067 --> 01:28:55,234
Do you wish to be treated?

923
01:29:01,484 --> 01:29:04,276
Ye-rin has already made her decision.

924
01:29:06,067 --> 01:29:07,901
It's all up to you now.

925
01:29:18,318 --> 01:29:19,610
I want to see it for myself.

926
01:29:25,734 --> 01:29:30,401
Let me talk to him face-to-face.

927
01:29:32,942 --> 01:29:34,109
As you wish.

928
01:29:42,234 --> 01:29:44,109
But remember one thing.

929
01:29:45,234 --> 01:29:46,568
Whatever happens,

930
01:29:48,067 --> 01:29:49,942
you have to believe in yourself.

931
01:30:28,401 --> 01:30:30,734
Sun-ju...

932
01:30:32,234 --> 01:30:34,984
- Are you okay?
- Is it true?

933
01:30:36,276 --> 01:30:38,859
Did you really touch Ye-rin?

934
01:30:40,443 --> 01:30:42,318
- What are you talking about?
- Tell me the truth!

935
01:30:44,318 --> 01:30:45,359
Is it true?

936
01:30:46,650 --> 01:30:51,650
Is it true what you did to Ye-rin?

937
01:30:52,568 --> 01:30:55,026
Stop this nonsense
and let's get out of here.

938
01:30:58,568 --> 01:30:59,859
Back Sun-ju!

939
01:31:01,817 --> 01:31:02,776
Are you nuts?!

940
01:31:03,859 --> 01:31:05,067
Put that down!

941
01:31:05,692 --> 01:31:06,901
Answer me!

942
01:31:09,067 --> 01:31:11,568
Did you really hurt Ye-rin?

943
01:31:12,650 --> 01:31:13,776
Sun-ju!

944
01:31:14,859 --> 01:31:16,359
You don't believe me?

945
01:31:16,984 --> 01:31:20,109
We have a long history,
but you'll take his word for it?

946
01:31:20,193 --> 01:31:22,568
You saw him conducting a hypnotism.

947
01:31:23,401 --> 01:31:25,026
He could have messed you up.

948
01:31:25,109 --> 01:31:26,609
Snap out of it!

949
01:31:29,151 --> 01:31:30,692
What about what she said?

950
01:31:32,901 --> 01:31:34,526
I talked to her.

951
01:31:35,109 --> 01:31:37,859
What if he messed with her too?

952
01:31:38,526 --> 01:31:39,942
Get it together.

953
01:31:40,026 --> 01:31:41,650
We have to take care of him first!

954
01:31:41,734 --> 01:31:44,109
Or we're both finished!

955
01:31:44,942 --> 01:31:47,776
We have to get out of here.

956
01:31:48,942 --> 01:31:50,485
So calm down.

957
01:31:55,692 --> 01:31:56,817
Good.

958
01:31:57,443 --> 01:31:58,859
Calm down.

959
01:32:02,276 --> 01:32:03,401
Easy.

960
01:32:11,401 --> 01:32:13,401
But remember one thing.

961
01:32:14,068 --> 01:32:17,525
Whatever happens, you
have to believe in yourself.

962
01:32:19,567 --> 01:32:22,318
You think someone broke
in looking for the ledger?

963
01:32:23,151 --> 01:32:24,276
Yeah.

964
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:25,817
I have to get it back.

965
01:32:26,650 --> 01:32:27,734
Okay.

966
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:30,151
- Detective Lee, come here.
- Yes, sir.

967
01:32:30,234 --> 01:32:34,318
Bring me footage from all
nearby security cameras.

968
01:32:45,942 --> 01:32:49,193
Right, you did it.

969
01:32:50,109 --> 01:32:50,942
It was you!

970
01:33:02,276 --> 01:33:03,609
Stop it, Sun-ju!

971
01:33:03,692 --> 01:33:06,651
Why did you do it?! Why!

972
01:33:06,734 --> 01:33:09,942
It was a mistake.

973
01:33:10,984 --> 01:33:13,151
What? A mistake?

974
01:33:13,609 --> 01:33:16,817
I just lost myself and made a mistake.

975
01:33:17,942 --> 01:33:19,901
You son of a bitch!

976
01:33:26,443 --> 01:33:27,942
Stop it already!

977
01:33:28,859 --> 01:33:30,609
I said stop!

978
01:33:31,525 --> 01:33:32,776
You bitch!

979
01:33:37,651 --> 01:33:39,943
I'm gonna kill you!

980
01:33:40,484 --> 01:33:42,026
Go ahead!

981
01:33:42,109 --> 01:33:43,567
Kill me!

982
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:50,943
That's enough, Mr. Han.

983
01:33:58,193 --> 01:33:59,943
You crazy son of a bitch.

984
01:34:02,734 --> 01:34:04,609
You're too agitated.

985
01:34:04,692 --> 01:34:06,484
Shut up, asshole!

986
01:34:06,943 --> 01:34:09,525
I think it'd benefit us
all to resolve this quietly.

987
01:34:11,026 --> 01:34:12,276
Quietly?

988
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:17,109
Yeah, I'll resolve this quietly.

989
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:25,692
It's all over when you
and this bitch die, got that?

990
01:34:25,776 --> 01:34:27,400
Please calm down.

991
01:34:31,817 --> 01:34:33,567
Calm down.

992
01:34:34,901 --> 01:34:36,943
Fuck you, motherfucker!

993
01:34:46,776 --> 01:34:50,525
You see? You were too caught
up to see that it wasn't loaded.

994
01:34:51,276 --> 01:34:52,276
Son of a bitch!

995
01:35:45,984 --> 01:35:48,692
Don't worry, he's just sedated.

996
01:36:09,151 --> 01:36:15,026
I'll take over from here, so
please head on home and...

997
01:36:18,484 --> 01:36:20,068
please give Ye-rin a hug.

998
01:38:53,110 --> 01:38:54,150
What's wrong?

999
01:38:55,859 --> 01:38:56,859
Scared?

1000
01:39:01,567 --> 01:39:02,943
You should feel it too.

1001
01:39:04,943 --> 01:39:06,734
The pain and fear...

1002
01:39:09,859 --> 01:39:11,026
that Ye-rin must've felt.

1003
01:39:40,276 --> 01:39:44,651
When this bell rings, you will wake up.

1004
01:39:59,276 --> 01:40:00,985
How are you feeling lately?

1005
01:40:01,067 --> 01:40:02,776
I'm much better.

1006
01:40:03,568 --> 01:40:07,150
I sleep well and have no nightmares.

1007
01:40:08,651 --> 01:40:09,818
That's good.

1008
01:40:13,734 --> 01:40:15,568
By the way, doctor...

1009
01:40:18,276 --> 01:40:22,526
He won't ever come back, right?

1010
01:40:27,609 --> 01:40:29,859
The news said he went missing.

1011
01:40:30,609 --> 01:40:34,234
His car got swept away by a rapid,
so we won't ever see him again.

1012
01:40:35,526 --> 01:40:38,067
You don't need to worry anymore.

1013
01:40:42,442 --> 01:40:45,734
I'll see you in two weeks, okay?

1014
01:40:46,693 --> 01:40:47,901
Okay.

1015
01:40:51,734 --> 01:40:52,943
Ye-rin.

1016
01:40:55,025 --> 01:40:56,901
Could you ask your mom to come in?

1017
01:41:00,943 --> 01:41:04,067
You really do not wish to be treated?

1018
01:41:12,693 --> 01:41:18,025
Guilt may be tough to deal with.

1019
01:41:20,860 --> 01:41:24,860
I'll have to endure it, as
I've committed a crime.

1020
01:41:29,317 --> 01:41:30,860
And you?

1021
01:41:34,151 --> 01:41:35,693
Are you okay?

1022
01:41:36,776 --> 01:41:38,317
The blood on your hands...

1023
01:41:40,067 --> 01:41:41,776
won't be wiped so easily.

1024
01:42:35,276 --> 01:42:38,276
Ms. Kim, any more appointments today?

1025
01:42:38,359 --> 01:42:41,192
There aren't any more, doctor.

1026
01:42:41,276 --> 01:42:44,818
Then I'll head home now. I'm
feeling a bit under the weather.

1027
01:42:45,526 --> 01:42:47,776
But doctor...

1028
01:42:49,151 --> 01:42:52,526
a social worker brought
in a young child just now.

1029
01:42:53,109 --> 01:42:58,067
They're a victim of abuse
and wish to get counseling.

1030
01:42:59,317 --> 01:43:00,526
What should I do?
