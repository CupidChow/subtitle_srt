1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,320
(Her Private Life)

2
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,080
(Her Private Life)

3
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,760
I guess it was really meant to be.

4
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,280
You and me, I mean.

5
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,160
Think about it.

6
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,800
We're both fans of Lee Sol's work.

7
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,760
27,000 dollars.

8
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,760
29,000 dollars!

9
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,760
30,000 dollars!

10
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,600
Excuse me!

11
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,560
That piece you just purchased,

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,120
please let me have it.

13
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,160
We live in the same building.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,320
Do you work here?

15
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,640
How can I help you?

16
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,160
My favorite artist is an acquaintance of yours.

17
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,880
Is it a meeting with an artist?

18
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,160
A collector.

19
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,600
White Ocean's Cha Si-an.

20
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,800
What?

21
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,320
The jacket.

22
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,240
Even that jacket the Curator Sung was wearing.

23
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,280
Wear this.

24
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,120
That jacket caused some problems,

25
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,000
but anyway, this is destiny.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,280
No, fate!

27
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,120
Here.

28
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,200
- Thank you. - No worries.

29
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,760
Where's Curator Sung going?

30
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,080
To the furniture workshop.

31
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,080
The owner's out, and I got a call saying my wood's being delivered.

32
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,080
So?

33
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,720
I didn't ask her, she offered to go.

34
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,440
Why would she go there when she needs to partake in this meeting?

35
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,160
Maybe she's not feeling well?

36
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,440
She didn't look too well today.

37
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,880
What time is that meeting with Ms. Choi and Mr. Cha Si-an?

38
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,040
At 2 p.m.

39
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,040
Then I'll meet you at the parking lot at 1??

40
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,080
No.

41
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,160
I'll be out for an off-site meeting.

42
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,360
I'll head straight to Ms. Choi's studio from there.

43
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,040
If even Si-an can't make you smile,

44
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,120
then you're really, really very ill.

45
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,560
I saw her without a smile on her face for the first time.

46
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,720
She's always smiling whenever I see her.

47
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,600
So I thought she might be my fan, for a second.

48
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,560
Um, I'll leave you to discuss things.

49
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,240
What?

50
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,960
- Ryan! - Brother!

51
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,800
Is he going to Curator Sung?

52
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,640
If you're not feeling well, you should say so.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Curator Sung?

54
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,640
Curator Sung.

55
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,200
Director.

56
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,960
I didn't want to ask you this??

57
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,120
I really didn't want to ask you, but??

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What was so hard about it?

59
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,720
Being in a fake relationship with me, I mean.

60
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,560
Did you really hate it that much?

61
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,520
Yes.

62
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,680
What did you hate so much about it?

63
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,760
It's not like I called you every day,

64
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,640
or asked you to see me every day.

65
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,360
All you??

66
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,680
All you had to do was pretend you're dating me, for a bit.

67
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,000
Was that so hard for you? Did you hate it that much?

68
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,000
I had butterflies and enjoyed it??

69
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,520
So why, Director??

70
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,960
Because it was fake.

71
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,720
I hated it because it was fake.

72
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,560
I wanted it to be real.

73
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,560
Is anyone there?

74
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,560
Hello?

75
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,560
Anyone? Hello?

76
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,440
Is anyone there?

77
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,600
No one?

78
00:07:54,600 --> 00:08:00,720
(This heart has already been taken)

79
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,960
The exhibition's in two months, so the deadline's a bit tight, huh?

80
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,960
What works will you be contributing?

81
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,000
Here.

82
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,400
(About the works/ From Cha Si-an's Collection)

83
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,000
Director Ryan is also a fan of this painting.

84
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,280
There's a total of nine pieces,

85
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,880
and I wanted to collect them all for the exhibition.

86
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,520
- Sorry, excuse me. - It's alright.

87
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,160
No one's at the workshop, so I'm leaving.

88
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,600
- You must be hungry. - That wasn't me.

89
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,480
You're actually hungry in this situation?

90
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,640
I said it wasn't me.

91
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,400
That's my stomach digesting. I had coffee, you see.

92
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,480
Should we go eat?

93
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,600
Yes.

94
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,280
Um, wait.

95
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,360
What is that?

96
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,480
It's a flashlight. A flashlight!

97
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,040
A flashlight?

98
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,840
Yes.

99
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,960
- It's pretty. - Isn't it?

100
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,200
Ed. Nam!

101
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,040
You should've started a bookstore, not a publishing company.

102
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,240
Gosh, our "Moment" is here!

103
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,000
No wonder our sales went up.

104
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,120
Is it all thanks to Director Ryan?

105
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,520
No matter how I see it, he's a perfect match for Duk-mi.

106
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,120
Mom, what about me?

107
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,160
What about you?

108
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,160
As a match for Duk-mi.

109
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,080
Ha! Don't make such jo??

110
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,880
Nam Eun-ki!

111
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,600
There's no one but me.

112
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,080
A guy who knows Duk-mi more than she knows herself.

113
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,200
I went to check the wood,

114
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,920
but how should I apologize for this?

115
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,680
Maybe we should've gone back to the studio for the meeting.

116
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,360
Mr. Cha Si-an's??

117
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,360
- What do you like about me? - What?

118
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,000
When did you fall for me?

119
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,160
I'm not too sure what you're talking about.

120
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,120
You said it yourself, earlier.

121
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,720
When did it all begin?

122
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,080
Was it when we took those, you know, fake date photos?

123
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,160
Or??

124
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,960
At Mr. Roh Seok's cottage?

125
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,160
Oh! If not that??

126
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,000
Perhaps that time when you had me blindfolded at your place??

127
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,040
Director!

128
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,160
Do you want gimbap?

129
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,720
It's been on my mind

130
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,080
ever since I failed to finish what my Mom made for us.

131
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,400
- Kimbap. - Kimbap!

132
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,720
- Kimbap. - Kimbap.

133
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,400
- Hot-pepper kimbap? - Yes!

134
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,400
Ta-da!

135
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,680
Is that the spicy one?

136
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,880
Just curious, have you not cleaned your house yet?

137
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,400
- Are you cold? - I'm alright.

138
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,120
So this is what Seoul's skyline looks like at night.

139
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,080
Don't you get a better view from your place?

140
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,360
Do I?

141
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,000
I actually chose this place because of the view.

142
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,080
It's a penthouse.

143
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,400
Penthouse?

144
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,720
If you can, get a place with an elevator next time.

145
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,720
Do you want one?

146
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,040
Why not? Try it.

147
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,320
Oops!

148
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,520
I'm so sorry.

149
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,040
It's alright.

150
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,080
It's not once or twice that you've ruined my clothes.

151
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,600
Um??Isn't this my second time?

152
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,320
What kind of Korean person sucks this much at using chopsticks?

153
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,080
Me? I'm really good at using chopsticks.

154
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,640
Oh, so you think you're good at using them.

155
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,920
- Well, are you? - I'm very good, thank you.

156
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,680
- You call that good? - Of course.

157
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,600
I guess Americans buy that.

158
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,600
Ah??Drive safely, Ed. Nam.

159
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,640
Eun-ki??

160
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,160
I??

161
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,240
I'm sorry.

162
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,520
Well this is random.

163
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,120
For what?

164
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,480
I didn't know.

165
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,960
I'm your mother, yet I never knew how you felt.

166
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,760
But then again, I didn't ecxactly raise you myself.

167
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,240
I mean, if I'd known that's how you felt about Duk-mi I'd have??

168
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,120
Mom.

169
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
I didn't know, either.

170
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,600
I only realized it now.

171
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,600
Like an idiot.

172
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,160
So cheer for me at the very least, and don't just feel sorry. Okay?

173
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,160
I'm off.

174
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,200
I'll explain to Ms. Choi and Mr. Cha Si-an tomorrow.

175
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,360
Yes, Director.

176
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,200
Ms. Sung Duk-mi?

177
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,360
Yes, Director?

178
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,200
Miss Duk-mi.

179
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,040
Yes, Director??

180
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,280
So, uh??We are dating, right?

181
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,840
Not pretend. For real.

182
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,600
In Korea, if you kiss and don't date after, you go to jail.

183
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,000
Of course we're dating for real!

184
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,920
It's just that you were so professional, just now.

185
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,520
Oh.

186
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,360
How about we call each other by our names?

187
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,760
Ryan?

188
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,520
Hey, Ryan.

189
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,840
That's a bit??

190
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,840
Aren't there any nicknames that we'd be comfortable using?

191
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,480
Nicknames that we'd be comfortable using? Well??

192
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,800
That Lion bastard.

193
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,080
I'll just go with what's comfortable for me.

194
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,440
See you tomorrow.

195
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,080
I hated it because it was fake.

196
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,560
I wanted it to be real.

197
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,080
Isn't there a way to turn memories into video clips?

198
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,800
I want to put keep replaying it.

199
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,080
I want to take screen shots.

200
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,360
Yes, make screen shots, photoshop, and make gif files??

201
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,680
(T.R.T.S sent message)

202
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,280
Latte,

203
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,160
maybe that person wasn't playing with you. It could be that they

204
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,160
simply took a step back because they didn't know how you felt

205
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,200
and were afraid of getting hurt.

206
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,120
Actually, that was the case with me.

207
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,880
So try to muster up the courage once more.

208
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,920
Good luck!

209
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,720
Thank you, T.R.T.S.

210
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,040
Sun-joo.

211
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,640
Duk-mi, look at this.

212
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,240
Oppa bought me a bag!

213
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,320
Really? It's gorgeous.

214
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,160
He put it in a locker at the barbecue place.

215
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,120
To surprise me.

216
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,000
Really? He sure is sweet.

217
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,400
That's why I'm still with him.

218
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,400
To be honest, Oppa's??

219
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,840
I'm dating Lion!

220
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,560
What?

221
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,520
I told you. It seemed like Lion might like me.

222
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,280
Hurry and tell me how it happened; thoroughly, in detail, all of it!

223
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,320
Duk-mi, you're all grown up, huh?

224
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,640
- Duk-mi. - Yeah?

225
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,200
Did you tell Eun-ki as well?

226
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,160
No, not yet.

227
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,000
Then let's not tell Eun-ki for now.

228
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,840
Why not?

229
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,560
Well, as soon as Eun-ki knows, so will your mom and dad.

230
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,880
Are you okay with that?

231
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,000
No, I'm not.

232
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,160
I can't have that.

233
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,120
Then I should keep this a secret from Eun-ki for the time being.

234
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,280
Don't tell him either.

235
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,280
Alright.

236
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,440
Ju Hyuk! Can I get, uh??

237
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,160
an iced condensed milk latte?

238
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,040
To go!

239
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,200
Did you already have a coffee?

240
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,680
I bought this for you.

241
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,160
Iced americano with an extra shot?

242
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,120
How did you know my coffee order?

243
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,080
I used my Phone-a-Friend lifeline.

244
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,320
Well, this is for you.

245
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,800
Sir,

246
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,760
this is condensed milk latte made with a dash of my sincerity.

247
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,040
How is it?

248
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,800
Delicious.

249
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,600
You're a bit late coming into work today.

250
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,880
Uh, I'm on time.

251
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,200
Oh, I guess I'm the only one who missed someone.

252
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,440
What do you mean?

253
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,000
Then I'll camp out here tonight.

254
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,160
Nothing hard about an all-nighter.

255
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,200
- Can I sleep with you? - What do you??

256
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,920
Well, it's because I've never slept in a tent before.

257
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,040
Typical American.

258
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,160
Oh? My son! When did you get here?

259
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,200
Hey, I told you to have me carry all the heavy stuff.

260
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,120
I have a husband who does nothing but bring rocks home,

261
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,000
so why would I ask that of my son who brings home money?

262
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,720
Your dad's still got it.

263
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,160
What about dinner?

264
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,680
Ate already.

265
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,520
Mom, is my suit here?

266
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,800
Suit? What, are you going to a wedding?

267
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,720
Why are you smiling about someone else's wedding?

268
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,040
You should be thinking about your own wedding.

269
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,600
It's here.

270
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,480
Did we dry-clean it?

271
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,000
What's up with Curator Sung?

272
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,040
I'm getting a very bad feeling.

273
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,320
Bad feeling?

274
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,560
Do you think Curator Sung and Director Gold got back??

275
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,000
No way.

276
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,480
Come on, no way!

277
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,320
Curator Sung Duk-mi?

278
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,840
Yes, Director.

279
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,200
Let's start the meeting.

280
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,200
Shall we?

281
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,480
What are you all doing? Let's go.

282
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,520
I was right, right? About them getting back together?

283
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,600
So the bomb's ticking again?

284
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,080
Ugh??

285
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,760
How's the progress on our talks with Ullim Museum

286
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,920
regarding Mr. Ahn's works?

287
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,560
Ullim Museum said it may take some time

288
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,120
as the works we requested first require approval from

289
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,400
the original donor.

290
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,560
But this donor is currently on an overseas trip,

291
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,160
so I'll contact them as soon as they're back.

292
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,600
Alright, good.

293
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,160
Then next is??Merchandise planning.

294
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,160
Ms. Kim Hyo-jin, how far have you gotten?

295
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,000
Don't be surprised.

296
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,160
What's this?

297
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,840
Cheering sticks for Si-an!

298
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,960
Why don't we add our museum's name or logo on here?

299
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,440
It even lights up!

300
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:17,320
This looks like that flashlight of yours, Curator Sung.

301
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,160
They make flashlights that look like this?

302
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,120
See, Curator Sung has??

303
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,720
Um, Hyo-jin?

304
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,960
It makes we think that our museum merchandise should be

305
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,520
distinct from idol merchandise.

306
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,360
Then??

307
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:37,120
How about cushions with Si-an's face printed on them?

308
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,720
Or there's this soap, too.

309
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,600
Ta-da! A keychain.

310
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,120
You don't like these?

311
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,120
Really?

312
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,000
You don't have anything else?

313
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,800
(Proposal for the Celebrities' Collection Merchandise)

314
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,440
"My Own Little Museum"

315
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,920
We could make miniatures of the artworks on exhibit for

316
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,520
people to display them how they want, like a curator.

317
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,080
(fits in one hand)

318
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,520
This is pretty good.

319
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,160
Really?

320
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,600
We could adopt this idea

321
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,040
not just for this special exhibition, but take it a bit further

322
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,000
and apply it to all future exhibitions at Cheum.

323
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,080
Ah! See?

324
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,280
I told you, I'm an expert at merchandising.

325
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,080
- Curator Yoo? - Yes.

326
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,120
Please pay extra attention to our intern so that

327
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,080
she doesn't let her passion or confidence go overboard.

328
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,080
Got it.

329
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,800
Let's end our meeting here.

330
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,840
Wh-what's this about?

331
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,800
Curator Sung.

332
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,000
Are you back with the Director?

333
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,520
Rather thanbeing back together, we're actually beginning??

334
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,480
"I'll be like I was in the beginning." "I'll treat you well."

335
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,280
I'm sure he's a first-rate sweet talker.

336
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,680
But Curator Sung,

337
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,040
you cannot be the one to fix people's flaws.

338
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,240
All I have to do is fix this.

339
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,280
Studies have proven it.

340
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,160
Couples who've broken up will do so again for the same reasons!

341
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,160
In car terms, Director is a shitbox.

342
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,560
Shit. Box.

343
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,280
Right now, you're too blinded by his good looks to

344
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,480
realize that he's a foul-smelling wreck!

345
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,080
That smells so good, though.

346
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,960
A guy who only has his good looks to boast?

347
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,080
Ha! You can never make a decent man out of him.

348
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,720
What, you think I haven't tried?

349
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,640
Exactly.

350
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,160
Curator Yoo? Mr. Kim Yoo-sub?

351
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,920
Remember this.

352
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,160
I, Sung Duk-mi, will put up with whatever's said against me,

353
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,320
but not with what's said against my Lion ba??

354
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,720
I mean, Director Gold.

355
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,120
Anyway, I appreciate how you're concerned for me,

356
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,000
but Director Gold's not like that. It's all a misunderstanding.

357
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,040
- Curator Sung. - Curator Sung!

358
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,560
I mean it.

359
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,000
So from now on??shhh!

360
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Ugh!

361
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,560
Miss Duk-mi.

362
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,840
Ryan's in his office, right?

363
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,520
Yes.

364
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,120
Would you like some tea if you're here for a meeting?

365
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,360
No. There's something I wanted to discuss with him in private.

366
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,680
Are you alright?

367
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,000
I am! Of course.

368
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,360
About yesterday??

369
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,080
I'm sorry.

370
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,480
I never got back to you about the meeting nor the wood.

371
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,280
I won't let that happen again.

372
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,920
What about Ms. Sung Duk-mi? Did you guys make up?

373
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,360
We never fought in the first place.

374
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,560
Then I'm guessing you've ended your fake relationship.

375
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,280
Yup.

376
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,440
How's Mr. Cha Si-an?

377
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,000
He's great.

378
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,160
He's more serious than I thought, and his music's great, too.

379
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,440
I think it'll be fun working with him.

380
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,680
I'm glad to hear that.

381
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,080
But I found something strange.

382
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,000
The works Mr. Cha wanted to contribute to the exhibition??

383
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,960
It's that one, isn't it?

384
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,760
That artwork you bought from New York Gallery.

385
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,040
You have a good memory.

386
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,640
The reason Cha Si-an has to be in this exhibition no matter what,

387
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,080
and the reason you asked me for a favor for the first time??

388
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,280
Is it this painting?

389
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,200
Just who is Lee Sol?

390
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,600
I'm always grateful to you.

391
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,560
Please do a good job on our special exhibition with him.

392
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,480
You sure have a long way of saying "don't ask."

393
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,760
Way to embarrass me.

394
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,160
Ms. Choi Da-in.

395
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,400
I'm looking forward to your collaboration with Mr. Cha Si-an.

396
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,080
Yes, and I'm also very much looking forward to

397
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,760
how long your relationship with Ms. Sung Duk-mi will last.

398
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,200
Is that a curse?

399
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,120
I said, I'm looking forward to it. Looking forward.

400
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,800
But??

401
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,720
How is it that you don't even ask?

402
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,160
Are you not curious why it is that I remember every single thing

403
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,000
about you, down to that instance three years ago?

404
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,920
Choi Da-in, I??

405
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,840
I'mma go.

406
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,240
(About the works/ From Cha Si-an's Collection)

407
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,240
I'm not going to apologize.

408
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,120
Because I wasn't lying.

409
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,000
"Ryan wants to end your fake relationship."

410
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,240
"Because??

411
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,000
he wants it to be real."

412
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,960
Half-truths also count as lies, Ms. Choi.

413
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,200
I guess you trusted my words

414
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,800
more than you trusted Ryan's feelings.

415
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,320
- Sun-joo. - Yeah?

416
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,960
If you had to, who would you pick between me and Lion?

417
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,480
What's gotten into you?

418
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,840
Are you turning into Ju Hyuk?

419
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,040
Eun-ki, I don't break cups anymore.

420
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,640
Oh, such an achievement.

421
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,160
Step out. I'll clean it up.

422
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,160
I've been having dizzy spells lately.

423
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,120
Step out.

424
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,800
Gosh, what if you hadn't been born the daughter of building owners?

425
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,080
Welcome.

426
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,120
I'd like to order.

427
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,920
Yes, welcome.

428
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,600
Mr. Pathetic?

429
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,000
Who are you calling pathetic?

430
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,320
Because of you??

431
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,080
Do you know what shame you've put me through?

432
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,000
What did I do?

433
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,600
You told me Ryan and Ms. Sung weren't really dating!

434
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,040
And?

435
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,400
Oh, so you haven't heard.

436
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,600
Nam Eun-ki!

437
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,600
Gun-woo??Gun-woo needs to go to judo soon.

438
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,720
You're quite the punctual mother today, eh?

439
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,760
I'm a director, too, not a "Mr. Pathetic".

440
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,040
When you're all twisted, working out is the way to go.

441
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,160
Kang Gun-woo, let's go to the gym.

442
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,320
Soy, yes soy!

443
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,600
Come here.

444
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,920
Are you ready to order?

445
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,320
I'll have an americano.

446
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,680
But??Who are you?

447
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,840
Sorry?

448
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,160
Gun-woo! Attention!

449
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,240
Like a man, now.

450
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,800
March forward!

451
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,240
One, two!

452
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,440
One, two, three!

453
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,160
Sir, what's that?

454
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,480
That?

455
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,920
That's my uniform.

456
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,080
That's not your uniform.

457
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,840
That's a suit.

458
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,160
That is my uniform for today.

459
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,360
I have a really important match today.

460
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,600
Let's go!

461
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,520
(Competent AND pretty? AnnoyingAnnoyingAnnoying)

462
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,720
I??I'm sorry.

463
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,720
That woman just now??She's Si-an's visual director?

464
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,440
Oh, you mean Ms. Choi Da-in?

465
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,120
Yes, she'll be directing Mr. Cha Si-an's album

466
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,040
and his exhibition, too.

467
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,400
Ugh, so annoying.

468
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,000
Why? Does that bother you?

469
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,480
Of course it bothers me. How could it not?

470
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,160
Some pretty girl is together with my oppa.

471
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,440
She's already competent. Why does she have to be pretty, too?

472
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,040
If I could, I'd tear them apart!

473
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,600
Tear whom apart?

474
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,120
- Choi??- Choi Da-in!

475
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,200
Director Gold, are you clocking out?

476
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,160
Uh??Am I the only one clocking out?

477
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,800
Cu. Yoo.

478
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,680
Mr. Yoo-sub, Miss Hyo-jin.

479
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,800
Is there anything else that must get done today?

480
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,440
Mr. Ahn's works??

481
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,240
Insurance??

482
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,560
I'm of the belief that if it can wait until tomorrow,

483
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,760
it shan't be done today.

484
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,880
Then shall we all head out?

485
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,160
Thank you for all your work today.

486
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,960
Thank you everyone.

487
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,800
What is it? Am I that pretty?

488
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,080
I was thinking about what to feed you today.

489
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,320
Hmm??But I'm not so hungry.

490
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,280
- No way. - I mean it!

491
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,160
We're going for a drive today.

492
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,120
Okay. Where are we going?

493
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,760
Let's take my car. Follow me.

494
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,840
(Seoul City Tour Bus)

495
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,560
Wow, your car's big and nice.

496
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,680
It's a convertible of sorts. Hop on!

497
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,560
Here you are.

498
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,280
- It's alright. - Why?

499
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,160
Do you know how hard it is to write scripts for something like this?

500
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,680
You have to be considerate and listen.

501
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,920
Yup, still don't want to listen.

502
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,400
Why not?

503
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,880
When I think about it,

504
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,000
here I have a local right next to me,

505
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
who grew up here and knows all about this city.

506
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,880
So why should I listen to something like this?

507
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,080
You be my guide instead.

508
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,080
Me?

509
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,800
Fine, alright.

510
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,480
What's that?

511
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,480
A building?

512
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,520
Sung Duk-mi's "Guide to Seoul at Night" part 2.

513
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,560
What about part 1?

514
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,640
You've already experienced it. "Sung Duk-mi's Penthouse".

515
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,640
Oh.

516
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,040
I've been wanting to show you the city sights of Seoul at night,

517
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,360
but as you know, I don't have a driver's license.

518
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,160
I love the night view. It's beautiful.

519
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,480
Right?

520
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,200
And the woman next to me doesn't have a license.

521
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,840
Why don't you have one?

522
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,040
I'm scared.

523
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,080
Scared?

524
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,720
You sure it's not because you gave up after failing several times?

525
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,480
Did you want me to take you for a  drive?

526
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,160
Then I'll go and register myself for the test.

527
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,080
No?

528
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,160
I'll do the driving.

529
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,880
It's hot.

530
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,200
Aren't you going home, Ms. Lee?

531
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,760
Oh, I used my Mom lifeline.

532
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,040
She said she'd look after Gun-woo today,

533
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,920
so I'm going to hang around here for a bit.

534
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,240
Let's do this!

535
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,320
Sure, let's??

536
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,120
(Cha Si-an's fan club)

537
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,080
(The Road to Si-an)

538
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,400
Today's the day they're airing the show!

539
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,640
Ah, interview!

540
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,160
Yeah, K the Pursuer!

541
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,600
But the title's??

542
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,080
Hey, hold on.

543
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,920
"Fangirls: Their Distorted Love"?

544
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,040
Hey, that wasn't the title.

545
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,320
I'm sure it was "21st-Century Super Fangirls"

546
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,000
The title alone shows that it's dissing fangirls.

547
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,800
What's the name of the producer again?

548
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,160
It was Kang, and something Min.

549
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,320
You remember his face, right?

550
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,920
I remember, 100%.

551
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,840
Hey, I think we were fooled big-time.

552
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,520
- We were. - We've been duped?

553
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,520
- Of course we have. - That bastard lied to us!

554
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,880
What is this?

555
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,520
What's the show about?

556
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:58,080
We're interviewing people who are living their lives passionately.

557
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,560
I thought you had a story to cover.

558
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,160
Well, the interview place is around here.

559
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,320
(Copying files)

560
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,080
Duk-mi, are you okay now?

561
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,840
I heard you were attacked by Cha Si-an's fans.

562
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,880
(Gun-woo's Mother)

563
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,120
Oppa.

564
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,320
Honey.

565
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,080
Where are you right now?

566
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,000
Sun-joo.

567
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,160
Let's just think of Gun-woo, alright?

568
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,040
Wherever you are,

569
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,160
a river will soon flow before you.

570
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,160
A river?

571
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,760
That's the river you'll be crossing soon.

572
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,200
But I don't want to cross any rivers.

573
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,200
Kang Seung-min.

574
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,640
Get your ass over here, right now.

575
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,800
Right now!

576
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,360
Sun-joo, please calm down and listen to me.

577
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,320
They promised they'd send me to the variety department,

578
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,920
so I only did it because I truly had no other choice!

579
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,200
You were hoping for me to transfer to variety, too.

580
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,760
I told you to do variety shows.

581
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,720
Did I say to sell out your wife?

582
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,800
Sell you out? Me?

583
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,520
- Ju Hyuk! - Yes.

584
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,560
Lock the doors.

585
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,200
- Sun-joo??- Ms. Lee!

586
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,240
Today,

587
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,560
I become a widow.

588
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,880
Come here!

589
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,160
Sun-joo!

590
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,760
- Somebody save me! - Move!

591
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,200
Die!

592
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,000
Die!

593
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,080
Sun-joo! I'm sorry!

594
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,040
I guess the wind really got you.

595
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,280
Here, an eyelash.

596
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,920
Here.

597
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,320
To the left a bit more. Towards the end.

598
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,640
- Here? - Yes.

599
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,360
Oh, here. Let me take it off.

600
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,640
Don't!

601
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,360
Hey!

602
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,040
Alright, I'll stop.

603
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,000
Let's go on a ferry next time.

604
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,000
I like that idea.

605
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,240
Let's ride everything and anything that can be ridden in Seoul.

606
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,080
One moment.

607
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,040
Duk-mi, are you done? When are you coming home?

608
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Who is it?

609
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,320
Eun-ki. He asked if I was done with work.

610
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,520
You must be really close with Director Nam Eun-ki.

611
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,760
Are we close?

612
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,080
Why are you laughing?

613
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,280
I've never even thought about whether we're close or not.

614
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,440
You're that close?

615
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,760
You remember Editor Nam who interviewed you, right?

616
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,320
She's Eun-ki's mother.

617
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,520
She met my mother at the gynecologist's,

618
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,360
and in light of her circumstances

619
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:46,200
my mother raised both Eun-ki and me, like twins.

620
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,480
So he's practically family, Eun-ki.

621
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,320
Do you think Director Nam Eun-ki thinks the same?

622
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,480
Director Nam may think otherwise.

623
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,040
He might see you as a woman.

624
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,120
Well, we actually heard that a lot back when we were students.

625
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,360
It was just our luck that we were at a co-ed school.

626
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,560
You have no idea how much we fought whenever that happened.

627
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,040
So yeah, we're siblings.

628
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,000
Or should I say brothers?

629
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,040
Or sisters? Something like that.

630
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,000
Things may be different from when you were little.

631
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,440
Some people realize their feelings later.

632
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,040
Director.

633
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,320
Are you suspicious of our...?

634
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,800
It's not that I'm suspicious.

635
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,120
I'm just saying that since you're always together,

636
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,560
it's possible that there's something you don't know.

637
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,520
What about you, Director?

638
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,360
Ms. Choi. You're very close with her.

639
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,240
Choi Da-in is??

640
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,120
Rather than say I'm close to her,

641
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,680
I'd say I like her.

642
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:09,840
What?

643
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:14,600
I like her work and her talent as an artist.

644
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,720
And Da-in trusts me as a director and as an artist.

645
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,320
Do you think Ms. Choi feels the same?

646
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,040
Because it may not be the case.

647
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,080
Duk-mi.

648
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,760
As you know,

649
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,760
winning gold at the Olympics was my life's goal.

650
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,920
But now, my goal is??

651
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,240
you, Sung Duk-mi.

652
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,320
I want to buy you tasty meals,

653
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,080
make you smile, make you happy,

654
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:20,280
protect you, and accompany you everywhere.

655
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,880
Though I retired with a silver medal instead of gold,

656
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,160
I won't retire from the tournament of trying to win you over.

657
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,160
I like you, Sung Duk-mi.

658
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,560
You can do it, Nam Eun-ki!

659
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,080
Drive safely.

660
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,080
Director.

661
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:09,000
You know I don't like letting go of hands.

662
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,120
Do you want to just invite me in?

663
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,080
Or maybe just my hand?

664
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,280
Just your hand, like this?

665
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,920
Director, aren't you a bit peppy for someone who's saying

666
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,600
something so horrific?

667
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,400
Go in.

668
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Bye.

669
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,720
Curator Sung!

670
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,040
Huh?

671
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,080
What??

672
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,400
Stay still.

673
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,400
What is this?

674
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,520
I wanted to give this to you the day I confessed my feelings.

675
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,880
But you rejected me.

676
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:15,080
Did I ever tell you how upset I was because of that?

677
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,200
About that??I didn't reject you.

678
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,000
You know already.

679
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,600
Beautiful.

680
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,960
(May 9th, 2019 First Date with Lion)

681
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,280
Duk-mi.

682
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,800
Sung Duk-mi!

683
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,760
That's right??Eun-ki!

684
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,760
I like you.

685
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,520
I like you, Sung Duk-mi.

686
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,560
I??

687
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,560
I'm sorry.

688
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,960
I read your text, but ignored it.

689
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,600
Here are some things I've prepared for you.

690
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,280
Please take as much as you please.

691
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,280
Here.

692
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,160
Are you mad?

693
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,960
Then what's that face for? Huh?

694
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,120
Smile. Come on, smile! Hurry up.

695
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,520
I'm not mad.

696
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:34,720
Right?

697
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,440
So??Why the suit?

698
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,280
- Duk-mi. - Yeah?

699
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,600
When we were born??

700
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,480
If my mom hadn't tried to run away from the hospital

701
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,320
after giving birth to me??

702
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,960
You knew about that? How long have you known?

703
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,800
Since the day I became a national rep.

704
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,560
Ed. Nam got drunk and blabbed.

705
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,080
I thought she only did that around me??

706
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:05,040
But I'm sure she never meant to do that.

707
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,320
I mean, otherwise Mom wouldn't have caught her.

708
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,160
If she were serious about running away,

709
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,280
she wouldn't have trusted a mere stranger.

710
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,400
I'm sure she was scared and very much afraid.

711
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,320
I understand. She was younger than we are now.

712
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,360
Ed. Nam tells me often??

713
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,640
To be good.

714
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,080
To be good to your mom and dad,

715
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,200
and to you.

716
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,360
Because you're my family.

717
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,440
Of course! We're totally family!

718
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,160
- But Duk-mi. - Yeah?

719
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,520
I??

720
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,400
You know, I??

721
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,600
I don't want to be fam??

722
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,600
Lee Sun-joo.

723
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:53,920
Lee Sun-joo?

724
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,280
Why are you here at this hour?

725
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,760
Something's up, huh?

726
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,960
- Duk-mi. - Yeah?

727
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,160
- I'm going back. - Back where?

728
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,520
To being single.

729
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,440
(Ex-husband)

730
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,360
Ex-husband??

731
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,920
Sun-joo, that show would've been made anyhow.

732
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,840
Maybe it was better that your husband was the one??

733
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,360
I didn't say anything.

734
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,360
Drink up.

735
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,080
- Duk-mi. - Yeah?

736
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,920
Don't you ever get married.

737
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:59,200
Actually, no. Don't even get into a relationship!

738
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,520
Just stay single.

739
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:04,000
You're really no help. No help at all, you know that?

740
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,360
That bastard??

741
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,720
(Producer)

742
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,920
If it's Kang Seung-min, don't pick up.

743
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,240
Still, I'm sure he's worried about you. Let me just say??

744
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,960
If you pick up, I'll kill myself.

745
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,960
I'll kill myself!

746
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,520
Damnit, I'm just going to go.

747
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,200
Whoa, just stay here. Stay here, stay here!

748
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,200
Hey.

749
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,080
Don't pick up. Don't pick up, alright? Don't!

750
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,040
Don't pick up, all of you! Damnit.

751
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,840
That Kang Seung-min is no good! I really expected more of him.

752
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,080
Let him worry about Sun-joo all night, alright?

753
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,080
Damnit.

754
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,040
Happy?

755
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,120
Sun-joo, let's drink 'til we die!

756
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,360
- I'm upset today, too. - Let's just all die.

757
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,040
Let's all die. Die! Alright?

758
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,440
Interfering wench.

759
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,480
Ugh, it's bothering me.

760
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,640
(Curator Sung)

761
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,000
Your call cannot be connected.

762
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,200
Please leave a message after the tone. You may be??

763
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,320
Why?

764
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,160
Why?

765
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,120
Seven o'clock.

766
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,840
Just the right time to go see your girlfriend.

767
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:14,720
Mister!

768
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,000
Where to, today?

769
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
- To Sangam-dong. - Come on, go a bit later.

770
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,560
You should get some rest on your day off.

771
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,800
Mister, have you forgotten already?

772
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,920
My main job is fangirling!

773
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:26,880
Here.

774
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,160
I'm off, then.

775
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,640
Oh my! Director Eom.

776
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,240
You!!

777
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:02,520
Mother??

778
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,000
Sung Duk-mi, where are you going?

779
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,520
Hey, how could you let yourself get plastered, too?

780
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,800
Ugh??It'd been a while since I drank??

781
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,000
So where are you off to?

782
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,040
Me?

783
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,880
To take some shots of Si-an on his way to work.

784
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:39,920
You're truly amazing. Amazing.

785
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,480
Is fangirling more important than breakfast?

786
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,200
I'm having it now.

787
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,280
Will this do?

788
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,720
Your camera's heavy.

789
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,400
This is enough to fill me up.

790
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,840
Hey, wake Sun-joo up and take her home.

791
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:56,840
I'm off.

792
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,480
Wait up.

793
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,240
You still want to fangirl after seeing what happened to Sun-joo?

794
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,720
At a time like this, I need to stay proud of being a fangirl

795
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,720
so that Sun-joo will forgive her husband.

796
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,360
That's very logical.

797
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,000
You must've solved a few math problems back in the day.

798
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,560
Don't you remember? I did all of yours, too.

799
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,840
True.

800
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:44,840
Let's go.

801
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,040
Hey.

802
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:14,960
Oh yeah, what was bothering you yester??

803
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,520
- What is it? - Lion.

804
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:35,600
Ms. Sung Duk-mi.

805
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,000
Director Ryan,

806
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,600
you came to see her without having made plans?

807
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,600
Today??

808
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,080
Come back another time.

809
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,040
I'd like to talk to Ms. Sung Duk-mi, not you.

810
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,320
Duk-mi??

811
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,080
hasn't washed her face,

812
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:21,000
so I don't think you'll get to see it today.

813
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,720
Have I not stated that I'd like to speak with Duk-mi?

814
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,320
Has Duk-mi not stated that she doesn't want to see you?

815
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,720
Duk-mi??

816
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,040
is my girlfriend.

817
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,160
So this is our business,

818
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:59,880
and not something you should mind.

819
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,760
Why isn't it something I should mind?

820
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:08,720
It concerns the woman I like.

821
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:20,000
Duk-mi doesn't want to show her face like this.

822
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:23,040
To you, Director Ryan.

823
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,160
So if you really care for her,

824
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,120
please leave for today.

825
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,880
Come out, Ms. Sung Duk-mi.

826
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,160
It's alright,

827
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:11,920
Ms. T.R.T.S.

828
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:10,040
(Her Private Life)

829
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:13,120
You want to duke this out, but you're bringing me to your house?

830
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,600
What, so you get home-field advantage? That's cheating.

831
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,480
Brother? Curator Sung?

832
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,800
Why didn't you tell me?

833
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,240
Because Duk-mi doesn't know about your feelings.

834
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:23,320
Did Mr. Nam stay over at your place last night?

835
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:26,760
- Eun-ki's??- He likes you, Sung Duk-mi.

836
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:29,080
Right now, you're not a friend nor family to me.

837
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:32,000
You're a woman. If you need more time, I can wait.

838
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,440
Teach me, too.

839
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,440
I want to try being your fanboy, too.
