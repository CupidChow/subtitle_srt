00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,560
What's a Saturday to high school seniors?

4
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,800
A day for studying until we puke.

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,880
Correct. On that note, I'd like you to go home right now

6
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,840
and give your all to your studies.

7
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,600
Gosh, our Eun-ki's sound asleep, isn't he?

8
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,240
Did you guys even feed him anything?

9
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,760
We fed him cup ramen.

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,120
Good.

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,760
Well, wake him up and tell him I want to see him.

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,160
Alright, Class President.

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,040
Attention!

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,880
Bow to the teacher.

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,320
- Thank you. - Thank you.

16
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,200
Hey!

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,080
Hey!

18
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,800
Wake up, class is over.

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,000
Teach wants to see you.

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,120
Ugh, it's raining and I don't even have an umbrella.

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,680
Who's that from? Do you have a secret admirer?

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,680
Lucky bastard.

23
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,960
Ugh, don't touch me.

24
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,160
No umbrella?

25
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,040
Let go of me.

26
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,000
How can a senior be so unprepared with exams around the corner?

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,200
What if you catch a cold?

28
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,320
Let go of me while I'm still asking nicely!

29
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,680
What are you going to do once you stop asking nicely, huh?

30
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,520
Oh?

31
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,600
Give me that.

32
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,840
- Your hand. - God, you're annoying.

33
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,000
Politely, now.

34
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,200
Now cutely.

35
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,800
Come home straight after practice ends

36
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,680
so Mom doesn't have to set the table twice.

37
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,440
Hey, pull your opponent closer to you!

38
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,480
Hey! Who are you?

39
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,080
Sung Duk.

40
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,720
Why are you all drenched?

41
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,280
What happened to the umbrella I gave you?

42
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,040
Fess up.

43
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,280
That umbrella you lent me??Was it a gift from someone?

44
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,480
Yeah.

45
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,200
Are you nuts? Are you out of your mind?

46
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,040
How can you lend something that someone gave to you?

47
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,960
You heartless bastard!

48
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,400
What's wrong with that?

49
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,280
It was a gift, so it's mine and I lent it to you.

50
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,280
Is that so wrong?

51
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,800
You've never liked anyone, have you?

52
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,520
Those Valentine's Day chocolates you devour without much thought,

53
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,080
those are someone's feelings.

54
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,800
Those gifts that you receive all the time,

55
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,080
they're all expressions of someone's sincerity.

56
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,080
Because they like you,

57
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,520
they want to give you tasty food and give you nice clothes.

58
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,560
And out of concern that you might get wet from the rain

59
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,200
or be blown away by the wind,

60
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,160
they mustered up the courage to confess their feelings.

61
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,000
Yet you?? You take that gift that means so much

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,520
and lend it? To a stranger?

63
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,000
Are you and I strangers?

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,280
Besides, I never asked them to like me.

65
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,000
They gave it to me, so it's mine. So dramatic...

66
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,040
You bastard??

67
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,360
Wait??Duk-mi!

68
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,840
You inconsiderate, immoral bastard!

69
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,440
We can't allow jerks like you to live in our society!

70
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,920
You deserve to die, Eun-ki!

71
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,600
Die, die, die!

72
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
You don't deserve to live!

73
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,200
Hey, don't grab me!

74
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,200
You bastard??

75
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,280
- Duk-mi??- Die, die!

76
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,200
Die, you bastard! Die! Die!

but you never know what life will bring you.

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,040
I mean, just yesterday I was crying over being fired,

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,600
but today my dream's about to come true.

84
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,680
So Sun-joo, let's live long, long lives.

85
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,080
Uh??You're going like that?

86
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,080
What did I just do?

87
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,120
Old habits die hard.

88
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,640
Duk-mi,

89
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,320
you're not going there as a fan.

90
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,280
You're going there to work.

91
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,480
That grand moment where your fan life and work life

92
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,480
merge is right before you.

Deok-eop-il-chi.

94
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,760
Right.

95
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,680
Sun-joo, can you pick out something for me to wear, then?

96
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,080
Let's see??The lucky watch that'll get to meet Si-an today is??

97
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,520
You.

98
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,880
Pretty.

99
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,440
Duk-mi,

100
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,760
I know I shouldn't be asking you this, but??

101
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,240
Can you keep me on the line when you meet Si-an?

102
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,160
I promise I won't even breathe. Just let me hear his voice!

103
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,080
Duk-mi...

104
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,280
Sun-joo, I really have to get going.

105
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,080
Talk to you later.

106
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,360
Duk-mi!

107
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,600
I'm so jealous.

108
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,400
I want to see Si-an

109
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,800
and get his autograph and take pictures with him, too??

110
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,160
Was that your way of telling me to snap out of it?

111
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,160
Take it out of my pay.

112
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,000
Ju Hyuk.

113
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,080
There's nothing more I can take out from your pay.

114
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,560
But I'm not going to fire you.

115
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,920
I'll make a human out of you, and get my money's worth.

116
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,920
I'm so jealous. So jealous??

117
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,040
I want to go, too!

118
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,120
Oh.

119
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,040
It's the jacket that Sindy got for Si-an.

120
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,040
Are they going for a couple look?

121
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,840
Are you all better now?

122
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,160
As you can see, yes.

123
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,200
I wasn't sick enough to deserve a gift for being discharged,

124
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,160
but since you got these, I'll gladly??

125
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,720
I heard Mr. Cha Si-an likes tulips, so??

126
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,080
Do you want them, too?

127
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,680
Oh, no. Not at all.

128
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,120
I brought some wine as a gift, too.

129
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,200
It's red wine.

130
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,040
But Si-an prefers white.

131
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,000
"Si-an?"

132
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,040
Oh, I mean Mr. Cha Si-an.

133
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,280
You know his preferences very well, don't you?

134
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,160
I'm the type to check my clients' personal profiles

135
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,320
and preferences before meeting them.

136
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,720
Before every meeting.

137
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,800

139
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,480
Yes?

140
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,000
It's nothing.

141
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,880
Come on, what is it?

142
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,240
Do you hate Mr. Cha Si-an that much?

143
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,080
Pardon?

144
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,640
You're free to like or dislike him personally,

145
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,480
but he's a potential client.

146
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,760
I think you need to work on your poker face.

147
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,760
Oh!

148
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,200
Sure.

149
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,120
You're early.

150
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,160
Si-an's not ready yet,

151
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,880
so why don't you come wait inside?

00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,040

Kong! I can't believe I'm seeing you for real!

155

Oh my God.

156
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,480
Do I really deserve all this?

157
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,080
Si-an??

158
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,520
Thank you so much, and I'm so sorry!

159
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,720
I could just die right now without any regrets.

So this is the so-called case of "fangirl death by heart thumping".

169
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,240
- Report this to the medical board. - Yes.

170
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,440
This life??

171
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,080
is a good one.

172
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,240
I get peace of mind just by looking at it.

173
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,480
This one's my favorite piece, to be honest.

174
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,440
The stars, the moon, the forest??

175
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,120
There's so much meaning in this piece.

176
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,760
I can tell already that you truly love art.

177
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,080
Cute.

178
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,520
So cute!

179
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,560
So cute! So cute!

180
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,760
If you look at these works here,

181
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,200
they're very realistic yet surreal.

182
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,800
You do have an eye for art, as the rumors say.

183
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,680
My first fan took this shot.

184
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,080
I was on my way to my first TV appearance.

185
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,600
Can you see how I'm all tense?

186
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,440
"The Road to Si-an??

187
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,080
I think T.R.T.S. is the person who knows me best,

188
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,040
though I don't even know who she is.

189
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,920
Isn't that strange?

190
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,440
Um, I'll make a quick run to the bathroom.

191
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,680
Sure. You can use the one right over there.

192
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,720
I've lived my life well.

193
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,160
I've really??

194
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,520
lived my life well.

195
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,960
You're so lucky.

196
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,040
You get to see Si-an every day.

197
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,520
You're so lucky, too.

198
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,040
Every day, you get to see Si-an...

199
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,120
What am I saying?

200
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,560
I really must be out of my mind.

201
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,120
Gosh!

202
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,800
Would you like some coffee? Or tea?

203
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,080
Tea would be great.

204
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,000
Alright.

205
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,400
Curator Sung Duk-mi?

206
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,280
Yes?

207
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,720
I accidently turned on the shower??

208
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,880
Wear this.

209
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,040
Thank you.

210
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,320
But??How??

211
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,000
Thank you.

212
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,160
Thank you.

213
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,080
Thank you.

214
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,360
But you know, I do feel a bit pressured by the title

215
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,160
"Cha Si-an's Collection" because it means

216
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,160
I'm not just another participant in the exhibition.

217
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,280
I feel like my collection needs to be a bit more impressive.

218
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,120
- Well, that's??- Of course, many will try to

219
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,040
judge your eye for art through this collection.

220
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,400
But won't this be more of an opportunity

221
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,760
for more people to get to know you

222
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,840
by learning your tastes and preferences?

223
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,200
If I'm to add two cents,

224
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,440
I think you have no reason to be shy about your eye for art.

225
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,040
That painting you said is your favorite work??

226
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,960
I also think very highly of it.

227
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,280
Director Gold is fond of Lee Sol's works, too.

228
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,680
He's even purchased one of Lee's works himself.

229
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,400
Do you know Lee Sol?

230
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,800
No.

231
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,480
I purchased it at the behest of a client.

232
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,160
I thought it was a great piece,

233
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,280
and found out that you happen to have Lee's works, too.

234
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,760
So it's a coincidence.

235
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,680
Yes.

236
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,040
It's a coincidence.

237
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,040
We'll see you again, then.

238
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,440
I'm sorry, I guess I brought up something I shouldn't have.

239
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,680
He wasn't enthusiastic about the exhibition to begin with.

240
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,120
But we'll have to convince him. Somehow.

241
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,680
I called a taxi for myself.

242
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,040
You rode your car here, right?

243
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,000
No, I rode the elevator here.

244
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,880
You mean you live here, in this building, too?

245
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,040
Unit 2401.

246
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,520
Unit 2401??

247
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,680
That's right above Mr. Cha Si-an's place!

248
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,480
Yes.

249
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,560
Must be nice.

250
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,040
I want to live in the same building as Si-an, too.

251
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,960
I'll get going, then.

252
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,040
Oh, the jacket.

253
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,600
Later. Give it back to me later.

254
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,600
I'll return it tomorrow, then.

255
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,720
Hey, Sun-joo. What's up?

256
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,840
Listen,

257
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,360
one of the photos I took for Si-an is hanging on his wall!

258
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,000
He's a total superstar, huh? A superstar.

259
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,400
I think T.R.T.S. is the person who knows me best.

(Favorite Artist: Lee Sol)

262
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,360
As soon as I opened the door and stepped in,

263
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,920
Kong came running toward me!

264
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,880
- Kong! Kong! - Kong was so cute.

265
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,040
Anyway, there was a ray of blinding light from over there,

266
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,200
so I turned around.

267
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,680
And voila! There was Si-an, walking toward me!

268
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,000
- In a bath robe! - Oh my God.

269
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,360
His hair was all wet, and still dripping??

270
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,160
He looked at me so sexily, while making that

271
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,320
expression he only makes when he's all shy. You know it, right?

272
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,560
Yes, of course!

273
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,600
Then he was like, "Hello."

274
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,320
I saw all that with my own eyes!

275
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,240
Oppa, isn't that crazy? Isn't it?

276
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,280
Yup, you're crazy. Really crazy.

277

I was attacked. In the form of sleep deprivation.

Gosh, I'm so tired.

No, no, no!

294

When would he find the time to date?

295

There's just no way.

Nope. There's no way!

When you're exhausted, you get lonely.

302
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,840
I guess he wanted to date, too.

just to see him doing this kind of stuff?"

I can't take this anymore.

331
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,440
And I just happened to have my photo taken

332
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,400
at his house, wearing this jacket??

333
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,040
The perfect setup for a misunderstanding.

334
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,160
What do I do?

335
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,560
Jeez, I can't even upload pictures anymore

336
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,200
because of how scary your fans are.

337
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,120
Why do they have to zoom in and check every detail?

338
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,120
Ugh, why did that woman have to be there, anyway?

339
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,920
This is all because of that exhibition.

340
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,680
I told you, from day one, that I didn't want to do it.

341
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,640
Si-an.

342
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,000
What are you going to do about the scandal?

343
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,480
Don't worry.

344
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,080
We'll tell the press that she was here to discuss the exhibition.

345
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,520
But that means the exhibition is a go, alright?

346
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,920
You're sayinig that this is Curator Sung?

347
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,480
I thought all celebrity gossip was true,

348
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,840
but some really is utter nonsense.

349
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,160
White Ocean's the biggest thing these days,

350
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,680
and not only that, it's Cha Si-an, the most popular member??

351
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,160
I would welcome that kind of misunderstanding??

352
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,680
"Bullshit."

353
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,920
"There's no way Si-an would do this to us."

354
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,320
"I knew Si-an would backstab his fans someday."

355
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,400
"I can just hear the fandom shrinking."

356
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,080
There are over a thousand comments on this article.

357
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,160
A thousand?

358
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,120
"Repulsed without even looking at her face."

359
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,720
Repulsed without even looking?

360
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,560
Sounds like a 4-character idiom.

361
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,960
"You better watch yourself at night."

362
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,720
"I will find you. And I will??

363
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,680
will you?"

364
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,720
Yes, it's more than possible.

365
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,120
White Ocean's fans have quite the reputation,

366
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,960
for being die-hard and hardcore.

367
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,760
At this rate, won't they track you down?

368
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,120
But all fans are like that, there's no need

369
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,000
to go as far as calling them die-hard and hardcore.

370
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,560
Curator Sung! You really know nothing.

371
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,200
Fangirls these days are truly frightening!

372
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,000
What did Cha Si-an's agency say?

373
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,920
They said that since they'll publish an article soon,

374
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,520
I can just wait and not worry.

375
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,760
Did you tell your boyfriend?

376
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,800
Boyfriend?

377
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,280
I have a boyfriend?

378
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,200
Hey, you confessed to having one when you were drunk last time.

379
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,520
What was it that you said?

380
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,000
Oh, you said he has a beautiful smile,

381
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,560
and that he's really talented.

382
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,400
Oh.

383
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,120
You remember, right?

384
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,560
He's not my boyfriend.

385
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,120
Whether he's your boyfriend or just a crush,

386
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,040
put his photo up on social media for all to see.

387
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,720
That way, even if fans do track you down,

388
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,120
you've explained yourself that you're not Si-an's girlfriend,

389
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,560
- and that you have a boyfriend. - Yes, yes!

390
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,480
But that's??

391
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,320
You have a photo with him, right?

392
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,320
Let me pick one out for you.

393
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,880
- I can do it! - You can do it!

394

It won't happen again.

401

How is this a chitchat?

402

This concerns the safety of an employee.

403
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,000
Mr. Gold is the type not to care much, I guess.

404

How can you say that about your boss?

405
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,080
I say he doesn't care one bit.

406
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,600
Are you sure he's seeing someone?

407
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,720
I think so. He must have a girlfriend.

408
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,320
There's no way he would date someone when he has us!

409
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,720
Please tell me it's a lie.

410

Please tell us!

411
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,160
Hey, he's denied it!

412
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,480
His agency's just published a statement.

413
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,760
So it's just a rumor, right?

414
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,160
- They always deny it. - Right?

415
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,080

visited Mr. Cha Si-an's place to discuss a potential exhibition.

421

Mr. Cha Si-an's jacket for the duration of the visit

427
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,640
this is Ryan Gold of Cheum Museum of Art.

428
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,880
I noticed an error in the article.

429
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,120
Why say the jacket was Mr. Cha Si-an's?

430
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,080
There are only a few in existence, and what,

431
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,360
it just so happened that two of them were here?

432
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,160
Do you think the fans would buy that?

433
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,400
So you're saying we should just deceive them?

434
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,760
Director Gold.

435
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,000
It's not facts nor the truth that people believe.

436
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,640
They see what they want to see and believe what they want to believe.

437
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,160
In this kind of a situation,

438
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,360
a convincing lie is better than the implausible truth, no?

439
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,800
We extinguished the rumors

440
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,720
and you now get to hold the exhibition.

441
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,520
Isn't it all good, then?

442
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,000

00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,320
Are you there, Miss Cha Si-an's girlfriend?

492
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,120
Knock, knock.

493
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,640
Miss Cha Si-an's girlfriend?

494
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,240
Knock, knock.

495
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,200
(Sung Duk has left the chatroom)

496
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,320
Do you think this is funny? Do you?

497
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,080
How can you laugh about this situation?

498
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,440
Then should I cry about it?

499
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,120
Hey, my friend's caught up in a dating scandal with

500
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,680
her favorite celebrity.

501
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,920
I should be dancing.

502
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,800
You'll be stabbed while you're dancing, then.

503
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,320
Does it not occur to you that the other fans are dying right now

504
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,840
because they believe the rumors to be true?

505
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,600
What's the issue? Your oppa can date.

506
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,200
Sure, he can date.

507
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,600
But he shouldn't get caught.

508
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,040
What's the difference?

509
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,000
In other words, he's someone at whom we can look but not touch.

510
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,200
He can't become touchable to anyone.

511
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,280
What kind of bullshit is that??

512
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,000
Strictly speaking, the relationship between

513
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,320
an idol and his fans is like that of a seller and consumers.

514
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,160
"I love my fans. They're all I have."

515
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,000
Getting our hopes up with sweet words like that??

516
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Why, they're practically selling virtual romance.

517
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,200
So what happens if they're caught dating someone?

518
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,800
This is a matter of morals and principles!

519
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,880
You're the one who broke those rules, here.

520
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,240
Exactly.

521
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,200
So this is my fault.

522
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,240
Ugh, you fangirls.

523
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,320
Anyway, now what? They raided your social media account.

524
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,320
Those matching items we bought,

525
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,080
and our pilgrimage??

526
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,160
There's just too many photos to wave it off as coincidence.

527
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,800
I know, I was surprised, too.

528
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,880
I tried so hard not to show that I'm his fan in that account,

529
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,040
but who knew there would be so many hints?

530
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,480
If they find out you're his fan,

531
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,880
and that you're T.R.T.S??

532
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,120
- Chills. - Chills.

533
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,960
I'll be dead and gone before you know it.

534
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,200
- Like dewdrops. - Yes.

535
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,040
I'll say my goodbyes now.

536
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,640
May you rest in peace.

537
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,720
No.

538
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,240
No. There's no way??

539
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,440
"Wench?"

540
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,160
Hey, I'm a precious daughter to my parents.

541
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,560
Who are you to call me a wench, huh?

542
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,120
Hey!

543
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,240
I'll see you at the police station.

544
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,840
This is all being recorded. So you??

545
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,200
Hello? Hello? Hello??

546
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,880
Ugh, I'm so pissed off!

547
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,680
Mommy??

548
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,120
I wouldn't be complaining if you were actually dating him.

549
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,720
I'd take all the insults graciously.

550
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:32,040
Curator Sung, you better watch yourself at night.

551
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,160
Not just at night!

552
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,480
I don't think you'll be safe during the day, either.

553
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,600
Our website's an absolute circus.

554
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,160
Sorry, this is all because of me.

555
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,480
There's nothing we can do about the calls,

556
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,200
but let's shut down our forum for now.

557
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,160
Alright.

558
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,560
Mr. Park!

559
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,640
Curator Sung's personal info is being shared on the Internet

560
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,760
and our forum's being bombarded with threats.

561
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,240
You're telling me you're still discussing the matter?

562
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,120
Aren't you taking this matter too lightly?

563
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,640
I'll call you back.

564
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,080
Mr. Cha's agency wants to wait until it dies down

565
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,120
rather than take aggressive measures.

566
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,040
I think that's too complaisant.

567
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,480
What are your thoughts?

568
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,560
People already found out it's a lie,

569
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,400
so nothing will prove effective.

570
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,280
It may be best, after all, to let time take its course.

571
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,520
I should've told them to set things straight,

572
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,720
no matter what, when they first published the article??

573
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,840
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

574
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,040
How is it your fault?

575
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,160
It could've all ended well,

576
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,800
if it weren't for that stalker.

577
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,160
Stalker?

578
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,720
Oh, I don't know much about this myself,

579
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,200
but apparently some extreme fans follow celebrities around.

580
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,040
So rather than fan??"Stalker" would be more fitting.

581
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,840
Anyway, I heard this all became a big issue

582
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,040
because that stalker uploaded my picture online.

583
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,680
Um, I'm set to give a lecture on art auctions

584
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,160
to Sejong Bank's VIP customers.

585
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,320
- Sure, go ahead. - Alright.

586
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,040
(Cheum Museum of Art)

587
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,440
Oh my gosh! Why are you doing this to me?

588
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,200
Ouch, that hurts!

589
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,400
You wench!

590
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,720
You wicked wench!

591
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,640
How dare you, with our oppa!

592
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,280
Please??Why are you doing this to me?

593
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,640
Who are you?

594
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,960
It's me, Duk-mi.

595
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,040
It's me, Eun-ki.

596
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,480
Are they crazy? Damnit.

597
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,400
Eun-ki??

598
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,000
Hey!

599
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,320
Who are you people? Huh?

600
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,360
Hey! Get them!

601
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,480
Stop right there!

602
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,760
Hey!

603
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,600
Over there, over there!

604
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,080
Are you alright?

605
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,160
Let's go.

606
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,080
These expensive eggs??

607
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,680
If they had the money for this,

608
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,320
they should've used it to buy another album.

609
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,160
Yes, I see.

610
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,040
Yes.

611
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,160
All the offenders are at the station right now.

612
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,960
So we meet again on another unpleasant occasion, huh?

613
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,080
Last time, at the hospital.

614
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,200
Oh, I guess you don't remember.

615
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,520
Curator Sung never talks about her friends, so??

616
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,320
Most people take me to be her boyfriend.

617
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,160
I apologize for the belated introduction.

618
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,840
I'm Ryan Gold, Director of Cheum Museum of Art.

619
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,080
Gold. Ryan.

620
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,200
That's right, I'm a "director" myself.

621
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,080
Here.

622
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,640
(Choikang Judo Center)

623
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,600
Oh, you run a judo center.

624
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,840
As for my relationship to Duk-mi??

625
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,000
I'm her brother.

626
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,440
Nice to meet you.

627
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,360
Director.

628
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,000
I'll be on my way to Sejong Bank, then.

629
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,440
Don't push yourself, that must've been a shock.

630
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,120
Go home and get some rest.

631
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,000
I'll go instead.

632
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,760
No, I think It's better to keep myself occupied.

633
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,160
Besides, I need to drop by the police station on my way.

634
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,280
Then I'll come with you.

635
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,320
She'll feel more comfortable going there with me.

636
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,640
I'll go with Eun-ki.

637
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,400
You can go straight home once you're done.

638
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,160
Alright.

639
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,640
Let's go.

640
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,040
There's no more of them. They're all at the station.

641
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:51,280
Also, you're a different person in front of your director.

642
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,280
You were acting all coy.

643
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,880
What, and you're upfront with your coach?

644
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,160
That's different, my coach is scary.

645
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,600
Well, Director Gold fires people.

646
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,080
"You're fired!"

647
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,040
Are you sure you're alright?

648
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,040
No, I'm not. Not at all.

649
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,320
That really hurt, you know.

650
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,800
Let's hit up a pharmacy first. That's going to scar.

651
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,680
No, we have to go to the police station first.

652
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,200
If our bae got wrapped up in a scandal, they should hope for it

653
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,720
to die down quietly, but what? They butt in and make it worse?

654
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,320
I'm going to make sure they cry their eyes out.

655
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,080
Follow me.

656
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,080
Cry their eyes out?

657
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:29,880
What?

658
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,000
Curator Sung's been named in a scandal with an idol.

659
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,160
Curator Sung? With an idol?

660
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,600
Oh, that makes me so mad!

661
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,800
Not only did I resign for Cheum's future,

662
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,120
but I'm stuck here in this hospital, suffering.

663
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,480
How dare they ruin my plans!

664
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,680
Tell me, what are your thoughts?

665
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,000
Well, uh??With this particular situation??

666
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,120
What are your thoughts?

667
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,440
Well, uh??

668
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,480
So this is all because of some idol oppa?

669
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,080
How absurd.

670
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,160
The Assault at Cheum Museum of Art.

671
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,240
Why you little??

672
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,400
Does doing this to someone seem like a joke?

673
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,760
This is assault, you know. Assault!

674
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,680
Do you know how intense the consquences are for assault?

675
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,280
I'm Sung Duk-mi, the victim.

676
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,280
None of you are going home today!

677
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,160
Who's your ringleader?

678
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,880
You were so confident up to a few seconds ago, why so quiet now?

679
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,320
So, who's the ringleader? Are you the ringleader?

680
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,360
Are you?

681
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,120
That lady wore the jacket we bought for our Si-an.

682
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,600
Hey, if you gave a gift, you've given it.

683
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,720
Is that a basis for assaulting someone like this? Hm?

684
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,040
You've never liked anyone, have you?

685
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,800
What we gave him isn't simply an expensive jacket.

686
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,080
Because we like him so much,

687
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,040
we wanted to see him in pretty clothes.

688
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,280
That gift contains our feelings,

689
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,440
yet that lady??Ugh!

690
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,160
Detective.

691
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,960
It's really not a big deal, so let them go.

692
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,040
Hey! Sung Duk-mi!

693
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,320
How's this not a big deal,

694
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,440
when I can't tell if you're a person or a mummy?

695
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,440
Oh, this?

696
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,080
It's just a prank.

697
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,640
See? I'm fine.

698
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,960
If I'm fine, it can't be assault, can it?

699
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,120
- Are you sure you're alright? - Yes.

700
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,800
Hey you. Don't cry.

701
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,440
If you do, I'm not going to forgive you.

702
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,480
But, uh??

703
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,360
Are you really dating Si-an?

704
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,520
What? How can you still??

705
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,920
No, it was my first time meeting Mr. Cha Si-an that day.

706
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,640
Then why did you take his jacket?

707
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,520
Well, that's??

708
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,880
The truth is, that's not Mr. Cha Si-an's jacket.

709
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,160
It's not?

710
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,440
But Sindy said that's the only one in Korea.

711
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,520
Right, which is prrobably why his agency had it wrong, too.

712
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,160
It's really someone else's jacket, though.

713
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,560
Do you mean it?

714
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,280
Then you've got nothing to do with Si-an?

715
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,960
Nothing at all. I swear.

716
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,120
- Thank you! - Thank you!

717
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,200
- We're so sorry! - We're so sorry!

718
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,600
A saint has risen, a saint.

719
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,400
I should call you Saint Duk-mi, not Sung Duk-mi.

720
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,040
I'm angry, too,

721
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,880
and those girls ought to be punished, yes.

722
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,640
Still??

723
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,000
I understand why they did what they did.

724
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,080
Ha??

725
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:42,120
Then why not bestow your mercy upon me as well?

726
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,320
You're still alive thanks to my mercifulness.

727
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:46,880
Right?

728
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:51,040
Hey, you have to keep what happened today a secret from Mom.

729
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,280
Do you take me for an idiot? I can tell the difference between

730
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,000
edible and inedible, speakable and unspeakable.

731
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,120
Good boy.

732
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,080
I'm off, then.

733

Be careful.

735
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,600
Director, you're not going for lunch?

736
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,960
You guys go ahead. I'll eat on my own.

737
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,320
Did Curator Sung go to the station on her own?

738
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,760
You should've sent me with her, at least.

739
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,520
Her brother came and took her.

740
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,960
He called to say it's all been settled, too.

741
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,880
She has a brother?

742
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,600
I heard she's an only child.

743
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,040
- I'm back. - Ah.

744
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,040
Ah, Ed. Nam's here.

745
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,640
What's up?

746
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,600
What am I, your friend?

747

"Ed. Nam?" "What's up?"

748
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,280
Welcome, Editor Nam.

749
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,560
Can't you at least pretend to be glad to see me?

750
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,440
I'm your mother, for God's sake.

755
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,320
Hand it over.

756
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:33,600
Hey, I told you not to feed him even if he comes over.

757
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,160
How long are you going to keep feeding him?

758
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,600
How can I starve my son?

759
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,240
You'll never understand, Ed. Nam,

760
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,040
what it is to feel full just by watching your child eat.

761
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,080
If someone else heard us, they'd think that

762
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,800
she's your biological mother and I'm your stepmother.

763
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:50,040
You got your surname, Nam, from me.

764

You're not Sung Eun-ki!

765
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,040
Let's be honest, Ed. Nam.

766
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,520
Sure, you gave birth to me. But it was Mom who raised me.

767
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,000
Single-handedly!

768
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,080
You don't get any credit.

769
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,760
Mom supported me for 20 years,

770
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,360
then Korea did by making me the national rep.

771
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,120
Hey, I was out earning money. Do you think that's easy?

772
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,640
Yeah, I was only able to clothe and feed you

773
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,160
because she did her part in the outside world.

774
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,640
We raised you together.

775
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:16,680
She raised you with love, and I with money.

776

You wouldn't be human if you hadn't done at least that much.

You'd be a cuckoo bird that abandoned its egg in another nest.

Oh, my Eun-ki. Look how well you eat!

779
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,000
I'm feeling full just watching you eat.

00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:26,920
That's right.

781
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:30,680
I bet no one else pays for a babysitter for their grown-up son.

782
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:31,440
This is for feeding him.

783
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,040
I told you there's no need.

784
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,200
No, no. Take it, I insist.

And I really, really hate that.

So fire her, right now.

802
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,160
As the word "scandal" implies, those were just rumors.

803

I'm not going to fire her for that.

Who cares if it's the truth or not?

What matters is that there's a rumor going around.

When I accepted this position at Cheum,

817
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,960
I did so under just one condition:

818
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,960
that you give up all authority.

819
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:13,040
Don't make decisions or even judgments about

820
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,320
Cheum and its employees.

821
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:23,640
The thing is??I had no choice, because of personal circumstance??

822
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,920
Is one's partner's embezzlement and breach of duty considered

823
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,200
a personal circumstance?

824
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,920
You mentioned dignity and class.

825
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,400
But aren't you the reason Cheum ended up on the

826
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,720
business and economy sections of the newspapers?

827
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,120
It's a bit laughable for you to be acting like this

828
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,320
over some celebrity dating gossip.

829
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,880
Laughable?

830
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,240
Oh, you're mad, aren't you?

831
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,160
You don't want to fire her.

832
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,240
But you'll accept a resignation letter

833
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,720
willingly submitted by an employee, right?

834
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:00,280
There isn't just one way to get rid of people, right?

835
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,640
What, authority?

836
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,320
Well, I thought I should at least make a show of

837
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,720
discussing it with you since I put you in that seat,

838
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,320
so here I am.

839
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,040
But you know what? I'll just take care of it myself.

840
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,000
Bye!

841
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,000
Former Director Eom So-hye.

842
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:19,880
Yes?

843
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:25,200
I'm curious about something.

844
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,120
Sure.

845
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:33,760
Where's that Ivanov piece?

846
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,960
What piece?

847
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:41,640
That piece by Ivanov, that you won at an auction in China.

848
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,640
Where is it?

849
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:46,040
Why haven't I seen any papers regarding it,

850
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,880
and why isn't it in the storage room, either?

851
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,480
I'm not quite sure to what you're referring.

852
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,520
Would you remember if a prosecutor asked you?

853
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,120
The trial's not over yet, right?

854
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:05,720
Did Curator Sung Duk-mi tell you?

855
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,280
No. At the auction house, I coincidentally??

856
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,440
I don't really care.

857
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,520
Secretary Kim!

858
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,240
Secretary Kim!

859
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,640
She's easier than I thought.

860
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,480
Yeah, stay right there.

861
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:02,600
Director, what??

862
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,320
Director.

863
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,640
Cu. Sung,

864
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,480
I really trusted you, you know.

865
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,480
So how could you do this to me?

866
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:33,600
Um, that scandal with that idol is actually??

867
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,040
That's??

868
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,080
That's not what I'm talking about right now.

869
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:43,360
I'll be watching you, Cu. Sung.

870
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,040
Capisce? Get it together.

871
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,120
Curator Sung Duk-mi.

872
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,200
Yes, Director Gold.

873
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,160
I told you to go straight home, didn't I?

874
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,480
Why did you come back?

875
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,000
There was a document I had to send off.

876
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:45,000
But, uh??I don't think this is something to be scolded over.

877
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,000
Go in, then.

878
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:49,880
Alright.

879
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,880
And sleep?

880
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:10,040
Do you still  sleep in a tent at the gym?

881
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:12,760
Sometimes at the gym, and sometimes in Duk-mi's room.

882
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,000
Cause, you know, she got her own place.

883
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:19,160
I'll pay back the money I borrowed by next month,

884
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,560
so go find yourself a place, even if it's just a studio.

885
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:24,600
Don't push yourself. I'm really fine.

886
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,280
Still, you need to have a place to sleep.

887
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,720
Is it terrible of me to start worrying about you now?

888
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:34,760
Not at all.

889
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,240
Seriously, why did you have to open a gym?

890
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,360
Who does that these days?

891
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,800
You should've just been a coach.

892
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,280
Mom, Mom!

893
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,800
Do you have any idea how much I enjoy doing judo?

894
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,080
Should I enjoy it all by myself? Hm?

895
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:49,920
Until the day when everyone takes up judo,

896
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,240
I, Olympic medalist Nam Eun-ki, must spread this sport.

897
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,080
That's what I think, anyway.

898
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,160
Goodness gracious, that tongue of yours!

899
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,160
You should use it to get into sports commentating.

900
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,200
Oh, that's right.

901
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:06,040
I couldn't ask earlier since Duk-mi's mom was there,

902
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,040
but I heard something strange today.

903
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:11,680
That a curator is dating an idol??

904
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,760
and the curator sounded like Duk-mi.

905
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,320
It's just a false rumor. How would Duk-mi??

906
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,920
Even if it's just a rumor,

907
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,040
it's never pleasant having people talk about you like that.

908
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,960
Wait, what's this? What happened?

909
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,160
It's all red.

910
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,320
I must've gotten a bug bite.

911
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,520
Let me see.

912
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,640
Drive safely. It's dark.

913
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:32,120
My, my. You must be worried about your cuckoo-bird mother.

914
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:39,040
Better to have a cuckoo-bird mother than no mother at all.

915
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:43,600
Hurry home.

916
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:44,560
I'll go.

917
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:46,160
- Drive safely. - Alright.

918
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,120
Director! Security Department's??

919
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,080
- Shhh. - Oh.

920
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:41,360
Why are you still here at work?

921
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,080
You must've had a rough day.

922
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,800
It's because I had a rough day.

923
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:49,560
Having had a rough day makes me want to look at art.

924
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,080
Does art console you?

925
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,760
How can I put it??

926
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,360
It's a bizarre consolation.

927
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:06,040
On days like this, I actually want to ask myself this:

928
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:11,240
"You're wearing yourself out both mentally and physically,

929
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:14,040
and it's not like people know or acknowledge your efforts.

930
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,440
Do you still want to do this?"

931
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,440
"Are these works really worth it?"

932
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,000
So, are they?

933
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:29,560
No.

934
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,560
As incredible as we say art is,

935
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,720
could it be more so than living people?

936
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,920
No matter how pathetic I may be,

937
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:45,160
I'm far more superb than those haughty paintings

938
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,760
hanging up on that wall.

939
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:51,040
Because I'm still here, alive and living.

940
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:05,520
Oh, that wasn't exactly appropriate to say in front you.

941
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,840
It's just a mental victory of sorts.

942
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:12,040
But of course, I think your work is

943
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:15,880
far more superb and amazing than I am, Director.

944
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:21,080
I thought so, too.

945
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,880
I used to think, "My work is superb and amazing."

946
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:29,520
"Someone like me doesn't even come close."

947
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,920
You know I was adopted, right?

948
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:39,720
Yes.

949
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,600
I was a child abandoned by his biological parents...

950
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,360
A child who couldn't even talk properly??

951
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:51,000
A child who was teased and at whom people pointed fingers,

952
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,040
so he got used to being ignored??

953
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:00,040
Yet the paintings drawn by such a child??

954
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,520
received nothing but praise.

955
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:13,000
Without painting, I've never once felt more worthy than my paintings

956
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:17,440
simply for the reason that I'm still alive and living.

957
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:25,360
So thank you, for teaching me that.

958
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,400
And??

959
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,640
I'm sorry.

960
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,280
Huh? What for?

961
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:45,600
I brought up Ivanov's piece with Director Eom.

962
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,440
I asked her where the piece she won the bid for was.

963
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:48,520
So, for that.

964
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:53,000
Oh, so that's why she slapped me.

965
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,000
I didn't have to pretend nothing was wrong. How embarrassing.

966
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,040
- Curator Sung. - Please forget what I said.

967
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:06,480
I'll do the same.

968
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:10,640
Let's go, then.

969
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:29,000
By the way, you're quite good at apologies.

970
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:33,320
Oh, don't get me wrong. I meant that in a good way.

971
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:38,160
Just now, I mean. If you hadn't told me,

972
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,400
I wouldn't have known.

973
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:46,040
Admitting your mistakes and apologizing??

974
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,760
That's not easy, you know.

975
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:51,040
Especially when it concerns your subordinate.

976
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:55,520
I'm not particularly affectionate, but I don't want to be a coward.

977
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,560
You heard that?

978
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:03,360
I didn't want to be irresponsible like those people who abandoned me.

979
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:06,280
Let me take you home. It's been a long day.

980
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:08,400
- And??- Because you still feel bad?

981
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:13,000
What, you haven't forgotten about it yet?

982
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,040
I told you you can.

983
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:18,200
I'll go ahead first.

984
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,280
I want to go for a walk on my own.

985
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,160
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

986
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:15,080
What??

987
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:23,360
No matter how pathetic I may be,

988
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:26,760
I'm far more superb than those haughty paintings

989
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:28,080
hanging up on that wall.

990
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:32,360
Because I'm still here, alive and living.

991
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,040
(I will find you, and I will kill you)

992
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:31,600
Curator Sung.

993
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:36,280
Are you alright?

994
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,080
Wait right here.

995
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,520
What gives?

996
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,040
That woman there??

997
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:59,600
She's my girlfriend.

998
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,280
She's my girlfriend, you hear me?

999
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,720
(Her Private Life)

1000
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,200
He's my boyfriend.

1001
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,440
But why him, when you have me?

1002
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:51,080
I have something to return to Cha Si-an's homepage master.

1003
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:51,800
Who is it?

1004
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,040
This is all because of me.

1005
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,520
I'm ready to observe a lot,

1006
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:56,760
and confirm many things at Cheum.

1007
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:59,000
So you're saying that lady might be a fan of Si-an's?

1008
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,520
She must be a special fan. Ms. T.R.T.S., I mean.

1009
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,520
You'll keep this a secret, right?

1010
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,120
Just one lie.

1011
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:07,280
It's a bit embarrassing to say this, but??

1012
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,800
Try to have me.

1013
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:09,920
You're my girlfriend, after all.
