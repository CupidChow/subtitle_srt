	(Her Private Life)

3
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,200
	You work here?

4
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,600
	Yes, just a moment.

5
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,320
	What can I help you with?

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,440
	You want it?

7
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,200
	You want it?

8
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,160
	Oh, oh. Oh!

9
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,880
	Sometimes to survive, you pretend to not be an otaku.

10
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,720
	Pretending that you don't even know what an otaku is.

11
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,840
	Known as Ordinary Person Cosplay, Ordinary Co.

12
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,040
	Ms. Sung Duk-mi.

13
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,320
	Ms. Sung Duk-mi, you've never studied abroad?

14
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,520
	I wanted to be in the middle of artists and their works??

15
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,160
	Perhaps you lacked talent.

16
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,240
	Or perhaps you lacked money?

17
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,360
	That was a factor??

18
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,480
	Bo-kyung.

19
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,920
	How's the Chairman doing?

20
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,200
	He wanted me to thank you for the work you sent over.

21
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,280
	It's one for the GN Group Chairman's office,

22
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,240
	I wanted to make sure that it was up to par.

23
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,600
	He likes it.

24
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,200
	Does she already have the job?

25
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,560
	Bo-kyung, I think we would get along.

26
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,640
	Wait.

27
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,160
	Daughter.

28
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,880
	Shouldn't you be at school?

29
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,160
	Who just spent $5,000 at Moon Tracks?

30
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,040
	Are you an idol group fan?

31
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,440
	Huh? Why do you need to buy 300 copies of an album?

32
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,320
	Do you have 600 ears?

33
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,640
	There's a line at the fan-signing?

34
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,560
	If there's a line, you just line up early.

35
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,000
	Why do you need to spend all that money?

36
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,960
	Hyo-jin, return it before dad finds out.

37
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,080
	Is Hyo-jin on her way to a fan-signing?

38
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,120
	They let the ones who buy the most albums

39
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,240
	in first at those things.

40
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,000
	If she wanted to secure her spot,

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,960
	she needs to buy at least 300.

42
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,000
	Oh, I guess you go to these things as well?

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,920
	Sometimes if there's an idol group I enjoy?

44
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,560
	What about you, Ms. Sung Duk-mi?

45
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,160
	Have you been to an idol group fan-signing?

46
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,480
	No.

47
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,200
	I don't understand what

48
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,520
	either of you two are talking about.

49
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,360
	What are you talking about?

50
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,800
	That's it.

51
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,320
	This is normal.

52
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,840
	Ms. Sung Duk-mi, you start tomorrow.

53
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,280
	- Really? - Yes.

54
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,720
	Director.

55
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,400
	You said that this interview didn't matter??

56
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,160
	How can an interview not matter?

57
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,000
	Ugh, I'm already sick and tired

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,200
	of my own daughter going crazy over idols.

59
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,800
	Do I need to see that at work too?

60
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,080
	Those that like idol groups

61
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,640
	shouldn't even think about setting a foot in my museum.

62
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,960
	Bye.

63
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,360
	Secretary Kim!

64
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,560
	Sung Duk-mi, the professional Ordinary Co.

65
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,040
	Is about to be unmasked.

66
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,160
	How??

67
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,200
	Where's the Director's office?

68
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,640
	Director's office?

69
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,040
	This isn't something the Director needs to know about.

70
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,680
	You must remember.

71
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,520
	The thing is??

72
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,600
	I mean it's nothing to be proud of.

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,640
	But I guess you're trying to keep it a secret from the Director.

74
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,480
	The Director wouldn't like it if she knew.

75
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,840
	If you answer my question,

76
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,280
	I'll keep it a secret.

77
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,040
	Who is your client?

78
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,200
	Pardon?

79
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,560
	Who is the client that requested you to do that?

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,680
	The client that asked you to purchase that Lee Sol painting.

81
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,760
	Oh.

82
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,360
	Oh, you're talking about the auction?

83
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,280
	Did we meet somewhere else besides the auction?

84
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,920
	No, we have not.

85
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,120
	Oh, and regarding that client, I can't say.

86
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,640
	The privacy of the collector is??

87
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,080
	Is it Cha Si-an?

88
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,080
	Cha Si-an?

89
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,000
	You don't know Cha Si-an of White Ocean?

90
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,120
	Oh, Cha Si??

91
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,360
	I think I've heard of him?

92
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,440
	I don't really know much about idols.

93
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,440
	They're all pretty and kind of all look the same.

94
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,960
	I'm not too crazy about pretty boys.

95
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,120
	I freaking hate them.

96
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,440
	But what brings you here?

97
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,200
	Today, I

98
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,520
	denied the one that I love by pretending not to know him.

99
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,920
	I lied and said that I didn't like him.

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,880
	I was in the middle of my Ordinary Co., I couldn't help it.

101
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,880
	But even so??

102
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,440
	How could I?

103
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,440
	Going so far as to say I freaking hate him?

104
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,040
	I have committed a great sin.

105
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,320
	Si-an.

106
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,120
	I'm sorry.

107
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,080
	Forgive me, I'm not worthy.

108
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,040
	Si-an.

109
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,040
	(Episode 2: I'm sorry, Average Cosplay)

110
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,640
	Let me introduce to you,

111
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,600
	the next Director of Cheum Museum.

112
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,680
	I'm Ryan Gold.

113
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,000
	That stupid lion is why I had to say those things about Si-an.

114
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,320
	Welcome to Cheum Museum of Art.

115
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,720
	It is an honor to work with you, Mr. Gold.

116
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,040
	Really?

117
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,320
	Let's do the welcome party later.

118
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,160
	It's polite to finish the first meeting on a good note,

119
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,840
	but unfortunately, I don't think I can here.

120
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,840
	Why does that lion twerp have my notebook?

121
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,160
	After I got scouted,

122
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,040
	I did a bit of research on Cheum.

123
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,080
	It was remarkable.

124
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,000
	Every exhibition was so-so.

125
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,080
	Is this a museum of art or personal connections?

126
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,880
	If you claim to be a museum of art,

127
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,440
	the least you could do is put on a real exhibition.

128
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,640
	That would be conscionable.

129
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,600
	Keeping that in mind,

130
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,000
	at least the exhibitions did not garner negative reviews.

131
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,400
	If you read the visitors' feedback and critical reviews??

132
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,640
	I've read them, all of them.

133
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,000
	Critical reviews from all outlets were the same.

134
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,880
	As if one person had written them.

135
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,840
	It looked like it was copied straight from the press kit.

136
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,480
	Who was the curator in charge?

137
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,240
	I enjoyed your work.

138
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,920
	I don't expect much from you all.

139
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,840
	Just one thing.

140
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,720
	Forget about all the connections of the former Director.

141
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,440
	Shouldn't we discuss that with Director Eom??

142
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,040
	Director Eom?

143
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,320
	Who's that?

144
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,360
	From today, the Director of Cheum is Ryan Gold.

145
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,920
	Am I wrong?

146
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,160
	I apologize.

147
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,760
	Thank you for the welcome.

148
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,520
	Director, just a moment. Director.

149
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,880
	Director,

150
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,520
	I would first off like to thank you

151
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,560
	for taking on Cheum Museum during these hard times.

152
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,600
	We'll listen and seriously take into consideration

153
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,520
	of your unbiased criticism as a chance for development.

154
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,640
	Alright.

155
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,080
	But.

156
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,880
	A bit, just a little bit.

157
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,520
	It feels like it's an unfair assessment.

158
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,400
	Cheum Museum from the get-go

159
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,920
	is different from Mono Art Gallery, where you were.

160
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,520
	We don't operate with donations or sponsorships.

161
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,600
	We're under the parent company of TK Group??

162
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,160
	It's essentially another business department.

163
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,920
	To help the company's image.

164
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,080
	We can't deny that we followed the former Director's approach,

165
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,080
	but despite that, everyone here has tried their best.

166
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,440
	I hope that you take that into your unbiased consideration.

167
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,160
	Let me ask you one thing.

168
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,600
	In your opinion, was the former Director

169
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,440
	talented enough to come up with an exhibition by herself?

170
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,040
	- Well??- She wasn't.

171
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,880
	But you couldn't go against her.

172
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,480
	Why?

173
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,080
	She's related to the owner and it was privately owned.

174
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,400
	Weak to authority?

175
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,320
	Director.

176
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,760
	That's not a bad thing, for me.

177
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,800
	Someone who submits themselves in any given situation.

178
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,160
	Someone without a thought, opinion, or ego.

179
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,160
	Someone who just follows orders.

180
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,040
	You can just keep that up.

181
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,720
	Throw away the connections? Why?

182
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,520
	He's tossing the planned exhibition?

183
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,400
	I believe so.

184
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,240
	A gifted artist.

185
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,120
	Mono Art Gallery's first Korean Director.

186
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,200
	I scouted him because he was perfect for the press.

187
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,760
	But just because he thinks he's a lion, he's acting like a king.

188
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,000
	What do you think?

189
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,800
	(Coco Moco)

190
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,320
	Auction, airport, museum director?

191
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,880
	Isn't this fate?

192
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,520
	Oh,

193
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,080
	I shouldn't say such things to a friend.

194
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,760
	Someone without a thought, opinion, or ego in any situation.

195
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,080
	You like someone who just follows orders.

196
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,680
	He's just asking me to submit.

197
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,040
	For someone who came from the country with

198
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,400
	the Statue of Liberty, why is he like that?

199
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,400
	It doesn't matter where he's from, a freak is a freak.

200
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,720
	At least he didn't see your face at the airport.

201
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,040
	Just imagine if he did.

202
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,120
	Goosebumps.

203
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,240
	It's okay. It's okay.

204
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,560
	You're right. You're right.

205

	(Coco Moco)

206
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,320
	How are you so wise?

207
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,920
	I was always like that.

208
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,560
	Yeah.

209
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,560
	But he's such a freak.

210
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,040
	There's someone I like,

211
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,680
	but it's kind of hard to see each other in person.

212
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,440
	Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

213
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,760
	Bless you. Thank you.

214
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,000
	Suite room. Suite room. Suite room.

215
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,600
	How did you get this?

216
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,800
	We can finally do it?

217
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,240
	We can. We can.

218
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,160
	Thank goodness.

219
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,800
	I'm so glad he didn't see my face at the airport.

220
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,800
	Exactly.

221
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,520
	Hey,

222
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,080
	Lee Sun-joo!

223
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,600
	Is Gun-woo asleep?

224
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,040
	I'm going to remind you again, I'm not a nanny.

225
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,320
	Did he eat?

226
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,120
	Chicken.

227
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,840
	I told you to feed him rice.

228
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,720
	What's wrong with her?

229
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,720
	Let her be.

230
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,360
	She almost got otaku-outed.

231
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,680
	What's the big deal?

	(Exposing one's otaku proclivities)

234
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,040
	What.

235
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,320
	You've never worked in a company and you talk a big game.

236
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,720
	Hey, so what am I doing now?

237
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,400
	Am I just doing some extracurricular activities?

238
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,400
	Do you know what happens once

239
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,320
	you're otaku-outed at work?

240
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,000
	Woah, Cha Si-an?

241
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,200
	Wow, that's crazy.

242
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,760
	Do you know how old he is?

243
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,600
	No conscience.

244
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,080
	I heard Cha Si-an was spotted on a date.

245
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,560
	Curator Sung,

246
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,400
	what are you going to do?

247
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,400
	What?

248
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,520
	You like an idol?

249
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,760
	Get out.

250
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,360
	There's not a single art museum

251
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,560
	in this whole country, that will take you.

252
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,120
	My biggest fear is being otaku-outed.

253
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,600
	Just let it in one ear and out the other.

254
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,760
	It's better than walking on eggshells.

255
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,400
	Do you know what you call a woman curator

256
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,760
	that likes idols?

257
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,120
	Pa-soon-yi.

258
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,640
	Curator, curator.

259
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,520
	It doesn't matter if you like an idol or a freak,

260
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,600
	a curator is a curator.

261
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,560
	You call each other Pa-soon-yi all the time.

262
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,920
	We can call each other that,

263
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,200
	but others cannot.

264
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,080
	That's looking down on us.

265
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,440
	You call a Pa-Soon-yi, a Pa-Soon-yi. What else?

266
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,800
	After all that.

267
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,520
	It's because of people like you that I'm afraid of

268
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,440
	being otaku-outed if I stop my Ordinary Co.

269

	What if you do?

273
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,040
	You think I'm going down alone?

274

	That's right.

275

	You two grew up together,

276
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,240
	you should die together too.

	There are different types of freaks.

	'He's had the industry's attention

290

	with his unapologetic counterculture style.'

	He's handsome.

293

	His looks didn't do anything wrong,

294

	it's his personality.

295

	His foster mom was of Korean descent.

	Stop pushing.

	Curator Yoo Kyung-ah.

312
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,760
	I memorized both your names, I think that's enough introductions.

	Please sit.

	We weren't sure what you liked,

	so we just prepared what we normally drink.

316

	There will be no time for coffee in meetings from now on.

	There's no need to figure out my coffee preferences.

318
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,480
	Should we start with the exhibition proposal?

319

	It's the Cheum's 5th anniversary exhibit proposal.

320

	It's a solo show featuring Ahn Myung-sub?

	Yes.

	It's only been 8 months since the group show.

323
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,920
	Hasn't anyone considered that it might be too soon?

324
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,200
	- Anyone? - Well...

325
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,200
	The former Director Eom specifically requested

326
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,000
	that Mr. Ahn's work be included in the group show.

327
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,160
	He agreed to it, in exchange for a solo show.

328
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,160
	That was irrational.

329
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,720
	But the group show only showcased a small amount of his new work.

330
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,080
	With this solo show on the 5th anniversary of Cheum,

331
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,400
	we plan a complete

332
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,120
	retrospective of his work.

333
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,320
	That's how you plan to differentiate?

334
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,160
	How about a different exhibition altogether?

335
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,520
	Not just differentiating, but specializing.

336
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,280
	You're not suggesting??

337
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,080
	we cancel Mr. Ahn's show, are you?

338
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,000
	That sounds better.

339
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,400
	Let's cancel it.

340
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,160
	Mr. Ahn's show.

341
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,520
	For Cheum Museum's 5th anniversary show,

342
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,040
	we'll showcase celeb's collections,

343
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,880
	a show of art-tainer works.

344
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,280
	That's not possible.

345
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,920
	Artwork collected by celebrities.

346
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,600
	Won't the public be intrigued and excited

347
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,240
	by the various sophisticated works?

348
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,360
	And I'm thinking of

349
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,160
	using the profits from the show

350
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,000
	to support and promote new, marginal artists.

351
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,480
	It seems like killing 3 birds with one stone.

352
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,880
	I'm not sure if it's okay for me to say this.

353
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,880
	Then you shouldn't.

354
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,000
	You'll end up losing 3 things as well.

355
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,160
	Mr. Ahn's trust,

356
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,160
	Cheum's reputation in the industry

357
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,520
	and peace within Cheum Museum.

358
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,000
	- Curator Yoo Kyung-ah. - Yes?

359
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,960
	Please get the proposal of what I've said, ready.

360
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,160
	- You may leave. - Okay.

361
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,720
	I knew he was a freak.

362
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,040
	A handsome freak.

363
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,640
	OG freak?

364
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,080
	Original freak.

365
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
	Yes, Director Eom.

366
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,720
	The hospital?

367
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,560
	Now?

368
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,520
	I misjudged you.

369
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,960
	Someone without a thought, opinion, or ego.

370
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,520
	Someone who submits themselves to authority.

371
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,840
	I thought that's who you were, Ms. Sung Duk-mi.

372
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,440
	How did someone with your tenacity

373
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,080
	manage to keep quiet for so long?

374
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,600
	I didn't keep quiet.

375
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,960
	Former Director Eom just refused to listen.

376
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,040
	Insubordination is possible when there is communication.

377
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,480
	Oh, you are aware of what insubordination means?

378
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,440
	Acting out without knowing their place?

379
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,960
	That?

380
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,200
	Badmouthing someone who's not here comes natural for you?

381
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,000
	I don't mind doing it about someone who is here either.

382
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,360
	Would you like to hear it?

383
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,720
	I prayed

384
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,040
	and I asked for someone that would listen.

385
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,560
	And here you are.

386
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,280
	Someone that listens, but doesn't understand.

387
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,080
	Is that it? That's a little weak.

388
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,600
	I'll tell you again,

389
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,120
	canceling Mr. Ahn's show is impossible.

390
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,000
	I don't mind you offering your opinions at any time.

391
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,320
	But possibility isn't something you, Curator Sung, decides.

392
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,800
	That's something for Mr. Ahn and me to decide.

393
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,120
	Get me a meeting with Mr. Ahn.

394
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,560
	Is that possible?

395
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,480
	That's possible.

396
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,120
	Oh.

397
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,160
	Please keep the fact we're canceling the show between us

398
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,920
	until the meeting. I'll tell him myself.

399
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,280
	Let's end the meeting here.

400
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,360
	The new director is asking for a meeting?

401
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,640
	Yes, Sir.

402
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,040
	Regarding what?

403
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:57,400
	I think he wants to introduce himself and have a chat.

404
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,120
	It must be bad news.

405
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,800
	Pardon?

406
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,920
	Well, the thing is...

407
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:06,040
	You, Ms. Sung, do not have a poker face.

408
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,360
	I think bad news might be better if it comes from you.

409
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,120
	Get home safe.

410
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,440
	I'm sorry about everything, Sir.

411
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,320
	Oh, and don't tell the new director that I know already.

412
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,880
	When I see him, I'll tell him I want to cancel my show

413
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,160
	due to personal reasons. I want to keep my dignity at least.

414
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,920
	Am I being petty?

415
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,680
	No, don't worry about that.

416
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,280
	No, I'm the one who should be sorry.

	(Cheum Museum of Art)

418
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,160
	Where's the director?

419
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,000
	He's in the exhibit hall taking publicity shots.

420
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,160
	- Okay. - Okay.

421
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,400
	Just a little bit, a little bit. Great.

422
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,760
	A bit to your right.

423
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,560
	Just a bit more natural.

424
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,280
	Okay, great.

425
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,000
	One more time.

426
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,320
	Director, the proposal you asked for.

427
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,720
	You can leave it on my desk.

428
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,000
	Okay.

429
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,000
	One more time.

430
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,640
	Good, great.

431
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,080
	Just a slight smile.

432
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,840
	Okay, great.

	Isn't it amazing?

471
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,840

	and send this certified mail?

	Well,

00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,960
	Even if you, Director, had told him, we would've??

484
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,160
	How are we the same?

485
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,680
	If I talked to him, I wouldn't have been empty-handed.

486
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,040
	For example??

487
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,080
	For example, a solo show in New York.

488
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,160
	Did you also take

489
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,040
	the proposal from my desk?

490
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,560
	No, I did not.

491
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,760
	I haven't even seen the proposal.

492
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,360
	I've seen and felt too much for me to believe you.

493
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,200
	Get out.

494
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,080
	Anyone that feels that this is unjust,

495
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,800
	may leave with her.

496
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,080
	The caller you are trying to reach is unavailable,

497

	please leave a message after the tone.

499
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,680
	Sir.

500
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,800
	This is Sung Duk-mi from Cheum Museum.

501
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,800
	I apologize if my rash actions

502
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,320
	have caused you any distress.

503
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,880
	I hope that you will permit me

504
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,920
	the chance to apologize in person.

	(Cheum Museum of Art)

506
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,640
	I guess Curator Sung is really not coming in today?

507
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,480
	What is she planning to do?

508
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,000
	She needs to at least come in and do something.

509
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,440
	The director is coming.

510
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,720
	Good morning.

511
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,520
	- Hello. - Good morning.

512
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,640
	Sesame oil.

513
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,120
	Good.

514
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:47,000
	Yes, well the song we're making now is one that I hope

515
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,880
	a lot of fans can easily sing along to.

516
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,520
	I can't wait for it to be presented to the world.

517
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,160
	The snack that I never get sick of eating

518
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,000
	is you, my Si-an.

519
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,320
	When do I have time to be depressed?

520
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,120
	Firing me is your loss.

521
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,440
	You've done a great job,

522
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,160
	working and studying.

523
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,760
	I'm going to say goodbye now.

524
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,160
	Goodbye.

525
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,560
	He should acknowledge the unemployed too.

526
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,000
	I'm unemployed.

527
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,080
	(Mom)

528
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,320
	Home.

529
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,160
	I'm home.

530
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,920
	- What? - Shh!

531
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,800
	Can't you feel the cold air

532
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,640
	in this house right now?

533
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,560
	Are mom and dad fighting?

534
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,760
	No, I came because of mom's text.

535
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,600
	I sent that.

536
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,760
	Why are they fighting?

537
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,360
	Dad.

538
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,400
	I thought they've been too quiet.

539
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,480
	- Loser gets dad! - Shoot.

540
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,120
	Yes!

541
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,560
	I get mom.

542
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,960
	Of course, an elderly woman's

543
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,400
	head, shoulder, knees hurt.

544
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,920
	What? An artificial joint?

545
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,480
	Look at how we're living, right now.

546
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,880
	Do we look like we can afford that right now?

547
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,360
	Are you blind or just not thinking?

548
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,240
	You know we can't do it, why do you keep asking?

549
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,640
	Grandma is dad's mom.

550
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,640
	He's just worried because his mom is in pain.

551
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,760
	Aren't you worried about me?

552
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,320
	Do you think your mother goes to work early in the morning

553
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,760
	because she has a surplus of knee cartilage?

554
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,560
	I'm in pain. I'm in pain too.

555
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,640
	We know how hard you work. Of course, we do.

556
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,360
	I'm the only one struggling to survive.

557
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,120
	He takes all our life's savings to start a business

558
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,840
	and all he does is just bring home stones.

559
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:23,240
	How can such an unconscionable man be such a filial son?

560
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,080
	Fine.

561
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,040
	Get her the surgery.

562
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,080
	We have no choice.

563
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,440
	It's my fault for marrying such a filial son.

564
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,080
	Take my spine and put it in your mother's joints

565
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,800
	or set up a monument for your filial piety.

566
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,400
	Do whatever you want. Whatever you want.

567
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,800
	- Mom. - Shush.

568
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,600
	You think I want to live like this?

569
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,240
	What I would give to be like you, act all graceful,

570
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,960
	sitting in an art museum all day.

571
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,840
	What I did to raise you??And you just take your dad's side?

572
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:03,080
	Oh forget it, all the Sungs are useless.

573
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,440
	I don't even want to look at you. Get out.

574
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,720
	Everyone get out.

575
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,760
	Why do I have to get out?

576
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,600
	Am I someone that just leaves because someone says so?

577
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,080
	What's up with you?

578
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,680
	What did you say?

579
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,000
	I'm sitting gracefully at the art museum?

580
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,520
	Do you even know what I do there?

581
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,280
	How I get treated there?

582
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,160
	What, how are they treating you?

583
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,120
	You see?

584
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,000
	The reason why Duk-mi is living like this is because of you.

585
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,920
	Stop it already.

586
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,840
	Here.

587
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,440
	Dad, use this to pay for grandma's surgery.

588
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,840
	Mom, use this to buy some supplements.

589
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,120
	Bye.

590
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,800
	Hey, wait...

591
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,240
	I'll go see what's up.

592
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,280
	What's wrong with you today?

593
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,120
	Did something happen?

594
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,080
	Something.

595
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,640
	I wish something happened.

596
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,160
	Hey, Sung Duk-mi.

597
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,920
	Oh, it's Lee Sun-joo!

598
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,400
	Korea's Cheekbone Beauty, Lee Sun-joo.

599
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,000
	Above all gods, Lee Sun-joo.

600
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
	Sis.

601
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,160
	Give me $3. For some soju.

602
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,040
	Soju, soju.

603
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:03,760
	I still love you. I still can't forget you.

604
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,920
	Oh-oh-owoah.

605
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,240
	Oh-oh-owoah-owoah. Ulssu!

606
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,560
	Because I was more worried than annoyed.

607
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,080
	I know you don't want to let me go.

608
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,080
	Actually...

609
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,440
	I got fired.

610
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,360
	What?

611
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,840
	I got fired from Cheum.

612
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,360
	Hey, Sung Duk-mi.

613
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,080
	You just left when they told you to leave?

614
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,600
	Why didn't you treat them like how you treat Eun-ki?

615
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,040
	Hey.

616
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,360
	Isn't it the year of the Three Disasters for her?

617
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,640
	(Gun-woo's Dad)

618
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,520
	Eun-ki.

619
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,320
	We're the same zodiac sign.

620
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,400
	If it was the year of Three Disasters, would we be fine?

621
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,560
	Oh.

622
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,120
	Why does she have all the bad luck?

623
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,800
	And why'd you throw your cards at them?

624
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,480
	You're the one that's screwed.

625
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,920
	Exactly.

626
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,200
	(Gun-woo's Dad)

627
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,240
	(The witness contacted me, I need to go)

628
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,520
	I need to go.

629
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,600
	A witness contacted him,

630
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,400
	so our Producer needs to go.

631
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,120
	Hey, hey.

632
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,600
	What do you want me to do with her?

633
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,360
	What do you mean?

634
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,080
	It's not like you can live her life for her.

635
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,040
	I gave her my money and my time, that's all I can do.

636
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,600
	You're cold but cool.

637
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,000
	Sung Duk.

638
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,920
	It's time to go home.

639
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,080
	You can't be depressed about it, you can't change it.

640
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,840
	If you're going to be a recluse at home,

641
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,720
	come out to the cafe and make some money.

642
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,160
	A person may betray you,

643
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,120
	but money does not.

644
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,680
	We have some cuties at the cafe.

645
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,680
	There are some handsome regulars.

646
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,040
	They slightly resemble Si-an.

647
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,080
	- If that's the case??- Yes?

648
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,320
	One more bottle of soju.

649
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,680
	We open at 8.

650
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,000
	- Take care of Duk-mi. - Hey! Hey! Hey!

651
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,080
	Ryan.

652
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,120
	Stupid lion.

653
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:41,320
	I'm going to catch him alive and feed him only grass.

654
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,560
	No soju.

655
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,120
	- Rock, scissor, paper, shoot. - Shoot.

656
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,720
	- Rock, scissor, paper, shoot. - Shoot.

657
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,720
	Why I oughta??

658
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,160
	Oh, it's mom!

659
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,120
	You just got home, where are you off to now?

660
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,800
	I have no choice.

661
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,040
	Goodbye.

662
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,920
	Why do witnesses always change their mind when the sun goes down?

663
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,680
	I know.

664
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,160
	Come back soon, dad.

665
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,080
	I'll go to variety shows by the end of this year.

666
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,440
	Dad will be back.

667
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,960
	Bye.

668
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,720
	Come back soon, oppa.

669
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,920
	Let's go.

670
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,840
	(Coco Moco)

671
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,120
	A new regular. Isn't he handsome?

672
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,200
	Say hello.

673
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,640
	My former job's, former boss, former director,

674
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,080
	Ryan Gold.

675
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,000
	Are you a regular here?

676
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,040
	I'm asking just in case.

677
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,240
	Do you plan to come here often? No??

678
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,240
	Do you have a lot of time?

679
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,640
	Yes, thanks to someone, I got fired

680
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,120
	and I have a lot of time.

681
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,600
	I don't because someone made a mess for me.

682
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,560
	Why don't you just take my order?

683
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,840
	What would you like?

684
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,440
	A warm milk with condensed milk.

685
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,760
	Sir, we don't have anything like that on our menu.

686
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,480
	He takes a condensed milk latte without the shot.

687
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,520
	Without the espresso.

688
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:44,440
	Then, why doesn't he just get milk from a convenience store?

689
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,640
	Oh no, it's not regular milk.

690
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,000
	It has condensed milk and your heart in it.

691
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,000
	If I ask you to take it out, take it out.

692
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,760
	Why take out the coffee?

693
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,200
	Do you know how hard that coffee has been working in the latte?

694
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,320
	And now you toss it? What happens to the coffee?

695
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,200
	How must the coffee feel, being tossed out, without

696
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,400
	even getting a word in? Do you know what feels like?

697
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,320
	I'll get you a condensed milk latte without the espresso.

698
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,680
	I'll take your card.

699
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,040
	This is just being rude to the latte.

700
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,160
	You think that would be tasty?

701
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,120
	Be careful, it's hot.

702
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,880
	Come again.

703
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,920
	He doesn't drink coffee.

704
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,160
	He's someone who cares about his body too much.

705
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,720
	What? A handsome regular? Looks like Si-an?

706
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,000
	Let's get you some LASIK.

707
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,200
	You saw that picture I took at the airport. And??

708
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,480
	You know.

709
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,120
	I've had some face blindness ever since I had Gun-woo.

710
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,160
	Hey, no!

711
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,160
	Ju Hyuk has his exams.

712
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,160
	I need to go pick up Gun-woo later.

713
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,000
	How can I let Gun-woo walk home by himself?

714
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,480
	Let go.

715
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,160
	I'm going to do the dishes.

716
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,920
	Don't forget to wear gloves.

717
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,840
	Is she bold or dumb?

718
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,040
	Why do something you can't handle?

719
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,920
	You called for me?

720
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,800
	Have you gotten in touch with Mr. Ahn?

721
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,080
	No, not yet.

722
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,160
	What about his family or his friends?

723
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:29,560
	Well, Curator Sung was in charge of Mr. Ahn??

724
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,200
	So?

725
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,680
	No, it's fine.

726
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,360
	But, Director??

727
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:39,720
	Is Curator Sung Duk-mi really fired?

728
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,680
	Did I sound like I was kidding?

729
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,000
	I'm going to start looking for her replacement today.

730
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,080
	Get me a list of the artists that you need to do inaugural greetings

731
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:52,160
	for sponsors, critics and reporters.

732
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,480
	Okay.

733
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,160
	I'm not done.

734
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,400
	Get me a list of all the exhibitions held by Cheum

735
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,680
	in the last 2 years, organized for me.

736
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,600
	And have you been keeping a list of all the works

737
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,640
	in Cheum's possession? Oh, and how have they been classified?

738
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,040
	Classified?

739
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,600
	We've been following Cheum's distinctive??

740
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,280
	Roll-with-the-punches method?

741
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,200
	Let's switch to the International Standard Management System.

742
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,960
	And I'll send you a list of up and coming artists

743
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,160
	in New York right now. There's about 30,

744
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,600
	so take a look and check what they've been up to.

745
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,880
	Curator Yoo!

746
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,120
	We have a big problem.

747
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,080
	- Another one? - Yes.

748
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,640
	Are you still deciding?

749
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,600
	Cold brew latte, green tea Coco Moco.

750
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,080
	So you got back the piece lent to Saebit Museum,

751
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,960
	but you've discovered mold on them?

752
00:45:58,960 --> 00:45:59,960
	Yes.

753
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,440
	Macaron.

754
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,160
	Both parties checked when it was first rented out. Just write

755
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,360
	a report on the current status of the piece. What's the problem?

756
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,800
	Well, the thing is??

757
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,400
	Did you not check?

758
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,320
	Well, the exhibition dates overlapped.

759
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,840
	Installing and dismantling of the exhibits were on the same day.

760
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:14,960
	So?

761
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,280
	You're saying you did nothing wrong

762
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,960
	and it was the curator's fault for bad scheduling?

763
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:19,960
	No, it's not that.

764
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,000
	You know the curator at Saebit Museum?

765
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,120
	I called and I was cursed out.

766
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,120
	They asked who taught that nonsense to me.

767
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,000
	Who taught that nonsense??

768
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,120
	Saebit...

769
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,120
	Oh, it's not that. Curator Sung.

770
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,720
	- Duk-mi, what? - Just a moment.

771
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:34,720
	Wait.

772
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,440
	Hello, this is Sung Duk-mi of Cheum Art Museum.

773
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,080
	You took one of our precious children

774
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,040
	and gave it an infectious disease?

775
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:11,960
	Oh, it was already sick?

776
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,280
	Can you get us a list of the pieces lent to Saebit?

777
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,720
	We need to check if there are other pieces with the same issue

778
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,480
	and respond accordingly. Oh, and

779
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,040
	we'll check our storage,

780
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:27,240
	you should do the same.

781
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,080
	Let's find out once and for all whose mold it is.

782
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,120
	Goodbye.

783
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,000
	Our storage is maintained by the same people as Saebit's.

784
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,960
	See if there were any issues with Saebit's storage.

785
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,160
	Okay.

786
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,560
	I'm sorry.

787
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,080
	It was my mistake.

788
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,760
	It was good you discovered this mistake early on,

789
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,760
	but you can't repeat this mistake.

790
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,320
	If this happens again??

791
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,120
	You can't.

792
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,560
	Good luck, bye.

793
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,120
	Curator Sung.

794
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,520
	(Art Director Ryan Gold)

795
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:12,760
	Yes.

796
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,280
	Mold?

797
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,360
	Yes.

798
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,240
	(Similar issue confirmed, Joint Response. They're dead)

799
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,120
	(Contacted storage maintenance, Saebit's storage has issues)

800
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,880
	I guess it's a good thing.

801
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:33,480
	We'll send you the bill after the piece is restored.

802
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,680
	Yes.

803
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,040
	I'll let Curator Sung know that as well.

804
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,520
	Go ahead. Give me an excuse or explanation.

805
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:53,520
	The firing of Curator Sung Duk-mi.

806
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,000
	Please undo it.

807
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,160
	Why would I do that?

808
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,160
	She didn't do anything wrong.

809
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,520
	To tell you the truth??

810
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:07,440
	Who said he can cancel Mr. Ahn's show?

811
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,840
	I'll take care of Mr. Ahn.

812
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,000
	Just carry on with the show.

813
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,640
	So what you're saying is,

814
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,560
	Director Eom is behind Mr. Ahn.

815
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,160
	Probably?

816
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:26,200
	Once my husband Moo-san's retrial is over, so is Ryan.

817
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,840
	Cu. Yoo?

818
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:32,080
	Who do you think you'll end up working for longer?

819
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,840
	No, I'm sure.

820
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,960
	Curator Sung didn't know anything.

821
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,200
	Then the person who took the proposal was??

822
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,600
	Well, that was??

823
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,120
	I was so scared.

824
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,840
	I couldn't help it.

825
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,200
	From my experience,

826
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,080
	following the person with the nastier character,

827
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,880
	leads to less backlash.

828
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:57,920
	From where I'm standing,

829
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,480
	I think you, Director, are much better than Director Eom.

830
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,000
	Thank you for the compliment.

831
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,680
	So please let Curator Sung come back.

832
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,320
	Okay, you can leave.

833
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,920
	Oh, and??

834
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,960
	what I told you today.

835
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:19,240
	If Director Eom finds out, she'll bury me alive.

836
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,080
	- So if you can keep it a secret. - Okay.

837
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,520
	Oh and also from Curator Sung.

838
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,680
	She's no joke either.

839
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,680
	Welcome.

840
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,240
	Do you have some time?

841
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,800
	We don't have that on the menu.

842

	Is working at a cafe fun?

843
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:16,000
	I've thought it over.

844
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,520
	I think I went a bit overboard.

845
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,160
	Even without a discerning eye, I should've acknowledged

846
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,840
	your 5 years of experience.

847
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,120
	I'm sorry.

848
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,480
	I apologize.

849
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,720
	Are you being sincere?

850
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,000
	Okay, I accept your apology.

851
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,880
	Good. I'll see you tomorrow.

852
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,240
	I'm accepting your apology. Just the apology.

853
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,320
	Please proceed with the termination.

854
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,160
	Curator Sung Duk-mi?

855
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,520
	What, Ryan?

856
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,160
	You think everything just magically disappears

857
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,400
	as soon as you apologize?

858
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,080
	When you get upset, you fire people.

859
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,160
	And when you apologize,

860
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,040
	I don't get a say and just come back?

861
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,160
	That's not what I'm saying.

862
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,280
	Do you think I don't know what's going on?

863
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,120
	There are fires starting left and right. You just want me to

864
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,000
	come and put them out. That's why you're apologizing.

865
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,080
	Cheum can't run without me.

866
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,440
	Okay.

867
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,280
	So why don't you take that responsibility

868
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,640
	and stick with it?

869
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,440
	You kill me with a single stroke of the sword

870
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,320
	and now you're asking me to clean the blood off your hands?

871
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,280
	How are you so egotistical?

872
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,000
	I can understand how you must be feeling,

873
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,480
	but choose your words carefully.

874
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,920
	If you understand how I'm feeling,

875
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,120
	you filter out the words.

876

	What you're saying is??

877
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,800
	You're not going to come back?

878
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,440
	I refuse to go back.

879
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,120
	Okay.

880
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,280
	Now that I see you, this suits you better.

899

	I had my revenge.

00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,440
	Against the lion? How?

901
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,200
	He just cares about his body so much,

902

	he doesn't drink coffee.

903
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,160
	So, I just secretly added half a shot.

904
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,760

	No, no. That's not necessary.

911

	No, you don't need to say that.

	Attempted murder.

963
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,520
	Oh, well we'll move him to a room soon.

964
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:40,560
	Sung Duk-mi.

965
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,880
	I knew you were going to get someone one of these days.

966
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,600
	I always thought it would be you.

967
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:02,960
	He's alive.

968
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,240
	I'm going to wipe the sweat off.

969
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,040
	I'm sorry.

970
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,680
	Ms. Sung Duk-mi.

971
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,240
	Ms. Sung Duk-mi!

972
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,280
	Ms. Sung Duk-mi. Are you in there?

973
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:42,320
	Ms. Sung Duk-mi!

974
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:45,840
	Who are you?

975
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:48,400
	Are you Ms. Sung Duk-mi, a curator at Cheum Museum?

976
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,920
	- Is that you? - Yes.

977
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:54,720
	You're under arrest for the attempted murder of Ryan Gold.

978
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:55,880
	Please put your hands out.

979
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:57,760
	Don't move.

980
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,920
	If you move, it'll hurt.

981
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,000
	Are you the Home Ma of White Ocean's Cha Si-an,

982
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,760
	- The Road to Si-an? - Yes.

983
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:09,080
	You're under arrest for the attack against Ryan Gold and fraud.

984
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,640
	Don't move.

985
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:13,200
	If you move, it'll hurt.

986
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,240
	Let's go.

987
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,960
	Mom, dad, Eun-ki, what am I going to do?

988
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:34,400
	I'm standing in front of the residences

989
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,360
	of Ms. Sung, an avid fan of a famous idol group.

990
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:40,800
	Ms. Sung, a well known active Home Ma in the fandom community,

991
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,080
	- Get out. Get out. - Get out of the way.

992
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:44,040
	Am I really being arrested?

993
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:45,640
	Is this real? For real?

994
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:48,760
	She added coffee to a mint choco for a man in his 30s

995
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,080
	and attempted murder.

996
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,240
	She often asked if I wanted to die

997
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,640
	and asked if I wanted my life shortened.

998
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,680
	She just suddenly opened her wallet and gave me her card.

999
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:03,680
	I was wondering what got into her, but murder??

1000
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,000
	So you're not saying it wasn't an accident?

1001
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,040
	Was it premeditated murder?

1002
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,280
	What are you all saying?

1003
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:13,520
	Mom.

1004
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,600
	Mom, what are you saying?

1005
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,600
	It's not me.

1006
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:16,920
	Stop taking my picture.

1007
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,000
	It's not me, mom. I didn't do it.

1008
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,320
	It's not me.

1009
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,680
	I'm not going. I'm not going.

1010
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,760
	It's not me.

1011
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,560
	I'm telling you, it's not me.

1012
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:30,040
	Oh.

1013
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:34,280
	Oh, Director, you're awake?

1014
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:40,160
	Here are your slippers.

1015
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,120
	Would you like some water?

1016
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,560
	Here's some water.

1017
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,280
	It's water. Water.

1018
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:02,720
	Pure water. 100%

1019
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,200
	- Yesterday??- Yesterday,

1020
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,040
	I didn't know you were allergic to coffee.

1021
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:15,600
	I made an unforgivable mistake.

1022
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,560
	I'm really, truly sorry.

1023
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:22,600
	- Yesterday??- Yesterday,

1024
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,480
	I must've lost my mind.

1025
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,000
	I spoke to you like that.

1026
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,040
	I must've been crazy.

1027
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,120
	- Yesterday??- Yesterday, I??

1028
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:32,320
	Can you let me speak?

1029
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,480
	Yesterday,

1030
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,120
	how did you find me?

1031
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:45,920
	Oh, well,

1032
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:48,600
	Mr. Ahn wanted to speak to you

1033
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,080
	and explain the situation.

1034
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:53,000
	So I went to your office to tell you.

1035
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,120
	Did you explain to him why I didn't get back to him?

1036
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:00,040
	It was late, so I sent him a text.

1037
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:02,600
	He agreed to follow your decision regarding the exhibition.

1038
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:06,160
	He wanted to speak to you in person, after you get discharged.

1039
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:12,680
	Okay.

1040
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:16,000
	Get me another meeting with Mr. Ahn.

1041
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,160
	Yes.

1042
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,040
	Yes?

1043
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:23,440
	Then.

1044
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,400
	Are you forgiving me?

1045
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,880
	Or should I just accept the apology, like someone I know?

1046
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,120
	Should I take legal action?

1047
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,760
	No, if given the chance,

1048
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,640
	I will work very hard

1049
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:37,760
	for you, Director Ryan Gold and Cheum Museum.

1050
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,480
	You may go.

1051
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,160
	Get some rest.

1052
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:51,880
	- Curator Sung? - Yes?

1053
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:54,160
	Don't come to the museum tomorrow,

1054
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,160
	just meet me at the meeting place.

1055
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,040
	Is it a meeting with an artist?

1056
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:00,080
	A collector.

1057
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:01,800
	White Ocean's...

1058
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,000
	...Cha Si-an.

1059
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:10,600
	- What? - We're meeting him to discuss

1060
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,680
	his pieces, so even if you may not like him,

1061
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:15,000
	I hope you can remain professional and not let on.

1062
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:19,160
	Okay.

1063
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,000
	I'm not going.

1064
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,040
	Si-an.

1065
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,360
	Si-an.

1066
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,080
	Si-an.

1067
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,280
	Si-an.

1068
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:23,920
	Si-an.

1069
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:26,360
	Cha Si-an.

1070
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:36,040
	There's a meeting with White Ocean's Cha Si-an.

1071
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,720
	Let's meet at his house.

1072
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:18,680
	It's by an artist that goes by Lee Sol.

1073
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:20,320
	I fell in love with it instantly.

1074
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:24,840
	It's just one in a series,

1075
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:27,600
	but isn't it just beautiful?

1076
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:31,800
	(Si-an)

1077
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:54,440
	Every time I look at it, I'm inspired, happy,

1078
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:57,040
	and comforted? That's what I feel.

1079
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:32,440
	(Her Private Life)

1080
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:35,120
	My gosh, I can die happy now.

1081
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,480
	Curator Sung, do you really hate Cha Si-an that much?

1082
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:38,840
	Your face is a bit??

1083
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,480
	Do you know Lee Sol?

1084
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,120
	I found out that you own

1085
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:43,320
	one of his pieces by chance.

1086
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:45,080
	What? Si-an is in the middle of a scandal?

1087
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:46,080
	It's me.

1088
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,480
	Isn't a lie that's believable

1089
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:49,600
	better than a truth that's hard to believe?

1090
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,200
	Did I spend all that time being an otaku

1091
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,880
	to end up like this?

1092
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:53,880
	Don't go overboard.

1093
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:55,040
	Good boy.

1094
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,600
	Curator Sung.

1095
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:57,600
	I'll do it.

1096
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,320
	I'll be your boyfriend.
