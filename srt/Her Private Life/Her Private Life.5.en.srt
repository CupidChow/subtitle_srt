00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,320
(Her Private Life)

2
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,080
(Her Private Life)

3
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,400
(One Single Lie)

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,280
That lie??

5
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,680
Fake relationship, pretend boyfriend??

6
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,520
I thought about giving it a try.

7
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,120
Is it okay to lie

8
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,000
if it's just one little lie?

9
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,880
Hello.

10
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,480
My name is Kim Hyo-jin, and I'll be working here from

11
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,800
today as an intern at Cheum Museum of Art.

12
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,360
Nope. You can't end at just one.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,200
He's my boyfriend!

14
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,920
You'll end up telling bigger lies??

15
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,160
Oh my gosh!

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,520
much, much bigger lies!

17
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,320
This is how scary lies are.

18
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,560
Oh.

19
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,760
So what happens if you lie a lot?

20
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,080
Your adorable little soul inside you will run away,

21
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,680
saying, "I don't like bad children!"

22
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,560
I think this calls for an explanation.

23
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,120
You see, the thing is??

24
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,440
Curator Sung?

25
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,040
The new intern??

26
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,160
She's the stalker who uploaded my photo.

27
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,000
You mean, Ms. Kim Hyo-jin is

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,680
Mr. Cha Si-an's stalker?

29
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,520
Yes.

30
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,120
But how do you know that?

31
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,520
Well,

32
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,560
I saw her take photos that day, in front of Mr. Cha's place.

33
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,720
I did.

34
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,600
You're going to release Ms. Kim Hyo-jin, right?

35
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,600
I mean, we can't go on pretending we're dating, even in the office.

36
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,120
We'll just have to keep on pretending,

37
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,960
because it's impossible to fire her.

38
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,080
- Why? - Ms. Kim Hyo-jin??

39
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,400
She's the daughter of the former director.

40
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,640
- Whose daughter? - Even if not as an intern,

41
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,960
she would've joined us one way or another.

42
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,880
So rather than see that happen, on the condition she apologizes??

43
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,320
She's Director Eom's daughter?

44
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,640
Yes.

45
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,680
How can there ever be a job interview that's meaningless?

46
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,640
Oh.

47
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,920
I'm already sick and tired of watching my daughter fangirl.

48
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,320
Do I have to keep a fangirl around the office, too?

49
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,840
Go tell those idol lovers not to even think of

50
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,000
stepping foot in my art museum.

51
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,800
Does this make any sense?

52
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,760
When could they have started?

53
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,960
So office dating is possible.

54
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,440
I guess nobody else knew they were dating?

55
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,520
We couldn't have even imagined!

56
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,320
Is that why Cha Si-an's fans stopped attacking her?

57
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,000
But how would they know what we didn't?

58
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,200
From this.

59
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,320
Huh? Who's that?

60
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,800
Oh my.

61
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,920
Don't tell me, that's Curator Sung and Director Gold?

62
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,360
Oh my goodness!

63
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,240
Oh my God.

64
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,520
What are you doing?

65
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,520
Aren't you supposed to be working right now?

66
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,920
Director??

67
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,960
Was this allowed during working hours, then?

68
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,600
If it weren't for our intern, we would've never known.

69
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,960
You have paparazzi trailing you, when you're not even celebs?

70
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,040
You're going to sue her, right?

71
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,200
What? Sue her?

72
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,760
Let's just overlook this one.

73
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,040
After all, things have calmed down somewhat, thanks to her.

74
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,800
But we should ask her to remove the photo now??

75
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,000
We had browsed through the homepage with our

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,080
new intern's ID, and I don't think she's normal.

77
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,680
"I'm hyperventilating over your clavicles."

78
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,040
"I'd die for you if I didn't have just one life."

79
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,120
"Si-an's thighs are my merchandise."

80
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,520
Thighs?

81
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,800
"Were you born this beautiful just to give me naughty ideas?"

82
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,720
Oh. So you get punished for lying a lot.

83
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,800
Exactly!

84
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,360
You must fear for your life, Sun-joo.

85
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,280
Besides, Mommy can tell when you're lying, Gun-woo.

86
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,520
How?

87
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,200
Because eyes can't lie.

88
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,160
Alright. Just because we're dating

89
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,080
doesn't mean anything's changed.

90
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,600
At the museum, we're strictly director and curator.

91
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,800
How many days ago did you two start dating?

92
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,000
How many days?

93
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,400
How ma??

94
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,840
Ms. Kim Hyo-jin,

95
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,720
is that what you're curious about on your first day?

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,360
Is it because we're at work?

97
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,760
I don't see any sweetness in your eyes.

98
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,160
(Episode 5: Honey drips from fangirls' eyes)

99
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,560
I'm going to take Gun-woo to the dentist,

100
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,000
then drop him off at his judo center.

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Alright.

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,280
Sun-joo, I got a message from Duk-mi.

103
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,400
What did she say?

104
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,440
Hold on.

105
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,880
Hey, what's this?

106
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,880
What's what?

107
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh. I told you last time.

108
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,480
We took photos for the fake relationship.

109
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,680
You said it was just a date.

110
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,720
- They're too??- They look great together, huh?

111
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,080
And it was me who took this picture!

112
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,640
No way.

113
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,600
One of Si-an's fans started working there as an intern,

114
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,480
so now she has to continue this pretend relationship with Lion.

115
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,480
What?

116
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,080
I knew this would happen!

117
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,600
Gun-woo, say goodbye to Ju Hyuk.

118
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,040
Goodbye, I'll be back!

119
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,880
Bye.

120
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,120
Let's go, Gun-woo.

121
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,680
Nam Eun-ki.

122
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,000
Do you know how many cell towers there are in Korea?

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,040
There's no place where you can't get a signal.

124
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,040
So what?

125
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,520
So if you've got something to say, just say it over the phone

126
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,360
instead of coming here to my workplace!

127
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,000
Hey, Sung Duk-mi.

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,280
Do you not know how many stupid things you've done?

129
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,080
You're not exactly one to listen when I say it in words, you brat.

130
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,320
Brat? Why you??

131
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,280
Keep up the fake dating act?

132
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,800
Even at the museum?

133
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,120
So what? What about it? Why? Hm?

134
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,880
What about your mother, huh?

135
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,320
What's my mother got to do with this?

136
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,960
I didn't want to say this in case you might get worried,

137
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,240
but even Editor Nam knows about you and Cha Si-an.

138
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,280
Editor Nam?

139
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,080
She wouldn't have told Mom, would she?

140
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,000
Let's say you keep up this fake dating act.

141
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,160
What if Editor Nam and your mother find out? Then what?

142
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,320
That's why I need to make sure no one else finds out.

143
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,560
- Just quit it. - No.

144
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,080
- Don't do it. - It's my choice!

145
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,560
You??

146
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,040
I'm going to tell on you.

147
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,800
I'm going to tell Mom everything, that you got a fake boyfriend to

148
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,440
cover up for some idol whom you're obsessed with!

149
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,760
Go try telling, and see what happens.

150
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,480
I will! I'm going to tell Mom,

151
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,000
and tell everybody at your work.

152
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,520
I'll tell them who you are and who you like so much.

153
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,240
Hey, Nam Eun-ki.

154
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,080
Sung Duk-mi's not really dating Lion!

155
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,560
Are you crazy? Huh?

156
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,880
Be quiet!

157
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,840
You're the one who's crazy.

158
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,880
If you were honest about it, it wouldn't have come to this.

159
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,040
Why'd you have to let this get so out of hand?

160
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,440
How long do you plan to lie about this anyway, huh?

161
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Hey.

162
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,240
It may just be a lie to you,

163
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,040
but to me, my life and my identity depend on this.

164
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,160
So butt out!

165
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,000
No.

166
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,160
I'm going to out you and set this all straight.

167
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,280
Where in the hell is that office of yours?

168
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,280
Hey!

169
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,360
- Hold on??- I told you to be quiet!

170
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,080
Hey. Hey, let go of me!

171
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,320
- Hold on??- Don't speak human?

172
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,120
Gold Lion!

173
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,120
Wait!

174
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,480
Director Nam.

175
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,880
Hello.

176
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,640
We see each other here quite often.

177
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,120
I'm guessing you're here to see Curator Sung?

178
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,840
Yes, I came to give her a piece of my mind.

179
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,840
What about?

180
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,480
It's nothing. She just doesn't get it, so??

181
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,480
Please excuse me, then.

182
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,240
Director Nam.

183
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,320
I'd like to take up judo.

184
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,360
You?

185
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,120
That's unexpected.

186
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,640
But alright.

187
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,480
Come visit my gym when you're free.

188
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,120
If you're not busy now,

189
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,440
let's go. Right now.

190
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,080
What, right now?

191
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,080
Alright, let's go.

192
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,040
(Choikang Judo Center)

193
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,800
The basics of judo.

194
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,120
Judo begins with and ends with etiquette and respect.

195
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,080
Sports without them cannot end with "-do".

196
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,600
Since this is your first day, let's start with falling.

197
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,040
Teach me some techniques, first.

198
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,160
Those aren't so easy for amateurs, though.

199
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,160
I'm quite athletic, actually.

200
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,760
Alright, fine.

201
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,320
Then let's start with a shoulder throw, since that's fairly easy.

202
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,120
Grab your opponent's right arm with your left hand,

203
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,080
and pull him toward you as you slide in your right arm.

204
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,800
Next, spin towards him and pull his right arm down.

205
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,120
As you do, straighten your knees

206
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,880
and your opponent should be off the floor.

207
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,160
And there it is.

208
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,080
Did you get that?

209
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,080
Yes.

210
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,080
Then go ahead.

211
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,240
Ah, you're left-handed.

212
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,320
You're a fast learner.

213
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,160
Am I?

214
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,080
Then should I try it again?

215
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,000
Sure, alright.

216
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,360
What's up with you?

217
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,760
So? Am I a student worth teaching?

218
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,320
Don't switch the topic and answer my question.

219
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,160
You've clearly done this for a couple of years,

220
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,800
so why did you pretend you're a novice?

221
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,920
Because this is the only way to throw down

222
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,240
an Olympian onto the mat?

223
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,960
So why on earth??

224
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,200
...are you so desperate to throw me down, huh?

225
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,600
Do you want me to answer you like this?

226
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,040
I don't really mind staying like this,

227
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,120
but I just might take a liking to you.

228
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,680
Talk.

229
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,560
I think I've earned the right to an explanation.

230
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,840
I didn't mean to, but I overheard you and Curator Sung.

231
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,960
If you were honest about it, it wouldn't have come to this.

232
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,040
Why'd you have to let this get so out of hand?

233
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,880
How long do you plan to lie about this anyway, huh?

234
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,800
It may just be a lie to you,

235
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,240
but to me, my life and my identity depend on this.

236
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,400
So butt out!

237
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,600
No.

238
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,240
I'm going to out you and set this all straight.

239
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,720
Where in the hell is that office of yours?

240
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,440
Hey. Hey! Let go of me!

241
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,160
As you know, Curator Sung is at a social disadvantage,

242
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,160
Especially in a conservative society like Korea's.

243
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,040
That's why I plan to support and protect Curator Sung

244
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:49,000
no matter what lies she tells to protect herself.

245
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,600
Because I want her to feel safe in my museum, at the very least.

246
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,240
So you, too, Director Nam??

247
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,000
I hope you won't do anything that defies her will.

248
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,520
What?

249
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,320
Don't tell her that you and I had this chat.

250
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,600
She might be distressed if she finds out that I know.

251
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,600
Then please excuse me.

252
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,640
Social??what?

253
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,920
Gold Lion. I mean, Director Gold!

254
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,240
What do you mean?

255
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,400
At a social disadvantage? Who is?

256
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,760
Director Gold!

257
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,000
At a social disadvantage?

258
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Ha! You've got to be kidding.

259
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,720
And what? Anything that defies her will?

260
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,400
This is just nonsense.

261
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,600
Soy!

262
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,920
Hello!

263
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,760
Hi, Gun-woo.

264
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,680
Well, off you go now. Get changed.

265
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,680
Good luck, Gun-woo!

266
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,160
- Hey, Sun-joo. - Yeah?

267
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,480
Is Duk-mi at a social disadvantage?

268
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,880
Did someone say she is? Who said that?

269
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,360
Apparently, Lion saw Duk-mi and me at the museum.

270
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,640
I told her that I'd out her.

271
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,880
What, out her?

272
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,560
You're crazy! You crazy bastard!

273
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,040
I already had enough from Duk-mi, thank you.

274
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,440
Hey, you should know that you're lucky to be alive.

275
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,640
I know.

276
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,400
He saw her beating me up,

277
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,240
and still says she's the one at a disadvantage.

278
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,680
Even after witnessing that?

279
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,440
Well, that's??

280
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,080
That's because he's never been beaten up by Duk-mi.

281
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,920
Right? Ha.

282
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,120
Then you tell him for me. I'm so pissed right now.

283
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,560
How is she disadvantaged in any way?

284
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,040
Excuse me!

285
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Don't you want this?

286
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,080
Huh?

287
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,320
Huh??

288
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
You're the guy from the hotel??

289
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,160
- Right? - Yes.

290
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,160
So that was you, Director Gold?

291
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:47,840
Yes!

292
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,880
Then why did you pretend you didn't know me?

293
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,720
Weren't you purposely pretending not to know me?

294
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,160
Why would I?

295
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,160
When thanks to you, Duk-mi and I had a blast in that suite.

296
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,160
You guys went to a suite without me?

297
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,520
You always leave me out of these kinds of things!

298
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,920
Why would I go with you, when I don't even go with my husband?

299
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,880
Because we're friends.

300
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,520
Are only the two of you friends? I'm your friend too, you know.

301
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,000
Be quiet, ugh!

302
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,400
Excuse me.

303
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,360
Curator Sung and you??

304
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,320
You're just friends?

305
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,080
Yes, we're friends.

306
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,120
No, what I mean is??

307
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,640
Friends, as in??

308
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,000
"just friends"?

309
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,120
Of course!

310
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,120
But why go to a hotel with a friend? And why??

311
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,400
It's obvious, they went on a "pilgrimage" or whatever, huh?

312
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,000
The trend these days is to stay in a local hotel

313
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,080
instead of going somewhere far for a vacation.

314
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,040
It's called a staycation.

315
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,160
We had so much fun.

316
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,240
But you said something about outing her.

317
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,560
Well, that's??Uh??

318
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,120
Your fake relationship!

319
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,640
You and Duk-mi are pretending to date, right?

320
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,040
You see, he's not so happy about that.

321
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,960
That's what you were trying to tell her, right?

322
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,080
Yes. I'm not so happy about that.

323
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,760
Oh??

324
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,040
Are you alright, Director?

325
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,640
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

326
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,560
I'm very sorry.

327
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,240
M...Misunderstanding?

328
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,160
What misunderstanding?

329
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,680
Why, that crazy bastard!

330
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,440
What? Misunderstanding?

331
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,600
What, me and her?

332
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,560
100% positive.

333
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,120
He got angry over the word "outing," right?

334
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,760
Then he said you're at a social disadvantage.

335
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,480
And "Just friends?" makes three.

336
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,360
What, pictures of you and me pretending to be a couple?

337
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,160
Yes.

338
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,360
What, she will?

339
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,600
Oh, so that's why.

340
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,080
It's understandable, you guys are always together.

341
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,440
But still??How could he take us for a couple?

342
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,480
Why? Is Sun-joo no good?

343
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,080
- What was that? - Hey!

344
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,120
But I thought Lion was interested in you.

345
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,480
I'm kind of disappointed to hear that's not the case.

346
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,680
He is interested in her, but in a different sense.

347
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,560
As in a general, human interest.

348
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,960
Shut up.

349
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,360
- You're disappointed too, right? - Disappointed?

350
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,720
- You were all here. - Hi, Seung-min.

351
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,000
- Hello. - Hi.

352
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,480
Well, it's not just for one or two days.

353
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,720
Where's Gun-woo?

354
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,920
He fell asleep at Mom's, so I told her to let him stay tonight.

355
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,360
You want something to drink?

356
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,280
- I'll??- Seung-min, how about a beer?

357
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,080
Beer sounds good. Thank you!

358
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,360
Duk-mi, are you okay now?

359
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,080
I heard you were attacked by Cha Si-an's fans.

360
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,360
Oh, it's all been taken care of.

361
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,880
I'm relieved to hear that.

362
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,040
So??How was it taken care of?

363
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,120
Why do you ask?

364
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,040
Why shouldn't I? She's your friend.

365
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,080
Seung-min, please don't bring up the fan stuff anymore.

366
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,120
I'm really sick of it.

367
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,360
Are you?

368
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,040
Then should we talk about something else?

369
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,840
What should we talk about?

370
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,120
You need to drive.

371
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,720
What gives?

372
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,160
That woman there??

373
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,840
She's my girlfriend.

374
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,280
She's my girlfriend, you hear me?

375
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,800
I'll do it.

376
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
Do what?

377
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,240
Act as your boyfriend.

378
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,240
What?

379
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,120
Have me, for a little bit.

380
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,840
- Who's there? - Delivery.

381
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,200
You have the wrong address. I never ordered??

382
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,440
Brother! I ordered it.

383
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,560
Just the payment??

384
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,800
Dig in.

385
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,000
I'm repaying you for letting me stay the night

386
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,680
and keeping it all a secret.

387
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,680
So this is how you repay your debts.

388
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,600
By using my credit card to pay for the delivery,

389
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,160
and polluting my house with the smell of this food.

390
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,960
Come on, why wouldn't I want to pay with my card

391
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,000
and treat you to this?

392
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,040
It's just that I'm supposed to be on a strict diet.

393
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,880
If my agency catches me for ordering something like this,

394
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,800
my workouts will double and my diet will be twice as restrictive.

395
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,680
They're really anal about this.

396
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,080
And then they ask me to hurry up with the new song.

397
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,280
When I have neither time nor the energy.

398
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,840
Is that why you pretended you broke your arm?

399
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,160
So you could focus on your music?

400
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,360
Director.

401
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,840
I'll participate in the celebrity exhibition.

402
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,520
But in return, shhh.

403
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,560
Deal?

404
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,240
Deal.

405
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,280
What is it?

406
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,240
I worked out a bit today.

407
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,400
Oh, sore muscles?

408
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,840
I'm a pro at dealing with those.

409
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,920
Take your thumb, and place it here at the back of your neck.

410
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,760
Then massage gently, in a clockwise motion.

411
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,760
Like this.

412
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,400
That's right.

413
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,560
Feels good, right?

414
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,360
Where did you pick this up?

415
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,480
I had to live with sore muscles when I was a trainee.

416
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,840
In fact, every one of us in the group did.

417
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,000
But we didn't have the money for massages,

418
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,040
so I just learned from reading online.

419
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,520
Your job is pretty tough, huh.

420
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,920
Is there any job that isn't?

421
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:22,040
But office dating might change that a little.

422
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,040
You saw?

423
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,480
I saw it on T.R.T.S.'s homepage.

424
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,080
That picture of you and that Curator Sung.

425
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,760
But T.R.T.S. isn't one to take those kinds of photos.

426
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,120
It's strange.

427
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,560
I'm sure I never sent that photo.

428
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,880
(Date Photos)

429
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,600
Dear Ms. 'The Road to Si-an.'

430
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,920
I've attached the photos we took using the concept you suggested.

431
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,280
(Are you sure you want to delete?)

432
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,360
(Delete)

433
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,080
Thank you once again for accepting my request,

434
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,280
I understand it may have been a difficult decision.

435
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,960
Director, was this allowed during working hours, then?

436
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,360
The meeting for the special exhibition is at 11 a.m. tomorrow.

437
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,320
Let's just do this right.

438
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,560
Then let's make sure we have as many witnesses as possible.

439
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,160
I can't believe he did all that because of his misunderstanding.

440
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,880
Why can't I ever distinguish kindness from interest?

441
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,760
Interest, my ass.

442
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,160
Shall I see what the other fans are talking about, then?

443
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,680
CU-patch?

444
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,040
What is CU-patch?

445
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,200
"CU-patch: Tracking the truth behind R & S' relationship.

446
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,920
Are they truly lovers?"

447
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,160
CU?

448
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,840
CU, C??

449
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,000
Cheum?

450
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,760
CU's R is??

451
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,000
Ryan.

452
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,080
Then S must stand for Sung Duk??

453
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,120
Ha! That Sindy.

454
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,440
Is she out of her mind?

455
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,160
No wonder I had a bad feeling about this.

456
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,160
What's she planning to do with this CU-patch, anyway?

457
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,360
Tracking down the truth??

458
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,120
Lion will continue to help me out, right?

459
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,480
What.

460
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,520
What is it?

461
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,280
I lost more followers, again!

462
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,320
Oh no, that's terrible.

463
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,080
This is all because of that T.R.T.S.

464
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,040
Sindy's nothing but a pretentious liar.

465
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,160
She said that jacket's the only one in Korea!

466
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,280
T.R.T.S. is cleaning up Sindy's mess, isn't she?

467
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,640
Ugh!

468
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,040
I was totally onto something! Why mess things up for me?

469
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,840
Hyo-jin!

470
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,160
Hyo-jin!

471
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,240
Shhh! It's a secret!

472
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,600
Let's go!

473
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,440
Kim Hyo-jin, intern at Cheum Museum of Art.

474
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,880
Yes?

475
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,720
Hyo-jin?

476
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,560
You didn't forget the promise that you'd quit following idols around

477
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,040
if I let you work at the museum, right?

478
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,960
Of course not.

479
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,240
I'll believe you. I trust you.

480
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,840
And what's the most important thing?

481
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,960
It's a secret that I'm your daughter.

482
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,160
Exactly!

483
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,000
I don't want people to say that

484
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,400
I pulled strings for my daughter

485
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,800
right after stepping down.

486
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,360
You know what I mean, right?

487
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,440
Yes.

488
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,880
- Curator Yoo! - Good morning!

489
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,040
- Hello. - Hey.

490
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,680
Um, isn't that the OG crazy with the intern?

491
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,120
You're right. How'd they come together?

492
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,000
Hyo-jin!

493
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,760
It's a secret that you're my daughter!

494
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,760
Yes.

495
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,280
No telling anyone you're Eom So-hye's daughter!

496
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,280
Sure.

497
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,880
She's actually the master, and not an intern?

498
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,960
Wow??

499
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,040
Sindy??

500
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,400
I'll let you off this once.

501
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,960
- Hello. - Good morning.

502
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,040
Good morning.

503
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,000
Here you are.

504
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,960
Curator Sung, are you going somewhere today?

505
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,960
I'm here to work.

506
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,160
Thank you.

507
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,320
Are you sure you're here just to work?

508
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,480
You're totally dressed for a date!

509
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,480
Well, you can say I'm doing both.

510
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,120
You're really open about this after dropping the bomb on us.

511
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,960
Please.

512
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,720
How should I return your notebook, T.R.T.S.?

513
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,040
Director.

514
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,760
Director, you should go somewhere nice today.

515
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,080
Curator Sung looks too great to just go home??

516
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,480
Let's start the meeting.

517
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,800
We've already reached out to many famous names in

518
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,880
various fields including writers, musicians, actors, and athletes.

519
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,040
If you look there,

520
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,040
I've included a list of those who've shown a positive response

521
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,960
along with their collections.

522
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,720
Now, for those who've confirmed their participation,

523
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,800
there's White Ocean's Cha Si-an??

524
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,000
Is he embarrassed about that misunderstanding?

525
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,120
What are your thoughts, Curator Sung?

526
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,800
Pardon?

527
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,880
Were you not paying attention?

528
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,640
Oh, I'm sorry.

529
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:47,080
Most of the works owned by our celebs are paintings,

530
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,000
which means there's not much variety.

531
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,440
But there's not enough space for installation art, either.

532
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,880
(Participation Confirmed: Roh Seok)

533
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,640
(Undisclosed work by photographer Yoon Tae-hwa)

534
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,600
(About the Collection: Yoon Tae-hwa)

535

(Auctioned off at a record price to a collector by the name)

536
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,200
('MANY PEOPLE")

537
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,000
What about the works by the late photographer Yoon Tae-hwa

538
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,800
that are owned by Roh Seok and have never been revealed to the public?

539
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,760
Well, other museums have contacted him to see if

540
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,560
he would be interested in showing them to the public,

541
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,600
but every time the author's strictly declined.

542
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,720
I'm a fan of that last work by photographer Yoon Tae-hwa

543
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,160
and so I'd like to see the unpublished works myself,

544
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,560
but it won't be easy.

545
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,560
I'm sure it'll be as meaningful as it is difficult.

546
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,840
Let me visit him in person. What is his address?

547
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,000
He's in Gangwon-do.

548
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,840
Gangwon-do??

549
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,040
Then today's no good.

550
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,600
I'll visit him on our museum's day off next week.

551
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,040
Give me the address.

552
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,520
You're going on your own?

553
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,560
I'll go on my own, yes.

554
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,680
That ends our meeting.

555
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,200
Thank you, everyone.

556
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,280
What, I never asked him to misunderstand us.

557
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,520
He's the one who misunderstood us, so why's he doing this to me?

558
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,920
I mean, I understand he's embarrassed about it.

559
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,160
It was Lion who suggested this whole fake dating thing,

560
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,160
and it was he who accepted Sindy as an intern!

561
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,920
As a grown-up, he should take responsibility for

562
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,000
his actions, shouldn't he?

563
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,040
Well said, Duk-mi!

564
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,400
But why tell me this, and not to Lion?

565
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,120
It's written on Lion's face.

566
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,400
"Don't cross over the fence."

567
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,160
"I'm a dangerous beast."

568
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,240
Duk-mi.

569
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,120
What's really putting you in danger isn't Lion.

570
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,600
It's our main profession.

571
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,600
Main profession?

572
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,160
I feel like we're losing to Sindy these days.

573
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,160
What is this?

574
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,760
Wow!

575
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,680
We can't beat Sindy with stamina alone.

576
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,000
So we'll have to compensate with gadgets.

577
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,480
Sun-joo!

578
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,000
- I'm totally awesome, right? - Yes.

579
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Don't. I don't want any more misunderstandings.

580
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,800
Anyway, take a look.

581
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,320
Hey, this will be really easy to carry around.

582
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,800
- It's not bad, huh? - No!

Choi Da-in??

587
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,920
Do you have photographer Yoon Tae-hwa's

588
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,080
last photograph?

589
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,200
Ugh, who's this?

00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,760

591

Ryan?

592
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,080
Do you know what those unrevealed works by Yoon Tae-hwa are?

593
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,280
You go to Korea without a word,

594
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,040
don't take my calls and don't read my emails,

595
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,160
and that's the first thing you have to say

596
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,360
after finally calling me?

597
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,360
I'm busy, so answer me first.

598
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,080
What are those photos by Yoon Tae-hwa??

599
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,480
You answer me first.

600
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,160
Do you miss me or not?

601
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,320
Do you miss me or not?

602
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,760
I??

603
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,520
I'm hanging up.

604
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,000
There were many rumors surrounding those works.

605
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,120
Since he  mostly took photos of landscapes,

606
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,880
many assumed they were of a place that was never done before.

607
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,840
Or since the last picture that was revealed was of himself,

608
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,080
there were rumors that there may be more like that.

609
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,240
Anyway, I was curious to know

610
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,160
so I contacted the author who owns the piece.

611
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,320
But it was no use, despite all the offers I made.

612
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,880
Alright.

613
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,560
Ryan.

614
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,040
You clearly told me you missed me, alright?

615
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,200
Just what is she thinking?

616
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,480
(CU-patch)

617
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,640
Director, you should go somewhere nice today.

618
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,520
Curator Sung looks too great to just go home??

619
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,680
Let's start the meeting.

620
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,560
S = all dressed up.

621
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,760
R = no interest at all.

622
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,680
Are they separating their work and love lives?

623
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,840
Or??

624
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,600
(Suspicion Meter: Two)

625
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,120
When do you think those two started dating?

626
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,080
I'm really curious about that, too.

627
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,960
I mean, they first met when Director Gold was appointed.

628
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,000
Weren't they on somewhat bad terms back then?

629
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,320
Just somewhat?

630
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,840
Director Gold even fired Curator Sung!

631
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,720
That's what I'm saying.

632
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,040
Is that how they fell for each other?

633
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,800
"You're the first guy who's ever fired me."

634
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,000
That sort of thing.

635
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,160
Come on!

636
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,960
R had been fired by S.

637
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,160
Is she a sucker for that kind of scenario?

638
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,720
Or??

(Suspicion Meter: Three)

640
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,440
R gets off from work at 21:13, alone.

641
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,920
R arrives home at 22:07, alone.

642
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,960
S doesn't have a date, either.

643
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,000
Do they have a platonic love?

644
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,040
Or??

646
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,120
Something's not right.

647
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,000
I'm going to reveal it, no matter what.

648
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,120
Hello?

649
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,840
Did you see it? CU-patch?

650
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,760
Sindy's finally uploaded her first post.

651
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,600
Hold on.

652
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,120

(Suspicion Meter: Four)

654
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,000
Hey, wouldn't you say Sindy's obsessed at this point?

655
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,920
What do I do?

656
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,600
Do I need to go on another fake date?

657
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,080
Duk-mi, instead of a hundred photos of you on a date,

658
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,160
wouldn't one punch work better?

659
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,560
One punch? What do you mean?

660
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,760
Not one punch, one room.

661
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,800
You spend one night together.

662
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,800
Throw her a bone that'll stir up her imagination.

663
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,960
Oh, so that's what you mean.

664
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,200
But how do I go about that?

665
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,120
He's really going alone.

666
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,680
I knew he would.

667
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,200
Oh what?

668
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,080
Honey, the door!

669
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,280
I thought I made it clear I was going by myself.

670
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,200
Well??Mr. Roh is pretty shy, so??

671
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,320
I'm sure it'll be fine.

672
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,000
You may be, but what about Mr. Roh?

673
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,160
You're going there to ask a favor,

674
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,120
so shouldn't you try and be considerate?

675
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,400
Gosh, it's hot.

676
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,960
What would he have done without me, huh?

677
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,040
It's no use. Let's leave it to the insurance company.

678
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,120
Yes, I think that's a good idea.

679
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,000
Thank you for trying.

680
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,760
No, it's my fault for not having a driver's license at this age.

681
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,520
It'll take some time since we're in the mountains.

682
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,440
Mr. Roh will be waiting for us, so let's walk.

683
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,240
Alright.

684
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,600
I'm alright.

685
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,640
Keep it on.

686
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,920
M??r. Roh.

687
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,080
Are you there?

688
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,360
Mr. Roh? Mr. Roh?

689
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,120
Do you know what time it is?

690
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,600
I mean??

691
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,120
I never asked you to come,

692
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,000
so if you're going to be late, at least give me a??

693
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,040
It??It's nice to??meet you.

694
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,320
I'm Cheum Museum of Art's??

695
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,720
You'll freeze to death before you're done.

696
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,120
Come on in.

697
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,440
Thank you.

698
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,400
We're sorry, Mr. Roh.

699
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,240
Really though, what did you come all this way for?

700
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,960
I told you several times that I'd never disclose that picture.

701
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,480
Here, chang into these.

702
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,240
You'll be going home empty-handed anyway,

703
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,640
so don't fall ill, at least.

704
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,040
Mr. Roh.

705
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:01,120
Please at least hear our proposal first??

706
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,760
The bathroom's that way.

707
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,880
Mr. Roh??

708
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,000
Curator Sung, is something wrong?

709
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,040
Oh no, I'm fine.

710
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,160
Uh??Can I help with anything?

711
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,880
Yes.

712
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,080
I'm going in.

713
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,800
My hair got caught in the scarf.

714
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,200
It's caught around the button??

715
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,880
Thank you, for taking it off??

716
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,040
Th.. The scarf.

717
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:54,000
It looks like Mr. Roh won't change his mind, doesn't it?

718
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,200
Yeah, it seems that way.

719
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,440
But let's try asking him again.

720
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,440
Yes.

721
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,520
I'll leave you to get changed.

722
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,080
Isn't it Duk-mi's day off?

723
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,160
Tell her to come for dinner.

724
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,800
Duk-mi's on a business trip.

725
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,640
Business trip? With who?

726
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,320
To where? For how long?

727
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,400
I don't know.

728
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,120
Mom, call Duk-mi.

729
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,600
Why call her? She's working.

730
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,760
You're so cool about these kinds of things.

731
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,400
You were like that when Duk-mi moved out, too.

732
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,640
Don't you know that the dream girlfriend for the guys

733
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,000
these days is a girl who lives on her own?

734
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,680
Yes, I heard it on the news.

735
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,880
Kids these days have no money, so they date at home

736
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,560
and go Dutch on everything.

737
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,240
Holy crap!

738
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:55,960
Those bastards are no good!

739
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,120
Jeez, you scared me.

740
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,840
Bastards who make their women pay are no good!

741
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,240
You should warn us before you talk.

742
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,400
Gosh, you scared me.

743
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,640
So you're saying men without money shouldn't date?

744
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,280
Well, not in my book.

745
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,080
So you went all out for Mom before you got married?

746
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,120
Don't get me started.

747
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,840
On every date, he'd shower me with flowers and gifts.

748
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,840
I thought, "This is what it means to be treated like a princess."

749
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,920
Wow, you're the man!

750
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,040
Who knew I'd end up like this, though.

751
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,600
Even boyfriends who treat you well

752
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,560
make for husbands who give you a hard time.

753
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,120
Boyfriends who give you a hard time?

754
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:46,120
It's obvious.

755
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,120
And it's the same with women!

756
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,080
So cut her off if you see any red flags!

757
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,080
Yes, Mom.

758
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:09,160
I know you've already declined our offer,

759
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,800
but we came here today to ask you once more.

760
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,160
Please give us your permission to exhibit the unrevealed works

761
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,680
of the late photographer Yoon Tae-hwa

762
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:20,920
at Cheum's special exhibition to celebrate its 5th anniversary.

763
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,560
Um??Mr. Roh.

764
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,520
I heard you were very close to the late photographer.

765
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,720
So much so that he entrusted those works to you.

766
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:37,000
Was there a special reason why he did that?

767
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,320
Tae-hwa and I first met back in middle school.

768
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,000
It was around then that Tae-hwa took up photography,

769
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,880
and me, writing, though you couldn't call it writing.

770
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:53,360
From his first photo to the last,

771
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,880
there isn't a single one which I haven't seen.

772
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,120
And it went both ways.

773
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,040
There you had two sensitive, so-called artists

774
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:05,040
who watched each other for 30 years at their work.

775
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,120
That's what we had between us, Tae-hwa and I.

776
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,280
The reason he probably entrusted those photos to me,

777
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,400
and not to his family, was probably because??

778
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,640
They were??

779
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,640
They were no good.

780
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,680
He probably wanted to say,

781
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,920
"Never show them to anyone else,

782
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,000
no matter what."

783
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
But Mr. Roh, that's??

784
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I won't show them to the public.

785
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,600
Nothing you say will change my mind.

786
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,720
But since you've come all this way,

787
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,760
stay the night and get some rest.

788
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:44,720
Please excuse me.

789
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,600
You're cold aren't you, Director?

790
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,120
Come this way. I'll swap with you.

791
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,120
That's quite alright.

792
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,160
It'll get colder at dawn. So come this way.

793
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,400
Curator Sung.

794
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,640
I'm really fine.

795
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,040
Director.

796
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,080
Yes?

797
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:44,040
I know you misunderstood my relationship with Sun-joo,

798
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:48,320
and that you offered to be my fake boyfriend

799
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,120
in case I was outed by Cha Si-an's fans.

800
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,480
It wasn't out of pity.

801
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,960
Besides, that's not something to pity anyone for.

802
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,160
Whatever the reason, thank you.

803
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,280
I'm much more grateful than you think.

804
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,760
Curator Sung.

805
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:16,800
Yes?

806
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,080
May I ask you something?

807
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:20,880
Sure.

808
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,600
Do you like taking photos? Of people?

809
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,560
Oh!

810
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,920
You're asking because of this, right?

811
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,720
So you remember me saying that I like this photo.

812
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,560
Sure.

813
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,360
It left a deep impression on me.

814
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,680
He took photos of landscapes his whole life,

815
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,920
but his last was a picture of himself.

816
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,040
He died from an illness,

817
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,000
so wouldn't it have been his way of saying goodbye?

818
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,480
Even the title's "Goodbye."

819
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:06,080
Mr. Yoon titled the photo "Anyeong" in Korean.

820
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,280
He never personally translated it to English.

821
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,120
I think that title is a mistranslation.

822
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,160
In fact, I'm sure of it.

823
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,000
Based on what?

824
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,560
Look here.

825
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,040
If "Anyeong" really meant goodbye here,

826
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,240
and he was bidding himself farewell,

827
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,240
he would've stared at the lens.

828
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:35,200
Because to a photographer, the camera is an extension of himself.

829
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,680
And if??

830
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,520
If this were a farewell to the world he'd been living in,

831
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:47,960
then he would've been staring into the distance.

832
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:51,200
Or maybe captured himself from a side angle.

833
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:55,280
So what if "Anyeong" wasn't a goodbye, but rather a hello

834
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,600
to the world where he's about to go for the first time?

835
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,800
I've considered that possibility, too.

836
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,040
But if that were the case,

837
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,160
he'd be looking up a bit more, towards the sky.

838
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,920
Then what's your hypothesis?

839
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,480
There's someone behind the camera.

840
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,600
These eyes??

841
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,080
They're not speaking of sadness before a farewell,

842
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,520
or of enlightenment before death.

843
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,400
He's staring at the person he loves.

844
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,520
That's what he wanted to leave behind:

845
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,960
this gaze directed towards that person.

846
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,600
It's his greeting to that person.

847
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,920
"Hello, I'm still here."

848
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,640
"I'm always here, looking at you."

849
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,760
"Goodbye."

850
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,840
Hello.

851
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,000
But that's just my hypothesis.

852
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,920
- You should get some sleep. - Right.

853
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:38,760
Mr. Roh, we'll be on our way.

854
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,120
We rested well, thanks to you. Thank you.

855
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,080
It's been a long time for me as well.

856
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:11,080
Mr. Roh, is this??

857
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,560
My father was a soldier.

858
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,160
He was always ashamed of his only son,

859
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:20,040
who wasn't a bit like him.

860
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,320
So ashamed of him that when his son said he'd become a writer,

861
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,800
he didn't talk to him for several years.

862
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:29,080
That's why I couldn't accept it.

863
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
I couldn't admit that I knew

864
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,560
Tae-hwa's feelings.

865
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,160
These photos??

866
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:45,880
They were love letters from Mr. Yoon.

867
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,240
Addressed to you.

868
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:50,000
That's why I couldn't show them to the public.

869
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,080
It's a secret I wanted to hide until the day I died.

870
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:58,160
Not because I detested how he felt about me,

871
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:02,000
but because I was ashamed of myself,

872
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,640
a coward who avoided his feelings

873
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,000
until the very end.

874
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:10,240
And now, with Tae-hwa gone??

875
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,040
How could I reveal these photos?

876
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,320
When it's already too late.

877
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:25,400
Did you really avoid his feelings?

878
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:29,080
Because this isn't the face of someone who did.

879
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:35,000
You may not have known your own feelings, Mr. Roh,

880
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,720
but I'm sure Mr. Yoon did.

881
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:41,120
How could a photographer not know,

882
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:44,120
when this is the gaze he saw through the lens?

883
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,200
I'm sure he knew.

884
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,000
Do you think so?

885
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:03,720
Do you think he knew?

886
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,520
Thanks for coming.

887
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,200
I didn't mean this to make this an overnight trip.

888
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,080
It was nice spending the night with you.

889
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:14,920
What?

890
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,320
Uh, no. That's not what I meant.

891
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:20,040
It's because of Ms. Kim Hyo-jin.

892
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:22,720
See, she made this "Cheum-patch" page.

893
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,560
"Cheum-patch"?

894
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:27,320
Yes. She's suspicious of the relationship between you and me,

895
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,160
so she's keeping an eye on us.

896
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,360
To be honest, that's why I tried even harder to show everyone

897
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:32,800
that we're "dating."

898
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:36,520
I see.

899
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:39,040
Then let's really make Ms. Kim fall for it.

900
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:12,920
Is that everything?

901
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:43,320
(There are new posts on the New Members' Greetings board)

902

New members?

903
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,520
Should I go say hello, then?

So that was all one person?

923
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:38,040
Test?

924
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:40,120
What am I looking at right now?

925
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:41,920
A foreshadowing of a mystery love affair?

926
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:44,040
I found one more piece by Lee Sol.

927
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:46,880
How do you know? Nothing's known about Lee Sol.

928
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,600
I missed you, Ryan.

929
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,560
I can be a little greedy, can't I?

930

932
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:56,200
Are you mistaking this for the real thing, perhaps?

933
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,120
What if he's disappointed in me?

934
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,680
You really like him, don't you?
