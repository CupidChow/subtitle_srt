3
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,520
No, let's not interrupt them.

4
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,160
I'm sure he'll call.

5
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,120
Director, did you see her?

6
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,600
Are you alright?

7
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,040
I told you to go to bed.

8
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,040
It's late, why aren't you sleeping?

9
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,840
I always go to bed late.

10
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,840
I'm a night owl, it's my nickname.

11
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,520
We promised not to deceive each other anymore.

12
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,000
Are you sure it's the truth?

13
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's totally the truth.

14
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,120
I called to say goodnight, in case you were still up, waiting.

15
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Director?

16
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,720
Are you alright? Where are you?

17
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,040
It's late.

18
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,840
I shouldn't have called you.

19
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,000
Sleep tight.

20
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,080
Director.

21
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,160
Director?

22
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,120
Duk-mi??

23
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,560
Did you think I wouldn't worry if you hung up like that?

24
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,920
You have to cry in front of me so that I can comfort you.

25
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,360
Why are you here alone, like a fool?

26
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,000
I want to be there for you. I hate you!

27
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,520
Don't force a smile when you're about to cry.

28
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,640
I want to cry.

29
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,280
You hit me so hard just now.

30
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,200
Director, are you asleep?

31
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,160
Yes.

32
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,120
Shall we go home?

33
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,880
I don't think I'll be able to fall asleep if I go home.

34
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,400
I'm in a weird mood.

35
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,520
Why?

36
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,080
When I think about how the person I've been curious about

37
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,080
all my life is asleep just a floor below me??

38
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,080
It feels strange.

39
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,640
Then you should've come to my place.

40
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,480
By the way, how did you know I was here?

41
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,080
Didn't you know?

42
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,520
I planted a GPS tracking device on your body.

43
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:18,080
Have I ever told you about my parents - my adopted parents?

44
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,200
I haven't, have I?

45
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,120
They were good people.

46
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,120
They adopted a 7-year-old boy and raised him so he lacked nothing.

47
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,080
My parents said to me once,

48
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,160
"The reason your mother gave birth to you

49
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,160
and raised you is that she loved you.

50
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,000
But circumstances beyond her control led us to meeting you.

51
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,520
So you're not an abandoned child,

52
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,920
but rather a protected child."

53
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,120
But that person I met today, she??

54
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,880
She says she's sorry.

55
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,320
So I??

56
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,600
I feel as if I've gone back to being an abandoned child,

57
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,400
and not a protected child.

58
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,040
I'm sure

59
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,040
those words were there in her heart all her life.

60
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,160
"I'm sorry I couldn't be with you as much as I love you."

61
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,680
Do you really think so?

62
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,680
Try get some sleep for now.

63
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm sure you'll feel better when you wake up.

Secretary Kim?

66
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,280
That's my Hyo-jin taking the bus, right?

67
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,800
Yes.

68
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,680
I think she learned how to BCR.

69
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,440
"BCR?"

70
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,960
What is that, an insect?

71
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,640
Bus. Card. Recharge.

72
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,080
I thought she'd come crying to me,

73
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,720
but instead, she learned how to BCR?

74
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,440
What do you think?

75
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,320
I asked, what are your thoughts?

76
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,480
This stop is??

77
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,880
Oh my God.

78
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,280
Did you sleep well?

79
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,440
Did you sleep well?

80
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,200
- Hey. - Director! Curator Sung!

81
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,600
- Good morning. - Good morning.

82
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,720
Isn't this what "privatizing" the museum really means?

83
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,360
You're all here early.

84
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,160
- We're on time??- Right?

85
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,240
Oh, I don't think we need to replace the sofa yet.

86
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,880
It's still comfortable.

87
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,800
- Have some common sense! - Why did you do that?

88
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,440
Here, take one.

89
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,000
If our eyes have to suffer, we should take care of our stomachs.

90
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,480
Is it good?

91
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,560
Two iced americanos!

92
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,760
- Can I have a straw? - Oh, that's right.

93
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,880
- Here you are. Enjoy. - Thank you.

94
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,000
- How much is this? - That's 80 cents.

95
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,080
I'm ready to take your order.

96
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,480
- Two iced lattes. - Two iced lattes.

97
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,320
Your card. Do you need a receipt?

98
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,240
It's fine.

99
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,680
- So Sun-joo fixed your guitar??- Yes.

100
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,080
- She went to your show??- Yes.

101
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,040
And even launched a fan club?

102
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,040
Yes.

103
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,200
So you're saying that Sun-joo likes??

104
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,280
Hey! Kang Seung-min.

105
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,680
What are you asking him?

106
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,760
- Well, I was just??- Whatever.

107
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,840
What did he ask you?

108
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,440
Well, he was asking whether you like me.

109
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,000
Now you're suspicious of me?

110
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Not suspicious??

111
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,800
But isn't it true that you like me?

112
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,600
What I like is the music.

113
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,000
The music that you do!

114
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,880
See, I'm right! She likes me.

115
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,280
You're right.

116
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,120
"You're right?" What are you saying is right?

117
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,920
Kang Seung-min, don't tell me??

118

(Producer Yoo Jong-hyuk)

119
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,080
- What's this? - A friend of mine's a producer.

120
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,040
He mentioned he was looking for band members.

121
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,360
I thought I'd introduce Ju Hyuk to him.

122
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,400
Really?

123
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,320
Why would you??

124
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,880
Because you like Ju Hyuk.

125
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,440
As a fan.

126
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,360
I thought that if things worked out for Ju Hyuk,

127
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,880
you'd have more to smile about.

128
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,640
Sun-joo.

129
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,120
I??

130
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,040
I'm happiest when you smile.

131
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,040
But all this time, I'd forgotten that.

132
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,720
But you know what?

134
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm only going to do things that make you smile!

135
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,040
I won't think about anything but making you smile,

136
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,000
not even promotions or variety. So what I mean is??

137
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,440
But Ms. Lee said she didn't want me to become too famous.

138
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,160
She said she wants to be the only one who knows our band.

139
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,320
- Should I butt out? - You should've done so already.

140
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,120
Sun-joo.

141
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,480
- Oppa. - Yeah?

142
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,320
I'm not saying I forgive you.

143
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,160
I'm only giving you another chance.

144
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,720
Okay, that's fine.

145
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,120
Honey!

146
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,440
Let go of me!

147
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,240
I said I'm only giving you another chance.

148
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,160

Hello?

151
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,640
At first, I thought you'd heard the rumors somewhere.

152
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,800
I even suspected you simply to be after a scoop.

153
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,920
But for some strange reason, I felt an attraction.

154
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,600
The more I got to know you, the more comfortable

155
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,360
it became to be around you, and I wanted to get closer to you.

156
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,600
I seemed like fate that we both like Lee Sol's art

157
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,000
and that we live on adjacent floors.

158
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,480
It turns out I was right,

159
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,120
Brother.

160

Mr. Cha Si-an.

161
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,360
I'll send you Mom's number.

162
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,440
Please give her a chance to talk to you.

163
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,080
Whether it's an apology or an excuse,

164
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,080
please give her a chance to talk to you.

165
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,920
Just once.

166
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,720
Curator Sung,

167
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,200
we need a final confirmation on the brochure design by next week

00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,160
in order to meet the deadlines for the printing.

169
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,600
How should we introduce Lee Sol's works?

170
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,480
You haven't been contacted either have you, Curator Yoo?

171
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,480
I pulled all the strings I could, but wow. Nothing!

172
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,080
When is our absolute final deadline?

173
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,640
Next Wednesday.

174
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,880
Then should we look a little more?

175
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,800
Yes, I'd like to see the complete series myself.

176
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,120
Okay.

177
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,680
(If you know of or possess art in a similar style??

178
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,760
(0 comments)

179
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,000
(I'm contacting you about the art of artist Lee Sol)

180
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,560
Hello? Hi, this is Sung Duk-mi from Cheum Art Gallery.

181
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,240
Right, thanks for your email.

182
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,880
We're interested in Lee Sol's Soap Bubble series

183
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,040
that was sold in the previous auction.

184
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,720
Oh, from the seller?

185
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,080
Yes, two more pieces from the series.

186
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,320
So they're going to place them for sale at the next auction?

187
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,600
- Two more pieces? - Then how many's that in total?

188
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,520
Eight.

189
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,600
Actually, I was hoping maybe you could offer sort of a

190
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,920
private sale for us?

191
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,120
We'll, of course, pay extra to show our appreciation.

192
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,280
Yes, sure. Please let us know.

193
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,360
Thank you very much, bye!

194
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,200
How did it go?

195
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,960
The collector who put a piece up for sale last time

196
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,360
found two more pieces.

197
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,120
They're going to consider offering it to us first.

198
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,840
Yay, that's great!

199
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,920
That means there's just one left to go, right?

200
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,720
Yes!

201
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,320
They're going to send me the files now.

202
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,360
- Okay, okay, okay! - We're almost there!

203
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,360
Knock-knock.

204
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,600
Why bother with the "knock-knock" when you already let yourself in?

205
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,200
I have some good news.

206
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,560
We found two more of Lee Sol's works.

207
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,920
I see.

208
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,880
Director.

209
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,400
You know what "I Spy" is, right?

210
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,440
Do you want to try it?

211
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,720
What?

212
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,720
Come with me.

213
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,640
When you watch a movie, for example,

214
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,040
the director often places a secret message, like an Easter egg.

215
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,040
And it turns out it's the same with this series, too.

216
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,440
Have a look.

217
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,680
Did you find something?

218
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,560
This is??

219
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,800
Soap bubbles, rocking horse, ferris wheel, pirate ship??

220
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,680
They're all things that a child might like.

221
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,560
I think I know what feeling she put into these paintings.

222
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,040
You see it too, right?

223
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,440
Why don't you go home early today?

224
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,440
I believe there's someone you need to see.

225
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,160
I'm sure she's waiting for you.

226
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,920
Cheum Museum of Art, did he say?

227
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,040
Hello?

228
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,880
Hello?

229
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,280
This is... Ryan Gold.

230
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,040
Yes...

231
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,240
I'd like to have a talk.

232
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,320
Can you set aside some time for me?

233
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,080
Would you like some tea?

234
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,080
Um, I don't have coffee??

235
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,080
Tea is fine.

236
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,160
I can't drink coffee.

237
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,320
Thank you for calling me first.

238
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,920
I missed you.

239
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,160
I know I have no right to miss you

240
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,320
and that I'm shameless to say it, but??

241
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,280
If I have to be shameless to see you,

242
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,040
then I'm going to be shameless.

243
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,160
I missed you, Yun-je.

244
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,320
I??

245
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,160
I have no memories of you.

246
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,160
All that's in my memory is

247
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,400
just your backside.

248
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,120
You painting, with your back turned against me.

249
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,320
You letting go of my hand, and turning your back to me.

250
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,160
Why did you abandon me?

251
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,680
I'm sorry.

252
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,080
Why did you abandon me?

253
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,040
I didn't abandon you.

254
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,880
I thought??I thought it wouldn't take that long.

255
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,880
I was going to go back to you soon,

256
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,040
but who knew 26 years would pass like this?

257
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,160
That day??

258
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,320
I shouldn't have gone there, that day.

259
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,440
I was a a struggling artist and when I suddenly got an offer,

260
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,080
I thought to myself, "Once I get the money,

261
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,280
I'll take Yun-je out somewhere nice tomorrow,

262
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,120
and also take him to the theme park that

263
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,000
he's always talking  about."

264
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
So I headed out with you.

265
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,600
Yun-je, stay here and play for a bit.

266
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,000
I'll be right back.

267
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,920
Where are you going, Mommy?

268
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,080
Someone said they'll help me paint,

269
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,040
so I have to meet them.

270
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,960
I hear they're a bit scary, though.

271
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,280
Do you still want to come with me?

272
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,000
Then play at the playground for a while.

273
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,880
Mommy will be right back.

274
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,160
Mommy, you'll be back soon, right?

275
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,960
Of course, I'll be back real soon.

276
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,000
But the thought that I'd never see you again??

277
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,000
genuinely??

278
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,160
genuinely never occurred to me.

279
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,800
That day, on my way back to you,

280
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,680
there was an accident.

281
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,600
Oh no??What do we do?

282
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,120
Are you alright?

283
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,520
It was quite a serious accident.

284
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,440
My Yun-je??Please??

285
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,280
Then because of that accident??

286
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,680
I lost everything because of that accident.

287
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,800
I lost you, my biggest treasure.

288
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,880
Is this true?

289
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,880
Then you never abandoned me??

290
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,000
I never abandoned you, Yun-je.

291
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,040
It may sound like an excuse to you,

292
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,480
but when I regained consciousness again??

293
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,120
Much time had passed already.

294
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,120
I searched for you like a crazy woman, wondering

295
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,920
where you were and how you were doing, but to no avail.

296
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,960
I didn't abandon you, Yun-je. I never??

297
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,160
I never abandoned you.

298
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,240
I'm sorry.

299
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,160
For leaving you in a foreign place,

300
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,120
for getting into an accident,

301
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,080
and for not being able to find you.

302
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,280
I'm sorry for everything.

303
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:31,240
After losing you, I lived a life of regret.

304
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,760
My whole life.

305
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,080
I know it may all sound like an excuse,

306
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,400
so hate me if you want and blame me if you want.

307
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,360
Still??

308
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,840
Won't you let me see you like this, at least?

309
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,240
Yun-je?

310
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,640
I??

311
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,960
have to get going. I'm sorry.

312
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,360
Why did you come back?

313
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,680
Can I stay here like this for a while?

314
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,280
Did you see her?

315
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,240
May I ask what you talked about?

316
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,880
Something I want to believe,

317
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,920
but I just can't.

318
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,160
That she hadn't abandoned me,

319
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,720
but had lost me.

320
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:43,000
Then the memories from at the orphanage??

321
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,080
I don't know, it's very different from what I remember.

322
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,480
I couldn't blame her

323
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,760
nor try understand her.

324
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,080
This was all when you were very young,

325
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,480
so your memories may have been distorted.

326
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,920
Let's believe in her sincerity instead of your memories.

327
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,960
I really hope I can.

328
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,600
My lifetime friend Nam Eun-ki,

329
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,800
it was nice seeing you tonight.

330
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,480
Paintings don't lie??

331
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,720
(Eun-ki Bastard)

332
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,080
Hey.

333
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,600
Hey, Sung Duk-mi. Come out for a second.

334
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,960
What?

335
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,920
Come out front.

336
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,280
I only need a few minutes.

337
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,160
What does he want?

338
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,640
Hey, if you collapse after running around like that at night,

339
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,280
that's immdiate death by freezing!

340
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,160
There's something that I just had to tell you now.

341
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,320
What is it?

342
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,160
Happy birthday. It's your birthday soon.

343
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,040
But you came empty-handed.

344
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,720
I did bring you a birthday gift.

345
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,600
Myself.

346
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,880
What the??

347
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,680
Your best friend of 33 years who's just returned.

348
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,120
Nam Eun-ki.

349
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,120
Man, I really didn't want to bring this up

350
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,480
because it's embarrassing, but??

351
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:10,040
I ran away in middle school because I didn't want to do judo.

352
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,680
Do you remember how you dragged me home by the hair?

353
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,160
Gosh, what do you remember all the details for?

354
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,520
So I called you a total stranger,

355
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,120
and you almost beat me to death.

356
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,000
You said that's not something you say to your family.

357
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,040
Of course not.

358
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,440
It hurt like hell, but still, I couldn't help but smile.

359
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,480
Because you told me that I'm your family.

360
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,160
I was so, so grateful to hear that.

361
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,000
So I thought it'd be really nice

362
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,960
if things could continue to be like this, the way they are.

363
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,080
But then??

364
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,520
I started liking you.

365
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,280
And I mean that.

366
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,920
But after spending some time apart, I came to realize this.

367
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,680
I'm just??

368
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,080
happy when you smile.

369
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,520
Even if it's not me who's beside you,

370
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,280
whether or not you're fangirling

371
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,120
or whether or not someone else is beside you??

372
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,920
I just want you to be happy and smiling.

373
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,880
That's what I want the most.

374
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,240
That's enough to make us family, right?

375
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,440
My dear friend Sung Duk-mi,

376
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,400
who's brave and so beautiful when you smile??

377
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,080
I'm sorry I made things awkward for us.

378
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,400
I'm truly sorry.

379
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,080
You'll accept me as your friend again, right?

380
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,080
Nam Eun-ki.

381
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,320
Thank you for telling me this.

382
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,120
And thank you for coming back to me.

383
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,120
Still??you should give me a birthday present.

384
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,920
I just gave it to you. Me!

385
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,000
What would I do with you?

386
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,320
Tigers are stronger than lions, you know.

387
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,800
Are you crazy? I'm going to bring a lion here.

388
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,880
- Do it. - Are you sure?

389
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,920
I'll do a mean shoulder throw!

390
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,080
You must be out of your mind!

391
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,640
What do you think? The back of a man lost in his work??

392
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,240
Do I look cool?

393
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,920
Very cool, actually.

394
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,440
Si-an, I??

395
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,400
I've got many things to tell you.

396
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,440
Did Brother call you, by any chance?

397
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,040
How do you think he knew your number?

398
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,520
I know.

399
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,480
I caught on a long time ago.

400
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,840
That you have a painful past,

401
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,000
and that I have a brother.

402
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,120
But why didn't you say anything?

403
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,320
Because I knew it was painful for you.

404
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,440
So I waited.

405
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,360
Until I grew up,

406
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,560
until you could come to depend and rely on me.

407
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,880
And here I was, thinking you're still a baby??

408
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,480
Thank you, Si-an.

409
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,160
Did it go well with Brother?

410
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,800
I guess not, huh?

411
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,120
I did something unforgiveable, after all.

412
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,240
Mom.

413
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,120
Yes?

414
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,600
Why don't we show him all of your paintings?

415
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,240
I don't think we should.

416
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,240
Why not?

417
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,080
This all happened because of those paintings.

418
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,040
It's too cruel.

419
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,520
It's Brother who should see those paintings, if not anyone else.

420
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,960
He has to.

421
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,440
This is for him, too.

422
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,400
Mom.

423
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,760
Wait here.

424
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,440
Yes, Mr. Cha Si-an.

425
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,520
I was just about to call you, too.

426
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,040
We found two more of Lee Sol's works,

427
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,720
and expressed our interest in purchasing them.

428
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,440
I'll let you know once I hear back from them.

429
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,720
I see.

430
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,080
So that means there's just one left?

431
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,040
Yes, we're trying our best right now, so??

432
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,840
- No need for that. - Why not?

433
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,040
I know who has the last piece.

434
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,120
And I'd like Brother to see that last piece.

435
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,720
Could you convince him for me?

436
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,560
It's this late already,

437
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:32,000
and she's walking this long a distance? My Hyo-jin is?

438
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,160
Secretary Kim, look up this neighborhood's safety rating.

439
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,360
Mom!

440
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,320
Mom, you bought groceries?

441
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,000
Yeah, ingredients for stir-fried glass noodles and some squid.

442
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,320
Do you like squid soup?

443
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,000
Yes, I like anything that you cook.

444
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,040
Let's go.

445
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,080
- Secretary Kim? - Yes, Director.

446
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,040
Did you just hear Hyo-jin say "mom"?

447
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,320
Yes.

448
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,080
What are your thoughts?

449
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,520
Why's she linking arms?

450
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,680
What do you think about this?

451
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,080
I think??You've lost your daughter to her.

452
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,320
Oh my God!

453
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,000
Yes, Duk-mi.

454
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,920
Director, I'm sending you an address. See you there.

455
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,640
- What? - I just received a call.

456
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,000
A collector who has Lee Sol's art wants to show it to us.

457
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,600
It's the last piece in the series.

458
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,040
Hurry up, I'll be waiting.

459
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,080
The painting's here?

460
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,960
Yes, the owner entrusted it to this cathedral.

461
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,960
That's why we're going to meet them here.

462
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,520
You're here?

463
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,560
Duk-mi.

464
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,960
- The truth is??- She's not at fault.

465
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,400
I asked her to bring you here.

466
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:34,360
Mom didn't know that you were coming, either.

467
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,720
I'm sorry you weren't informed about this.

468
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,920
If this is uncomfortable,

469
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,880
you're free to go. It's alright.

470
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,880
Mom!

471
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,200
Director.

472
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,160
If it's hard to be here as Heo Yun-je,

473
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,080
then let's say you're here as Director Gold today.

474
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,840
We need to hold that exhibition,

475
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,360
and to do that we need to see the painting.

476
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,160
Will you show me??

477
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,800
the last piece?

478
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,160
Ms. Lee Sol.

479
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,000
"Please protect this child."

480
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,320
It was with this prayer that I entrusted it here.

481
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,800
You don't remember, right?

482
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,000
This is Yun-je.

483
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,920
Heo Yun-je.

484
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,120
Mommy!

485
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,000
I'm hungry.

486
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,080
Mommy. Mommy.

487
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,320
Mommy!

488
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,120
Mommy, I'm hungry.

489
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,040
Mommy.

490
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,520
Yun-je, what do you want to eat?

491
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,320
- Soy bean soup. - Hm?

492
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,520
Soy bean soup.

493
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,120
Mommy, did you paint me?

494
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,320
We're smiling.

495
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,720
Both of us.

496
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,920
Very happily.

497
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,080
Wow!

498
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,800
Mommy, look at this!

499
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,640
Mommy, did you see that?

500
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,760
Wow, so pretty!

501
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,120
But... are you alright, Mr. Cha Si-an?

502
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,760
It must've been a big shock to you, too.

503
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,440
Perhaps not as much as my mom,

504
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,440
but I waited for this day for a long time.

505
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,920
We found all of Mom's works,

506
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,000
and through them we found the child she'd lost.

507
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,120
We found my brother.

508
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,960
Are you an angel, by any chance?

509
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,160
Please.

510
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,680
I do get asked that every so often.

511
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,040
We owe this all to you. Thank you.

512
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,320
No, please.

513
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:14,600
Ms. Lee Sol, let me introduce myself once more..

514
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:17,400
I'm Sung Duk-mi, head curator at Cheum Museum of Art.

515
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,120
What brings you here at this hour?

516
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,440
I heard you know where the last piece is.

517
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,720
I'd rather not reveal??

518
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,120
Would you first take a look at this?

519
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,600
(Cheum Museum of Art's 5th Anniversary Special Exhibition)

520
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,480
Just the fragments could lead to

521
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,160
different interpretations, but??

522
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,600
With the last piece completing the series,

523
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,680
anyone who sees these paintings will know.

524
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,800
The heart that's contained in these paintings.

525
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,040
The feeling of love and yearning

526
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,040
for that one child.

527
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,800
And I really want the Director to see that.

528
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,000
As a curator,

529
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,600
and for the happiness of a person whom I cherish a lot.

530
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,440
Yun-jae??

531
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,560
But that's not the only reason.

532
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,040
I'd like it to be Cheum

533
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,120
where you showcase your works

534
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,520
for your debut as Lee Sol.

535
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,720
So please say yes.

536
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,480
By any chance??

537
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,840
I've been hesitating whether to ask this or not??

538
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,120
What is it?

539
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,360
Oh, it's nothing.

540
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,040
What is it? Go on.

541
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,920
Are you, perhaps??

542
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,480
a fan of mine?

543
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,280
A fan?

544
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,120
If someone likes your music, doesn't that make them a fan?

545
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,600
- Right? - I love White Ocean's music.

546
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,400
Oh, thank you.

547
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,920
Um, I have a new song that's coming out soon.

548
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,920
What's the genre this time?

549
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,440
- It's got a hip hop base??- Ah, I see.

550
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,200
But with a more acoustic feel.

551
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,600
So you saw Lee Sol's final painting.

552
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,120
What did you think?

553
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,000
I could feel it from the painting.

554
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,440
That she loved me,

555
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,040
and protected me.

556
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,080
That I was a protected child?

557
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,480
Go and really feel it, then.

558
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,120
Today I'll let your mother have you.

559
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,560
Go ahead.

560
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,240
Curator Sung,

561
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,560
we just got a call from the Chinese dealer.

562
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,080
Apparently, the collector said they'd sell us Lee Sol's painting!

563
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,160
Really?

564
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,480
That means we'll be able to exhibit all nine pieces!

565
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,280
You found the last piece, too?

566
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,280
All the works will be here, starting next week.

567
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,240
Curator Sung, Curator Yoo! We're almost there!

568
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,440
Our merchandise is also 99% ready!

569
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,960
I just need to display them now.

570
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,280
The exhibition's not far off now, so let's all hang in there!

571
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,280
Yes!

572
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,560
Why didn't you tell me

573
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,080
that this is what "delivery" means?

574
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:00,520
I forgot that it was hard work.

575
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,680
Why do you think we forget each time?

576
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,280
That way, we do it all over again next time.

577
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,880
You know, shouldn't we go for a group dinner on a day like this

578
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,240
even if we're busy with the exhibition and all?

579
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,760
I don't have my mom's card anymore.

580
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,320
Why doesn't Curator Sung's boyfriend treat us?

581
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,520
My boyfriend?

582
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,840
Then shall I put my boyfriend to some use?

583
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,240
Get changed.

584
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,280
Alright!

585
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,800
So you're saying that

586
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,960
this and this here are the only spaces I can use?

587
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,480
That's not what you said in the beginning.

588
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,760
The number of pieces has increased since then,

589
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,480
and everyone wants more exhibition space.

590
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,280
Please understand, Ms. Choi. Please?

591
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,680
- Hello, Ms. Choi. - Hello.

592
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,160
If your meeting's not over should I come back later?

593
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,080
We're done.

594
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,320
Right?

595
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:58,160
Well you're telling me to stop, so I guess we are?

596
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,040
I'm off to see a friend, anyway.

597
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,560
Friend?

598
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,160
You have a friend in Korea?

599
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,720
All thanks to Ms. Sung Duk-mi, yes.

600
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,280
Me?

601
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,200
I'm off.

602
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,320
See you.

603
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,080
All thanks to me?

604
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,440
What is it?

605
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,480
Oh. You're going to have to drop some cash today.

606
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:22,120
Everyone's exhausted with the exhibition coming up.

607
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,840
I think you should treat them to dinner.

608
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,880
Alright.

609
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,720
Ah, what about that makgeolli place last time?

610
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,120
- Not the makgeolli place. - Why not?

611
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,720
You're really heavy.

612
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,480
I'm not going to get drunk tonight.

613
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,640
Sure you won't!

614
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:40,360
Sure you won't??

615
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:43,600
That was definitely positive, but why does it sound so negative?

616
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,400
You need to work on your Korean.

617
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,160
Here's your iced americano.

618
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,320
Ju Hyuk, I heard you're releasing an album.

619
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,080
I'll give you a signed copy once it's out.

620
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,080
I say you're the blessed fan, Lee Sun-joo.

621
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,280
Making albums for your cafe employee??

622
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,360
Fangirls need to have an eye for talent, you know.

623
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,000
Just because I went on hiatus

624
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,280
doesn't mean I've lost my touch.

625
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,160
Right. Is that why you married Seung-min?

626
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,240
Hey!

627
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,760
Are you dissing my husband?

628
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,920
- Didn't you guys fight? - Only I can diss him, alright?

629
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,080
Hi.

630
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,240
Hello.

631
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,760
Who... are you?

632
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,320
Well, last time??

633
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,840
You've never met her.

634
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,920
You don't know her.

635
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,400
So why did you want to see me?

636
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,760
I can't go out and have fun once I start the installations,

637
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,840
so we should have a drink before I get busy.

638
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Fine, but??

639
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,080
Just one round.

640
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,000
Excuse me, I need to use the bathroom.

641
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:56,640
Hey, Duk-mi.

642
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,080
Sun-joo, I won't be able to see you tonight after all.

643
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,400
I'm having dinner with my colleagues.

644
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,040
All my friends have something going on tonight, huh?

645
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,320
What, even Eun-ki?

646
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,040
Eun-ki has a new friend.

647
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,040
She's not my friend.

648
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,280
A new friend?

649
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,760
Yeah, and they seem pretty close.

650
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,000
I told you, she's not my friend!

651
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,680
So where are you guys going?

652
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,800
Probably to a makgeolli place.

653
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,120
Mr. Heo Yun-je just loves makgeolli, you see.

654
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,160
Heo Yun-je?

655
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,000
That's Director Gold's Korean name. Heo Yun-je.

656
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,840
Isn't it a pretty name?

657
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,120
See you tomorrow, Sun-joo.

658
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,440
Jeez, we hardly see her anymore.

659
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,560
Sun-joo,

660
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,040
who is Heo Yun-je?

661
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,880
Why did Duk-mi suddenly mention that name?

662
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,800
She says it's Director Gold's Korean name.

663
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,200
D-Director Ryan?

664
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,760
Yes, I think she learned his name before he was adopted.

665
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,800
Let's go drink.

666
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,120
Not today, I'm sorry. Another time.

667
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,720
Another time, when? I'll be busy soon.

668
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,120
I'll stay until round 3, next time. Something urgent came up.

669
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,160
I'm off.

670
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,800
Bye.

671
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,280
If it's alright with you, how about a drink with me?

672
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,320
No.

673
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,280
It's awkward, right?

674
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,280
Yes.

675
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,640
- Mom. - Yeah?

676
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,280
You know??

677
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,280
Yes?

678
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Um??

679
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,040
Come on, what?

680
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,440
You know that kid??

681
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,000
That kid?

682
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,160
Yeah.

683
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,840
What was his name again?

684
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,160
Why are you suddenly asking us that?

685
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,560
Right. It's nothing, forget what I said and eat.

686
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:13,320
Why did I even ask you that?

687
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,320
Dig in.

688
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:19,920
Eat your rice.

689
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,840
Here's to the special exhibi??

690
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:29,840
Wait, but isn't it Curator Sung's birthday tomorrow?

691
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,160
Probably is.

692
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,720
We'll leave you two alone tomorrow to spend some time together,

693
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,520
and wish you a happy birthday today instead.

694
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,600
Oh, but what do we do about a cake?

695
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,640
I'm ordering one now.

696
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:42,920
It'll be here soon.

697
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,280
Thank you.

698
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,560
Happy birthday to you!

699
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:52,520
Happy birthday to you!

700
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:56,120
Happy birthday dear Cu. Sung!

701
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:00,080
Happy birthday to you!

702
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,080
Thank you everyone.

703
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,080
- The cake's delicious. - Yes.

704
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,240
Cheers!

705
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,920
Hey??What are you doing?

706
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,400
Keeping tabs on him again?

707
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,480
Director Gold won't be drinking tonight, not even a drop.

708
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,520
I'm going to drink.

709
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:27,600
No, you can't.

710
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,440
Are you on herbal medicine?

711
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,120
- No. - Then why not?

712
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:35,160
Director Gold has something to do tonight.

713
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,440
What's that?

714
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,200
Something you need to do with me.

715
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:41,440
Woah, TMI guys.

716
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,760
So are you two going to date, or not?

717
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,640
What's gonna date? Who, us?

718
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,120
Us?

719
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:02,000
Ha! That will never, ever happen!

720
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,640
Does anyone know what lies in their future? Never say never.

721
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,080
Earth to you,

722
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:10,080
I at least know this much.

723
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:16,280
- What's this? - Just know how I feel.

724
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,320
Oh, please! Don't you date, too!

725
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:23,080
These two here are already a ticking bomb for me,

726
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:26,040
and now you two??How annoying!

727
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,520
Okay, okay.

728
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,560
Go for round two.

729
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:35,320
Director, can we go until round three?

730
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,640
Until round four.

731
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,000
Thank you very much!

732
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,160
- See you. - See you!

733
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,440
Have a good time!

734
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,880
What are we doing tonight?

735
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,600
You wouldn't even let me drink.

736
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,000
Well??First get changed into something comfortable.

737
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,080
I'll wait here.

738
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:44,560
(Heo Yun-je)

739
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,040
Duk-mi?

740
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:24,840
Director.

741
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:01,360
Duk-mi, this is??

742
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,000
It's my birthday tomorrow.

743
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,600
I want a birthday present from you.

744
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,680
Please draw me.

745
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,480
But you know, Duk-mi,

746
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,280
that I can't draw anymore.

747
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,080
You can.

748
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,200
You drew my hand last time, remember?

749
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,800
This is no different from then.

750
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:43,880
I've got

751
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:49,560
a killer profile,

752
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,400
but my neckline is even better.

753
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:31,160
What do you think? Can't wait to draw me now, right?

754
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,280
Just trace my silhouette.

755
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,440
That's very beautiful,

756
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,480
Ryan Gold, the artist.

757
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,280
I love you.

758
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:20,120
I love you.

759
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,240
I'm it!

760
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,240
Let's run!

761
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:31,000
I'm Sung Duk-mi, and I'm seven years old.

762
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,760
What's your name?

763
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,560
I'm??

764
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:37,360
Heo Yun-je.

765
