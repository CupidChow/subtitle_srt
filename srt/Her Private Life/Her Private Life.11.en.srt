(Her Private Life)

3
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,320
Is it too early?

4
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,880
Oh yeah, what was bothering you yester??

5
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,640
- What is it? - Lion.

6
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,720
Ms. Sung Duk-mi.

7
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,960
Director Ryan,

8
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,560
you came to see her without having made plans?

9
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,600
Today??

10
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,160
Come back another time.

11
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,000
I'd like to talk to Ms. Sung Duk-mi, not you.

12
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,320
Duk-mi??

13
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,880
hasn't washed her face,

14
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,760
so I don't think you'll get to see it today.

15
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,560
Have I not stated that I'd like to speak with Duk-mi?

16
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,120
Has Duk-mi not stated that she doesn't want to see you?

17
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,520
Duk-mi??

18
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,000
is my girlfriend.

19
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,160
So this is our business,

20
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,480
and not something you should mind.

21
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,360
Why isn't it something I should mind?

22
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,520
It concerns the woman I like.

23
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,520
Duk-mi doesn't want to show her face like this.

24
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,840
To you, Director Ryan.

25
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,800
So if you really care for her,

26
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,840
please leave for today.

27
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,400
Come out, Ms. Sung Duk-mi.

28
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,280
It's alright,

29
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,080
Ms. T.R.T.S.

30
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,600
I'm sorry.

31
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,560
I didn't mean to pretend not to know.

32
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,000
Well if you knew, you should've said so.

33
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,880
Do you want me to say it here, right now?

34
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,680
- Let's go talk elsewhere. - Duk-mi.

35
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,800
I'll be fine.

36
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,760
Ugh, this hangover??

37
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,160
Where did they all go?

38
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,440
What the??

39
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,080
Duk-mi!

40
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,280
Nam Eun-ki. Eun-ki!

41
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,360
Isn't that Lion?

42
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,560
Was Duk-mi busted? About being T.R.T.S.?

43
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,960
He says he already knew.

44
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,880
He knows?

45
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,960
Really?

46
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,160
Sun-joo!

47
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,080
Sun-joo, I'm sorry.

48
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,080
It's all my fault.

49
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,800
Make your apologies at family court.

50
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,320
We've been together for so long. How can we split over this?

51
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,400
At least for Gun-woo's sake...

52
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
We're a family. A family! Hm?

53
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,120
Family, my ass.

54
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,800
And who cares about how long we've been together?

55
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,000
It only takes a second to become strangers again.

56
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,440
To be honest,

57
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,680
- Gun-woo??- What about Gun-woo?

58
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,320
Come on, what is it?

59
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,760
Ugh!

60
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,000
Eun-ki, I'll call you!

(Beware of Reality Checks)

63
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,640
It's alright, Ms. T.R.T.S.

64
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,720
I'm sorry.

65
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,600
I didn't mean to pretend not to know.

66
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,560
Since when has he known that I'm T.R.T.S.?

67
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,120
Since when had she been together with Director Nam?

68
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,000
No, wait. How did he find out?

69
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,120
No, wait. How??

70
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,120
How could she hide after seeing me?

71
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,280
- Where are we going? - You'll know once we're there.

72
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,440
I have a right to know where we're going, thank you.

73
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,160
Then why don't you drive this car yourself, Ms. T.R.T.S.?

74
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,880
Ugh, you're so petty.

75
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,160
Get out.

76
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,880
You want me to go to your place?

77
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,000
Like this?

78
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,960
What time does Mr. Cha Si-an have appointments today?

79
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,680
Today, our Si-an starts at 10??

80
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Seriously. Why here, out of all places?

81
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,360
We can't fight on the street, as intellectuals.

82
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,840
"Our Si-an" has probably left, by now.

83
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,840
Let's go.

84
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,520
You want to duke this out, but you're bringing me to your house?

85
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,360
What, so you get home-field advantage?

86
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,320
That's cheating.

87
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,440
Then should I have started while Mr. Nam was there?

88
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,120
Two on one? So you can cheat?

89
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,320
But some fans have camped out all night.

90
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,840
Since your manager's dealing with them...

91
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,520
Brother?

92
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,600
Yes, Mr. Cha Si-an.

93
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,720
What's he doing?

94
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,760
Hello, Curator Sung?

95
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,000
Uh, hello, Mr. Cha Si-an.

96
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,160
I'll get the next elevator. Go ahead first.

97
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,560
But why??Why were you so startled?

98
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,440
This is all because of you, obviously.

99
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,080
I was worried you might get "outed", Ms. Duk-mi.

100
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,520
Where did you learn that word?

101
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,200
I did a bit of studying,

102
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,000
because my girlfriend happens to be a fangirl.

103
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,160
Gun-woo.

104
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,320
Mom!

105
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,680
Gun-woo, are you feeling sick?

106
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,640
What hurts? Your stomach?

107
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,960
Mommy, Daddy says his chest hurts.

108
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,680
What?

109
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,040
Mommy!

110
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,000
Yes, Gun-woo.

111
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,680
Mommy, are you sick?

112
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,880
No, Mommy's not sick.

113
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,400
You smell, Mommy.

114
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,840
It's that smell you have whenever you're sick.

115
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,120
Die. Die, alright?

116
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,760
Gun-woo, shall we go to the gym?

117
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,680
Let's go, let's go!

118
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,120
Bye.

119
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,160
See you.

120
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,840
My hand hurts.

121
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,120
Duk-mi is my girlfriend.

122
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,080
It's alright, Ms. T.R.T.S.

123
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,680
- Hello! - Hello!

124
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,520
Nam Eun-ki.

125
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,800
Duk-mi's going out with Director Gold.

126
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,280
Since when?

127
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,720
It's been a few days since she told me??

128
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,120
But who knows how long she's had feelings for him?

129
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,880
Why didn't she tell me?

130
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,640
I told her not to.

131
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,080
Because she doesn't know

132
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,840
how you feel about her.

133
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,240
Go. I have a class to teach.

134
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,200
Nam Eun-ki.

135
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,160
You're okay, right?

136
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,040
You're on my side, right?

137
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,040
Of course! I'm on Nam Eun-ki's side.

138
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,200
You really have been lying down to a science, huh?

139
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,120
You know something?

140
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,120
What?

141
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,880
I'm on Lee Sun-joo's side, too.

142
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,320
Where'd that come from?

143
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,080
I'm saying you should give Seung-min a chance and hear him out.

144
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,600
You think he wanted to do what he did?

145
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,360
Are you really going to keep taking that man's side?

146
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,080
Alright, let's get changed!

147
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,240
Come here. Come here! Come here, let's get changed.

148
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,480
Let's go and get changed. Come on, let's go!

149
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,000
Line up! Get up.

150
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,840
Did Mr. Nam Eun-ki??

151
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,000
?存tay the night at your place? By any chance?

152
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,120
- Yes. - Ah??

153
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm asking because I'm really curious??

154
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,320
Why are you so confident?

155
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,520
Your boyfriend caught you leaving your house

156
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,480
in the morning, with another man.

157
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,880
I guess you saw Eun-ki, but not Sun-joo.

158
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,360
Something bad happened to Sun-joo,

159
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,160
so we drank together and knocked out. And Eun-ki??

160
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,560
He likes you, of course, Ms. Sung Duk-mi.

161
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,080
Why isn't it something I should mind?

162
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,800
It concerns the woman I like.

163
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,560
Well, that's??

164
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,200
He just blurted that out to defend me.

165
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,800
Is that what you really think?

166
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,040
Yes.

167
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,960
Eun-ki's my family.

168
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,160
It's been that way until now, and will continue to be so.

169
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,840
Alright.

170
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,120
Well then, shall we now talk about you?

171
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,120
You've also done me wrong.

172
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,600
I don't think I did anything wrong.

173
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,240
You knew I was T.R.T.S. and didn't tell me.

174
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,040
Aren't you at a bigger fault for

175
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,080
hiding the fact that you're T.R.T.S.?

176
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,320
Ha! But I never meant to hide it.

177
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,920
You behaved with a bit too much caution to be able to say that.

178
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,360
Fine, it's true that I hid it intentionally.

179
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,840
But back then, I didn't know I'd end up falling for you.

180
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,120
Oh, so it never occurred to you that you'd fall for me?

181
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,000
It did, but I didn't know I'd fall for you this hard.

182
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,120
This hard? How hard?

183
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,120
Very??

184
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,240
What are you doing?

185
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm sorry.

186
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,000
For not telling you that I knew.

187
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,400
I'm sorry for deceiving you.

188
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,800
So??When did you find out?

189
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,160
Right before we went to visit Mr. Roh Seok?

190
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,040
How?

191
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,240
There were hints. Plus,

192
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,440
most conclusively??

193
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,960
Your handwriting in the personal organizer.

194
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,960
Oh.

195
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,280
Weren't you surprised?

196
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,680
I was, a little.

197
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,280
You weren't mad?

198
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,080
I was, a little.

199
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,880
It didn't turn you off?

200
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,920
Or make you think that I'm weird?

201
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Not at all.

202
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,240
I was a little surprised and a little angry,

203
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,880
but it didn't make me like you any less.

204
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,120
Because as a result, I got to know you better.

205
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,520
Well, then.

206
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,560
Shall we introduce ourselves officially this time, Ms. T.R.T.S.?

207
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,600
I'm T.R.T.S.

208
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,400
I'm sorry for sitting on top of you at the airport,

209
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,400
and for ruining your clothes.

210
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,120
But you know something?

211
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,000
The reason you fell at the airport??

212
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,760
Is that I pushed you.

213
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,560
I'm sorry, too.

214
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,240
That means there are no more secrets between us now, right?

215
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
Yes.

216
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,680
Ah.

217
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,200
What is it?

218
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,080
Latte?

219
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,040
Latte?

220
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,680
Hey! Hey!

221
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,840
W-wait!

222
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,640
Ha! You're a con. What, you're Latte?

223
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,200
Wait, Ms. T.R.T.S. Ms. T.R.T.S., please!

224
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,000
- Ms. Sung Duk-mi. - What??Latte?

225
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,600
W-wait. Wait! Wait!

226
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,440
Ow!! Wait, ouch!

227
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,040
So why did you even register on the site? Why?

228
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,960
Well, I wanted to know more about you, so??

229
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,040
So what did you find out? What did you dig up?

230
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,120
Well??

231
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,840
That Si-an's thighs are your merchandise?

232
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,520
Oh, shut up!

233
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,000
Ow! Ow!

234
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,960
"I'm hyperventilating over your clavicles."

235
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,400
Oh, please. Stop it!

236
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,680
Let go.

237
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,720
Let go of me while I'm still saying it nicely.

238
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,240
Hey, come on!

239
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,760
Teach me.

240
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,920
Teach you what?

241
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,160
How to fangirl.

242
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,200
How to fangirl?

243
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,680
You're so cute when you're fangirling,

244
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,360
so I want to try being your fanboy, too.

245
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,600
The Road to Duk-mi?

246
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,000
It won't be so easy.

247
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Is that so?

248
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,840
Being a fan??

249
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,160
...means you're happy while just watching them.

250
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,960
So you're not allowed to touch them like this.

251
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,400
Why not?

252
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,240
Because you should be happy while just watching them.

253
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,600
- Oh. - That's our rule.

254
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,480
Then I should just watch you.

255
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,880
Do you think you can?

256
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,880
Alright. So you should feel happy just watching them,

257
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,120
enjoy it, and??

258
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,040
Have butterflies just??

259
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,040
Why are you unbuttoning your shirt?

260
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,200
Oh, because it's a bit hot in here.

261
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,520
So you want them to do well,

262
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,840
and the way they smile??

263
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,080
Why the watch this time?

264
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,520
My wrist is hurting a little.

265
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,760
Anyway, Si-an's someone who??

266
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,160
You're just so darn beautiful.

267
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,720
I thought you told me to just watch you.

268
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,400
You just watch, and leave the rest to me.

269
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,120
Is it Mr. Cha Si-an again?

270
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,160
Ms. Kim Hyo-jin?

271
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,080
Kim Hyo-jin?

272
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,000
Sindy?

273
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,920
What are doing here without any prior notice?

274
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,320
Director, if you and my mom were to fight,

275
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,000
- who would win? - I'm sorry?

276
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,320
Director, can you win against my mom?

277
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,880
Ms. Kim Hyo-jin, put it in a way that I can understand??

278
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,480
Ugh! My mom won't let Si-an participate in the exhibition!

279
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,360
What about Mr. Cha Si-an's exhibition?

280
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,720
What the??

281
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,080
Hello.

282
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,760
Curator Sung, why do your clothes always end up wet

283
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,200
when you're at someone else's place?

284
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,600
People may misunderstand you.

285
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,680
Well, uh??

286
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,480
I get hand tremors.

287
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,360
Ms. Kim Hyo-jin, get to the point.

288
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,520
Simply and calmly.

289
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,120
Well, what happened is??

290
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,240
Mother.

291
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,000
Um, this isn't what you think it is.

292
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,760
Hyo-jin?

293
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,240
Um, I'm on my way to the museum.

294
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:01,320
Did you watch the trailer for the documentary "K the Pursuer?"

295
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,120
The title is

296
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,960
"Fangirls: Their Distorted Love"

297
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,760
One who bought a limited-edition product for her idol,

298
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,560
the fanatic stalker, Sindy.

299
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,760
Watching the trailer made your mother

300
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,080
get a little feeling, so she did a little research.

301
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,520
And sources say that this "fanatic stalker" is my daughter!

302
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,920
It's not me.

303
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,120
"It's not me"?

304
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,520
My husband's on the news,

305
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,680
and my daughter, on some documentary.

306
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,640
My husband is an economic criminal,

307
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,040
and my daughter, a fanatic stalker.

308
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,040
Mother.

309
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,600
They say your father! Moo-san!

310
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,400
Has an illegitimate child and I'm sick of hearing those rumors!

311
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,640
And now my daughter is a fanatic?

312
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,840
I really hate fanatics!

313
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,600
I hate fanatics!

314
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,520
"Never in my life will I have some lousy idol

315
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,160
exhibit his collection in my museum! Ever!"

316
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,480
is what my mom said.

317
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,760
That documentary has done damage to more than one person.

318
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,240
Ms. Kim Hyo-jin, your mother has no authority at Cheum.

319
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,360
Happy?

320
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,320
If you're done, then please??

321
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,520
Even if she's the chairperson of TK Cultural Foundation?

322
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,400
My mom's going to be the chairperson,

323
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,920
who does have decision-making rights at Cheum.

324
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,000
Can you still win against her?

325
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,120
I really want to make merchandise for Si-an's exhibit.

326
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,080
Me too??

327
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,200
Give me some time to think of a solution.

328
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,760
Please leave now.

329
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,960
Director.

330
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,880
I've never asked this of anyone

331
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,320
so this is extremely awkward for me, but??

332
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,120
Please lend me some money.

333
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,320
If you were chased out of your house empty-handed

334
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,480
and took a taxi to get here,

335
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,520
you should've asked for the taxi fare first.

336
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,000
Do you know how expensive it is to make them wait?

337
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,040
I'm going to pay him back.

338
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,760
The payment's not the issue.

339
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,120
You're going to go home, right?

340
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,560
How much is it to go to those saunas?

341
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,080
I heard you can sleep there.

342
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,160
Just go home.

343
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,360
- Ms. Kim Hyo-jin? - But I can't just yield to her.

344
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,880
I'm going to hold out for at least a week.

345
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,360
Um??Make that three days!

346
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,360
There's no way I'm going home.

347
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,320
Director,

348
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,000
I'll take Hyo-jin.

349
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,360
Why are you taking her?

350
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,640
She's completely ignorant about everything except fangirling,

351
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,560
so I can't just leave her alone.

352
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,480
And I can't let her sleep at a sauna.

353
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,040
Then let's put her up in a hotel.

354
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,600
Don't go, Miss Duk-mi.

355
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,800
I'll take her.

356
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,120
Where will you take her? To your place?

357
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,240
No way.

358
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,520
What are you doing? Why aren't you following me?

359
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,120
Can't I just go to a hotel?

360
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,600
Miss Hyo-jin? You have exactly two options.

361
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,960
One, stay at my place, or two, end up on the streets.

362
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,920
My place is better than the streets, right? Follow me.

363
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,600
Oh, that's right!

364
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,040
I must warn you about one thing.

365
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,560
The word "idol" is banned in our house, alright?

366
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,320
What, is that the trend among mothers these days?

367
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,920
Let's go.

368
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,640
- Hey. - Mom, we're here.

369
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,680
Welcome.

370
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,680
So you're Duk-mi's subordinate?

371
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,120
Gosh, you're a pretty thing.

372
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,360
Hello.

373
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,040
You may not have realized it yet, but do say hello over there, too.

374
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,040
That's Duk-mi's dad.

375
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,400
Hello.

376
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,560
Make yourself comfortable. Please.

377
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,600
Have a seat.

378
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,280
What's with those clothes you're wearing?

379
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,000
What? It's the boyfriend look. It's what's in these days.

380
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,280
What guy would fancy you if you go around looking like that?

381
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,640
That's why you don't have a boyfriend yet.

382
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,400
Huh? But Curator Sung??

383
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,520
I should date a guy who likes me even if I dress like this, Mom.

384
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,320
Tsk, tsk.

385
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,560
Have a seat over there.

386
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,600
- Did the rice come out well? - Of course.

387
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,400
Here.

388
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,240
Yum, we won't even need side dishes.

389
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,920
- Duk-mi. - Yeah?

390
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,040
Call Eun-ki and let him know that you're staying the night.

391
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,120
Oh, sure.

392
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Oh, Nam Eun-ki?

393
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,400
I'm at Mom's place,

394
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,160
and I'll be sleeping over with my colleague.

395
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,280
So, uh??you camp out in the gym, alright?

396
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,440
You??you called me to tell me that?

397
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,440
Yeah.

398
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,200
I'm going there now, so come out to the playground for a sec.

399
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,120
Eun-ki. Eun-ki?

400
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,080
Wear these to bed.

401
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,800
But only for tonight. Go home and sleep in your own bed tomorrow.

402
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,480
So??Do we both sleep here?

403
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,080
If you don't like it, go sleep in your own spacious room.

404
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,160
You're fine being alone, right? I'll be out for a little.

405
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,400
- Where are you going? - Are you still running CU-patch?

406
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,880
Get some sleep.

407
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,080
Hey, Nam Eun-ki.

408
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,000
I told you I have a guest over at my place,

409
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,680
so why'd call me out here?

410
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,000
What is it that you want to tell me? Just hurry up and say it.

411
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,160
Sit.

412
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,080
Duk-mi.

413
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,120
- This morning??- Did Sun-joo get home safely?

414
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,520
I wonder if she made up with her husband.

415
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,520
I couldn't get a hold of her. Should I try again now?

416
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,400
- Sung Duk-mi. - Yes?

417
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,080
This morning??

418
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,480
You heard me say that I like you, right?

419
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,520
Hm, did you say that?

420
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,800
You went that far to try and help me, didn't you?

421
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,040
Aw, Eun-ki. You've got a cute side to??

422
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,080
Don't try to dismiss it as a joke.

423
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,400
Right now, to me you're??

424
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,920
neither a friend nor family.

425
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,720
You're a woman.

426
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,880
I like you, Sung Duk-mi.

427
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,840
Why are you so surprised? Sheesh.

428
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,120
Eun-ki.

429
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,600
I like Director Gold.

430
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,240
Director Gold and I??

431
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,240
I know.

432
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,600
I know you're going out with Director Gold.

433
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,800
But do you think a judo athlete like me knows how to

434
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,040
step down without a match?

435
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,040
I'm not asking you to see me as a man right now.

436
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,640
Even if you need more time,

437
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,640
I can wait.

438
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,480
Go home, and sleep well.

439
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,720
What is it? You can't sleep?

440
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,760
Oh, yeah.

441
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,880
Aren't you going to bed?

442
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,680
No, I can't sleep either.

443
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,080
Could you come for a moment?

444
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Here.

445
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,880
Would this be too big?

446
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,080
If you can't sleep,

447
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,160
can you wind this yarn for me?

448
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,840
Who is this for?

449
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:03,000
I'm just knitting it, out of habit.

450
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,800
Duk-mi grew up wearing clothes I knit for her,

451
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,600
but she's tired of them and won't wear them anymore.

452
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,160
Plus they're not as pretty as the clothes these days.

453
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,040
I think they're pretty.

454
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,000
Really? You think they're pretty?

455
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Yes.

456
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,400
Then I'll give this one to you after I'm done knitting it.

457
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,160
Oh, I wasn't really asking for one??

458
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,680
Oh.

459
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,080
Um, I mean??

460
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:33,080
How much is all this? For the material and the labor.

461
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,120
Five big ones.

462
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,840
Thank-you-ve-ry-much.

463
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,920
Oh. Thank you very much.

464
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,040
You fought with your mom, right?

465
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,760
We only let people who've fought with their moms stay for 1 night.

466
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,360
Go home tomorrow. Your mom's probably worried.

467
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,000
I don't think my mom would ever worry.

468
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,160
Really?

469
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,000
Then don't go home.

470
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,120
I'll give you Duk-mi's room over there,

471
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,080
so live here from now on.

472
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,160
You can't after all? Because you're worried about your mother?

473
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,200
Jeez, why isn't that daughter of mine back yet?

474
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,400
Right now, to me you're??

475
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,160
neither a friend nor family.

476
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,160
You're a woman.

477
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,880
I like you, Sung Duk-mi.

478
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,600
Yes, Director.

479
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,080
Hold on, let me take this call outside.

480
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,040
Oh, 'cause Hyo-jin's asleep right next to me.

481
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,040
Director.

482
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,040
Yes.

483
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,520
Nevermind.

484
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,080
You sound troubled.

485
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,600
Did something happen?

486
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,760
Is it because of Director Nam?

487
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,400
How did you know?

488
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,520
You didn't know?

489
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,560
That I know you like the back of my hand?

490
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,560
To tell you the truth??

491
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,080
Eun-ki

492
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,880
says he likes me.

493
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,080
I know already. I heard him earlier.

494
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,800
Are you repeating that to make me jealous?

495
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,840
We agreed there would be no secrets between us.

496
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,360
That's why I'm telling you.

497
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,200
Thank you for telling me.

498
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,680
And??

499
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,680
Don't rush into anything.

500
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,920
Director Nam is a precious family member.

501
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,400
I know you won't waver.

502
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,560
Oh!

503
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:47,000
But I don't want you to think that I'm not jealous about this.

504
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,240
Alright.

505
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,680
Anyway, has Hyo-jin not caused any trouble yet?

506
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,680
Now that I think of it, right now there are

507
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,960
two fangirls under one roof.

508
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,320
Wasn't your mother shocked?

509
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,080
If my mother finds out,

510
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,680
Hyo-jin will be kicked out of my house.

511
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,480
You have no idea how much she hates fangirling.

512
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,120
Hmmm??Is that so?

513
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,160
What was that just now?

514
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:15,120
"I've got to hide my girlfriend's fangirl identity."

515
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,000
That sort of realization?

516
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,280
No, that's not what it sounded like at all.

517
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,080
You're making fun of me, aren't you?

518
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,680
You're pretending to be so understanding,

519
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,280
but you're making fun of me, aren't you?

520
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,520
Sun-joo.

521
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,960
That documentary??

522
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,440
I wasn't going to do it, for you and Duk-mi.

523
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,920
But my mentor said if I do it,

524
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,680
he'd transfer me to whatever department I want.

525
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,000
And I thought that if I did it,

526
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,280
I could make sure it took the most neutral stance.

527
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,920
You wanted me to do variety shows, too.

528
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,920
Didn't you?

529
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,200
Did you do it against your will? Because of me?

530
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,880
Although you wanted to keep doing documentaries, not variety shows?

531
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,000
Did you force yourself to, because of me?

532
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,880
Uh, no??It's not like that??

533
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,320
Do you know what the worst part of this is?

534
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,960
If you've hurt me,

535
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,240
then be just the offender.

536
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,360
Why claim me to be the reason as you victimize yourself?

537
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,080
In this situation, do I really have to understand you

538
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,920
and even pity you?

539
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,360
I should've just told you from the start.

540
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,040
Why did I drag it on like this??

541
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,400
I really don't know why I did that, either.

542
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,120
Should I tell you why?

543
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,320
Why you didn't tell me beforehand?

544
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,560
Because there was no need to.

545
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,000
Even if I get angry and yell about it after finding out

546
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,840
too late, all you have to do is put up with it for that moment.

547
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,480
Because you knew that as a married woman with a child,

548
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,160
I wouldn't divorce you over something like that.

549
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,640
That's why you didn't tell me.

550
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,080
Because you did all your calculations.

551
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,320
You??

552
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,000
You stabbed me, using family as your weapon,

553
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,000
then hid behind the shield that is Gun-woo.

554
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,040
Despicably. Cowardly.

555
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,000
Sun-joo.

556
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,800
S-Sun-joo??Where are you going?

557
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,120
Where else would I go?

558
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,440
I'm going home.

559
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,840
(Cheum Museum of Art)

560
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,400
Accomodation fees.

561
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,320
Accommodation fees? What's this?

562
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,440
The original files.

563
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,800
From CU-patch.

564
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,400
Hey, I don't take pictures anymore.

565
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,840
They're just??date snapshots? Those kinds of photos.

566
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,880
And??

567
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,400
S-O-R-R-Y.

568
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Huh?

569
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,880
What is it this time?

570
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,920
Come take a look at this.

571
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,920
Hey! That's??

572
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,480
This is it, right?

573
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,080
Curator Sung, you should come have a look.

574
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,800
What is it?

575
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,120
Oh?

576
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,520
Where did you... find this?

577
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,360
Yoo-sub found it on an online community for art investors.

578
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,680
It's a private collection that was uploaded a year ago,

579
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,160
and while it looks like it wasn't stored in optimal conditions

580
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,280
it's clear that it's something by Lee Sol.

581
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,080
Were you able to contact the collector?

582
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,680
Yes, but he said it's not with him at the moment.

583
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,880
It's at a consignment gallery.

584
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,040
I'm about to go there now.

585
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,040
I'll go with you.

586
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,400
- I'll be out with the Director. - Alright.

587
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,080
Mr. Kim Yoo-sub.

588
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,080
Yes.

589
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,120
Well done. thank you.

590
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,360
See you!

591
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,760
It wasn't just me who heard that, right?

592
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,280
Director Gold saying thanks.

593
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,040
He finally have grown on us.

594
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,240
Whoa.

595
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,840
Lee Sol's work is here?

596
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,600
We don't store all works like this.

597
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,600
This is where we store works that have been severely damaged

598
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,000
or have almost no value, until they are discarded.

599
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,080
Is it this one?

600
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,800
Allow me.

601
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,960
Director.

602
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,520
Oh, yes.

603
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,040
This piece is so damaged

604
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,360
that I almost feel bad selling it to you.

605
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,680
Please have it delivered to Cheum Museum of Art.

606
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,760
Sure.

607
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,240
Director?

608
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,120
Director.

609
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,880
I'll ask Professor Yang to do the restoration.

610
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,720
Okay.

611
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,080
Director.

612
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,840
One moment, I need to go buy something.

613
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,480
Will you wait for me over there?

614
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,160
- Shall I go with you? - Uh-uh.

615
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,080
Wait here.

616
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,000
What the heck? How come you're so much better than me?

617
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,640
Come on, try harder.

618
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,600
It's spinning.

619
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,440
It's funny, right?

620
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,960
Get me two of what they're having, please.

621
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,040
Were you thirsty?

622
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,800
What are you doing, Ms. Sung Duk-mi?

623
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,120
It's a pinwheel.

624
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,400
You're adorable when you smile.

625
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,680
Director,

626
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:27,120
Professor Yang is the most recognized art restorer in Korea.

627
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,720
I'm sure Lee Sol's work will be restored to its former glory.

628
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,000
Don't worry.

629
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,040
I'm sorry.

630
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,120
I've been too lost in my own thoughts.

631
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,320
No, don't say that.

632
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:45,000
I was also sad to see those artworks stacked in the warehouse.

633
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,880
Those works were once

634
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,160
someone's happiness and joy,

635
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,000
but now they're there, neglected.

636
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,680
Let us??

637
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,280
?好ot end up discarded in a warehouse.

638
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,600
Let's always look at each other, take interest in each other,

639
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,080
and discover each other.

640
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,560
Ah, what great weather.

641
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,840
Is it good?

642
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,120
I think this is the feel we're going to go with.

643
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,400
Ah, I think that's nice. It goes well with this, too.

644
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,400
I think it'll go with that one here, too.

645
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,640
Hello, Director.

646
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,120
What? I'll let Si-an know, too.

647
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Alright.

648
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,000
Was that Ryan?

649
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,040
Yes, it's about Lee Sol's works.

650
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,440
He found one more piece.

651
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,560
Really?

652
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,040
I should go home and ask him about it tonight.

653
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:19,080
Don't interrupt him, he's probably with his girlfriend.

654
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,480
Anyway, lucky him.

655
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,560
He gets to spend the whole day with his girlfriend.

656
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,480
Ms. Choi's going to misunderstand.

657
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,680
It just seems like she's there often.

658
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,480
- Okay. - Si-an, you saw them, too.

659
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,720
In the middle of the day, they were like this in the elevator...

660
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,960
They really were.

661
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,040
I think we should go with something like this.

662
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,280
Brother, can I see Lee Sol's painting tomorrow?

663
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,440
It's got a bit of damage.

664
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,160
We'll have to restore it first.

665
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,880
Damage? How much?

666
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,000
I have a meeting with an art restorer tomorrow,

667
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,840
so I'll let you know once the results are out.

668
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,000
Alright.

669
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,480
Curator Sung told me that

670
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,320
he's the most recognized expert in Korea,

671
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,160
so there's no need to worry.

672
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,760
Alright.

673
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,880
I really want to see it,

674
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,440
all nine works by Lee Sol on exhibit in one place.

675
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,400
Ah! That collector who purchased Lee Sol's art has

676
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,000
agreed to lend it, right?

677
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,080
Yes, we'll have it soon.

678
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,680
I can't wait to see it.

679
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,120
Would you like to have chicken?

680
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,480
If you don't want to, uh??

681
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,760
Try saying, "You want chicken?"

682
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,200
You want chicken?

683
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,960
You want chicken?

684
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,720
See, it's nice to talk casually. It's more comfortable.

685
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,440
Order it boneless, please.

686
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,080
Professor, will it be possible to finish by the exhibition?

687
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,320
I'll have to make it possible.

688
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,080
Don't worry, the damage isn't as severe as it appears to be.

689
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,720
Send it to my lab.

690
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,160
Alright.

691
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,160
We leave it in your hands, Professor.

692
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,480
Thank you, Professor.

693
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,600
See you.

694
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:28,080
Director, what are you doing after work today?

695
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,400
Is there anything you'd like to do?

696
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,200
I have to clean my place today.

697
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,080
Oh, then??

698
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,920
My boyfriend will be coming over, you see.

699
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,960
What?

700
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,560
Come to my penthouse after work today.

701
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,360
Oh, but don't come too early.

702
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,120
Since he knows, I'll just make it clear to him.

703
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,200
Still??Is this too much?

704
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,080
Should I put some away?

705
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,920
No, Sung Duk-mi. Be confident.

706
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,880
You already came out to him.

707
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,320
Then??

708
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,800
Maybe just one?

709
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,200
Oops! Sorry, Si-an.

710
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,320
Goodness.

711
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,440
Huh? Why's the door open?

712
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,680
Are you here al??

713
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:39,840
Mom.

714
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:46,360
So you left home saying you're an independent woman or whatever

715
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,640
so that you could do this, huh?

716
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,240
M-mom? It's not that.

717
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,240
I, your mom,

718
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,960
said I'd do what if I caught you fangirling again?

719
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:58,600
Mom, whoa! Calm down, and listen to me.

720
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,680
What happened is, this place is??

721
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,400
- Mom, No! - You little rascal!

722
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,600
Where are the scissors?

723
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,880
You! That idol you chase after, I'm going to catch him

724
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,120
and chop his hair off!

725
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,280
Mom! There are no scissors! No scissors!

726
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,760
That hurts! Don't!

727
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,960
Mom!

728
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,480
I'm not your mom. I won't be your mother!

729
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,680
If you're not my mother, why are you hitting me? You non-mother.

730
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,280
Non-mother?

731
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:37,160
Why you?? You didn't exactly do anything praiseworthy!

732
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,600
D-Director?

733
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,840
Hello.

734
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:59,160
You should've told me you had a guest coming.

735
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:05,120
But??What brings you here, Director Gold?

736
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:06,800
For museum-related stu??

737
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,080
Duk-mi and I are seeing each other.

738
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,480
You're in a relationship?

739
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,120
With my Duk-mi?

740
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:18,960
Yes, but it hasn't been long.

741
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,200
About why Duk-mi's place is like this is, uh??

742
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,400
It's all mine!

743
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,840
I'm a fan of that young fellow over there,

744
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:36,360
but I put all the goods here because Duk-mi's father hates it.

745
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,640
It surprised you, didn't it?

746
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,560
Mom,

747
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,760
Director Gold knows that I like idols.

748
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,480
He knows?

749
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,960
You know that she's like this?

750
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,640
- Yes. - Yet you still like her?

751
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,040
Yes.

752
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,440
The sight of Duk-mi fangirling??

753
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:05,320
that passionate side of her

754
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,160
is what made me fall for her.

755
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:08,280
Oh my goodness??

756
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:10,280
See? I told you.

757
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:13,120
Fangirling's not to blame for my not having a boyfriend.

758
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,600
When I put my mind into it, I??

759
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,960
Who said I was against you fangirling because of that?

760
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,400
It's because you always come home hurt.

761
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,640
Did you hear how she broke her arm in her last year of high school?

762
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,080
Yes, I was told she had to re-sit her college entrance exams.

763
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,560
- Well, what happened is??- Mom?

764
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:32,040
She went to some idol's concert and came home with a broken arm!

765
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,440
I appreciate how you're so understanding of my daughter,

766
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,840
but I don't want to see her hurt anymore.

767
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:39,160
That won't ever happen.

768
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,400
I'll make sure to protect her.

769
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:47,880
Then??

770
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,640
From now on, Duk-mi??

771
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:51,920
Let me take Mom home.

772
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,200
Mom, you must be tired after all that, huh?

773
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,160
Let's go. Let's go home and get some rest.

774
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,480
Get your bag. Come on!

775
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,480
You!

776
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,200
I'm sorry, it's all my fault.

777
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,920
If I see you come home with another broken arm,

778
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,880
I'll really chop off your hair!

779
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,440
And if you're going to clean your place, do a proper job.

780
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,480
If you can't, just call me.

781
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,600
Mom??

782
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,600
Ugh, you're heavy.

783
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,560
Mom, I love you. You know that, right?

784
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:34,840
I'm not taking that.

785
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:35,840
Go in.

786
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,120
Mom!

787
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,200
Go in!

788
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,480
It's a lot different from what you imagined, right?

789
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,520
Yes.

790
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,600
So??

791
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,000
Is it weird?

792
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Yes.

793
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:27,120
All you gave me is a quick caricature on paper,

794
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,080
but what's with this portrait?

795
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,560
And??

796
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,040
And the flowers I gave you.

797
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,000
Why are the flowers I gave you here?

798
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,560
You could've put them in the center, right here.

799
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,120
Can't you empty this row?

800
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,880
Oh, you even wrote out "Lion."

801
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:44,240
There's nothing here but goods related to Cha Si-an!

802
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:47,720
Are you getting jealous over Cha Si-an?

803
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,480
Jealous? Me? Jealous?

804
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
What was that?

805
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,120
Shutting you up, because you're too cute.

806
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,160
What's that water bottle?

807
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:09,480
Oh, I received that at a snapshot showcase

808
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,400
on April 3rd, 2019.

809
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,040
Did Mr. Cha Si-an share his water with you?

810
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,240
No.

811
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,280
Si-an threw that to me from the stage,

812
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,520
perfectly targeting it so that it flew right into my hands.

813
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,360
And this paper?

814
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,440
Oh, that's the confetti he threw from the stage.

815
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,920
The energy from there can still be felt, huh?

816
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,200
Yes, you're right.

817
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,160
And an excellent combination of colors, too.

818
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,920
Then should we head over to Exhibition Room 2?

819
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,400
This here is

820
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,120
the Fan Art Exhibition.

821
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,360
That is a surrealistic portrait of Mr. Cha Si-an,

822
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,040
depicting even his beauty within.

823
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,080
No.

824
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,000
Si-an's beauty is surreal,

825
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,160
and cannot possibly be conveyed on paper.

826
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Oh, and??

827
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,680
Oh, and??This is Kong.

828
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:59,360
Not only did I beat out heavy competition for that fansign

829
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:02,040
by buying only one single album, I also won this in a drawing!

830
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:08,720
Gosh, it feels so good coming out to you.

831
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,080
- But Miss Duk-mi. - Yes?

832
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:16,320
There's just one thing that's bugging me.

833
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:17,320
What?

834
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,720
I feel like we're not alone in this place.

835
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,040
It's cold outside. You want me to throw him out?

836
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,280
What happened to his neck?

837
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,280
His neck?

838
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,360
That stupid Eun-ki cut it off.

839
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,200
Good night.

840
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:12,360
Mom.

841
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,040
Let go of me!

842
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:25,960
I'm not your mother.

843
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,880
Hello?

844
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,120
Were you sleeping?

845
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,000
No, I wasn't.

846
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:09,360
It's still early. Why would I be sleeping?

847
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,040
What were you doing instead of sleeping?

848
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:19,000
Uh??I was working.

849
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,120
Until now?

850
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,160
Delegate to your subordinates.

851
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,760
Oh??

852
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:26,520
But our head curator's a little??

853
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,040
A little what?

854
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:30,880
A little too precious to make her work.

855
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,160
You can't sleep, can you?

856
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:43,960
Uh, you should go back to bed. Don't turn the lights on.

857
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,040
Director, where are you right now?

858
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,640
Director, I'm coming down. Wait right there.

859
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:34,720
Did you really come to see me?

860
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,080
Wow, I feel like I just won the lottery.

861
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:41,880
I thought fangirls never got lucky?

862
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,080
That's what I mean.

863
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:54,040
I'll get going. I got to see you, at least.

864
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:04,080
You really only came just to see me?

865
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,080
I'm all recharged now.

866
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,680
Sorry to have woken you up. Go in.

867
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:29,600
Miss Duk-mi?

868
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:49,720
It's okay.

869
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:58,440
We said there'd be no secrets between us.

870
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:02,240
So??

871
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,320
It's okay??

872
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,160
to cry.

873
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,480
(Her Private Life)

874
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:38,000
I'll keep you entertained all night, Director.

875
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,120
I think I was scammed yesterday.

876
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:45,000
Cancel the Celebrities' Collection exhibit.

877
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,160
I've never come across anything I couldn't get my hands on,

878
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:51,800
so I think there's just one thing left for me to do now.

879
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,400
I'm glad I came.

880
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,760
After building good memories with the person I love,

881
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:58,440
I no longer hate the place I used to hate.

882
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:00,120
Hi, Heo Yun-je.
