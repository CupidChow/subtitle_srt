00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,320
	You're going to do work again, right?

164
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,640
	Stendhal syndrome.

165
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,400
	After witnessing a great piece of art,

166
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,040
	you instantly feel??

167
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,160
	You instantly feel a variety of mental shocks or splitting.

168
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,280
	Hey!

169
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,160
	Stop it!

170
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,280
	Do you know how much this thing costs?

171
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,960
	$89.99?

172
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,360
	$12 wholesale.

173
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,920
	Did you really buy that picture because you liked it?

174
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,160
	Or because it was cheap?

175
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,120
	I liked it.

176
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,440
	Stop it.

177
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,920
	Now.

178
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,160
	To put it simply??

179
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,640
	Ever since you saw a picture,

180
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,720
	you can't draw, not even pick up a paintbrush.

181
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,480
	So that's how you were diagnosed with Stendhal syndrome.

182
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,600
	After 3 years of therapy, medication, and hypnosis,

183
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,320
	nothing changed.

184
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,080
	Thanks to an unskilled doctor.

185
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,640
	I accept that title.

186
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,160
	So, please stop coming.

187
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,120
	I give up, okay?

188
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,440
	Why? Why?

189
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,760
	You can give up on me, but I won't give up on you.

190
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,520
	I can't leave you as an unskilled doctor.

191
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,880
	You can do it, believe in yourself!

192
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,480
	Did you find out anything more about the picture?

193
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,560
	Have you heard of a K-pop star named Cha Si-an?

194
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,000
	White Ocean?

195
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,160
	My nieces love them.

196
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,880
	He owns a piece.

197
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,080
	Really?

198
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,000
	You still haven't found out the artist after 3 years.

199
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,840
	A K-pop star owns a piece?

200
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,680
	Hey, maybe it's a famous artist?

201
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,400
	Anyhow.

202
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,360
	Good.

203
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,000
	Go and ask him to show it to you.

204
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,960
	- Me? - Yes, you.

205
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,800
	Then, who?

206
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,080
	The reason why you can't draw? It's in that picture.

207
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,720
	There's no point in you coming to me??

208
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,800
	Relax. Relax...

209
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,840
	It's my last bit of advice as your physician.

210
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,600
	Stop bothering me

211
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,040
	and find out the artist, Lyan.

212
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,120
	It's not Lyan.

213
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,800
	Ryan.

214
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,160
	Ry. Ry??

215
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,040
	(Introducing the work_Kim Min-hyuk)

216
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,760
	Did you go somewhere after the VIP opening?

217
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,400
	I was looking for you, but you weren't there.

218
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,160
	Oh,

219
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,720
	there's a child I periodically sponsor

220
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,720
	and I went to see his talent show.

221
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,880
	You go to children's talent shows?

222
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,960
	What else do you do?

223
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,800
	Oh??

224
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,760
	I attend birthday parties

225
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,280
	and I send him good luck texts during exams.

226
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,440
	(White Ocean)

227
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,360
	Oh??Cu. Sung, you seem to like things like that.

228
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,080
	Is that why you want to do these new artist discoveries?

229
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,440
	You think you can sell tickets?

230
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,960
	Selling tickets is important,

231
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,680
	but discovering new artists with potential

232
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,960
	and presenting them to the world is also our??

233
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,640
	Cu. Sung.

234
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,800
	I prefer blue-chip to sleepers.

235
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,720
	A big, great blue-chip.

236
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,480
	Don't bother with this

237
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,920
	and go buy all of Ivanov's works.

238
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,480
	Oh, my arm hurts.

239
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,200
	We can't let that happen.

240
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,040
	Come on. Look.

241
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,920
	Look. Look.

242
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,880
	You have to start from the top, straight down.

243
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,480
	It gets crooked as you push.

244
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,680
	From the top. Press down firmly.

245
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,880
	Okay?

246
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,960
	Okay.

247
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,400
	You can tell you studied abroad.

248
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,280
	Why are you mentioning that all of a sudden?

249
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,160
	- It's just??- Are you making fun of me?

250
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,160
	That wasn't my intention.

251
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,440
	She's not doing it?

252
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,840
	One of these days, I will do it.

253
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,040
	What is that?

254
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,240
	This?

255
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,000
	A big, great blue-chip.

256
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,360
	She wants me to pick it up at the auction.

257
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,440
	Safe trip.

258
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,840
	A business trip?

259
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,480
	You said it'll slow down after the opening.

260
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,600
	Oh, I need to go to an auction.

261
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,160
	You wouldn't??

262
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,280
	Are you using a business trip as an excuse to follow around idols?

263
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,680
	Come on now.

264
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,040
	I don't have the time for that.

265
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,360
	Your kimchi jjigae is delicious today.

266
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,440
	If I catch you doing that one more time??

267
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,960
	I'll catch that twerp you follow,

268
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,720
	the whole set of them and shave their heads.

269
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,160
	He didn't do anything wrong.

270
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,760
	Of course, he did.

271
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,480
	You went to go see them before your college entrance exams

272
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,960
	and broke your arm.

273
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,080
	If you didn't have to re-take your exams, we could've

274
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,280
	sent you to study abroad before our family went broke.

275
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,160
	The reason why you're not an artist?

276
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,560
	It's because of your damn otaku ways.

277
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,120
	Who do you think I take after?

278
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,040
	What? How am I at fault?

279
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,880
	Did I send you to an academy

280
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,040
	or get you a tutor to help you become an otaku?

281
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,400
	Mom, the thing is,

282
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,160
	An otaku isn't made, she's born that way.

283
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,280
	I'm home.

284
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,600
	I'm home.

285
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,240
	I'm home.

286
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,440
	When you sow obsession, you reap an otaku, not a muggle.

287
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,440
	- What -gle? - Muggle.

288
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,120
	A non-magical person in Harry Potter.

289
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,080
	Otakus refer to non-otakus as muggles.

290
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,240
	It's because you and dad are otakus,

291
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,880
	that's why I'm an otaku.

292
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,440
	That's also otaku.

293
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,400
	How is this otaku? This is knitting.

294
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,080
	Look.

295
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,880
	This, this, this and this??

296
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,800
	Growing up, Eun-ki and I only wore knitted sweaters.

297
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,040
	How is this just knitting? This is hardcore otaku.

298
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,080
	Oh, and dad?

299
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,160
	Dad?

300
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,720
	Knitting Otaku and Stone Otaku.

301
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,360
	We don't need a paternity test,

302
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,080
	you're clearly my parents.

303
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,480
	You already look like a boulder.

304
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,760
	Out of all things, you collect something that looks

305
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,240
	exactly like you? Throw all of them out!

306
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,680
	- I'm going to get going. - Duk-mi.

307
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,120
	Take some side dishes with you.

308
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,160
	These aren't side-dishes, are they?

309
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,280
	These are dad's stones.

310
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,640
	You eat like an oblivious cow.

311
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,640
	Go! I'll help you.

312
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,480
	No, I'm fine.

313
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,880
	You said it was heavy.

314
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,040
	I'll help you to your house.

315
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,120
	I'm worried about you coming back alone.

316
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,680
	Oh, I'm fine.

317
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,080
	- Eun-ki. Eun-ki. - He's asleep.

318
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,160
	Eun-ki, you twerp.

319
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,360
	Eun-ki.

320
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,120
	Can you help me carry this to my place?

321
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,360
	I'm busy.

322
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,360
	I need to pick some apples.

323
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,960
	- I'll give you $3. - Apples are going to rot.

324
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,120
	$4.

325
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,280
	Call me oppa.

326
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,200
	Oppa.

327
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,000
	$5.

328
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,240
	I'm going to get going.

329
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,760
	Don't forget to eat, you're too thin.

330
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,120
	I'll be back.

331
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,360
	You left home to live as an otaku?

332
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,480
	If mom finds out, you're dead.

333
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,320
	Come on now, I'm still her daughter.

334
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,000
	November 23rd, 2005. 2:13 AM.

335
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,160
	Have you forgotten?

336
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,160
	No.

337
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,320
	Mom, no.

338
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,160
	My hair's my strong suit.

339
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,000
	Oh, my hair.

340
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,400
	My hair??

341
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,360
	Hey,

342
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,120
	I changed my code.

343
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,560
	What? How'd you know?

344
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,440
	You're so predictable.

345
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,000

346

	or 140523, oppa's debut.

347
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,200
	Don't tell mom.

348
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,320
	You're dead if you do.

349
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,520
	Children are useless.

350
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,120
	How can you do this to Mom?

351
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,400
	- What? What? What? - What the??

352
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,880
	Hey!

353
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,920
	Don't touch him.

354
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,480
	Get away.

355
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,960
	You murderous bastard.

356
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,080
	I'm the crazy one for letting that twerp

357
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,280
	into this sacred place.

358
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,400
	Can't tell a cut-out from a real person.

359
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,200
	And you want to be a Judo fighter?

	Sung Duk.

361
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,520
	- What? - I'm leaving.

362
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,800

	It's a piece from 1987.

377

	He's Korean.

378

	Delicate lines and harmonious features.

	You want it?

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,000
	Pardon?

	No.

387

	I thought you wanted it.

388
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,640
	You just kept staring.

389
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,080
	Oh my,

390
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,680

	Hit it. Now is the time. Now.

	Yes, $30,000, sold.

	- Next, a painting on canvas??- Excuse me.

00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,560
	titled 'Poor Love'.

433
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,480
	Excuse me.

434
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
	Just a moment.

435
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,800
	Excuse me.

436
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,920
	That piece you just purchased,

437
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,240
	please let me have it.

438
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,000
	Is it your first time at an auction?

439
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,000
	I know that this sort of proposal must catch you off guard.

440
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,560
	But, this might actually be in your favor.

441
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,000
	Really?

442
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,160
	Yes.

443
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,000
	After you saw me successfully bid on Ivanov's pieces,

444
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,240
	you might've thought, 'Is she a professional?'

445
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,400
	'She must have a discerning eye.' And followed my lead in bidding.

446
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,400
	To be honest, Lee Sol's work

447
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,320
	has yet to gain any traction or value.

448
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,920
	It's my opinion that

449
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,040
	your bid was above its actual worth.

450
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,920
	I, of course, was bidding

451
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,000
	on the request of my client.

452
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,640
	So, if you decide to transfer it to me??

453
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,920
	How much do you know about the Ivanov

454
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,640
	that you just bought?

455
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,880
	Besides the price.

456
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,160
	I'm a professional in the industry.

457
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,440
	- Ivanov??- Began to have a severe

458
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,160
	tremor due to his alcoholism.

459
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,320
	You just bought that picture with terrible brushwork

460
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,040
	because of the name that's attached.

461
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,320
	It's easy to determine the price of something based on brand-name.

462
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,720
	Not everybody has a discerning eye

463
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,400
	to recognize talent without background info.

464
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,600
	So embarrassing.

465
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,680
	(Shanghai/Korea)

466
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,760
	If it wasn't for that freak.

467
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,480
	Why did I hesitate?

468
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,760
	You shouldn't check a ledger when it comes to love.

469
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,320
	So irritating.

470
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,680
	Ridiculous.

471
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,360
	Director.

472
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,160
	- Ms. Sung Duk-mi? - Yes.

473
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,720
	We're from the Seoul District Public Prosecutors' Office.

474

	and embezzlement of TK Group CEO, Kim Moo-san, have arrested

484
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,320
	Director Eom So-hye of Cheum Museum

485
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,360
	after discovering her involvement

486
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,680
	with the embezzlement charges.

487
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,000
	The prosecutors began in 2014??

488
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,040
	A slush fund?

489
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,040
	No.

490
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,640
	I've never even heard of one.

491
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,600
	I really don't know anything.

492
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,000
	Come on now.

493
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,840
	Oh, you scared me.

494
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,360
	You're home?

495
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,600
	Hey.

496
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,880
	Cheers.

497
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,680
	You okay?

498
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,760
	Of course.

499
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,560
	Sun-joo.

500
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,360
	There you go again.

501
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,080
	I'm not going anywhere.

502
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,840
	Sun-joo.

503
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,320
	You.

504
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,560
	Do you know what my favorite thing to do in the museum is?

505
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,640
	Receiving your paycheck?

506
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,360
	It's hanging the pieces

507
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,480
	on the museum walls.

508
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,680
	When I hang them there,

509
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,840
	people come and stop there

510
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:53,040
	to look and be inspired by what I hung up there.

511
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,120
	I really like it.

512
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:05,040
	How can someone like work that much?

513
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,160
	Your problem is working too hard.

514
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,000
	But, Sun-joo.

515
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,560
	It turns out that my position

516
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,040
	wasn't one that was inspiring people,

517
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,080
	but one that was growing a slush fund.

518
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,800
	Growing it well.

519
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,440
	I worked so hard, like an idiot.

520
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,160
	You didn't do it on purpose.

521
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,000
	You didn't know.

522
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,480
	Sun-joo, you know what

523
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,800
	really makes me angry?

524
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,080
	If??

525
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,560
	If I knew about it??

526
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,080
	If I knew everything,

527
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,320
	would I have stopped?

528
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,680
	Could I have stopped?

529
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,400
	Duk-mi.

530
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,200
	Could I have said I can't, I refuse to? Could I have?

531
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,440
	Don't cry. Wipe away those tears.

532
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,160
	Those bastards.

533
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,440
	I don't know what I've been doing.

534
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,400
	It's not your fault.

535
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,280
	You're making me cry because you're crying.

536
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,600
	Hello?

537
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,120
	Miss Lee.

538
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,040
	Is your best friend on a date?

539
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,760
	No.

540
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,040
	First,

541
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,800
	my friend does not meet men in real life.

542
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,560
	Dating is done through screens.

543
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,760
	Second.

544
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,800
	She dares to have a date in my caf矇?

545
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,360
	People can,

546
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,040
	but my friend can't.

547
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,280
	Miss Lee, you're married with children.

548
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,920
	I got married because I got pregnant.

549
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,080
	Ah??

	(GN/Lee Sang-hyun Department Head)

	GN Group brand marketing manager?

552
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,080
	Yes, the CEO's wife recommended you.

553
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,000
	She's best friends with Director Eom,

554
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,040
	so she frequented Cheum Museum.

555
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,000
	Oh??GN Group CEO's wife??

556
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,760
	Cu. Sung.

557
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,160
	- Ma'am. - Let go!

558
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,040
	I apologize.

559
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:04,200
	She spoke very highly of your capabilities.

560
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,640
	But brand marketing??

561
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,040
	What would be expected of me?

562
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,840
	It's similar to your position right now.

563
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,960
	We plan to launch

564

	joint business ventures with art foundations

	and public development projects with the cultural funds.

566
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,000
	I see.

567
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,480
	It sounds like it's a rewarding position.

568
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,440
	Oh and just so you know, our company motto

	everything past 40 hours is your time.

572

	A company that supports otakus?

573

	My parents own this building.

	Director, I need to speak to you about something.

578
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,080
	What could that be?

579
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,560
	I'm going to resign.

580
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,920
	Cu. Sung?

581
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,040
	How long have we worked together?

582
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,400
	After the museum opened,

583
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,600
	you fired about 12 curators

584
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,720
	and when no one applied,

585
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,400
	you gave me the job.

586
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,040
	So, we're on the 5th year.

587
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,080
	Has it been that long already?

588
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,160
	Yes.

589
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,360
	Cu. Sung, you've worked so hard.

590
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,120
	I have.

591
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,720
	- Now that you mention it??- I know.

592
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,880
	I know that Cheum has survived

593
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,600
	all because of you.

594
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,240
	Even here.

595
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,120
	Exhibit layout, caption,

596
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:07,240
	even the wall color and lighting.

597
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,520
	Every inch of this place has been touched by you.

598
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,120
	To be honest,

599
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,240
	I started this gallery because I was sick and tired of hearing

600
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,080
	Moo-san, my husband, brag about making money.

601
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,040
	So, what do I know?

602
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,080
	Without you, Cu. Sung,

603
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,040
	we would've closed our doors, long ago.

604
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,240
	- To be honest??- To be honest,

605
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,160
	I'm going to resign.

606
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,160
	What? Resign?

607
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,000
	My husband, Moo-san is going to jail.

608
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,440
	I'm only resigning without regret

609
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,040
	because Cheum has you, Cu. Sung.

610
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:46,040
	If you weren't here, I would've shut this down right away.

611
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,080
	Cu. Sung.

612
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,640
	Who do you think would

613
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,800
	look good in Cheum Museum's Director's seat?

614
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,080
	Well??

615
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,120
	Someone like me.

616
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,040
	Someone that loves Cheum as much as I do.

617
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:07,760
	Someone who's been with Cheum.

618
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,000
	Who?

619
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,120
	Then??

620
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:23,440
	I think that kind of person should be the director.

621
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,640
	Do you understand what I'm saying?

	Leave your job.

629
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,920
	You said it was 2 years at most.

630
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,560
	Do you know what you get when you search for Cheum Museum?

631

	Slush fund.

632
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,760
	I worked tirelessly

633

	for 5 years as a curator, working day and night.

634

	But, it's a slush fund.

635
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,120
	I can't give up now.

636
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,360
	I'm going to change it all back.

637

647
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,840
	Why do you always hide it?

648

	I'm not going to be your average fan.

649
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,040
	One of these days, I'll go pro, super pro,

650
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,720
	and I'll make damn sure we cross paths.

651
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,120
	Damn sure.

652
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,040
	You damn sure don't have a conscience.

653
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,000
	Go.

654
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,240
	Damn sure we cross paths.

655
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,000

	Let's sit for now.

662
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,560
	- Did you see this? - Yeah, I did.

663
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,360
	Huh? Woah.

664
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,320
	Did you all see this? Si-an's departure preview?

665
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,200
	- Who's the Home Ma? - Sindy.

00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,160
	She must've followed him to the U.S. and taken the same flight.

670
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,680
	That's stalking.

671
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,520
	Si-an oppa probably likes T.R.T.S. more.

672
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,640
	Of course.

673
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:42,880
	Si-an got to where he is

674
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,080
	because T.R.T.S. was there.

	Before they official made their debut, she made videos

679
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,520
	and subtitled them herself. She made the Si-an Meal.

680
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:03,120
	I'll be okay if Si-an had a 1:1 fan meeting with T.R.T.S.

681
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,120
	Me too.

	What are you doing, right now?

701
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,560
	I don't think that's something

702
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,880
	who sat on me and ripped my clothes, should be saying.

703

	But that doesn't mean you should take it out on my camera.

	Camera?

705
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,160
	Isn't that camera too nice

706
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,880
	to take a picture of that twerp?

707
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,120
	That twerp?

708
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:44,120
	Did you just call Si-an, that twerp?

709
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,280
	I was the one that messed up, why are you taking it out on him?

710

	Oh, you care about manners, do you?

	So pretty, so pretty.

	The man that called our Si-an, that twerp.

730

	He does seem familiar.

731

	I just can't put my finger on it.

	We'll have a formal press conference soon.

806
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,480
	Please get out of the way.

807
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,360
	Let us get through. Please move.

808
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,160
	Regarding the slush fund??

809
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,120
	Why did you do that to me?

810
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,160
	Tell me.

811
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,160
	Why did you?

812
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,720
	I thought about it a lot

813
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:08,280
	and I still can't figure it out.

814
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,200
	Tell me.

815
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:14,520
	For 5 years,

816
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,560
	I worked like a dog under you.

817
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,480
	Tell me.

818
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,960
	Say something.

819
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:27,120
	Say anything!

820
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,160
	You.

821
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,960
	You insulted me.

822
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,080
	You were my dog.

823
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:55,240
	I can't let the woman who pulled my hair, steal you.

824
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,000
	Cu. Sung?

825
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:18,480
	Is it heavy?

826
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,320
	Why'd you bring that?

827
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,160
	I don't really like things like that.

828
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,840
	Well, since you did, leave it.

829
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:31,440
	How are you feeling?

830
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:34,880
	Moo-san said my resignation was not enough.

831
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,560
	He wants me to act like I'm a patient.

832
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,760
	Did you see the news?

833
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,680
	I really looked sick, right?

834
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,480
	Yeah??Oh,

835
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:48,320
	about that successor Director.

836
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:51,000
	I chose a successor that would

837
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,080
	be perfect for the press.

838
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:58,040
	You just continue doing what you've been doing.

839
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:05,120
	You want a banana?

840
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:15,800
	The marketing manager position has already been filled.

841
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,920
	- Embarrassing. - Why are you embarrassed?

842
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,600
	She's the one who sold her soul.

843
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,120
	She has no conscience.

844
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:44,280
	For 5 years, I've known this to be true.

845
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,960
	But I still believed her.

846
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,040
	Director Eom is right.

847
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:52,040
	Maybe my greed got the better of me.

848
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:55,760
	Don't put a positive spin on some BS.

849
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,040
	When reality sucks, what do we do?

850
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:04,800
	- Otaku. - Yes, otaku. Let's go.

851
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,080
	- Where? - Pilgrimage.

852
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,080
	Pilgrimage.

853
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:11,080
	When fans go visiting sites visited by

854
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:13,640
	favorite idol stars and finding traces of them.

855
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,040
	This is crazy.

856
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,160
	Wait for me.

857
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,560
	It's at the front desk as per your request.

858
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,560
	- We're checking in. - Sun-joo.

859
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,080
	Let's just leave.

860
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:11,120
	The suite room that Si-an was in is really expensive.

861
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:15,480
	- Duk-mi. - Yeah?

862
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:17,400
	My parents own a building.

863
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,360
	Oh my.

864
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,800
	Wait for me!

865
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:30,040
	(Employment Agreement)

866
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,440
	- Thank you. - Sir,

867
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:35,200
	as per Secretary Kim's request, we changed your room.

868
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,000
	Here's the key to the suite.

869
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,120
	Welcome, what can I help you with?

870
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:49,160
	We would like suite 3250.

871
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,440
	Oh no,

872
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:54,160
	that room was just taken by another guest.

873
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,560
	Just now?

874
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,800
	Would you like another room?

875
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,120
	No.

876
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,080
	I thought I was going to finally benefit from having a rich friend.

877
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,840
	I guess today is not the day.

878
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,720
	Thank you for thinking of me today.

879
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,480
	Treat me next time.

880
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,240
	There's no going back in my otaku life.

881
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,640
	We just need to keep pushing forward.

882
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,360
	Where are you going?

883
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,160
	Where are you going? Forward??Hey!

884
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:21,960
	Ms., this is your bag, correct?

885
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:23,080
	Yes, thank you.

886
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,600
	Excuse me.

887
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,240
	Pardon me.

888
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:51,720
	You're in suite 3250, correct?

889
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:55,320
	Can we switch rooms?

890
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:57,520
	- Pardon? - You're surprised, I know.

891
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:58,800
	I know it's a lot to ask.

892
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,680
	Oh, are you aware of that?

893
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:02,480
	Then perhaps you shouldn't be asking.

894
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:07,280
	I wouldn't just ask you without offering something in return.

895
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,000
	Something for your troubles, perhaps?

896
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,640
	Is there an amount in your head?

897
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:14,120
	I'm just in the middle of a situation, that I can't talk about.

898
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,800
	What is your situation?

899
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,160
	It's just that??

900
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,280
	What situation could be so dire

901
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,400
	that I need to stand for this rudeness?

902
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,400
	I've already told you, that I can't talk about it.

903
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,240
	You don't want it?

904
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,040
	I'll tell you.

905
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:36,800
	If I do, then will you switch rooms?

906
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,760
	So, the thing is??

907
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,360
	Pilgrimage.

908
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:43,080
	So??

909
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:45,400
	there's someone I like

910
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,120
	and that person's stayed in that room before,

911
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:51,720
	but it's kind of hard to see each other in person.

912
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,240
	Wait, have we met somewhere?

913
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:18,000
	Cheers.

914
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:29,440
	Hey, I'm the one who got backstabbed by Director Eom.

915
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,360
	Why do you look like you lost a nation?

916
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:33,920
	I did come here to cheer you up??

917
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,640
	But I got excited to be an otaku with you again??

918
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:41,040
	It reminded me of how I was before I was married.

919
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,320
	Why did I get married?

920
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:48,080
	Come on now, you're otaku over your son.

921
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:51,120
	Gun-woo is cute.

922
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:53,320
	Show some love to the Producer too.

923
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,560
	He's your soulmate.

924
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:55,880
	Duk-mi.

925
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:59,080
	The one person you need to meet in life

926
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:01,160
	isn't your soulmate.

927
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:02,440
	Then, who?

928
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,280
	Your otaku-mate.

929
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,560
	Oh, come on.

930
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:07,840
	What time is it?

931
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,800
	Oh, Si-an has his performance today.

932
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,440
	I must've gone nuts, I totally forgot.

933
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,720
	Grab this.

934
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,040
	This is driving me nuts.

935
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,440
	Someone that she loves.

936
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:27,120
	So pretty, so pretty.

937
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,800
	There's someone I like.

938
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:36,680
	but it's kind of hard to see each other in person.

939
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:43,680
	Look at that expression.

940
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,080
	Oh my.

941
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:54,400
	Thinking that a loved one is of the opposite gender

942
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:55,960
	is prejudiced and discrimination.

943
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:00,080
	And on top of that, that woman had the courage

944
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:06,240
	to tell her truth and I thought she was lying.

945
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:10,960
	I'm so disappointed in myself.

946
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
	Don't go.

947
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:20,800
	Love you.

948
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:22,760
	He's gone.

949
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:27,400
	That was fun.

950
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,160
	- Bathroom. - Okay.

951
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:39,600
	Hold on.

952
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,320
	Wow.

953
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,440
	I think I might cry.

954
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:58,080
	This makes no sense.

955
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,240
	Hey.

956
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:00,560
	Sun-joo, I love you.

957
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:02,680
	It's so comfy.

958
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,280
	This smells like Si-an.

959
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,280
	Is Si-an here?

960
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,200
	Same angle.

961
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,560
	Gloomy mode shot.

962
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:12,600
	Okay.

963
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,520
	Small mouth.

964
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,440
	Pretend you're drinking, I'll take the pic.

965
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,080
	One, two, three.

966
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:22,640
	Did you see his skin?

967
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,360
	We locked eyes.

968
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:28,600
	- He was looking at me. - Don't kid yourself.

969
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,080
	Hey.

970
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,120
	This is why you need to be young to be an otaku.

971
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:35,920
	I'm getting tired just from laughing too much.

972
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:39,120
	But I had a great time thanks to the otaku.

973
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,000
	I'll pay you back as soon as I find another job.

974
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,520
	You're really going to quit?

975
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:44,520
	Of course.

976
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:46,920
	After all the insults and humiliation from Director Eom,

977
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:48,040
	you think I'm going to just keep taking it?

978
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:52,480
	I'm going to throw my resignation in her face tomorrow morning.

979
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:53,960
	Then what are you going to do?

980
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,520
	Do you have a plan?

981
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,080
	Of course.

982
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:02,880
	I'm going to start off by buying a lotto ticket at the store.

983
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,360
	Then I'm going to win.

984
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:09,360
	How is that a plan?

985
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:13,760
	A plan first and foremost should consider reality and probability.

986
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,160
	That's unlike you.

987
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:19,040
	You need to dream first. A ridiculous dream.

988
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,680
	Hey, what about being the president?

989
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:23,240
	That's right.

990
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:26,480
	If I win the lotto.

991
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,840
	Si-an is going to have an album signing soon.

992
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,760
	I'll get a thousand copies for me and a thousand for you.

993
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:33,000
	I'll get exactly 2,000 copies and go to the album signing.

994
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
	Oh and then I'll go to the set of his drama.

995
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:40,000
	Food truck, snack truck, coffee truck and a churros truck.

996
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
	Oh, hold on. Why did the guy who was here, give us this room?

997
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,080
	I'm not sure.

998
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,560
	But I've definitely seen him somewhere.

999
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,360
	I'm sure of it, but I don't remember.

1000
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:54,880
	I've been forgetful ever since Gun-woo was born.

1001
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,920
	Don't blame him.

1002
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:59,560
	You were always like that. Face blindness.

1003
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:00,720
	Hey! Hey?

1004
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:02,560
	- Hey. - Hey, hey?

1005
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,600
	Hey, do you want to write your resignation now?

1006
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,560
	Dear Director Eom So-hye.

1007
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,680
	Dear? Forget that.

1008
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:12,440
	Oh, come on.

1009
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:14,360
	Let's talk about it later.

	You work here?

1015
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,080
	Yes, just a moment.

1016
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:47,080
	What can I help you with?

1017
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,240
	You want it?

1018
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,000
	You want it?

	Let me introduce you to the new Director.

1022
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,160
	Weak to authority?

1023
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:03,840
	You can just keep that up.

1024
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:04,840
	Director.

1025
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:07,080

	Trust, reputation and??

1028

	Peace within Cheum Museum.

1029

	- Get out. You're fired. - Fired?

1030
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:17,600
	You don't know White Ocean's Cha Si-an?

1031
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,360
	Why start something you can't finish?

1032
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,080
	Who taught you to do that?

1033
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:22,800
	- Curator Sung. - I had my revenge.

1034
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,040
	Against the lion?

1035
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,560
	You think I'm going to leave quietly?
