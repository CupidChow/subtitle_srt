00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,320
(Her Private Life)

2
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,080
(Her Private Life)

3
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,680
How old are you?

4
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,120
Seven.

5
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,120
I'm seven, too, and he's also seven.

6
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,560
I'm Sung Duk-mi,

7
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,640
and he's Nam Eun-ki.

8
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,520
What's your name?

9
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,160
I'm??

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,720
Heo Yun-je.

11
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,120
Are you waiting for your mom?

12
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,960
Do you want to play with us?

13
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,000
(Episode 15: You are my home)

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,120
(You're where I'm meant to be)

15
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,080
Did you sleep well?

16
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,240
Did you sleep well?

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,520
Are you still sleeping?

18
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,040
It's too early to get up.

19
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,440
But it's your birthday.

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,240
Happy Birthday.

21
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,680
Thank you.

22
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,760
You're not even opening your eyes.

23
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,160
Don't you want to see me?

24
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,360
Wow, you're the first thing I see as soon as I open my eyes.

25
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,440
What a fantastic birthday.

26
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,160
We should get up now.

27
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,840
It's my birthday. I don't have to get up.

28
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,000
Fine, sleep some more.

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,480
Should we just stay like this and not go to work?

30
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,960
How about becoming unemployed together?

31
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,000
We could resign.

32
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,120
- I'll get up. - I was being serious.

33
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,160
Let's do this all day and not go to work.

34
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,080
- No? - No.

35
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,160
Why not?

36
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,720
Because it's such a waste.

37
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,080
I want to treasure this moment.

38
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,960
Duk-mi.

39
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,320
You're really damn??

40
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,400
Beautiful, even in the morning, right?

41
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,880
I was going to say gross??

42
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,080
Gross?

43
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,560
Don't be scared, now.

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,040
I'll still be able to go to work today, right?

45
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,560
- Here we go. - Alright.

46
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,800
Why are you quivering?

47
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
No, I'm not.

48
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,880
You don't trust me?

49
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,120
What's all this?

50
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,000
It's your birthday, so I need to make you seaweed soup.

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,440
- You're going to make it for me? - Yes.

52
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,920
But what are these hot peppers and ginseng?

53
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,240
Hot pepper's something you think tastes good,

54
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,080
and the ginseng's something that's good for you.

55
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,160
Oh??

56
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,640
But I don't think these guys should make it into our soup??

57
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,280
Really?

58
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,440
Then I'll make you kimbap with these later.

59
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,440
Alright!

60
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,440
Yum, ginseng kimbap.

61
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,680
This much should be fine, right?

62
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,160
Director, this thing has 60 servings,

63
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,520
so with that, we'll have plenty for 20 people.

64
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,760
Then??

65
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,760
About this much?

66
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,720
I'll cook it up real nice, just wait a little while.

67
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,320
Yes, I trust that you will.

68
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,600
This one?

69
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,000
Yes, it's nice.

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,040
Oh! You should get changed, too.

71
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,480
I was planning to just go in this.

72
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,320
I'm starting to think we're sharing too much of

73
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,000
our private lives with the museum staff.

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,120
Are you embarrassed, shy boy?

75
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,320
Then wear something of mine. I'll pick it out for you.

76
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,440
Oh, no.

77
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,640
I can drop by my house and change into my own clothes.

78
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,120
But I think this would look nice on you.

79
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,600
What is it?

80
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,760
What do you want?

81
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,080
I'll do it for you.

82
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,760
Have you ever done it before?

83
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,320
I'm Ryan Gold.

84
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,120
Beautiful.

85
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,760
Let me put some on you, too.

86
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,200
I think you need a little more.

87
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,600
Do I have to go to work looking like this?

88
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,920
You look nice.

89
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,360
You look like you've got some life in you now.

90
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,760
Can I be queen for the day, since it's my birthday?

91
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,160
I look like a celebrity, don't I?

92
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,720
Oppa, have some of this as you go.

93
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,200
Thanks, Sun-joo.

94
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,800
Are you working? Is this a proposal for a new show?

95
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,160
No.

96
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,920
I said I'd live to make you smile from now on, didn't I?

97
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,040
So I was thinking about what I could do with you,

98
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,000
and made a proposal.

99
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,560
You even wrote a proposal?

100
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,680
Have a look.

101
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,960
The title is "How About Camping?"

102
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,880
- Camping? - Yes.

103
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,040
Every weekend, you, Gun-woo and I will go camping.

104
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,760
We'll cook outdoors,

105
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,200
watch the stars at night and just chill.

106
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,280
But do we have a tent?

107
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,240
We should get one.

108
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,120
And there are so many other things you need for camping.

109
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,160
You need pots, burners, and??That's right, lantern.

110
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,720
Oppa??

111
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,920
You know that I'm particular about where I sleep.

112
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,000
Oh, I forgot. Then, uh??

113
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,560
Should we just buy an RV?

114
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,880
Uh-uh.

115
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,120
- Anything else? - Of course I have others.

116
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,680
The title of the second proposal is

117
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,160
"Fishing Over Flowers."

118
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,000
- Fishing? - Yes.

119
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,080
I hear night fishing is great.

120
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,000
But rather than fishing,

121
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,920
it's about spending time together and talking to each other.

122
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,120
And at night, we'll sleep in tents??

123
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,080
Ugh, again with the tents?

124
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,440
If sleeping in tents is not your thing,

125
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,840
then I guess an RV is the way to go?

126
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,000
- Oppa. - Yeah?

127
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,040
How about instead of doing things to please me

128
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,000
you just try not to do things I don't like?

129
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,360
- Not do things you don't like? - Yes.

130
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,160
Okay, I totally got it.

131
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,960
Then??In order to find out what you don't like,

132
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,400
we need to spend some time chatting, so the fishing??

133
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,520
Don't, I said don't! Just stop it already.

134
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,680
Alright, alright.

135
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm going to work!

136
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,520
Let's talk a lot tonight.

137
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,640
About what you don't like??

138
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,640
while fishing.

139
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,080
Just go! Go! Go!

140
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,680
What's wrong with him?

141
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,920
If laughing in disbelief is still considered laughing,

142
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,480
then your husband has succeeded.

143
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,160
Isn't my Seung-min just too cute?

144
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,080
This is the final layout of our exhibition space.

145
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,160
Did you run a simulation on the expected route?

146
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,160
Yes, we think Mr. Cha Si-an's hall will be the busiest,

147
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,000
so we assigned him the biggest space.

148
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,360
Oh, the partitions will be up starting next week.

149
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,040
Once they're up, we'll start painting the walls.

150
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,080
How about you go for a stronger color

151
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,160
for the main entrance wall as an accent?

152
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,680
Oh. Sure.

153
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,280
How's the recruiting going?

154
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,440
We've already recruited our docents and helpers,

155
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,920
and training will begin next week.

156
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,040
Alright, so we're almost set.

157
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,480
Ah! You need to prepare a speech for the opening day.

158
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,560
Got it.

159
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,280
- Duk-mi! - Yes?

160
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,440
I know we're both busy, but this is our first birthday together.

161
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,160
You'll make time this evening, right?

162
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,080
I'll see what I can do.

163
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,120
What's our goal for today?

164
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,000
To get off work on time.

165
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,120
Your mom said to wait at the playground?

166
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,040
Yes, she said she'd come soon.

167
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,160
What's your name?

168
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,280
Yun-je.

169
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,680
Heo Yun-je.

170
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,720
Yun-je, you must be hungry.

171
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,840
Do you want to come to our house for dinner?

172
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,400
What is it?

173
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,760
Duk-mi and Eun-ki will be there, too.

174
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,720
I have to wait for my mom at the playground.

175
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,480
Um??

176
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,040
Then I'll wait here instead,

177
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,640
and let you know once your mother is here.

178
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,760
How does that sound?

179
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,040
Alright, off you go to eat!

180
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,000
- And wash your hands! - Okay!

181
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,600
Gosh, what do you keep looking at this for?

182
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,880
Why do you think Eun-ki asked about his name?

183
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,160
He said he just did.

184
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,120
Eun-ki??

185
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,040
That boy has never once mentioned that day,

186
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,800
not even by accident.

187
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,320
You've no idea how grateful and guilty I've felt about that.

188
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:14,280
I think there's something he can't tell me.

189
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,120
If it's something he can't tell you, he won't say it.

190
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,160
And if it's something he must, he'll say it.

191
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,320
Just wait.

192
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,000
Duk-mi, do you want to go in first?

193
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Why? Let's go in together.

194
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,120
I think we're a little late for our reservation.

195
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,440
Oh. Sure.

196
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,160
Welcome. Do you have a reservation?

197
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,120
Yes, under Ryan Gold.

198
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,360
Happy birthday to you!

199
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,040
Happy birthday to you!

200
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,240
Happy birthday, Duk-mi.

201
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,680
Mr. Cha Si-an??

202
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,960
First, make a wish.

203
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,640
I have no more wishes now.

204
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,120
Oh!

205
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,000
I know my brother's pretty awesome,

206
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,280
but he's going to be a little late after planning this all.

207
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,800
Don't hold it against him today.

208
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,280
Director Gold's going to be late?

209
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,160
Yes, he said he was running late

210
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,400
and asked me to keep you company in the meantime.

211
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,600
That's why I ran here, at the speed of light.

212
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,160
It's nice that you're seeing Director Gold and Ms. Sung Duk-mi,

213
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,640
but I hope you're not interrupting them.

214
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,320
Mom, what's with "Director Gold"?

215
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,720
It's Yun-je. Heo Yun-je.

216
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,160
And what if I do interrupt them?

217
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,120
A little is fine.

218
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,040
Alright.

219
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,120
Here's your mission.

220
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,120
Go to the next room alone, most definitely alone,

221
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,800
and sing happy birthday to Ms. Sung Duk-mi.

222
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,320
I'm running a little late.

223
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,120
Who is it?

224
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,960
It's brother.

225
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,040
Mom, one minute.

226
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,720
Really?

227
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,480
Yes! I didn't even know today was your birthday.

228
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,760
If I'd known, I would've prepared a gift.

229
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,840
My Si-an??You're the gift!

230
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,160
One moment.

231
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,760
Do you like my present?

232
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,680
- Is it brother? - Yes.

233
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,800
Director, I'm the happiest fangirl in the world right now.

234
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,040
Thank you so much!

235
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,120
But just 20 minutes, alright?

236
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,760
And don't get more excited than when you're with me.

237
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,520
It's Ms. Sung Duk-mi's birthday so you should spend it together

238
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,800
just the two of you, instead of calling us.

239
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,040
It's alright.

240
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,640
I'm sure Duk-mi will like this, too.

241
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,200
Let's wait for 20 minutes and go over together.

242
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,240
20 minutes?

243
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,680
Because it's nice,

244
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,680
being here just the two of us.

245
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,640
Thank you.

246
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,240
For calling me mom.

247
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,360
To be honest with you, I still find it a little awkward.

248
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,360
But I promise I'll get used to it with time.

249
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,040
Though it may be awkward for you, too,

250
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,160
please call me by my name.

251
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,640
Yun-je.

252
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,080
Yes, Mother.

253
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,520
It's Ms. Sung Duk-mi's birthday today but I'm getting a gift.

254
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,000
September 12th.

255
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,160
Your birthday, Yun-je, is September 12th.

256
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,120
September 12th??

257
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,440
Let's spend it together this year, no matter what.

258
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,680
By the way, I brought some photos along.

259
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,240
There aren't many, but??

260
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,960
This is how I remembered you all these years.

261
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,880
I always wondered how much you'd grown up when you were 10,

262
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,120
and what you looked like when you were twenty.

263
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,560
You have no idea how much I missed you.

264
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,000
I'll show you.

265
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,280
What I looked like when I was ten, and when I was twenty.

266
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,160
I've got quite a lot of pictures.

267
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,160
I see.

268
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,240
Do you see that?

269
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,960
Ah, Director!

270
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,040
Hello.

271
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,080
Happy birthday, Duk-mi.

272
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,440
Thank you.

273
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,920
You're very excited, aren't you?

274
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,920
I am?

275
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,640
Of course I am, to see you.

276
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,040
- Duk-mi. - Yes?

277
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,080
- Ms. Sung Duk-mi? - Yes?

278
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,040
Are you really going to make your boyfriend drive

279
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,800
and have your eyes glued to Mr. Cha Si-an's photos?

280
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,480
Uh, no! I was looking at this photo just now.

281
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,960
I was marveling at how hot my boyfriend is.

282
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,800
To tell you the truth??

283
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,480
I did prepare a birthday gift for you, but??

284
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,080
Besides the fan meeting?

285
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,160
But they said it hasn't been delivered yet.

286
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,400
I'm sorry, but could you wait a little longer?

287
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,160
What you did for me today is more than enough,

288
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,000
but I'll wait, since you said you've prepared this, too.

289
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,920
Oh, I have something to show you.

290
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,520
It's me, when I was little.

291
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,760
Mother gave it to me just now.

292
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,960
Aww, how cute!

293
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,280
So you've been cute and adorable all your life.

294
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,360
Do you want to display it in your room?

295
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,120
Could I really?

296
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,640
Then I'll scan these and return them to you.

297
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,560
They're something dear to you, so I can't just have them.

298
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Show me pictures of you when you were little.

299
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,760
I'll give you a whole album.

300
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,120
I was really happy today.

301
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,560
I was happy, too.

302
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,880
Who's Heo Yun-je?

303
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,280
She says it's Director Gold's Korean name.

304
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,640
Director Ryan?

305
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,080
Yeah, I guess he found out his pre-adoption name.

306
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,640
What's your name?

307
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,760
Yun-je.

308
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,080
Heo Yun-je.

309
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,800
Heo Yun-je??

310
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,480
So cute!

311
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,560
Aww, so cute.

312
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,200
Hey, Nam Eun-ki. What's up?

313
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,040
I've something to ask you.

314
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,440
Can I see you for a second?

315
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,880
Um, sure.

316
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,160
- Here's your present. - What is it?

317
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,080
Chicken feet? I love these.

318
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,120
So, what is it that you wanted to ask me?

319
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,400
Uh, it's about Director Ryan.

320
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,680
Oh, you're still hung up on that?

321
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,160
Don't worry, I already explained everything.

322
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,160
No! It's just that I heard his Korean name by chance??

323
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,120
This is a photo of Lion when he was little!

324
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,360
Super cute, huh?

325
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,440
Heo Yun-je??

326
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,000
How do you know that name?

327
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,560
Oh, you heard from Sun-joo.

328
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,280
I should get going.

329
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,440
What, just like that? You said you had something to ask.

330
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,440
Oh??

331
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,040
Um, I forgot.

332
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,480
But you know me. I'm always like that.

333
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,040
I'll get going then, enjoy.

334
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,240
You want me to eat the chicken feet alone?

335
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,080
- Thanks for the food. - Sure.

336
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,000
What do we do?

337
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,800
Let go of me! I'm not your mother.

338
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,160
Mrs. Sung??

339
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,120
Mrs. Sung!

340
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,200
Mrs. Sung, we're going to see Duk-mi and Duk-su, right?

341
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,080
Right? At the hospital, right?

342
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,800
To tell them to get better soon.

343
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,120
Mrs. Sung!

344
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,200
Mrs. Sung!

345
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,680
Let go of me!

346
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,000
- I'm not your mother. - Mrs. Sung!

347
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,560
Mrs. Sung!

348
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,200
Mrs. Sung!

349
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,800
Mrs. Sung!

350
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,240
Mrs. Sung!

351
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,360
Mrs. Sung!

352
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,520
Mrs. Sung!

353
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,920
One moment.

354
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,240
Let me breathe.

355
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,680
Eun-ki, will this be okay?

356
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,280
Mom, I'll do the talking.

357
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,640
You just stay with me.

358
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,400
What about you?

359
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,040
Will you be okay?

360
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,800
Let's go.

361
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,120
This is about this boy, isn't it?

362
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,200
When you asked me his name,

363
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,360
I sensed that something was up.

364
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,240
I've been preparing myself since hearing you were coming, too.

365
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,200
Eun-ki??

366
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,080
This is something I should know, isn't it?

367
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,160
Then go on, Mom's alright.

368
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,600
Mom.

369
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,440
This may shock you,

370
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,240
sadden you, and leave you in distress.

371
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,720
But Mom, please remember this.

372
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,560
You're a good person,

373
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,040
and what happened that day??

374
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,600
You had no other choice.

375
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,160
Director Ryan??

376
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,360
Director Ryan??

377
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,800
is Yun-je.

378
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,080
Heo Yun-je.

379
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,360
That boy??

380
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,880
Heo Yun-je??

381
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,800
You're telling me he's Director Ryan?

382
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,000
Mom.

383
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,080
That boy??

384
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,120
That boy from then is??

385
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,200
If thou dost want thine pictures returned, buyeth me coffee.

386
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,120
It's been a long time, Director.

387
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,480
Do you have milk today?

388
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,760
What cafe doesn't have milk?

389
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,480
Kang Gun-woo, say hello.

390
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,240
Hello, I'm Kang Gun-woo and I'm seven years old.

391
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,880
Hello, I'm Ryan??

392
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,080
I'm Director Heo Yun-je.

393
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,080
Huh? Do you do judo too, Director?

394
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,360
That's right, shouldn't Gun-woo be at judo right now?

395
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,360
Why is he still here?

396
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,360
Oh, I suddenly got a text from Eun-ki that

397
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,280
all classes have been cancelled due to personal circumstances.

398
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,520
He didn't mention anything last night??

399
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,320
I saw him briefly,

400
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,120
because he said he had something to ask.

401
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,080
Do you want to order anything?

402
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,320
Yeah, Ju Hyuk. We'll have a condensed milk latte??

403
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,720
Since I got my coffee, I should return your pictures.

404
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,800
Here.

405
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,200
I scanned them all and displayed them in my room.

406
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,040
Come see them next time.

407
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,080
- Duk-mi. - Yes?

408
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,360
Do you remember everything from your childhood?

409
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,680
Little bits here and there, of course.

410
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,160
But not from when I was very young.

411
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,920
By any chance??

412
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,280
Does my face when I was young??

413
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,440
Huh? It's mom.

414
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,120
She wants me to come straight home after work.

415
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,240
But why? Did something happen?

416
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,040
I think you'll have to be on your own tonight.

417
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,920
It'll be so boring, right?

418
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,040
It won't be boring, no.

419
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,800
Really?

420
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,080
It'll be boring, of course.

421
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,000
Director Nam Eun-ki.

422
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,040
I have something to ask you.

423
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,800
The memories from before I was adopted are

424
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,320
slowly coming back to me, little by little.

425
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,800
And in those memories are you, Duk-mi,

426
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,000
and Duk-mi's mother.

427
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,240
Do you remember me, by any chance?

428
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,240
My name was Heo Yun-je.

429
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,680
I do remember.

430
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,080
Long time no see,

431
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,880
Heo Yun-je.

432
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,120
Mom.

433
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,560
What do you mean?

434
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,840
How do you know Heo Yun-je?

435
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:23,080
He waited for his mother at the playground until dark.

436
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,960
I thought, "I'll just bring him home and feed him dinner,

437
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,080
and his mother will come for him.

438
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,960
She'll surely come for him tomorrow."

439
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,800
And like that a month went by.

440
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,160
Our situation became difficult all of a sudden, so??

441
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,280
So?

442
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,560
So?

443
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,040
Things became so hard that

444
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,120
I had no choice but to??

445
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,640
No way.

446
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,160
It can't be. Mom.

447
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,800
You didn't, right?

448
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,440
Mom, it's not true, is it? Please tell me it's not.

449
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,640
Duk-mi??

450
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,000
It was me.

451
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,200
I did something unforgiveable.

452
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,240
Duk-mi.

453
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,120
Duk-mi.

454
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,120
Duk-mi.

455
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,880
I want to be alone.

456
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,400
Woo-hoo!

457
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,520
Catch me if you can!

458
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,480
I'm Heo Yun-je.

459
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:10,160
Mom, Duk-mi's scribbling again!

460
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,720
Why, you kids?? That's cold.

461
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,680
Was it scary dream?

462
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,160
It wasn't just a dream,

463
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,840
but a nightmare you could say is my memories.

464
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,880
A dream about the day I was abandoned at the orphanage.

465
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,040
Our mom??

466
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,360
I hope you don't hate her too much.

467
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,360
She's regretted it ever since,

468
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,440
not having been able to take you in.

469
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,040
When I think about it now,

470
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,680
I'm actually grateful to her for what she did.

471
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,680
Thank you

472
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,680
for thinking of it that way.

473
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,200
But??

474
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,840
I feel like there was one more person.

475
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,320
Who was that kid?

476
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,120
Duk-su.

477
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,640
Duk-mi doesn't remember.

478
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,840
Any of it.

479
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,600
Eun-ki!

480
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,560
Father.

481
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,000
Did you come because you were worried about Duk-mi?

482
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,800
Have you told her everything?

483
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,040
No, but I should tell her now.

484
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,360
Should I come with you?

485
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,400
I'll tell her.

486
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,360
You go home and??

487
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,080
comfort your mother.

488
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,120
Tell her it's okay.

489
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,720
That everything will be alright.

490
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,480
Alright.

491
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,080
Eun-ki.

492
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,080
Thank you, my son.

493
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,480
Oh yeah, Eun-ki.

494
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,640
You know the password to Duk-mi's place, right?

495
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,240
Dad.

496
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,720
I wish none of it were true,

497
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,920
but it is, right?

498
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,160
What Mom said.

499
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,920
Duk-mi.

500
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,000
I know this is hard for you.

501
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,240
And??

502
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,280
It may get even harder??

503
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,040
But there's something you need to know.

504
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,040
Duk-su,

505
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,040
your little brother.

506
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,960
Sung Duk-su.

507
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,400
My little brother?

508
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,080
Sister!

509
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,680
Who is this, Dad?

510
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,640
Your little brother.

511
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,760
Was it when you were seven, and he was five?

512
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,080
There was an accident on your way home from kindergarten.

513
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,880
You were in such shock that you forgot it all.

514
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,720
You were with him, you see.

515
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,960
Ever since that accident,

516
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,760
you've forgotten everything.

517
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,040
Everything about Duk-su.

518
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,440
At that time, there was really no

519
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,840
way for your mom to be in her right mind.

520
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,120
She'd just lost Duk-su,

521
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:51,000
and she couldn't lose you, too.

522
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,200
Your mother really had no choice.

523
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:03,080
She had no time for Yun-je with what was going on.

524
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,280
Why are you only telling me this now, Dad?

525
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,760
We??We've always been scared.

526
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,120
That one day we'd have to tell you everything.

527
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,120
Because we knew it would hurt you.

528
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,800
It's??

529
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,760
It's all my fault for not being good enough.

530
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:48,760
I made your mom bear that heavy burden for far too long.

531
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,800
If I'd been a little more reliable and dependable,

532
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,440
we wouldn't have left Director Gold there like that.

533
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,720
Your mother really had no choice.

534
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,160
I??

535
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,600
I'd driven her to the edge.

536
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,440
Duk-mi.

537
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,960
I'm sorry to say this to you,

538
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,040
but since you're all grown up now??

539
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,040
Your mom's burden,

540
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,120
I think it's time we take it off her shoulders.

541
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,960
Is that alright with you, Duk-mi?

542
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,840
Sister!

543
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:41,720
Twinkle, twinkle, little star!

544
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,880
Sister! Hurry up. Hurry up!

545
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,760
Over there! There!

546
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,120
Duk-su, you want to ride that?

547
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,120
Yeah!

548
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,240
Giddy-up, giddy-up!

549
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,480
Alright, I'll let you go for a ride.

550
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,720
Yay! How exciting!

551
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,040
Twinkle, twinkle??

552
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,560
?她n the Eastern sky??

553
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,640
Sister!

554
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,520
Duk-su??

555
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,280
Duk-su??

556
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,240
Mom??

557
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,240
Duk-su's hand is cold.

558
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,560
Duk-su??

559
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,600
Please give them some time.

560
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,720
Time for Mom to tell Duk-mi everything,

561
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,240
and time for Duk-mi to take it all in.

562
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,200
Duk-mi??

563
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,840
Duk-mi's a strong girl, so I'm sure she'll be fine.

564
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,560
Duk-mi.

565
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,640
Mom, I'm sorry.

566
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,400
I'm really sorry, Mom.

567
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,600
Don't cry.

568
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,760
Don't cry.

569
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,360
I'm sorry, Mom, for not remembering.

570
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,480
For making things harder on you.

571
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:29,760
Back then, it was thanks to you that I was able to live on.

572
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:38,480
It's thanks to you forgetting everything and

573
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,600
growing up bright and cheerful

574
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:45,120
that I was able to make it no matter how tough it was.

575
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,560
I'm still sorry.

576
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:54,640
For being the only one going on as if nothing happened

577
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,600
when everyone else had to live with painful memories.

578
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,520
I'm sorry for being such a coward.

579
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,000
They said that when they found you

580
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,920
you were holding onto Duk-su's hand and wouldn't let go.

581
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,200
So I'm sure Duk-su wasn't scared

582
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,840
on his journey to the other world.

583
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,920
I know

584
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,920
just how much you loved and cared for Duk-su.

585
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,120
So it's alright.

586
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,040
It's all alright, Duk-mi.

587
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,920
I remember everything now.

588
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,800
Both Director Gold and Duk-su.

589
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,200
Mom, let's??

590
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,960
Let's not swallow what we want to say.

591
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,960
Let's share it,

592
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,080
and let's remember Duk-su.

593
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,680
Thank you, my dear daughter.

594
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,200
Thank you.

595
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,240
Oh, that's right.

596
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,480
Duk-mi.

597
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,320
Eun-ki??

598
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,280
That young thing??

599
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:24,280
What happened to Duk-su and your illness in the aftermath??

600
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,760
Seeing as that he watched it all from the sidelines

601
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,080
and endured it all without complaint,

602
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:33,440
I'm sure he had a tough time, too, though he's never said anything.

603
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,280
Eun-ki.

604
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:54,480
Thank you for comforting Mom and Dad all this time.

605
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,000
When I think about it,

606
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:09,360
it was you who always stayed by my side and protected me,

607
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,120
and I took it for granted.

608
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,680
Because??

609
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,960
You're my Eun-ki bastard.

610
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,000
That was just me fanboying, FYI.

611
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,000
- Duk-mi. - Hm?

612
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,520
Are you alright?

613
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,000
No, I'm not alright.

614
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:39,000
How did you take all this? You were so little, too.

615
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,120
We're family, that's how.

616
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,000
I'm really grateful to that

617
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,440
seven-year-old Eun-ki right now.

618
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:05,040
And also to the 33-year-old Eun-ki,

619
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,400
who's in front of me, right now.

620
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,800
I'm sorry, too.

621
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,080
Hey, Duk-mi.

622
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,080
I guess I only told you that you're pretty when you smile,

623
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,080
but never this:

624
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,480
You're really ugly when you cry.

625
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,480
Liar.

626
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,680
I'm not lying.

627
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,480
You're going to tell him, right?

628
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,640
Director Gold, I mean.

629
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:36,920
You can do it, Duk-mi!

630
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,160
- Hello, Director. - Hello!

631
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,480
Right, Curator Sung is a little late today.

632
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,040
Please give them some time.

633
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,160
Time for Mom to tell Duk-mi everything,

634
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:02,040
and time for Duk-mi to take it all in.

635
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,120
Curator Sung will be taking the day??

636
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,320
Good morning.

637
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,080
I'm here, Director.

638
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,200
Duk-mi.

639
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,000
I have something to tell you.

640
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,320
- Duk-mi. - Director.

641
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,440
I heard from Eun-ki that your memory returned.

642
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,040
I was so distressed I didn't know what to do.

643
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,640
I just wanted to go into hiding??

644
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,880
Don't do that.

645
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:55,160
If you do that, I'll really struggle.

646
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,080
I thought you would,

647
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:03,880
so I decided to just face you with a smile.

648
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,440
I thought that struggling together

649
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,440
might be better than struggling alone.

650
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,000
Thank you.

651
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,280
Mom's??

652
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:21,000
My mom's here.

653
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,560
She wanted to apologize to you in person.

654
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:30,120
My mom??My mom??

655
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,120
It's alright, Duk-mi.

656
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,080
It's really alright.

657
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,640
I'll be back.

658
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,520
Wait here.

659
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,000
I heard from Duk-mi

660
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,400
that your mother couldn't come because she was in an accident.

661
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:40,960
I should have kept you with us a little longer.

662
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,160
Then all this time, you wouldn't have had to??

663
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,440
I'm sorry.

664
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,360
Mother.

665
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,040
I heard that's how you address your girlfriend's parents

666
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,680
in Korea. "Mother" and "Father".

667
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:10,040
I've come to have many mothers ever since coming to Korea.

668
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:14,000
I found my birth mother,

669
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,480
and now I can call you "mother," as well.

670
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:23,560
I don't deserve to be called that by you.

671
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:27,000
I know it's too late to seek your forgiveness, but??

672
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,400
I'm sorry.

673
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,960
If it weren't for you,

674
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,040
I really would've been an abandoned child

675
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,160
in an unfamiliar neighborhood.

676
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:42,440
You took me, a complete stranger, in,

677
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,560
fed me,

678
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,520
and looked after me.

679
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,080
Thank you.

680
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:05,120
I'm too late in saying this,

681
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,840
but thank you so much for

682
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,760
looking after me,

683
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,120
and giving me love, Mother.

684
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:42,080
I decided to go see Duk-su's resting place with Mom.

685
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:46,960
Apparently, they went to see him every year without me.

686
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,120
And??

687
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:57,040
I will always be sorry about

688
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,200
Mom putting you in an orphanage.

689
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,440
Duk-mi.

690
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,040
Those memories??

691
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:19,160
They may have hurt seven-year-old Yun-je,

692
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,440
but they mean nothing to present me.

693
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,600
So please??

694
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,280
Stop feeling so sorry.

695
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,280
Alright?

696
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,080
Good memories,

697
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,320
good times??

698
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,120
Give me lots of those now.

699
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,560
Lots and lots.

700
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,400
I??

701
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,640
I'll love you more.

702
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,520
So that you can be happy.

703
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,080
I'm already receiving  that kind of love.

704
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,440
And take me with you

705
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,120
when you go see Duk-su.

706
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:34,360
Yes, that's right. That's right!

707
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,920
Whoa, careful!

708
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:49,600
Go!

709
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,120
Aren't you going?

710
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,120
Mister, when will you be done?

711
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,080
Why are you asking me this?

712
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:59,160
If you're done, drive me home.

713
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,000
You'll be going that way, anyhow.

714
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,520
I'm curious about something.

715
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,040
Do I look like a pushover to you?

716
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,240
A little?

717
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,440
I'm not done with my classes, so take the bus home!

718
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,600
By the way, mister??

719
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,040
I told you not to call me "mister".

720
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,840
This place??

721
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,480
Do you give discounts to acquaintances?

722
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,160
Of course, Ms. Potential Customer.

723
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:31,760
I can give you a 20% discount,

724
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,120
and a further 10% off if you bring a friend.

725
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,800
So, will you be signing up?

726
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,160
No!

727
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:40,800
Hey, come here.

728
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,600
Hey! Hey!

729
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,960
(Community Center)

730
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:49,160
I like everything you make, Mom!

731
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,760
Since when was she her mother? And why?

732
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,000
Oh my God!

733
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,040
Ma'am, the family register.

734
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,440
(Family register: Eom So-hye/Kim Hyo-jin)

735
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:10,160
Okay, so she's still on the family register.

736
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,400
- Let's go! - Where to?

737
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,680
To get my daughter, where else?

738
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,520
- Quickly, quickly! - Yes, ma'am.

739
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,000
What did the Director say?

740
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:32,960
He said he's fine, and comforted me instead.

741
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,120
I felt so bad and so grateful at the same time??

742
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:45,920
Mother?

743
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:49,120
How did you??

744
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,240
Did you follow me?

745
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,040
Who was the one who told me to get out?

746
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,120
Why are you here?

747
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,160
Hyo-jin?

748
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,240
Should we have a little chat at home?

749
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,240
Let's go.

750
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,080
This is my home now!

751
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,920
Oh my God??

752
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,800
What are your thoughts?

753
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,040
Well, grab her!

754
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,440
- Let's go. - Let go! I'm not going.

755
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,000
- I said, let's go! - I'm not going!

756
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,120
Hey!

757
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,200
Let go of me!

758
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:20,440
I'm so glad he was adopted by a good family??

759
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,880
I said I'm not going!

760
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,440
- What's this sound? - What's all the noise?

761
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,240
I said I'm not going! Let go of me! Mom!

762
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:29,640
- Open the door. - I'm not going!

763
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,480
What??What is this?

764
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,320
What do you think you people are doing?

765
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,920
Who are you people, and where are you taking our daughter?

766
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,640
Hyo-jin's my daughter!

767
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,120
She's my daughter, so why are you doing this?

768
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,200
She's my daughter, so move it!

769
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,080
Secretary Kim, tell them to move. Tell them!

770
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:46,400
- Please excuse me. - Move it!

771
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,680
Hyo-jin's my daughter!

772
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,080
Hey, Hyo-jin! Are you my daughter or not?

773
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,280
She's my daughter, yet??Oh my God! Oh my God!

774
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,800
Secretary Kim, what are your thoughts on this?

775
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,360
Oh my God! Move!

776
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:08,400
We're sorry, we didn't realize you were her mother.

777
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,080
How could you not,

778
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,000
when we look exactly the same?

779
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,840
Hyo-jin,

780
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,960
pack your bags and go with your mother.

781
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,040
But Mom??

782
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,760
Why do you keep on calling her mom?

783
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,640
She was wrong to make you pack your bags and leave,

784
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,160
but now that she's come for you,

785
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,720
you should give her a chance and go with her.

786
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:40,840
And Hyo-jin's mother?

787
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:43,080
I'm Eom So-hye.

788
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,360
Hyo-jin's mother?

789
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:48,320
I know that some people hate being called

790
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,800
so-and-so's mom, so-and-so's mom.

791
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:54,080
But perhaps because I'm an old lady? I really like it.

792
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:57,040
I really like it when people call me Duk-mi's mother.

793
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,760
It feels like the whole world is hailing me for

794
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:02,440
being a mother to my dear daughter.

795
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,560
But you know??

796
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:08,080
That moment doesn't last forever.

797
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,600
Right now she's your baby,

798
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:13,920
but she'll leave the nest one day.

799
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,520
So be good to her while she's still in your nest.

800
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,840
It's like people say: Be good to them while you can.

801
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:23,360
Isn't that usually what we say to the children?

802
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,960
"Be good to your parents while they're still with you."

803
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:27,360
It goes both ways.

804
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,800
You have to be good to each other while you're both around.

805
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,160
Once you hurt them and find the distance growing between you,

806
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:35,280
there's no use regretting it.

807
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,560
Just because she's your child doesn't mean you can do

808
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:42,320
as you please. Being family doesn't let you do that.

809
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,680
Whether it's between husband and wife,

810
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,560
mother and daughter, or siblings,

811
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,520
we're all human and those are all human relationships.

812
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:51,280
No relationships should be taken for granted.

813
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:55,400
So even if you're a little clumsy,

814
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:58,600
as long as you're making the effort, I say it's alright.

815
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,040
You understand, right?

816
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,240
Did you understand me?

817
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:08,720
You really have a way with words.

818
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:11,440
Hyo-jin.

819
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,000
You'll come home, right?

820
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,640
Yes, Mom.

821
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,120
She says she's coming home!

822
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:21,640
This is my daughter. Doesn't she look just like me?

823
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,400
She got her good looks from me.

824
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:30,600
Thank you.

825
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,600
Sure.

826
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:33,560
I'll visit you again.

827
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:37,560
Visit us anytime.

828
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,560
But not after a fight with your mother.

829
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:40,560
Alright.

830
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,160
Okay!

831
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:46,360
Goodbye.

832
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:02,280
Wow, this is bad.

833
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,320
What is it? You don't like it?

834
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,400
Just as I expected, it's amazing.

835
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:09,880
You almost got me, although I knew there was no chance you'd hate it.

836
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:12,040
Ms. Choi.

837
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,680
Work with me on my next album, too. Please?

838
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,000
Well??I'll think about it.

839
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,000
I'm really looking forward to the exhibition.

840
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,080
(Cheum Museum of Art)

841
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:26,600
For the main wall which we're going to accentuate,

842
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:27,680
how about this color?

843
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:30,040
Oh, I liked that color too so I did some research,

844
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:32,880
but the margin of error is wide so it's hard to get it just right.

845
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,240
Let's go see the color mixing together.

846
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,120
Alright.

847
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:36,320
So, who are we?

848
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:38,000
- Museum helpers! - Museum helpers!

849
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,520
That's right! So, what are your basic roles and duties?

850
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:41,320
First is??

851
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:43,120
Please be gentle with that.

852
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:44,120
Sure.

853
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,120
You're all exhausted, aren't you?

854
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:01,360
Here. Hang in there!

855
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:05,320
- Same for you, Kyung-ah. - Thank you.

856
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,960
Sorry, this is for girls only.

857
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:16,040
It's right around the corner now, so let's hang in there.

858
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,520
Tired, right?

859
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,280
A little, maybe?

860
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,800
Still, I'm having fun.

861
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:31,760
We'll soon see the exhibition we've been planning.

862
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,720
Let's hang in there a little more.

863
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:36,400
Yes, ma'am. Curator Sung.

864
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,320
Do you want to come to my place?

865
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:42,120
If you buy me something delicious.

866
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:44,240
I have something even better than something delicious.

867
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,200
What?

868
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,760
Your birthday present has arrived.

869
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,640
Do you want to take it?

870
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,240
Where is it?

871
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:04,960
Close your eyes.

872
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,000
This is a prank, right?

873
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,960
Just give it to me.

874
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,520
When you told me to close my eyes,

875
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,000
I kept my eyes closed like a good boy.

876
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,560
You don't trust me, do you?

877
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:18,600
Oh, so that's how you'll be?

878
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,240
Alright, I'll close my eyes.

879
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,080
- Follow me. - Alright.

880
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:34,120
I've got super-high expectations, you know.

881
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:37,120
You shouldn't get your hopes up too much.

882
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:41,800
Are you ready?

883
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,760
Yes.

884
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:16,000
Director??

885
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:18,000
I??

886
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:23,480
I can paint again, now.

887
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,680
But my hands still need some time, so??

888
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:28,880
It's perfect.

889
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:35,160
I'll practice a little more, and??

890
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,920
It's perfect as it is now.

891
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,120
It's just perfect.

892
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:16,480
On the day we first met, too,

893
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:21,040
you held my hand tight, like this.

894
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,240
Do you remember?

895
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:26,400
"Hello."

896
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:29,120
I'm Sung Duk-mi.

897
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,960
What's your name?

898
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,120
you said.

899
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:41,920
And do you remember what I said?

900
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,080
I'm??

901
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:47,080
Heo Yun-je.

902
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,160
"Heo Yun-je."

903
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:02,120
Now that I think about it,

904
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:05,600
the reason why I was unable to paint temporarily,

905
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,360
although it was my everything??

906
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:11,760
I think it was a sign, telling me to

907
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,560
find that something that's more precious than painting.

908
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,520
And to me, that was you.

909
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:55,160
It took too long for us to meet again.

910
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:00,280
I missed you, Duk-mi.

911
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:04,840
I missed you, Yun-je.

912
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:11,720
Hello, Duk-mi.

913
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,080
Hello, Yun-je.

914
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,800
(Her Private Life)

915
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:59,480
Didn't you say you had something important at five?

916
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:00,680
Do you want to join me?

917
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:02,960
My boyfriend had the hands of a god!

918
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,000
So cute!

919
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,400
Railroad, the Road to Si-an??

920
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,120
And now, the Road to Lion.

921
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:10,120
Curator Sung is going to the States?

922
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:12,080
No way. You think she'd leave the Director behind?

923
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,360
She wouldn't, right?

924
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:14,880
Take care of yourself.

925
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,240
So Duk-mi's really going??

926
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:19,240
Did you have a good dream?

927
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:21,240
A dream that was good because it was a memory.

928
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:23,440
But a dream that was a little sad at the same time, too.
