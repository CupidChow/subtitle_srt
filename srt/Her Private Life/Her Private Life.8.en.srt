(Her Private Life)

3
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,360
All done.

4
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,600
Thank you.

5
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,080
No, it was I who got the paint on you.

6
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,200
Now that I think about it,

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,080
it's a bit unfair.

8
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,120
What is?

9
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,240
You got to see my whole place.

10
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,160
So why can't I see yours?

11
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,680
To make it fair, I'll see your house.

12
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,240
No, you can't!

13
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,640
Do you want me?

14
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,680
Curator Sung?

15
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,360
Curator Sung?

16
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,080
Director, you should get going.

17
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,040
The door's that way.

18
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,480
Curator Sung.

19
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,840
Curator Sung?

20
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,040
- Uh??- Oh, that's right.

21
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,760
This way, yes.

22
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,600
Careful.

23
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,040
Keep going.

24
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,080
This way.

25
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,000
This way, watch your step.

26
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,520
Watch your step, careful!

27
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,720
This way.

28
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,640
It's alright now.

29
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,760
I'm sorry, that was uncomfortable, right?

30
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,680
If you're sorry, invite me properly next time.

31
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,080
And clean up your place.

32
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,440
But cleaning won't??

33
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,200
Alright.

34
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,840
But??Did something happen?

35
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,960
You didn't look so happy, earlier.

36
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,520
Your strokes were violent, as if something was upsetting you.

37
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,680
I was photoshopping you.

38
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,800
Is something troubling you?

39
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
You.

40
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,720
Oh, no.

41
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,960
Then??Are you unwell?

42
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,000
Yes, because of you..

43
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,560
No, not at all.

44
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,960
If there's anything I can help you with,

45
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,480
tell me. Anytime.

46
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,680
Anytime?

47
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,120
Actually, Director??

48
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,160
Yes, Curator Sung.

49
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,400
To tell you the truth, I??

50
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,720
(I Si-an You)

51
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,880
- Oops! - Curator Sung?

52
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,840
There was paint on the floor!

53
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,840
- What? - I'm fine.

54
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,040
Aren't you tired? Because I am.

55
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,400
You should get going. We have work tomorrow.

56
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,720
Yes.

57
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,160
Take these stairs to go down.

58
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,880
- Sure. - Bye!

59
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,960
Oh my God!

60
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,440
You held back well.

61
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,680
You held back real well.

62
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,840
(Episode 8: If the waves are the work of the sea,)

63
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,240
(then wild imaginations are the work of a fan girl)

64
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,160
Why hold myself back? I should've just gone for it.

65
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,440
- Gone for what? - A kiss.

66
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,840
- With who? - Lion.

67
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,400
You want to kiss Lion?

68
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,000
No!

69
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,360
No?

70
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,000
There's disappointment written all of your face.

71
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,760
- That's not true! - That's not true!

72
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,720
You like that Lion, don't you?

73
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,920
- No! - No?

74
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,160
No!

75
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,440
- I should get going. - Sit.

76
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,960
Where did you go after the fansign event?

77
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,000
I was photoshopping!

78
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,040
Then why haven't you uploaded the pictures?

79
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,960
To tell you the truth, I??

80
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,600
I was photoshopping Lion's??

81
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,760
You really do like him, don't you?

82
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,480
I can't filter my words anymore.

83
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,600
Yesterday, I almost confessed my feelings.

84
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,040
Hey! That is a big no.

85
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,320
Why?

86
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,080
Sure, you can fall for Lion.

87
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,160
He's good looking, competent, and nice to you.

88
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,560
But??

89
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,000
Did he say that he likes you, too?

90
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,920
He came onto me like this, and??

91
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,160
Then he kissed me like??

92
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,040
You said Sindy was watching you.

93
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,920
If he liked you, he would've kissed you on the lips!

94
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,320
Why would he've done it on his finger?

95
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,040
As an educated man, at that?

96
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,120
But when he came to my house,

97
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,080
he smiled the whole time in front of my parents.

98
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,120
I mean, he hardly smiles. Then he ate so well??

99
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,160
Should he have complained about your mom's cooking, then?

100
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,360
You don't confess out of bravery.

101
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,160
A confession is like that confirmation step,

102
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,640
to put a stamp on the fact that you both like each other.

103
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,520
I didn't get the feeling that he dislikes me.

104
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,880
He may not dislike you,

105
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,800
but that doesn't mean he's head-over-heels for you.

106
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,520
You need to understand this.

107
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,040
When Lion helped you out,

108
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,680
it was purely out of human interest.

109
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,880
I mean, it's thanks to Lion that you're

110
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,040
shutting down the rumors, and shutting Sindy up, too.

111
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,520
So imagine what'd happen if you asked him out and he rejected!

112
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,760
Why are you so pessimistic? You're not usually like this.

113
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,200
I'm not being pessimistic, I'm being realistic.

114
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,240
Would you be alright if he rejected you?

115
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,800
You'd still have to see him every day at the museum!

116
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,840
So just wait??

117
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,400
Wait until you're sure how he feels.

118
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,160
Hyo-jin?

119
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,800
Is this the museum?

120
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,920
Why are you clocking in here?

121
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,880
Why are you here, where Cha Si-an lives?

122
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,720
Oh, really?

123
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,640
So this is where Cha Si-an lives??

124
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,960
Hyo-jin, I'm confiscating your car key and your credit card.

125
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,760
- What? - Hand them over.

126
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,800
Come here.

127
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,400
But Mother! That's??

128
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,920
- Secretary Kim? - Yes, ma'am.

129
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,080
Grab her.

130
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,280
One moment.

131
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,800
I'm confiscating the car key.

132
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,800
Now, where's your credit card?

133
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,560
But Mother, how am I supposed to do without either of them?

134
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,080
Why do you need your credit card?

135
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,680
You get full just by seeing Cha Si-an's face,

136
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,760
and must be on cloud nine right now.

137
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,560
Mother, it's all a misunderstanding.

138
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,840
Where was that card?

139
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,280
Director!

140
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,880
Director Ryan!

141
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,120
Good morning!

142
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,120
(What will his response be when you confess to him?)

143
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,640
(Ryan Gold)

144
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,000
(You're not just after my body, are you?)

145
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,120
Don't tell me??

146
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,240
You're not just after my body, are you?

147
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,040
Oh what?

148
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,920
Lion.

149
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,000
(Get lost!)

150
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,840
Get lost.

151
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,080
Why are you saying that?

152
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,080
You're so cruel.

153
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,400
Get lost.

154
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,440
You get lost, too, application.

155
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,160
Curator Sung.

156
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,360
What is it?

157
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,200
Are you busy?

158
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,160
Oh, no. Did you need something done?

159
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,160
I'm not here to talk about work.

160
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,640
Then??

161
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,560
There's something you'll be happy to hear.

162
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,200
Something I'll be happy to...?

163
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,360
What is it?

164
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,920
Well, I??

165
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,840
Director, there you are.

166
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,160
That letter for Ullim Museum is on your desk.

167
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,240
Alright, thanks.

168
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,440
Just for a moment.

169
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,000
What's with that shyness?

170
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,560
Don't tell me??He's going to ask me out?

171
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,080
This is??

172
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,120
Director, you can speak comfortably now.

173
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,120
So you still don't know?

174
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,960
How would I know, unless you tell me?

175
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,040
I thought you were always checking.

176
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,760
I am, but??

177
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,920
I think it's better you tell me yourself.

178
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,320
Well, you see. I??

179
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,160
Yes?

180
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,720
I had Cheum-patch deleted.

181
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,520
Director Ryan lives here, too.

182
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,560
I'm here to see him.

183
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,840
Mr. Gold. Is that true?

184
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,680
- Just what??- Mr. Gold,

185
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,880
I was hoping that my Hyo-jin would naturally

186
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,600
come to develop a refined interest for fine arts

187
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,400
once she started working at the museum.

188
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,560
But after you, Mr. Gold,

189
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,040
had Cha Si-an participate in our special exhibition??

190
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,040
My heart is now filled with worries instead.

191
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,960
In fact, when I saw Hyo-jin in a rush to go to work??

192
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,040
I decided to trail her, and??

193
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,000
No, no, I was worried so I followed her,

194
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,400
and she came right here, to where Cha Si-an lives.

195
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,320
But Hyo-jin just told me otherwise,

196
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,800
that she's here because you called for her.

197
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,880
Is this true?

198
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,880
- Ms. Eom So-hye? - Yes?

199
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,280
I thought I asked you to stop concerning yourself

200
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,280
with Cheum and its staff.

201
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,640
Oh my God!

202
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,920
But Hyo-jin's my daughter.

203
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,160
From this moment onward, she's my employee.

204
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,200
Let's continue our business at the museum.

205
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,720
Then please excuse me.

206
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,000
Mother, I'll get going, then.

207
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,360
Secretary Kim, what do you think?

208
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,600
Ah, yes. Well??

209
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,720
What are your thoughts?

210
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,400
Pardon?

211
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,800
Ms. Kim Hyo-jin won't be following you around any longer.

212
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,840
Great news, huh?

213
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,160
Ah, that's great news.

214
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,280
I knew you'd be happy to hear it.

215
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,040
Oh, and I think she will be leaving us soon.

216
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,400
So let's hang in there until she does.

217
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,080
Here, through the palm fronds??

218
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,440
But uh??Why are we taking photos?

219
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,760
I'm going to upload this on your fan page.

220
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,960
Alright, that's great!

221
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,000
It's very dreamy.

222
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Should we try standing over here?

223
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,320
Can you look at me through your fingers?

224
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,160
Okay, awesome.

225
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,080
Ms. Lee, are we not going to open for business today?

226
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,720
Does business really matter right now?

227
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,280
What matters is the fact that you, a musician, don't have a fan page.

228
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,440
What fan page? I don't even have fans.

229
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,120
You don't get customers unless you first open a cafe.

230
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,160
You have to make a fan page for fans to show up.

231
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,360
Oh, but what's wrong with your friend?

232
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,040
Sung Duk-mi, what's up?

233
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,240
Don't tell me??You confessed and he rejected you already?

234
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,040
- No. - Then what?

235
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,880
New updates on Cheum-patch?

236
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,600
Cheum-patch is gone.

237
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,760
Gone?

238
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,320
(CU-patch)

239
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,480
You're right!

240
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,160
Hey, I guess that means Sindy really believes it.

241
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,040
That's great.

242
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,120
Why the long face?

243
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,920
Lion says we should "hang in there" until she quits.

244
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,000
What is that supposed to mean?

245
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,160
He probably means that since it'd be weird if you discontinued

246
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,240
the fake relationship as soon as Cheum-patch disappeared,

247
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,000
you should end it when Sindy leaves.

248
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,040
Right? That's what he means, right?

249
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,040
He's implying that this fake dating is a lot of work, huh?

250
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,920
In other words, this whole tiring drama will only end

251
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,400
once Sindy quits. That's what he means, huh?

252
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,000
You're being very pessimistic here.

253
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Sun-joo, I feel like I'm on a rollercoaster ride these days.

254
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,640
All these ups and downs??I feel like a nutcase.

255
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,680
What, you want to keep up this fake dating thing?

256
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,720
Then I guess Sindy just needs to keep working there.

257
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,080
How do I make that happen?

258
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,560
Well now you have to think about that.

259
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,480
We've sent that letter to Ullim Museum,

260
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,800
requesting the works by Mr. Ahn.

261
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,320
The meeting's scheduled for this afternoon.

262
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,240
We'll need storage space, not just for the special exhibition

263
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,920
but also for Mr. Ahn's New York exhibition.

264
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,840
Do we have enough room?

265
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,160
I'm also inquiring at other places because it looks like we don't.

266
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,960
I will update you after I narrow down the candidates.

267
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,960
Alright.

268
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,720
Oh??I'm bored to death, so what do you expect me to do?

269
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,160
At least give me some work.

270
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,320
Ms. Kim Hyo-jin.

271
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,040
I think it's been over a week since I asked you to

272
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,480
tidy up the archives.

273
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,280
Oh, but objectively speaking, that's just no fun.

274
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,080
It's a violation of human rights.

275
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,080
Let me be a part of the special exhibition.

276
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,760
Just imagine how hard I'll work, since Si-an's involved in this.

277
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,320
No, because I'm worried you'll work too hard.

278
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,040
But Director??

279
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,880
Um, how about letting her try?

280
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,160
For example, merchandise planning?

281
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,640
Merchandise planning?

282
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,760
In other words, like goods.

283
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,360
But related to the exhibition.

284
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,760
But museum merchandise is just pencils and postcards, isn't it?

285
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,680
Sounds boring.

286
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,280
Forget that. How about our Si-an's special exh??

287
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,920
Oh, we need merchandise for the special exhibition, too.

288
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,000
I'll plan them! The goods.

289
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
How am I supposed to entrust you with this

290
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,200
when you've shown me neither your responsibility nor diligence?

291
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,160
I'll show you from now on.

292
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,920
Sometimes, positions maketh man.

293
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,080
On one condition: All internal documents

294
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,080
and meeting minutes must be kept confidential.

295
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,080
Yes, sir.

296
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,440
Who was in charge of product planning until now?

297
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,680
Curator Sung and I were.

298
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,120
So that's why they were so blah.

299
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,000
- Curator Sung. - Yes?

300
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,760
Are you free this afternoon?

301
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,240
Ah, yes.

302
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,280
Then come somewhere with me.

303
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,240
To where?

304
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,480
You'll know when we get there.

305
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,080
I'll see you at the parking lot in 30 minutes.

306
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,360
Oh!

307
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,760
Make sure you look good.

308
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,040
A meeting with Mr. Cha Si-an?

309
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,360
I couldn't meet with him yesterday because something came up.

310
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,040
Then why did you tell me to make sure I look good?

311
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,720
The last time Mr. Cha Si-an was here,

312
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,520
everyone seemed to be self-conscious.

313
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,200
Cu. Yoo and Hyo-jin as well.

314
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,520
Absolutely everyone.

315
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,360
I was mistaken again??

316
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,920
Again?

317
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,120
Again what?

318
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,040
Oh, it's nothing.

319
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,960
One!

320
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
All rise!

321
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,320
Come on, up!

322
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,920
Two!

323
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,080
- Hello! - Hello!

324
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,640
Yes, hello.

325
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,600
Gosh, you're all so adorable.

326
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,160
Alright, face the front!

327
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,080
Who's distracted in the middle of training, huh?

328
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,000
One!

329
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,080
Now, get up!

330
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,960
Two!

331
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,280
You need to hurry up! Come on, up!

332
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,360
Hey, hey, hey!

333
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,520
Stop it, you'll catch a cold!

334
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,960
Come on, up!

335
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,040
Two!

336
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,600
Let's see who's the first one to get up.

337
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,000
Come on, up!

338
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,080
One!

339
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,520
Two!

340
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,320
You need to get up faster.

341
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,520
Two!

342
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,040
Mom.

343
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,880
Ah.

344
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,440
When did that get on my face?

345
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,120
It's not like that.

346
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,000
Here.

347
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,640
Eat up.

348
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,200
Wow, looks delicious!

349
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,120
Son, are you mad at me?

350
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,960
Mad at you?

351
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,080
What's there to get mad about between a mother and son?

352
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,320
Then why won't you come home these days?

353
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,000
You've grown so haggard because you haven't been eating properly.

354
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,000
If I ate like this every day, I'd be twice the size I am now.

355
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,360
Tsk, you say that, but??

356
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,200
Mom.

357
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,160
Let's have some meat tonight. I'll buy.

358
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,360
Tell Duk-mi to come home, too.

359
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,040
Tell her to have dinner at home, no matter what.

360
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,080
Alright?

361
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,360
Mmm, yum!

362
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,720
Your visual director just disappeared, without a word?

363
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,320
We thought we could trust him,

364
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,720
but I guess you can't know everything about a person.

365
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,160
Which is why, uh??About the exhibition??

366
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,600
You're not trying to say that you can no longer participate, right?

367
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,040
I'm sorry, Director.

368
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,400
But I can't afford to postpone my new single for this,

369
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,080
nor can I ask you to postpone this exhibition just for me??

370
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,040
What about other directors?

371
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,800
I am still looking,

372
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,760
but I haven't exactly found anyone??

373
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,120
By any chance,

374
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,200
have you heard of Choi Da-in?

375
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,120
Of course I have.

376
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,600
I've contacted her many times for a chance to work with her.

377
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,120
If Ms. Choi says

378
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,120
she'll take over as your visual director,

379
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,480
would you be able to carry on as planned?

380
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,760
Of course.

381
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,320
Do you know Ms. Choi Da-in?

382
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,120
I know her very well.

383
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,720
I'm Choi Da-in.

384
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,640
I missed you, Ryan.

385
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,520
It'd be really nice if she agreed.

386
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,280
Please put in a good word for me.

387
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,520
I'll contact her, then.

388
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,520
Please.

389
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,360
There won't be a problem with our schedule, then.

390
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,640
Ms. Choi Da-in??It's her, isn't it?

391
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,480
The one who came to see you at the museum?

392
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,360
You've met her, right?

393
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,280
She's a talented artist.

394
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,840
Her participation will help with our publicity, too.

395
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,400
But will she do it? The timeline's so tight.

396
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,800
She will.

397
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,480
You sound very sure.

398
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,440
It's the first time I'm asking her for a favor in 10 years,

399
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,160
so she'll say yes. If she has a conscience.

400
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,640
10 years??

401
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,760
Besides, I had a favor to ask her anyway for the exhibition.

402
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,600
She's the owner of the late photographer

403
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,080
Yoon Tae-hwa's last work.

404
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,840
If she is, then "Many People" is??

405
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,400
Da-in.

406
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,000
That was the pseudonym I came up with for her

407
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,520
when we first met,

408
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,480
but who knew she'd be using it until now??

409
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,200
That's right. Curator Sung.

410
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,000
Yes?

411
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,320
Are you free today?

412
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,240
Oh, I thought we'd finish early, so I told Mom I'd have dinner

413
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,120
- at home. But I can always cancel. - That's alright.

414
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,160
It's nothing urgent. Get in.

415
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,440
This is Ryan Gold, who made a reservation for 7 p.m.

416
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,880
I'm sorry, but I'll have to cancel that reservation.

417
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,680
Yes.

418
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,360
Have a safe drive.

419
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,560
That's right. What should I do about that interview with Moment?

420
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,000
You find a time for me, Curator Sung.

421
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,920
Alright.

422
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,080
Oh, and I'm going straight to Ms. Choi's studio tomorrow.

423
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,280
Do you want to come with me?

424
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,120
Yes.

425
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,760
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

426
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,040
Director Nam Eun-ki?

427
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,200
How long will you keep up that fake relationship thing?

428
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,480
That Cheum-patch or whatever is gone now,

429
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,200
so why not just end it here?

430
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,120
That's for us to decide, and not for you to??

431
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,120
"Us"?

432
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,760
Are you interested in Duk-mi, by any chance?

433
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,720
That's also none of your business??

434
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,880
It is my business.

435
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,000
Don't change the subject, and answer me.

436
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,680
Are you interested in Duk-mi?

437
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,080
I am.

438
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,960
I think she's a good person. Ms. Sung Duk-mi, I mean.

439
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,800
Is that purely out of human interest?

440
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,320
Like how you helped her out

441
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,880
when you thought she was dating Sun-joo?

442
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,760
If not, then what?

443
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,520
I don't see why I should answer that question.

444
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,640
Just put an end to it,

445
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,440
instead of stirring her up for nothing.

446
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,800
Was she stirred up? Sung Duk-mi?

447
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,920
I repeat,

448
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,320
this is for Curator Sung and me to decide.

449
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,080
I don't need your advice, Director Nam.

450
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,000
How much do you know about Duk-mi, anyway?

451
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,960
You see, there isn't anything I don't know about her.

452
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,360
I know enough.

453
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,440
More than you think I know.

454
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,920
There's no way Duk-mi would tell you about herself.

455
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,040
See, she tells me everything.

456
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,600
Without hiding anything.

457
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,120
But do you think she'll do the same with you?

458
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,160
Done.

459
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,840
- Watch it. - Watch it!

460
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,640
Stop that, before I punch your teeth out.

461
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,160
My teeth are too precious, though.

462
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,600
- Hey! - What?

463
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,920
You??

464
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,440
- Sung Duk-mi. - Yeah?

465
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,760
Director Ry is doing well, right?

466
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,480
Mom, stop asking me about him.

467
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,280
I'm telling you, we're really nothing!

468
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,760
Why would he take you home when you two are nothing?

469
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,120
He obviously thinks there is something??

470
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,160
Mom, don't you have any conscience?

471
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,680
Your daughter's crazy.

472
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,960
Who are you trying to marry her off to?

473
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,120
Crazy?

474
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,000
Hey, Nam Eun-ki.

475
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,080
I hope you meet a girl who's exactly like me.

476
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,040
Should I?

477
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,800
Then I hope you meet a guy who's exactly like me, too.

478
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,680
Are you crazy?

479
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,600
Hey!

480
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,840
Do you think I raised you kids

481
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,360
just to get a daughter-in-law and a son-in-law like you?

482
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,120
If you're going to, just stay single all your life!

483
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,240
Don't eat any more.

484
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,880
But I bought it.

485
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,680
What's wrong with a daughter-in-law like me?

486
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,040
Right, Dad?

487
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,120
Dad, wouldn't you be happy with a son-in-law like me?

488
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,360
Ugh.

489
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,800
What's wrong with us? Aren't we fantastic?

490
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,280
Right?

491
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,040
Eat up.

492
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,960
You eat up, too. You look a bit haggard today.

493
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,440
Say ah.

494
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,880
Eun-ki.

495
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,360
What do you think of me?

496
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,480
Let's say we're not childhood friends,

497
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,760
but that we just met for the first time today.

498
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,480
What do you think of me?

499
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,360
- You're pretty. - Right?

500
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:26,160
Then how would you feel if

501
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,480
a girl like me said she liked you?

502
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,440
It's a big thank you.

503
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,040
Really?

504
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,640
Yes. I'd date you right away.

505
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,640
You really would?

506
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,120
Then I'd ask her.

507
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,360
"You're into idols? At your age?

508
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,240
You're not just any fan, but a homepage master? What's that?

509
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,720
You follow them around and take pictures?

510
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,200
You've been doing that your entire life?

511
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,360
Then does that mean I'm second to him?

512
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,840
Choose: is it me or Cha Si-an?"

513
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,280
Hey!

514
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,800
You could've given me a more cookie-cutter answer.

515
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,600
Why make it so realistic?

516
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,360
Sung Duk-mi.

517

Date a guy to whom you can tell honestly

518
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,200
and with confidence that you're a fan girl to the bone!

519
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,040
Not someone who you're worried will find out.

520
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,040
Though I must admit, there aren't many guys like that out there.

521
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,000
How much do you know about Duk-mi, anyway?

522
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,960
See, she tells me everything.

523
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,000
Without hiding anything.

524
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,280
But do you think she'll do the same with you?

525
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,600
(The Road to Si-an)

526
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,160
Hey, we even write back to each other on this site.

527
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,640
I can't believe my goal in this life is to be a water bottle.

528
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,640
Water bottle?

529
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,320
Lord, I have sinned.

530
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,320
Sinned? In what way?

531
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,920
I'm sorry, Si-an!

532
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,080
Sorry about what?

533
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,600
(Write a comment)

534
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,680
It seems there are two suns in this world.

535
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,040
(It seems there are two suns in this world)

(Si-an at the airport!)

537
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,960
Date a guy to whom you can tell honestly

538
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,560
and with confidence that you're a fan girl to the bone!

539

Not someone who you're worried will find out.

540
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,160
It's all because of this day.

541
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,160
If it weren't for what happened this day,

542
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,040
I wouldn't be feeling so guilty about deceiving him.

543
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,080
I'm glad I met you that day.

544
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,680
- Shall we go in, then? - Sure.

545
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,760
Ms. Choi Da-in.

546
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,560
Hello, Ms. Choi.

547
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,160
Don't tell me??Is this about work?

548
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,120
Have a seat.

549
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,840
You know the idol group White Ocean, right?

550
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,240
Yeah.

551
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,560
There's a member named Cha Si-an.

552
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,680
Oh, I was offered the visual director position for his album.

553
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,160
I refused, though. What about him?

554
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:59,200
I'd appreciate it if you reconsidered that offer.

555
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,800
And even more if you just did it.

556
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,040
Why are you asking me?

557
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,760
Mr. Cha Si-an expressed his interest in participating in

558
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,480
our special exhibition, and he wants his album concept to

559
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,400
follow the exhibition concept.

560
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,160
But his visual director suddenly??

561
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,480
He disappeared.

562
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,200
And Mr. Cha very much wants to work with you.

563
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,680
And Cheum needs Cha Si-an for this exhibition?

564
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,480
Yes.

565
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,000
So that means you absolutely need me, Ryan, huh?

566
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,080
Yes.

567
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,120
Then ask me a bit more earnestly.

568
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,840
I??

569
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,160
I absolutely need you, Choi Da-in.

570
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,120
Sorry, I can't do it.

571
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:39,960
Hey!

572
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,120
I have to be ready to do any work, let alone visual directing, no?

573
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,400
I can't take on any work until my studio is ready.

574
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,160
Ms. Choi, then??

575
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,080
If there's a particular studio you have in mind, then??

576
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,880
Hey, what are you doing?

577
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,840
Give me that!

578
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,040
What are you doing?

579
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,800
Hey! I said to give it here!

580
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,120
I said I didn't want to show it to anyone. What was that just now?

581
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,880
Do I have to be good at sketching, too?

582
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,440
Sketching is one thing, but the main problem is the layout.

583
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,240
You want to put your workbench here?

584
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,160
Well, the view's nice??

585
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,280
Are you here to make art or to drink?

586
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,320
Both!

587
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,960
I chose this place

588
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,640
because I liked the view of the garden.

589
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,760
I must admit, your studio in New York was a bit cramped.

590
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,040
A bit cramped? It was totally cramped!

591
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,720
On top of that, I had you visit me every day.

592
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,080
I don't think you have the right to complain,

593
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,000
Miss I-Don't-Care-About-Deadlines.

594
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,760
Oh, and I still haven't fixed that habit of mine.

595
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,360
You wouldn't be Choi Da-in if you had.

596
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,320
Oh, I'm thinking of using plants as part of the interior design.

597
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,760
- "Planterior?" - Yes, that's right.

598
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,240
So I was thinking of putting some big plants in here, and??

599
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,000
And you want to kill them all?

600
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,080
Hey!

601
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,400
It's all trees in front of you. Don't be so greedy.

602
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,000
I want to bring them inside.

603
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,240
Can I have one, too?

604
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,240
Here.

605
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,080
I like this coffee, because it has a clean aftertaste.

606
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,040
Same.

607
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,080
Would you happen to have any tea?

608
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,840
- Sorry, excuse me. - Oh.

609
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,960
It's so annoying that he doesn't drink coffee, huh?

610
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,720
A bit.

611
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,040
Ms. Sung,

612
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,160
have you ever seen Ryan paint?

613
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,200
No, I don't think so.

614
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,280
Really?

615
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,760
Did he really stop painting after he retired?

616
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,800
I really like it when he painted.

617
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,440
He had that, what do you call it, sexiness of a man lost in his art?

618
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,920
Has he ever told you why he retired?

619
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,920
No, I never asked.

620
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,920
Really?

621
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,840
But then again,

622
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,040
like he'd tell just anyone who asks him why.

623
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,680
I'll take this to him.

624
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,680
Sure.

625
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,760
I thought you said you were off to see some furniture.

626
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,680
Me?

627
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,920
I said I was off to see some wood.

628
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,160
Ms. Choi, are you thinking of making it yourself?

629
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,160
Yes.

630
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,520
This one here is used for desks and bench tops.

631
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,840
What do you think?

632
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,600
I think that'll do.

633
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,320
Let's go.

634
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,000
(Furniture Workshop)

635
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,080
If it's for a workbench??How about 2200 x 1000?

636
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:41,000
Considering thee space, 1600 x 60 would be most ideal.

637
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,760
This one here??

638
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,720
Ah, he's good.

639
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,200
Your boyfriend?

640
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,320
No.

641
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,840
I'll help you.

642
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:22,480
Oh, so it's her boyfriend, not yours.

643
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,120
Ah, no wonder they have great teamwork.

644
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,040
- Whoa, not that one. - Why not?

645
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,280
- You might hurt yourself. - Or I might not.

646
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,840
- It'll fly everywhere. - I can do this.

647
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,440
Alright, here we go. Is this how you do it?

648
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,320
Alright, press down. Press down, and??

649
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,360
Attention!

650
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,320
Bow.

651
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,760
Thank you, everyone.

652
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,400
Are you interested in Duk-mi?

653
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,240
I am.

654
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,120
I think she's a good person. Ms. Sung Duk-mi, I mean.

655
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,840
What do you think of me?

656
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:06,560
How would you feel if a girl like me said she liked you?

657
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,080
Hey, Eun-ki.

658
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,680
Sung Duk-mi, what time do you finish work today?

659
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,840
What? I can't hear you.

660
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,000
What's all that noise?

661
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,040
One sec.

662
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,000
Ah, now I can hear you.

663
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,120
Where are you?

664
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,800
Me? I'm at a furniture workshop.

665
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,080
I'm making furniture for one of our artists.

666
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,960
What, a curator does goes as far as making furniture?

667
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,040
Hey, the Director's helping, so I can't say no.

668
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,120
You're with Lion?

669
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:29,000
Yes, there's so much to make, so I might have to work all night.

670
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,680
Work all night? Again?

671
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,880
Where is this place?

672
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,320
I'll go over there and make it for you in a blink!

673
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,000
- Really? - Yes.

674
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,480
I'm heading there now.

675
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,600
- Does it fit? - Yes.

676
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,600
Sung Duk-mi!

677
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,840
Eun-ki, you really came.

678
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,280
Move.

679
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:12,960
Let's go.

680
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,960
It'll break. Hold it gently.

681
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,760
Go.

682
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,640
Eun-ki, water.

683
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,440
Should I help you with anything?

684
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,800
Nope, go rest. Go rest!

685
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,000
Now, out!

686
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,880
Is that Ms. Sung Duk-mi's friend?

687
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,360
I feel so bad about making him come here.

688
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,440
It looks like he was desperate to do some woodwork.

689
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,920
You worked so hard today. Will this really suffice?

690
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:15,920
No.

691
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,000
So please reconsider Mr. Cha Si-an's offer.

692
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,040
Ah, I'm hungry.

693
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,000
Pick something nice. It's on me.

694
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,320
You're our artist, so of course I should pay.

695
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,120
Curator Sung, did you decide?

696
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,160
We'll have??

697
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,320
Black bean noodles, spicy noodles, and fried rice.

698
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,160
Oh. You see, we always share.

699
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,920
Really? Three dishes between the two of you?

700
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,440
She eats a ton, you see.

701
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,520
What? It's true.

702
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,200
Excuse me.

703
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,080
Me?

704
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,760
Thank you for helping me.

705
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,680
Yes, well??

706
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,240
But you played a bit dirty.

707
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,240
Dir??Dirty?

708
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,760
Man, I get a lot of "cute", "beautiful" and "pretty,"

709
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,960
but this is the first time I've gotten "dirty."

710
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,880
And from someone I've just met.

711
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,160
Well, this person you've just met thinks

712
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,480
you're acting overly friendly toward Ms. Sung Duk-mi.

713
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,000
Oh, I guess you don't know.

714
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,720
Duk-mi and I are very close. Overly close.

715
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:09,160
Even so, you're her friend not her boyfriend.

716
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:14,600
You were acting pretty pathetic in front of her boyfriend.

717
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:20,600
I guess you're not so close with Director Ryan, after all.

718
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,280
Judging by how you know nothing.

719
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,760
Those two??

720
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,800
They're not really dating.

721
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,000
It's all fake.

722
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,760
What is it? Is there something on my face?

723
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,080
Did you enjoy your meal?

724
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,720
You ate quite heartily. Three dishes.

725
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:50,800
No, it was Eun-ki who??

726
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,000
Thank you.

727
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,120
Director, you should take your friend home.

728
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,080
Let's go.

729
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,280
Ms. Choi, I do hope you'll reconsider.

730
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,320
I'll see you tomorrow, Director.

731
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,240
I'll e-mail you the proposal.

732
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,800
Please do review it in a positive light.

733
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,120
It'll be a good chance for you as well. Bye, then.

734
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,240
- I heard it's fake. - What?

735
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,320
I heard you're not really dating Ms. Sung Duk-mi,

736
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,160
and that it's all a show.

737
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,720
- That artist??- Yeah?

738
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,160
I think she's more than friends with Lion.

739
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,000
More than friends?

740
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,160
Yeah, it's obvious that she likes him.

741
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,160
- You thought so as well? - Yeah!

742
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,160
Hey, so hurry up and end this pretend-dating thing.

743
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,600
There's nothing nastier than coming between two people??

744
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,320
I guess she hasn't been able to confess to him, either.

745
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,840
In case she loses him as a friend, too,

746
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,920
if he rejects her.

749
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,960
Should I tell him to do more concerts?

Oppa!

753
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,000
What brings you at this hour?

754
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I thought you had a story to cover.

755
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,280
Well, the interview place is around here.

756
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,560
Honey, a cup of coffee for me, please.

757
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,360
What coffee? An americano?

758
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,280
Uh, no. Instead of coffee??

759
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,880
A parfait.

760
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,160
A parfait?

761
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,560
What kind of parfait?

762
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:58,120
Well, I suddenly remembered that parfait that

763
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,280
we used to enjoy when we were still in college.

764
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,600
- It was good, right? - It was.

765
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,000
Can't you make me something similar, honey?

766
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Sure.

767
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,920

Yeah!

00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,040
Strawberry?

774
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:55,120
Yeah, and uh??With chocolate, too!

Don't mention it.

779

I should thank you for this interview opportunity.

780
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,800
Director Gold has the rest of the day off,

781
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,120
so don't worry about the time and interview comfortably.

782

That's alright with you, isn't it?

Your call cannot be connected??

Gosh, why isn't she picking up?

786
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:48,640
Who?

787
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,080
Ms. Choi Da-in.

788
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:51,960
I'm trying to e-mail her the proposal,

but she's not picking up.

She's not?

791
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,240
Print it out, and I'll take it to her in person.

792

Ms. Choi.

793
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:20,080
Duk-mi, what brings you here without notice?

794
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,240
I called several times, but you weren't picking up.

795
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,200
Oh.

796
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,200
I left my phone in the bedroom.

797
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:29,000
Why are you doing this alone? You should've called me.

798
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,160
I needed to do some thinking.

799
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,080
Still. Here, let me help you.

800
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,080
No, it's really??

801
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,440
One, two, three!

802
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,880
- Over here? - Yes.

803
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,600
Is this alright here?

804
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,920
One last question.

805
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:28,000
Director Gold, you are known for your excellent eye for art.

806
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,480
So is there anyone

807
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:35,160
who has caught your interest here in Korea?

808
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,600
Director?

809
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,240
That's Cheum's confidiential information.

810
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:07,000
I've seen many world-class works since coming to Korea.

811
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,320
But the artwork itself cannot exist on its own.

812
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:16,120
It only takes on value after it meets with an audience

813
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,160
that sees it and feels something from it.

814
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,040
That's why, as the director of Cheum,

815
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,920
I want to change the prejudice that art is difficult and boring.

816
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:27,560
Through an exhibition that is easy for anyone to approach.

817
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:30,720
Oh, so the Celebrities' Collection will be that first step, huh?

818
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,360
I'm looking forward to it.

819
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,400
Thank you.

820
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,720
No, thank you.

821
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:41,000
Oh, and this is just out of my own curiosity.

822
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,120
Once your term is up,

823
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,800
will you be returning to New York?

824
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,600
It's hard to say.

825
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:49,160
Any chance you'll get married and settle in Korea?

826
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,040
I'm sorry?

827
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,960
I mean, if you started seeing someone in Korea,

828
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,440
you could decide that you might like to settle here.

829
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,120
I'll think about that.

830
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:01,160
Saying you'll think about that??

831
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,880
Does that mean you're seeing someone now?

832
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,200
Hey, Young-sook.

833
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,800
You better get yourself a new hanbok for Duk-mi's wedding.

834
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:20,800
That's right!

835
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,920
If it weren't for you, I would've been in trouble.

836
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:25,920
So thank you.

837
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,560
You know that I have other intentions, right?

838
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:34,760
Here's the proposal for Mr. Cha's album and the exhibition.

839
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:35,960
There's no need.

840
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,080
Because I'm going to do it.

841
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,440
Really?

842
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,880
Thank you.

843
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,000
Don't thank me,

844
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,880
because I have other intentions, too.

845
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:50,480
I'm doing this so I can work with Ryan, right next to him.

846
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,080
I like Ryan, you see.

847
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,720
You don't mind, do you?

848
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,600
Because you're not really dating him anyway.

849
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,200
How did you??

850
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,320
I heard.

851
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,520
That he's pretending to see you to help you out.

852
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,920
But you know something?

853
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:22,160
Ryan wants to end this fake relationship.

854
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:08,520
I heard you're not really dating Ms. Sung Duk-mi,

855
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,840
that you're just pretending.

856
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:13,320
If someone saw you, they'd say you're being jealous.

857
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,080
Why are you so into it, for nothing?

858
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,080
When was I jeal??

859
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:26,600
Oh.

860
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,000
I am jealous.

861
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:37,800
What do you mean?

862
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,120
I was jealous.

863
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,160
This pretend relationship??

864
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,360
I'd better end it here.

865
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,720
Choi Da-in, you're so pathetic.

866
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:34,720
(Butterfly Ranunculus: Charm, Allure)

867
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,120
(Gerbera: Gratitude, Kindness, Grace)

868
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:43,360
(Delphinium: I will make you happy)

869
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,040
(Stock: Eternal beauty)

870
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:58,880
(Rose: Passionate love)

871
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:44,680
You know something?

872
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:49,120
Ryan wants to end this fake relationship.

873
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,480
Curator Sung, there's something I want to say to you.

874
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,200
Come down to the parking lot.

875
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,000
I like you.

876
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:24,520
I like you, Director Gold.

877
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:30,600
I've come to like you.

878
01:02:57,080 --> 01:03:01,200
I like you.

879
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,040
Ms. Sung Duk-mi.

880
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,120
I like the sound of your voice

881
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,520
calling out my name.

882
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:20,520
I like your smile that you have on for me.

883
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,720
There's something I wanted to say to you.

884
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:44,880
I know it's sudden, but Curator Sung??

885
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,040
Director.

886
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,640
However, a love confession

887
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,760
is not something you do for yourself;

888
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:57,000
it's for the other person.

889
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,040
You go first.

890
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:06,080
Thank you for helping me all this time.

891
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:11,720
We??

892
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:17,120
should stop with our fake relationship.

893
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,440
What?

894
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:27,280
I'm truly grateful.

895
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:32,880
Curator Sung.

896
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,280
Curator Sung??

897
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,800
My confession??

898
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:49,080
I'll bury it in my heart.

899
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:37,040
(My feelings are sincere)

900
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,280
(Her Private Life)

901
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:39,480
Yeah, it's a good thing I didn't confess.

902
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:40,400
Oh no!

903
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:42,560
You did well, hanging in there.

904
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:44,240
Curator Sung.

905
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,080
As you can see, I'm a bit busy.

906
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,080
They're the ones who broke up,

907
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:50,080
so why do we have to suffer?

908
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,920
I think I made the right decision in coming to Korea.

909
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,080
It's nice to see you often.

910
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:55,080
I heard you cheated.

911
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:57,360
How could I get dumped when I didn't even go out with her?

912
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:59,160
I need to make this clear.

913
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:00,560
If you don't have anything to say, I??

914
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:02,120
Ms. Sung Duk-mi, I??
