(Her Private Life)

3
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,680
We??

4
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,960
should stop with our fake relationship.

5
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,360
I was thinking of ending our fake relationship, too.

6
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,040
I'm truly grateful.

7
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,120
Why did she say it like this is the end?

8

(Curator Sung)

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,120
Tomorrow??

10
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,880
I'll be seeing her tomorrow, anyway.

11
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,440
You wait for his call after saying that to him?

12
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,000
Goddamn morning.

13
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,920
I really don't want to go to work today.

(The End Curator Sung)

15
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,400
What's up with her again?

16
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,000
Sun-joo, an iced americano for me.

17
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,720
Did something happen between you and Lion?

18
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,160
No, nothing happened. Why do you ask?

19
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,880
Can you still say nothing happened?

20
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,320
Oh??

21
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,120
Did you confess your feelings for him?

22
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,440
Hey, I told you not to until you're sure!

23
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,960
I didn't.

24
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,200
It was all over before I could.

25
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,600
Lion said he wanted to end this, the fake relationship.

26
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,920
Lion did?

27
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,360
Yeah.

28
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,120
So what did you say?

29
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,800
What was there to say?

30
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,080
I said "Okay, let's end it." I said it collectedly.

31
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,200
What the??

32
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,840
Forget about your confession. The fake relationship is over, too?

33
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,600
What? Why was he being so nice to you, then, if he didn't like you?

34
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,280
I mean, isn't that illegal nowadays?

35
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Right?

36
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,640
I mean... Why did he do this that time huh?

37
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,040
Was he trying to stamp something? Is my mouth an inkpad to him?

38
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,880
Ugh, that bastard.

39
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,240
That bastard.

40
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,600
Why does he have to have such a great voice, huh?

41
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
And those eyes, too!

42
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,240
Yeah, he should go to trial. He deserves a life sentence.

43
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,320
Right?

44
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,360
Still, I feel much better after talking to you.

45
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,400
I feel like I might actually survive this.

46
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,160
Hey, it's Lion!

47
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,080
Lion?

48
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,120
Why are you hiding? You'll be seeing him at work anyway.

49
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,760
I'm not prepared to, not just yet.

50
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,320
Good morning.

51
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,040
So you're having a good morning??

52
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,880
- By any chance??- By any chance, what?

53
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,280
Cu??Curator Sung??

54
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,080
We don't have anything like that on our menu.

55
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,000
I see. Then can I get a condensed milk??

56
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,480
Oh, sorry. We're out of condensed milk.

57
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,520
Then even just a warm milk??

58
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,120
Sorry, we're also out of milk.

59
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,640
Then what do you have?

60
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,840
Coffee.

61
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,200
Would you like a coffee?

62
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,480
It's alright.

63
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,680
I'm sure that was Curator Sung just now.

64
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,000
Why did she lie?

65
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,040
He's gone.

66
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,640
Why am I so pathetic?

67
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,120
Duk-mi, don't do anything for a while. Don't update your

68
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,320
profile picture or your status message.

69
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,720
Oh, and you can't update your social media page, either.

70
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,120
Not even social media?

71
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,000
They say to join the fandom with fanfare, but leave it how?

72
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,160
Quietly.

73
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,560
So just work quietly, alright?

74
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,960
Yes, ma'am.

75
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,080
That bastard.

76
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,480
What brings you here so early?

77
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,680
Let's have breakfast together.

78
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,480
I don't have the appetite. What are you here for?

79
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,520
You're all huffy and it's only morning.

80
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,600
What the... Did you really did confess?

81
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,880
If this isn't about work, just go.

82
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,480
Alright, then let's talk about work.

83
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,520
- Curator Sung. - Ah.

84
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,400
What are you doing?

85
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,800
Why are you so startled?

86
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,560
Oh, it's the Director.

87
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,600
Hi, Mr. Gold!

88
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,200
Hello.

89
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,960
Hello, Ms. Choi. Hello, Director.

90
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,960
I'll go ahead first, then. I'm quite behind on work.

91
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,600
She's right. Whether I'm leaving a fandom or leaving a guy,

92
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,040
I should do it quietly.

93
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,200
So let's just work quietly for now. Quietly.

94
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,040
Ryan wants to end this fake relationship.

95
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,040
So that means you absolutely need me, Ryan, huh?

96
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,920
I absolutely need you, Choi Da-in.

97
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,360
Just work.

98
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,920
What?

99
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,240
Do you know anything?

100
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,560
Curator Sung.

101
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,080
Are you busy right now?

102
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,560
As you can see, I'm a bit busy.

103
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,360
Did you need me for something, Director Ryan Gold?

104
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,720
Nevermind.

105
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,320
(Episode 9: Join the fandom with fanfare, leave it quietly)

106
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,560
(Episode 9: Join the fandom with fanfare, leave it inconspicuously)

107
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,920
It definitely seems like those two fought, doesn't it?

108
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,560
But Curator Sung seemed fine yesterday,

109
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,960
at least before that meeting with Ms. Choi.

110
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,600
Right.

111
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,120
I missed you, Ryan.

112
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,040
- You said you missed me too. - Three.

113
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,480
Why? What is it?

114
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,400
- It's a girl problem. - Girl problem?

115
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,120
Ms. Choi Da-in.

116
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,120
I'll go ahead first, then. I'm quite behind on work.

117
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,000
They've fought??over Director Gold.

118
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,920
Wow... Then you're saying Curator Sung lost the fight?

119
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,080
That's the vibe I'm getting.

120
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,280
Ah, Curator Yoo. What did Ullim say about lending us??

121
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,280
I'll update you via e-mail.

122
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,280
Director Gold, I'm really disappointed!

123
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,160
Mr. Kim, about that third-party storage??

124
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,960
I'll update you via e-mail as well.

125
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,240
Director Gold, you're a shame to all men.

126
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,120
Ms. Kim Hyo-jin.

127
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,760
- I'll also e-mail??- Cha Si-an!

128
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,640
And the special exhibition.

129
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,200
That I dumped her?

130
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,520
Apparently, you cheated on her.

131
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,560
I did?

132
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,560
What, did Curator Sung say that?

133
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,080
No, it's just the employees' speculation.

134
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,120
Speculation??

135
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,000
Ms. Kim, why didn't you say anything?

136
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,400
You know everything, because you stalked me.

137
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,120
Oh. Of course I know that you weren't cheating.

138
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,080
- But??- But?

139
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,800
Why should I?

140
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,840
For a person who threatened to sue me?

141
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,160
I think it serves you right.

142
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,200
Why is she acting like she was dumped when she did the dumping?

143
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,880
Actually, no.

144
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,080
We never even dated, so there was never any dumping to be done!

145
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,000
I need to make this clear.

146
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,800
If you have nothing to say, I'll be on my??

147
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,920
Curator Sung.

148
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,920
What did you mean by what you said last night?

149
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,880
It's as I said.

150
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,720
If it's as you said,

151
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,680
are you saying you want to end this fake relationship?

152
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,000
We can't continue it forever. It was fake to begin with.

153
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,160
Fake to begin with?

154
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,440
Besides, Director Gold.

155
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,640
You said so yourself, before,

156
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,160
that Cheum-patch is gone, and that Ms. Kim Hyo-jin

157
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,840
will be leaving us soon.

158
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,080
Then there's no more reason for us to continue this fake??

159
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,000
Is that really your reason?

160
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,880
Because I??

161
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,840
Fair enough.

162
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,280
You did well, hanging in there.

163
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,040
It was fake?

164
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,240
(A new chatroom has been set up on T.R.T.S.'s homepage)

165
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,000
(Leave)

166
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,960
T.R.T.S., what's your opinion?

167
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,640
Is the cake shop not good? Should I look for another one?

168
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,280
Oh, no. Let's go with this one.

169
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,800
Director, your car lease expired

170
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,320
so a new vehicle has been allocated for you.

171
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,160
It's all registered and ready to use.

172
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,000
Thanks.

173
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,560
Is the concept finalized for ballerina Oh Young-hee's exhibit?

174
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,360
"Time Engraved on a Ballerina's Body."

175
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,040
We're currently discussing with the artists about how to

176
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,640
go about it, in terms of photography and visual arts.

177
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,600
Isn't that too cliche?

178
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,280
Aside from the "Celebrities' Collection" title,

179
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,640
I don't see anything new or different compared

180
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,360
to our previous exhibitions.

181
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,840
I think it's a new approach,

182
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,320
even with just the videos that show Ms. Oh Young-hee's life

183
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,320
as a ballerina in a dramatic way.

184
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,360
Perhaps you're prejudiced in saying that this is cliched,

185
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,760
when you've only had a glimpse of the proposal,

186
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,240
Director Ryan Gold who holds no prejudice.

187
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,040
Man, it's those two who broke up.

188
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,080
Why do we have to be the ones who suffer?

189
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,560
I feel like I actually held my breath for 15 minutes.

190
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,080
So office dating is bad.

191
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,920
I should tell Mom to ban it.

192
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,720
Uh??No, I don't think there's a need for that.

193
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,080
Yeah.

194
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,040
For now??Okay.

195
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,120
Let's eat in peace, at the very least.

196
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,680
I'll take Curator Sung and Hyo-jin,

197
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,120
so you take Director Gold.

198
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,360
- Okay? - Okay.

199
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,240
- Four servings? - Go ahead.

200
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,240
Okay!

201
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,160
How about we go elsewhere??

202
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,760
Lion is always kind and affectionate to everyone.

203
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,120
There's no special meaning behind this.

204
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,080
Looks delicious.

205
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,120
So cute.

206
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,000
Choose one, either be handsome or be cute.

207
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,040
Greedy human.

208
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,880
Does he have to make the world revolve around him?

209
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,480
He's taking it all for himself.

210
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,120
What?

211
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,240
I??I was only trying to serve them out.

212
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,920
I'm sorry if it appeared that way.

213
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,960
Um, that's not??

214
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,160
I can't take this anymore.

215
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,160
They had all the fun when they were dating,

216
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,040
so why's the suffering ours now that they broke up?

217
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,400
Can I take the day off?

218
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,600
This work environment is just too stressful.

219
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,440
Did he have a hard time because of me?

220
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,560
It seems like she's mad at me for something.

221
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,640
Curator Sung.

222
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,320
Yes?

223
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,240
By any chance, did I??

224
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,040
Director Ryan!

225
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,080
Mom! Dad!

226
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,040
Hello.

227
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,120
Hello, Director. Have you been well?

228
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,000
Yes, and you?

229
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,040
Yes, much thanks to you.

230
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,040
Why are you here at the museum?

231
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,640
Why else? To see Director Gold.

232
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,600
You haven't had lunch yet, right?

233
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,040
I prepared you a lunchbox.

234
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,600
We already ate.

235
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,640
Already?

236
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,120
That's why you should've said you were coming.

237
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,640
Well, we thought you'd be eating around noon.

238
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,800
Just go. I'll take you home.

239
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,520
Sorry, Director. We should've let you know we were coming.

240
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,080
Well, see you again, then.

241
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,080
- Let's just go. - Goodbye, then.

242
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,120
Hurry up!

243
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,120
Uh, tell you the truth...!

244
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,040
I'm still a bit hungry.

245
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,200
Curator Sung ate so heartily

246
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,960
that I yielded my food to her.

247
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,840
Oh, did you?

248
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,240
She's like her Dad, and can be a glutton at times.

249
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,840
Let's go, then.

250
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,200
It's a fine day today, so let's have a picnic!

251
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,240
- Come on. - Mom, where are you going?

252
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,320
It looks like she introduced him to her parents already.

253
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,320
Where are you taking him? Director Gold?

254
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,880
I don't think she knows about their breakup.

255
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,160
I'm not going! I said I'm not going!

256
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,160
- Duk-mi, just go. - No!

257
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,080
Man, I really can't watch this.

258
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,960
For you, Director, a tuna kimbap with mayo and a cheese one.

259
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,320
And this is Duk-mi's favorite??

260
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,920
I'm not eating.

261
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,640
Have a taste!

262
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,960
They came out extra tasty today.

263
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,600
Well I'm extra full right now.

264
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,040
I'll have them.

265
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,000
Director, that's r??

266
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,400
Hot??

267
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,720
Do you like hot peppers?

268
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,080
Hot peppers?

269
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,320
I put in a ton of Cheongyang peppers??

270
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,240
Ah, Cheongyang chili peppers??

271
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,880
It's delicious.

272
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,320
Director Gold, are you crying?

273
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,360
No.

274
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,160
It's just so good.

275
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,720
Uh??Drink some of this, and see if it helps.

276
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,040
It's delicious.

277
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,160
Oh, that's right!

278
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,440
I've got something for you.

279
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,160
Um??here.

280
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,880
I made it.

281
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,040
Your name is Lion, right?

282
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,520
Mom, his name is Ryan, not Lion!

283
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,800
Thank you.

284
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,080
Should we take a photo, too, since we're here?

285
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,720
What picture? Let's just go home.

286
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,120
Well, you're right??

287
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,520
What good is a picture when you're old anyway?

288
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,840
The only picture I need is one for my funeral??

289
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,600
Mom! My beautiful mom.

290
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,560
It has been a while. Should we take a photo?

291
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,160
Let's take one with the trees in the background.

292
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,000
Come on. Let's go, Mom.

293
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,160
I'll take one more.

294
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,440
- Director, join us. - Join us!

295
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,960
Come on, join us.

296
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,320
Excuse me, can you take a picture for us?

297
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,480
- A picture? - Yes.

298
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,320
Ah, sure.

299
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,040
Come on, then.

300
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,000
One, two, three!

301
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,200
Mom! What are you doing?

302
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,640
Alright??One, two, three!

303
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,680
- Mom! - Just stay there.

304
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,600
Give me a wide, pretty smile, Duk-mi.

305
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,560
Oh, Director! You should smile, too!

306
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,760
Here we go.

307
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,840
One, two, three!

308
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,080
Duk-mi, a wider smile.

309
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,080
You guys look great! Just lovely!

310
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,000
We could've just gotten a taxi. Thank you.

311
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,200
I got to enjoy a delicious lunchbox, thanks to you.

312
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,520
Of course I should take you home.

313
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,040
I'm guessing you found my cooking to be alright?

314
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:24,200
Yes, I even finished all the side dishes you packed me last time.

315
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,600
You finished them all?

316
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,560
Oh, then you should've said so.

317
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,680
Then why don't you drop by our house and??

318
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,640
Mom.

319
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,560
Director Gold is a busy man, and he's already missed a whole

320
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,640
day of work because you showed up unexpectedly.

321
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,720
Today's the last day you disturb him.

322
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,920
It was thoughtless of me.

323
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,040
I'm sorry.

324
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,440
No, please.

325
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,120
Next time, why don't I invite you for??

326
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,160
Director.

327
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,520
You really don't have to.

328
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,280
Thank you for today.

329
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,160
Drive safely.

330
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,160
Go.

331
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,360
Go.

332
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,680
Bye.

333
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,040
I'm sorry.

334
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,920
We won't trouble you again like this anymore.

335
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,720
I enjoyed it.

336
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,120
You don't have to think of it as troubling me.

337
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,680
Thank you for your understanding.

338
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,800
Honestly,

339
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,080
it still stings. That??

340
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,520
The hot-pepper kimbap?

341
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,000
My tongue is still numb.

342
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,440
It was my first time seeing it in a long time,

343
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,160
that smiling face of yours.

344
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,800
Do I make you uncomfortable?

345
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,720
Oh, no. It's not like that at all.

346
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,320
But because our fake relationship has come to an end??

347
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,320
So what if it did?

348
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,520
What happens now, if things are going to be

349
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,200
as awkward and uncomfortable as this?

350
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,720
Well??

351
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,680
(Ms. Choi Da-in)

352
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,080
Ryan's not picking up.

353
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,880
Is he with you?

354
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,400
No, it's about work.

355
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,560
The timelines for Mr. Cha Si-an's album and exhibition

356
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,360
might be a bit too tight.

357
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,400
Can you schedule a meeting with him?

358
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,920
Sure, thanks.

359
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,920
Alright.

360
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,880
Mom, the cuckoo bird is here.

361
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,160
Sis, you have a moocher to feed, too.

362
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,080
I made kimbap. Come eat.

363
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,160
Woohoo, it's my favorite. Wow!

364
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,560
Sis, sis.

365
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,920
I brought your son-in-law over.

366
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,880
My son-in-law?

367
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,160
Director Ryan Gold.

368
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,040
He's just Duk-mi's boss.

369
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,640
He's handsome, competent and single.

370
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,200
Why should he be just her boss?

371
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,600
He's her potential son-in-law.

372
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,560
Right, sis?

373
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,640
I hoped so too,

374
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,080
but it seems like that's not the case.

375
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,080
Did Duk-mi say it's not?

376
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,160
I made lunch and visited the museum today,

377
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,600
hoping to see Director Gold as well. But??

378
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,840
This??You made this kimbap for that Lion bastard? Did you?

379
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,040
I'm not eating!

380
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,480
Then don't!

381
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,240
Mom??

382
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:28,200
How is it that you and Duk-mi are all the same?

383
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,680
I guess I can't blame them though.

384
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,760
It was me who raised them!

385
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,520
You...

386
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,040
Why are you so upset, sis?

387
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,440
What did Duk-mi say?

388
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,520
Well, I don't know what it is with that girl,

389
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,320
but she was all pouting

390
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,560
and she wouldn't even look at her favorite hot-pepper kimbap!

391
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,240
I'm sure it's because there were many eyes watching,

392
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,960
since it is her workplace. I'm sure she was just being shy.

393
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,520
No!

394
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,000
Director Gold drove us home,

395
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,120
and I was so grateful to him that, you know,

396
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,680
I asked him to come drop by

397
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,800
so I could pack some food for him.

398
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,840
But Duk-mi wouldn't have it, and told us to just go.

399
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,400
Why would she do that?

400
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,720
It's obvious, it's all because of me.

401
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,560
If we were either well off,

402
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,880
or had a solid retirement plan??

403
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,400
Then she wouldn't feel so reluctant about marriage.

404
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,120
And it's not like she has any siblings, either.

405
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,360
Why doesn't she have any siblings? She has Eun-ki.

406
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,960
You know, should Eun-ki ever get married,

407
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,320
I'm going to tell his wife to think of you as her in-laws.

408
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,280
Don't go around saying that!

409
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,160
Do you not want to see your son get married?

410
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,240
What girl would marry him if you tell her she'll have 3 in-laws?

411
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,280
That's why he needs to work on his charm.

412
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,160
Or earn lots of money.

413
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,920
- Excuse me. - Ah, jeez!

414
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,920
Director Eom?

415
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,000
Oh my God.

416
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,360
- Shhh. - Shhh.

417
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,440
Help me up.

418
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,880
Oh my God.

419
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,240
Director, why are you here?

420
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,080
And what's with your??I mean, why are you dressed like that?

421
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,680
Where is my daughter?

422
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,000
Follow me!

423
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,680
What did she say?

424
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,920
Oh, to follow her?

425
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,320
So in other words,

426
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,920
Hyo-jin's been entrusted with a main project?

427
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,520
Moreso than a main project??

428
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,400
Now that's what a growth engine is.

429
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,520
A-players.

430
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,520
Management must be able to discern where to place

431
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,200
and how to use these A-players to the company's advantage.

432
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,320
And the fact that he's using Hyo- jin, who is still a mere intern??

433
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,320
Ryan Gold.

434
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,160
Let's leave for now.

435
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,000
- Secretary Kim? - Yes.

436
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,280
When did you say the election for TK Cultural Foundation's

437
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,440
new chairperson was?

438
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,240
This week.

439
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,160
Tell them to push it back one week, there's a new candidate.

440
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,000
Candidate?

441
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,120
Me. Eom So-hye.

442
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,720
We need to teach that daring lion at the zoo

443
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,520
who the real owner of Cheum is, shouldn't we?

444
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,080
- Open the door. - Yes, ma'am!

445
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,040
What is this?

446
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,480
Hi.

447
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,160
Eun-ki, what's all this?

448
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,080
Go get changed.

449
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,520
What's gotten into you that you're doing this without my asking?

450
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,720
I heard Mom and Dad went to the museum today.

451
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,800
How did you find out? Did Mom say something?

452
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,000
No.

453
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,720
She didn't say anything, but she looked a bit...

454
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,600
She appeared out of nowhere, without even calling me first.

455
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,520
We were already full from having lunch,

456
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,920
but she forced us to eat the kimbap she brought.

457
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,680
And then Lion??

458
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,120
Lion's a busy person, but he couldn't get any work done

459
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,960
because of them, and even drove them home.

460
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,080
I mean, he suffered enough because of that fake relationship.

461
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,040
Did Lion say it was hard for him?

462
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,880
Being in a fake relationship with you?

463
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,120
Yes.

464
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,200
That's why we decided to stop, but Mom??

465
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,960
She turned up without warning,

466
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,240
and fed Lion kimbap?

467
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,280
When your mind is troubled because your fake relationship is over?

468
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,080
I must be crazy.

469
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,640
Why did I get so into it, when it was all fake?

470
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,840
Enough is enough. I deserve a few whacks.

471
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,880
God, it's hot.

472
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,520
All this knitting??

473
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,080
What the??

474
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,920
Sung Duk-mi.

475
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,840
Are you crying?

476
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,080
Gosh.

477
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,360
This is why you got rejected, because you're so gross.

478
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,680
I'll beat him half to death, tomorrow. Okay?

479
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,840
Do those for me.

480
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,120
Leg locks, trunk strangles, and scissors throws.

481
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,040
Hey, those are all forbidden moves in judo.

482
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,080
Do them for me!

483
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,120
He could really die.

484
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,560
Then kill him!

485
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,320
You're going to keep him alive, when he rejected me?

486
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,280
That bastard deserves to die.

487
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,920
Block all of his airways!

488
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,680
Alright, I'll kill him.

489
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,720
You promised, alright?

490
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,760
Duk-mi, don't do anything for a while. Don't update your

491
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,440
profile picture or your status message.

492
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,080
Oh, and you can't update your social media page, either.

493
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,720
Right.

494
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,160
I shouldn't do anything I'll regret later.

495
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,000
Just leave it.

496
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,960
I can't sleep??What do I do?

497
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,800
Let's see.

498
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,360
(Open Chatroom)

499
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,200
It's a sleepless night,

500
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,440
so I welcome your painful stories.

501
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,960
(Shan Oppa has entered the chatroom)

502
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,080
Hello.

503
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,840
I've come folllowing a breakup.

504
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,680
Shan Oppa, I'm all ears.

505
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,000
(There was a guy I was seeing,)

506
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,640
(and he'd even promised marriage, but it turns out)

507
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,120
(he not only had another girl, he also lied about his age!)

508
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,680
What??

509
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,440
So you're saying that your fiance not only

510
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,880
cheated on you, but also lied about his age the whole time?

511
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,160
First, sue him for making false promises of marriage.

512
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,840
The thing is??

513
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,960
(Shan Oppa)

514
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,160
You're twelve??

515
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:55,480
(T.R.T.S.: You're twelve??)

516
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,840
Shan Oppa,

517
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,760
you've only lived for 12 years so far.

518
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,400
You'll have countless more chances to meet great guys.

519
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,160
Have you met many guys, T.R.T.S.?

520
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,600
Alright, next.

521
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
(Si-an's Princess)

522
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I go to the same cram school as my boyfriend, for math.

523
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,720
Math??

524
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,840
And so does his friend, who's a girl.

525
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,520
Anyway, I was late yesterday,

526
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,160
and that wench was sitting right next to him!

527
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,120
Woooow.

528
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,440
Well I was super mad,

529
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,640
so I asked her to move, but she wouldn't!

530
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,880
That is annoying.

531
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,160
Oh my??And?

532
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,760
Well, I yanked her hair and??

533
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,480
Ugh. My mom says to turn off the computer.

534
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,200
(Si-an's Princess has left the chatroom)

535
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,920
Should I just try going to bed?

536
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,960
Knock, knock.

537
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,160
(Latte)

538
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,920
Are you asleep?

539
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,160
No, I'm not.

540
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,320
I'm all ears, Latte.

541
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,000
So I talk about myself?

542
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,520
Yes.

543
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,200
I'm currently listening to the personal stories of

544
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,080
those who can't sleep because they're heartbroken.

545
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,480
(Latte)

546
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,800
Well, at the museum whe??

547
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,680
Workplace. Workplace.

548
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,120
At my workplace??

549
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,280
At your workplace?

550
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,160
There's someone I've come to like.

551
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,440
So it's one-sided love..

552
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,000
It's not??

553
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,200
one-sided.

554
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,200
Definitely not.

555
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,640
The person smiles brightly whenever our eyes meet,

556
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,360
and forgives me even if I do something wrong.

557
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,120
Once again, I'm sorry.

558
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,600
I sincerely apologize.

559
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,800
Sure.

560
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:41,160
And the parents have a good impression of me.

561
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,680
I packed some of the side dishes you seemed to enjoy.

562
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,960
Oh, thank??Thank you for the food.

563
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,280
Director, please visit us again.

564
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,080
Anyway, so I tried to ask them out officially,

565
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,880
in order to advance our relationship.

566
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:55,120
Let's stop with the fake relationship.

567
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,480
But they suddenly asked to stop it all.

568
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,640
Oh dear.

569
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,200
Stop what?

570
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,840
Oh.

571
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,000
To stop being close.

572
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,640
Oh. So you tried to confess your feelings, and now there's

573
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,120
some distance?

574
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,920
Perhaps??

575
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:32,480
Isn't it possible that they felt burdened by your feelings?

576
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,640
It's nice if the person you like likes you just as much??

577
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,080
(Pompon: My feelings are sincere)

578
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,080
But if that's not the case,

579
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:47,320
wouldn't it be better to give up on the confession

580
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:52,040
before those precious feelings started burdening them?

581
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,680
But Latte,

582
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,960
Si-an never feels burdened by our love for him.

583
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,760
You've only just fallen for him,

584
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,560
so you've got a lot of catching up to do.

585
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,360
Look at Si-an and stay strong!

586
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,680
What if looking at Mr. Cha Si-an doesn't cheer me up at all?

587
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,840
If even Si-an can't make you smile,

588
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:31,000
then you're really, really very ill.

589
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,600
Start by seeing a doctor.

590
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,840
Well, Latte, see you again!

591
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,080
(T.R.T.S. has left the chatroom)

592
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,880
You're a good talker.

593
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,760
It's burdensome?

594
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,920
Yeah,

595
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:14,200
it's a good thing you didn't confess. It really is.

596
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,680
(Delete)

597
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,040
(Unregister from T.R.T.S.'s fan page?)

598
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,680
I can't get myself to delete it.

599
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,840
- Ah, Ju Hyuk. - Yes.

600
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,200
I'm stepping out for a while,

601
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,120
but I'll be back before your band practice??

602
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,000
You can take your time, you know.

603
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,600
I can miss one day of practice.

604
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,800
Miss one day of practice, and you will know.

605
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,880
Miss two days of practice, and the critics will know.

606
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:04,040
Miss three days, and the audience will know.

607
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,480
It's a relief, then.

608
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,000
Because I have no audience in the first place.

609
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,920
Excuse me.

610
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,480
Yes, miss?

611
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,360
The music that's playing now??

612
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,000
It's great, right? There's this band, FADE??

613
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:20,640
He's the vocalist and the guitarist in that band!

614
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,440
What's more, he wrote this song.

615
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,200
That's really great, but??

616
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,840
I came here an hour ago,

617
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:29,640
and this song has been on repeat since then.

618
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:30,840
Oh??

619
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,080
You see, they only recorded one song.

620
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:35,440
I'll change the music for you.

621
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,640
Your band has more original songs, right?

622
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,120
- Yes. - Let's record them.

623
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,840
But Ms. Lee, that costs a lot of money, and??

624
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,000
Ms. Lee? Ms. Lee?

625
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:50,880
What's the favor you wanted to ask?

626
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,160
You know those cheering sticks we ordered for that event?

627
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,840
The samples are out, so I wanted you to check them out.

628
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,440
Not sure what's gotten into Oppa, but he asked me out on a date.

629
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,320
A date? Your husband did?

630
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,240
I thought he was extremely busy because of that final show?

631
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,400
It's weird, right?

632
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:08,920
It's weird.

633
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,720
Hey, what's so weird about a husband

634
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,240
wanting to take his wife out on a date?

635
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:16,400
Anyway, I'll contact them. You just go and enjoy yourself.

636
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,920
- Duk-mi. - Yes?

637
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,160
What do you do when you're depressed?

638
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,040
Fangirl.

639
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,040
And today, take photos.

640
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:27,560
Seriously, I'm still fangirling in the midst of all this.

641
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,160
That's all the more reason to let yourself get absorbed in it.

642
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,160
Fangirling is your path.

643
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,800
Fangirling is my path.

644
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:38,040
I'm off, then. You be happy, at least.

645
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,760
Yes, I think it's as we wanted it to be.

646
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,040
As for the sample??

647
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,120
Then I'll see you tomorrow.

648
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,640
Yes, thank you.

649
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:38,760
Ha! I knew it. What date?

650
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,120
Oppa.

651
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,080
Ah, you're here?

652
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,360
If you were craving meat, you should've told me.

653
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,120
Here, go hang your coat.

654
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,840
How nice would it be if I took it off and handed it to him,

655
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:02,080
and he came to put this away for me, huh?

656
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,360
What's this?

657
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:27,840
Oppa??

658
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,920
Yes, Sun-joo.

659
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,080
Did you cheat on me?

660
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,240
Hey, what the hell is this?

661
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,800
What the hell is this supposed to mean?

662
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,080
Come on, I'm sorry.

663
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,120
I mean, if you suddenly give me something like this,

664
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,640
will I or will I not be surprised?

665
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,760
If someone heard you, they'd think I never gave you presents.

666
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,000
You're my biggest present, Oppa.

667
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,560
Lee Sun-joo, you can't let your feelings change.

668
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,480
Of course.

669
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,120
Whatever I do,

670
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,080
it's all for you and Gun-woo.

671
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,040
You know that, right?

672
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,680
Of course I do, of course!

673
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,680
Good.

674
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,920
That reminded me of when we first met.

675
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,600
I met you at the broadcasting station

676
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,120
when I went to fangirl with Duk-mi.

677
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,080
Oppa.

678
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:56,840
We were brought together through fangirling.

679
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,120
So you have to appreciate the fact that

680
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,400
I was a fangirl.

681
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,520
Okay?

682
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,760
(Universally Handsome Man Cha Si-an)

683
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,200
Should I upload it?

684
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,200
(Upload Picture)

685
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,400
Fangirling is the best.

686
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,000
It's the funnest thing in the world.

687
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,400
Oh, Brother!

688
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,320
Hello, Mr. Cha Si-an.

689
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,480
Why alcohol?

690
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,640
Do you need a drinking budd??

691
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,360
No, I bought just enough for myself.

692
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,040
So you're going to drink by yourself?

693
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,400
You must be returning from a shoot.

694
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,200
Yes.

695
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,520
T.R.T.S. is uploading heaps of photos today.

696
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,000
I wonder what's up?

697
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,960
T??T.R.T.S.?

698
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:06,880
Yes.

699
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,040
You remember, right? I told you about her last time.

700
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:12,360
Even I'm surprised, sometimes,

701
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,280
by the pictures she takes of me.

702
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,160
I wonder, "Have I always made these expressions?"

703
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,040
- For example, this picture here??- Stop!

704
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:21,960
What?

705
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,120
The elevator has stopped on your floor.

706
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,680
Sure. See you tomorrow, then.

707
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,520
Tomorrow?

708
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,920
For the meeting with Ms. Choi Da-in.

709
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:38,840
Oh.

710
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,160
Oh, and that Curator Sung, too??

711
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,480
Curator Sung.

712
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:16,360
What time is that meeting with Ms. Choi and Mr. Cha Si-an?

713
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,600
At 2 p.m.

714
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,720
Then I'll meet you at the parking lot at 1??

715
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,840
No, I'll be out for an off-site meeting.

716
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:27,160
I'll head straight to Ms. Choi's studio from there.

717
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,080
Were you that burdened by??

718
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:35,760
Fine, alright.

719
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,400
Can you take a look to see if it's alright?

720
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:57,120
This bit here, inside??

721
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,320
- Can you do that for me? - Sure.

722
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,480
I'll be looking forward to it.

723
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,160
Let me take the sample with me.

724
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,280
Well, what's wrong with skipping work sometimes?

725
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,000
I'm here, Ms. Choi.

726
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,440
You're early.

727
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,640
Where's Ms. Sung Duk-mi?

728
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,440
She didn't come with you?

729
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,920
No, she had another meeting.

730
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,640
I think I made the right decision in coming to Korea.

731
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,480
It's nice to see you often.

732
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,040
Ugh, I really don't want to go.

733
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,880
No. I have Si-an.

734
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,880
I'm here to see him.

735
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,240
Fangirling for work.

736
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,920
Give me your autograph.

737
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:05,960
Autograph?

738
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,200
Yes, I'm really a big fan of yours.

739
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,000
I even brought along some paper and a pen.

740
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,200
Start by signing here.

741
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,600
We can't proceed if you don't sign the contract.

742
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,240
Brother. I was first.

743
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:23,760
Your name?

744
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,080
Cha Si-an.

745
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,400
What, your autograph's still??

746
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,320
I told you to change it, so it's legible.

747
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,080
It's fine as long as you can read it.

748
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,480
So, have you decided on a concept?

749
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,160
White Ocean's Cha Si-an.

750
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,040
As a way of representing a new beginning,

751
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,000
I was thinking of showing various colors

752
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,280
all of which are made from white.

753
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:51,600
White, smokey white, snow??

754
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,680
Like how that one color we think we know

755
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:58,040
in fact has thousands of different colors within?

756
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,160
Exactly.

757
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:03,320
So I'll add a spectrum effect to this background.

758
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,160
With a media facade effect?

759
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:07,000
Like in the Berlin Art Fair last year?

760
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,040
Ah, you're spot on.

761
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,120
Just as I'd expect.

762
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,000
This is what's great about working with you.

763
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,160
This is your work from two years ago, right?

764
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,480
I really liked it, so I wanted to add it to my collection.

765
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,120
- Oh, really? - Yes.

766
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,000
I have something similar??Something like this.

767
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,640
I think this looks really good, too.

768
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,560
Or there's this.

769
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,760
I like your idea,

770
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,840
but how about you make it easier?

771
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:30,840
Why? I thought you liked it.

772
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,680
Something that's more direct

773
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,880
and easily accessible for the wider audience.

774
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,520
Please put some more thought into it. You're a pro.

775
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,760
Typical. You never give me a straight pass.

776
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,480
Curator Sung!

777
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,880
Are you alright? You're not hurt?

778
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:48,720
I'm fine.

779
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,200
I'll clean this up right away. I'm really sorry.

780
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,560
Oh no, it's fine.

781
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,000
What is wrong with me??

782
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,520
Ms. Sung Duk-mi.

783
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,720
You were startled, weren't you? Sorry about that.

784
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,120
No, we're really fine.

785
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,600
As long as you're not hurt.

786
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,080
Please excuse me, I'm sorry.

787
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,920
Yes, hello?

788
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:27,880
Yes. Yes.

789
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,560
Oh, right now?

790
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,560
Uh??Now's not the best time.

791
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:34,840
Oh, really?

792
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:37,520
Yes, I see. Bye.

793
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,040
Oh no??What do I do?

794
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,040
Is something wrong?

795
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,440
I ordered more wood to be sent to the workshop,

796
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,400
but the owner's out at the moment.

797
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,000
Then I'll go.

798
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,000
Could you?

799
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Of course. I can still head out now, right?

800
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,200
Thank you, I'll ask just this one favor.

801
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,080
No worries.

802
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,080
Hello?

803
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,560
Yes, we're on our way.

804
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,080
Yes, thank you.

805
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,440
Excuse me.

806
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,760
Is anybody here?

807
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,560
Maybe they're not here yet?

808
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:56,000
- Mom! - Just stay there.

809
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:00,040
It was my first time seeing it in a long time,

810
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,880
that smiling face of yours.

811
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:56,000
Isn't it possible that they felt burdened by your feelings?

812
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:04,080
(T.R.T.S.'s Inbox: Latte)

813
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:09,000
Do you really think

814
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,200
my feelings are simply burdensome?

815
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:17,520
Latte, I actually lied to you.

816
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:19,800
Ms. Sung Duk-mi.

817
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,920
The reason why I gave up on telling him how I felt

818
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:25,600
wasn't my consideration for him,

819
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:29,040
but my cowardice and concern that I might get hurt.

820
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,960
Perhaps, Latte??

821
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:35,880
Perhaps that person isn't burdened by your feeelings at all.

822
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:40,000
Maybe they ran away because, like me,

823
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
they were scared that they might end up hurt.

824
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,960
So why don't we both muster the courage again?

01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,800
Director.

828
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:05,200
I didn't want to ask you this??

829
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:08,480
I really didn't want to ask you, but??

830
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,600
What was so hard about it?

831
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,200
Being in a fake relationship with me, I mean.

832
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Did you really hate it that much?

833
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:37,840
Yes.

834
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,960
What did you hate so much about it?

835
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,040
It's not like I called you every day,

836
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,080
or asked you to see me every day.

837
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,720
All you??

838
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:52,960
All you had to do was pretend you're dating me, for a bit.

839
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,240
Was that so hard for you? Did you hate it that much?

840
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:05,800
I had butterflies and enjoyed it??

841
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:06,960
So why, Director??

842
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,360
Because it was fake.

843
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,120
I hated it because it was fake.

844
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:35,080
I wanted it to be real.

845
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:11,360
(Her Private Life)

846
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,880
So we're dating, right?

847
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:15,120
I'm dating Lion!

848
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:16,760
There's no one but me.

849
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,840
A guy who knows Duk-mi more than she knows herself.

850
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,440
I guess you trusted my words

851
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:22,920
more than you trusted Ryan's feelings.

852
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,040
7 o'clock!

853
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,920
Just the right time to see your girlfriend.

854
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,440
I guess I'm the only one who missed you.

855
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:30,240
Duk-mi, who will you choose between me and Lion?

856
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,160
I like you, Sung Duk-mi.

857
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:35,280
You know I don't like letting go of hands.

858
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:36,760
Do you want to just invite me in?
