00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,560
Miss Duk-mi??

4
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,280
Aren't I heavy?

5
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,960
It feels like your arms have lost some of their strength.

6
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,000
No, you're not heavy at all.

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,200
Your head's lighter than it looks.

8
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,520
Thank you for telling me what was probably hard to say.

9
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,480
Thank you,

10
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,000
for being that someone I can confide in.

11
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,440
I kept it suppressed for three years,

12
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,400
and it's liberating to finally have said it.

13
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,400
Right?

14
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,320
From now on, I'll lend you my ears whenever you need them.

15
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,120
First you lend me your hands and now your ears.

16
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,600
What can I lend you, then?

17
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,200
Let me think about that.

18
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,520
We're not going to write up an IOU, are we?

19
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,360
- Shall we go? - Alright.

20
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,840
Director. Today, I'll take you home.

21
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,000
You'll take me home?

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,400
Yes.

23
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,880
What are we taking today, then?

24
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,000
Your car.

25
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,240
Is that taking me home?

26
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,800
Me driving my own car to my place?

27
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,120
So you don't want to?

28
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,520
No, that sounds so good.

29
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,080
Let's go.

(Episode 13: Always Together, Even When You're Alone)

31
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,440
Didn't you say you were taking me home?

32
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,080
We're here now.

33
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,080
We're not quite there yet.

34
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,720
Then you're going all the way to my door?

35
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,520
Should I really just go home?

36
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,040
What should we do tonight?

37
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,560
Last time, we did something I'm good at,

38
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,320
so this time, let's do something you're good at.

39
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,600
Something I'm good at?

40
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,360
We've agreed to do something I'm good at.

41
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,360
Whatever it is, it won't be easy to beat me.

42
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,520
- Do you really think so? - Yes.

43
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,600
You'll see soon enough.

44
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,240
Ah, Brother!

45
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,560
- Hello, Curator Sung. - Hello.

46
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,680
This is a brother who lives one floor up, and his girlfriend.

47
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,160
He really likes me, you know.

48
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,160
Si-an must bother you a lot.

49
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,360
This is my mom.

50
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,040
It's nice to meet you. I'm Ryan Gold.

51
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,160
Hello, I'm Sung Duk-mi.

52
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,240
Si-an gets lonely easily, so he likes being around people.

53
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,200
He's not weird, I promise.

54
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,280
Mom!

55
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,560
You just made me look weird by saying that.

56
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,440
Ah. Brother, Ms. Sung??see you.

57
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,640
Mr. Cha Si-an!

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,960
The damaged painting has been well restored.

59
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,040
Great.

60
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,560
Figures.

61
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,560
What figures?

62
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,120
Si-an. I always wondered where he got his good looks,

63
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,160
and it turns out that his mother is a stunning beauty!

64
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,520
The power of DNA, right?

65
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,120
Oh, so you came to see Mr. Cha Si-an, huh?

66
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,160
Then why don't you just follow him instead?

67
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,040
May I?

68
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,080
They are, right? Your paintings?

69
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,200
You remembered these paintings?

70
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,480
Of course I do.

71
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,840
You were so devastated when Grandpa secretly rid of them all.

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I wanted to find them all for you, but it hasn't been easy.

73
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,800
Thankfully, with this upcoming exhibition,

74
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,600
we should be able to find a few more.

75
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,840
Oh yeah, Mom. That guy just now was the museum director.

76
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,840
He's very well known for his aesthetic sense.

77
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,040
It was he who first suggested it.

78
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,480
He said your art is great and that he wanted to see it on exhibit.

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,440
Si-an.

80
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,160
I appreciate how you've been looking for these for me, but??

81
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,120
These paintings, I??

82
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,160
I don't want to see them on exhibit.

83
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,240
These paintings??These paintings are??

84
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,240
I know.

85
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,120
I know, Mom.

86
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,480
I know, but just this once.

87
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,160
Just this once, for your sake??

88
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,000
Can't you just think of yourself and let it happen?

89
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,840
I can't do that.

90
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,840
It can't happen.

91
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,320
Then for my sake, if anything??

92
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,160
Think about it for me. Please?

93
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,120
Well, let's first eat something. I'm hungry, Mom.

94
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,880
I'm heading out first.

95
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,520
Now I understand.

96
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,480
I get why you were so upset

97
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,320
when I stepped into this room.

98
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,480
Back then??

99
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,320
I didn't bring this up to receive an apology.

100
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,240
I just wanted to say that I'm so glad

101
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,120
I got to know you more and understand you better.

102
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,040
Besides, I should be the one apologizing.

103
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,600
That time, at the auction house??

104
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,640
I'm sorry for making a rash judgment about this piece.

105
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,000
I didn't mean it, I promise.

106
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,200
I understand.

107
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,680
Because I also know more about you.

108
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,000
Besides, you weren't entirely wrong.

109
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,720
What would you say about this work, then?

110
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,040
As an art director?

111
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,320
I sense sadness and uncertainty.

112
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,360
Those bubbles that may just burst any minute

113
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,080
seem to represent the reality beyond the canvas.

114
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,760
The way I see it??

115
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,000
Rather than uncertainty, I think these bubbles

116
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,560
represent hope because while they're fragile,

117
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,120
they're always ready to float high up into the sky.

118
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,840
A painting's meaning is dependent upon the viewer's perspective.

119
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,480
I hope that one day, you too, Director,

120
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,640
will see that painting in that light.

121
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,080
So can we do what I want to do now?

122
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,160
What is it that you want to do?

123
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,760
- Father. - Eun-ki, come in quick!

124
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,560
- Hurry up and come in. - What is it? What?

125
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,800
- Close the door. - Why?

126
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,640
Father, why??Why? What's going on?

127
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
Oh what?

128
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,920
Father??Father!

129
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,800
Hello!

130
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,320
W-who??Who are you?

131
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,560
Who are you?

132
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,640
Father.

133
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,200
What are you doing?

134
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,080
I'm told that I'm a genius in whatever I do.

135
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,600
Pick a card!

136
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,760
How did a lily-livered fellow like you

137
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,600
manage to uproot and upend our whole house?

138
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,000
Here.

139
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,160
Ha!

140
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,080
- W-water??- Here, water.

141
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,760
Mom, who's this kid though?

142
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,440
Oh, she's Duk-mi's subordinate.

143
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm a homestay tenant.

144
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,920
You said you'd rent Curator Sung's room to me if I left home.

145
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,920
Who said that?

146
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,040
Uh, that's my room.

147
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,840
How much is this mister paying?

148
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,920
"Mister"?

149
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,000
I'll pay double.

150
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,280
Hey, whether you're willing to pay double or triple??

151
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,120
- Give me just three scoops more. - Three scoo??

152
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,280
You can have four.

153
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,120
We're here.

154
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,000
Now you're doing this?

155
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Don't you think it's too late?

156
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,320
Go in, Mr. Ryan Tazza.

157
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,760
"Tazza"?

158
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,120
What's a tazza?

159
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,080
A tazza is??

160
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,760
Just watch the movie.

161
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,040
Drive safely.

162
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,040
Thank you.

163
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,360
Thank you.

164
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,320
(Eun-ki Bastard)

165
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,840
What the??

166
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,960
What's this? Why's Hyo-jin there?

167
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,600
You ask her yourself.

168
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,080
Hello, Curator Sung.

169
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,160
Why are you at my parents' house, Hyo-jin?

170
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,040
With all your belongings?

171
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,000
Well, I went home after work??

172
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,920
Mother!

173
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,560
Ms. Kim Hyo-jin, who talked back at me,

174
00:13:53,560 --> 00:14:00,040
Eom So-hye, in front of Mr. Gold??

175
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,640
Do I still look like your mother to you?

176
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,000
Mother, about what happened??

177
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,080
You were amazing.

178
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,240
If you're my daughter,

179
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,400
you should have guts, yes.

180
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,040
But??

181
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,640
You dare to use those guts on me?

182
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,480
Mother, I can explain.

183
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,280
That's how much I wanted for the merchandise I designed

184
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,800
to be a hit at Cheum's 5th anniversary special exhibition.

185
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,440
Oh, so it's not because of Cha Si-an, at all?

186
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,080
That's right, not at all.

187
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,640
Alright.

188
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,200
You can do your special exhibition.

189
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,080
However, until then??

190
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,280
Try living without your car, credit card and camera.

191
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,680
Alright, I will.

192
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,720
Oh!

193
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,920
And the house, too.

194
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,000
What?

195
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,200
Secretary Kim!

196
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,600
Okay, get out.

197
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,800
Out! Out!

198
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,640
In other words, if I live in this house

199
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,880
the special exhibition will go without any problems.

200
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,240
It's great that the exhibition will go ahead as planned,

201
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,320
but why my mom's place, out of all places?

202
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,080
What's your duty as the head curator?

203
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,840
Isn't it to make sure that prep for the exhibition goes smoothly?

204
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,840
Yes, so?

205
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,080
Then you should take me in, because you owe me.

206
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,160
The way I see it, this room has bad feng shui.

207
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,680
It only attracts weirdos.

208
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,000
Hey, you used that room, too, you know.

209
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,800
Do I even compare to the room's owner? Gosh.

210
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
Hey!

211
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,640
Sung Duk-mi.

212
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,640
What?

213
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,160
Mom says to come home on our birthday.

214
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,600
Oh, but I think I'll be a little busy that day.

215
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,080
You will?

216
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,840
Alright, I'll tell Mom, then.

217
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,000
Alright, talk to you later.

218
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,640
Mister.

219
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,040
What time do you go to work tomorrow?

220
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,400
It's quite close to our museum.

221
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,200
Wow, have you no shame?

222
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,440
I've definitely seen this before.

223
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,600
By the way, I'm not a "mister".

224
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,240
By the way, I'm not a "mister"!

225
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,000
Ah, Cu. Yoo.

226
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Sorry for calling you so late.

227
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,720
No, it's alright. What is it?

228
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,000
We have to send the final draft of the brochure to the print shop.

229
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,120
How should I introduce Lee Sol?

230
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,440
Oh, about that??

231
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,840
Leave it blank for now. Are we doing the edits tomorrow?

232
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,560
Yes, will you be going, Curator Sung?

233
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,680
Yes, I'll go.

234
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,760
Another thing. Right now, we've planned the layout for

235
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,680
the scenario in which we have all nine of Lee Sol's works.

236
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,440
Shouldn't we also prepare a plan B in case we don't find them all?

237
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,880
We must admit, it won't be easy to find the remainder of them.

238
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,640
No, we still have time so let's look a little more.

239
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,040
I'll do some searching myself, but could you ask some

240
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,520
galleries and collectors, Cu. Yoo?

241
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,040
Sure, I'll try my best. Have a good night!

242
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,120
Good night to you, too.

243
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,120
It was all because of Lee Sol's art,

244
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,560
so I thought something might change

245
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,320
if I collected all of her works.

246
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,280
Why would someone who paints such beautiful art??

247
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,040
Let's first find the paintings.

248
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,760
Editor Nam, this is Duk-mi.

249
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,400
Can I see you tomorrow, briefly?

250
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,960
Where should we meet?

251
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,360
I'll contact you again tomorrow.

252
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,040
If you know anything about artist Lee Sol

253
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,160
or have seen paintings in a style similar to hers,

254
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,880
I would very much like to hear from you.

255
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,720
Hello, Director Ryan Gold.

256
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,680
Oh, hello.

257
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,400
Did I surprise you?

258
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,240
If you're yet to have breakfast, have this.

259
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,280
I prepared some extra while making some for Si-an.

260
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,280
I'm not a great cook, but my sandwiches are alright.

261
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,760
Thank you, I'm sure I'll enjoy these.

262
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,080
I came to apologize.

263
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,040
Si-an mentioned you a lot,

264
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,120
which means he must have bothered you quite a bit.

265
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,760
He didn't bother me that much.

266
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,560
He was fine when he lived with the other members in his group

267
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,160
but I guess living alone has made him lonely.

268
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,000
He keeps asking me to come back to Korea for good, too.

269
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
So it's a relief to know that

270
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,840
he has a great friend who lives one floor up.

271
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,600
Thank you.

272
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,680
No, it's really nothing.

273
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,560
Oh no, you must've been getting ready for work.

274
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,920
- Go on in. - Alright.

275
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,000
(Gold Lion)

276
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,840
Good morning!

277
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,080
Curator Sung.

278
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,080
Yes, Director.

279
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,440
Where are you now? Are you already at the office?

280
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,280
I'm still at home, but I'm about to head out.

281
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,800
Then come out as soon as you can.

282
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,920
What? Where are you, anyway?

283
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,840
Thank goodness, you're still at home.

284
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,720
I thought something had happened.

285
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,040
Something did happen.

286
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,160
What happened?

287
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,080
What's all this? Breakfast?

288
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,480
Mr. Cha Si-an's mother made these herself.

289
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,160
Really? But why?

290
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,920
To thank me for being a good friend to Mr. Cha Si-an.

291
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,480
Really?

292
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,120
Director, may I take a photo?

293
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,080
What are you staring for?

294
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,880
What? I was just looking because I like my lion so much.

295
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,080
Because he brought the sandwiches Mr. Cha's mother made?

296
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,360
No.

297
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,400
Because he saw those and immediately thought of me.

298
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,960
Thank you.

299
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,440
Oh no, lipstick!

300
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,400
I like perfect symmetry.

301
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,000
The other side, too, please.

302
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,200
That's enough for today.

303
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,640
(Cha Si-an)

304
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,640
Yes, Mr. Cha Si-an.

305
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,640
Brother, may I ask you a difficult favor?

306
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,480
Yes! Yes! Yes!

307
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,480
I'll hear it first.

308
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,120
I want to take my mom on a musem date,

309
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,120
but people will recognize me if I go during normal hours??

310
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,480
So you want to come after we close?

311
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,760
Yes, just this once.

312
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,640
I'll think abo??

313
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,960
I'll allow it just this once.

314
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,200
Yes! Thank you, Brother.

315
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,240
Thank you!

316
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,600
Today's the day we have to check for edits at the print shop.

317
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,760
We should hurry.

318
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,800
Duk-mi, you're going to be a blessed fan again today.

319
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,160
I've already been blessed.

320
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,160
I think "Rendezvous" suits this exhibit's concept best.

321
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,080
But can you increase the cyan hue?

322
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,480
And make the tone a little brighter too, please.

323
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,480
Alright, we'll do that.

324
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,480
Duk-mi.

325
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,920
Why'd you come all the way here? I planned to visit your office.

326
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,280
Don't worry about it, I had to come here anyway.

327
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,760
Also, it's your birthday. What do you want?

328
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,920
What should I ask you for?

329
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,560
Go on. Anything you want.

330
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,960
But nothing too pricey.

331
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,000
Oh, then gift me that.

332
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,760
The original copy of Director Gold's cover shot.

333
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,160
You really like him, don't you?

334
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,200
Fine. I'll give you the A and B cuts, too.

335
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,320
Really?

336
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,200
Is this the brochure for the special exhibition?

337
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,440
Yes.

338
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,800
Editor Nam, there's something I wanted to ask you.

339
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:25,000
Have you heard of an artist by the name Lee Sol?

340
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,040
Lee Sol?

341
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,840
Well??Her name is unique,

342
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,080
so if I had, I'm sure I'd remember.

343
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,280
Then do you know any works similar to this one?

344
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,400
You see all the new artists' exhibitions, too,

345
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,240
so I thought you might know best.

346
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,920
Oh, I think I have seen something.

347
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,960
- Really? - Yeah.

348
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,120
No, I've definitely seen something like this.

349
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,400
But you know, menopause.

350
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,800
Then please let me know once it comes to you!

351
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
I will.

352
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,000
Try this section.

353
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,360
I remembered!

354
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,120
Was it when I was in my senior year in college?

355
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,120
I don't remember her name,

356
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,760
but there was a freshman whom

357
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,720
even the professors had been eyeing.

358
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,160
I heard she went abroad to study after she graduated,

359
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,120
but heard no news of her debut after that.

360
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,800
There was a rumor that she had a child.

361
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,240
I think her style was similar to this.

362
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,040
But you said the artist's name is Lee Sol?

363
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:46,080
(Gong Eun-young)

364
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,720
Daddy!

365
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,720
Yes?

366
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,480
What is love?

367
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,040
L-Love?

368
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,120
Love seems really difficult.

369
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,040
Gun-woo, have you ever been in love?

370
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,000
Na-young, in Yellow Class.

371
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,120
What about Na-young?

372
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,520
Does she say she loves you, too?

373
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:35,200
Na-young likes an older boy in Blue Class.

374
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,680
He's a tall and handsome.

375
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,040
I'm really sorry about that.

376
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,400
Then Gun-woo, can't you just like someone else?

377
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,360
I'm trying to, but I can't.

378
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,840
Today, I fell over in front of Na-young on purpose.

379
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,960
Like this.

380
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,920
Because when she smiles, I'm happy too.

381
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,480
Daddy, that's love, right?

382
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,600
You're better than I am.

383
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,040
Here, drink.

384
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,280
Oh, this is my Mom.

385
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,600
It's nice to meet you. I'm Ryan Gold.

386
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:43,200
(Gong Eun-young)

387
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,120
They could just have a similar style.

388
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,080
But if Lee Sol really is Cha Si-an's mother??

389
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,120
- Mr. Kim Yoo-sub? - Yes.

390
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,120
Before you go home today,

391
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,520
could you bring the restored Lee Sol painting

392
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,120
from the storage to my office?

393
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,120
Sure.

394
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,480
Director.

395
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,440
Lee Sol's painting??

396
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,000
Are you planning to see it with Mr. Cha and his mother?

397
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,840
Yes.

398
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,160
I'm sure the museum date with his mother is just an excuse.

399
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,680
He's probably really coming to see the painting.

400
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,640
Why, what's the matter?

401
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,680
The thing is??

402
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,040
Nevermind.

403
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,520
Brother! Curator Sung!

404
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,120
I'm sorry. Si-an, again??

405
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,080
It's not because of Mr. Cha Si-an's request,

406
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,840
but because of you, ma'am.

407
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,080
Your sandwiches were very delicious.

408
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,000
Oh? When did you try her sandwiches?

409
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,160
I gave some to him this morning.

410
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,000
She doesn't make them for just anyone, you know.

411
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,600
I heard this piece is by Mr. Jeon Yong-hwan.

412
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:38,000
Tell me about this piece. Please?

413
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,920
This piece is a little difficult for me, too.

414
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,240
- Mom, wait right here. - Okay.

415
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,880
Brother.

416
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,040
- By any chance??- Lee Sol's painting?

417
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,960
May we see it?

418
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,520
It's in my office.

419
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,000
Please excuse me, I have to use the bathroom.

420
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,240
I'll go with her.

421
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,040
Are you alright?

422
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,520
Yes.

423
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,600
I just hadn't seen it in such a long time.

424
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,080
You're Lee Sol, aren't you?

425
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,120
I saw a piece similar to Lee Sol's

426
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,040
in the brochure for a university graduation exhibition.

427
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:44,560
And alongside it was a picture of you, Mrs. Cha.

428
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,840
No.

429
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,360
I'm not Lee Sol anymore.

430
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,360
That's a name I failed to protect.

431
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,920
And artwork??

432
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
which I failed to protect.

433
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,680
I'm not worthy of that name anymore.

434
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,120
I don't want to reveal that it was me.

435
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,520
Is that alright?

436
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,600
Yes.

437
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,360
We'll be able to find all nine pieces, right?

438
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,040
I really hope we do.

439
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,800
The others and I are doing our best to find them.

440
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,000
Oh, and Brother??

441
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,120
My mom may ask you a favor behind my back.

442
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,720
What favor?

443
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,280
You see, my mom's against it.

444
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,240
Exhibiting Lee Sol's works, I mean.

445
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,280
So please convince her for me.

446
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,120
But why is your mom??

447
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,120
The truth is, I wanted to do this for my mom.

448
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,120
I wanted to realize her dream.

449
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,080
Though it's late, I wanted to return that name to her.

450
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,080
The name Lee Sol.

451
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,120
Those paintings are a bit painful for my mom, so??

452
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,160
Son!

453
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,920
Yes!

454
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,720
Mommy.

455
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,760
Son,

456
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,720
let's not bother the Director anymore.

457
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,000
He and Curator Sung also need to go home.

458
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,800
Thank you for today, Director Gold.

459
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,520
Let go!

460
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,560
I'm not your mother.

461
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,600
Oh, this is my mom.

462
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,640
Son!

463
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,920
Did I interrupt you?

464
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,960
Tell me if you want to be alone, I don't mind.

465
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,240
Director.

466
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,760
You've found out, right?

467
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,080
Miss Duk-mi,

468
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,280
how...?

469
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,000
By coincidence.

470
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,080
It feels kind of weird.

471
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,040
These past three years,

472
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,720
I tried all means to find her, but it was all in vain.

473
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,160
And suddenly, here she is in front of me,

474
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,280
and it hasn't even hit me yet.

475
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,200
It feels like one big lie.

476
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,080
I can't collect my thoughts right now.

477
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,120
If you don't want to say anything now,

478
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,640
then you don't have to.

479
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,720
Let me know if you need some time alone.

480
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,880
Would you like that?

481
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,600
Right now, it's??

482
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,040
??0 o'clock in the evening,

483
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,320
so exactly 12 hours until tomorrow morning.

484
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,360
It's going to be very hard, but I'll try and bear it.

485
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,760
See you tomorrow morning, then.

486
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,120
I saw her paint that.

487
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,880
Before I was Ryan.

488
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,080
When I was still Heo Yun-je.

489
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,080
Mommy.

490
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,120
Lee Sol??

491
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,320
is probably someone I know.

492
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,200
Though it's late, I wanted to return that name to her.

493
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,960
The name Lee Sol.

494
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,200
Son!

495
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,080
Probably??

496
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,760
my mother.

497
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,520
Even if you insist you're alright,

498
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,280
you're not alright in here.

499
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,760
Because there's no way you can be.

500
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,160
Were you also in the mood for a drink?

501
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,480
Sun-joo's never here when we need her, is she?

502
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,360
Look who's talking!

503
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,160
You're not here when I need a friend.

504
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,480
Should I take back what I said, temporarily?

505
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,800
Let's hop on the time machine, and Bam! back to the past.

506
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,720
What do you want for your birthday?

507
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,840
Hye, let's give our parents gifts from now on, instead.

508
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,040
I mean, it's thanks to them that I was born this beautiful.

509
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,560
Okay.

510
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,600
- Eun-ki. - Yeah?

511
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,120
Have you never been curious about your father?

512
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,400
Yup, never.

513
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,800
Liar! How can you not be curious?

514
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,080
Even if it makes me a liar,

515
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,240
I'm going to lie until the day I die.

516
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,080
I'm not curious about him, at all.

517
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,200
Why not?

518
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,760
I've lived fine without him,

519
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,040
so if I say I'm curious about him, it sounds like I want to see him.

520
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,400
But isn't it natural to be curious about him and want to see him?

521
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,000
It's natural,

522
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,080
but then how come he's not curious about me

523
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,160
and doesn't want to see me?

524
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,080
Sorry.

525
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,320
And??I don't know.

526
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:47,120
I think I'd be annoyed whether I found out he's living

527
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,240
well or not so well.

528
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,880
I thought about which might be better,

529
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,000
but just erased that question from my head.

530
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,320
How come you've never told me this?

531
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,120
Because I felt guilty.

532
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,440
Guilty about what?

533
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,080
Mom, Dad, you??

534
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,200
You've all been so good to me, like a real family,

535
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,280
so it'd be like betraying you if I talked about my birth father.

536
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,960
Hey! Eun-ki Bastard.

537
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,080
Do you think Mom and Dad wouldn't understand?

538
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,040
Exactly.

539
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,480
This is exactly why I'm still Eun-ki Bastard to you,

540
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,080
and not a man.

541
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,600
Uh, so??

542
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,360
So that time machine or whatever is now over?

543
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,800
Yeah.

544
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,920
I'll get going, then.

545
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,200
Sure, bye.

546
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,760
Eun-ki Bastard!

547
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,760
My lifetime friend Nam Eun-ki,

548
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,760
it was nice seeing you tonight.

549
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,640
You know Lee Sol?

550
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,720
...and found out that you happen to have Lee's works, too.

551
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,720
So it's a coincidence.

552
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:30,520
You'll keep it a secret, right?

553
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,400
Brother! I ordered it.

554
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,960
Just the payment??

555
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,400
But anyway, this is destiny.

556
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,000
No, fate!

557
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,480
Oh, Brother!

558
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,960
It's late. I'll see you another time.

559
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,840
Oh, but there's something I forgot to mention.

560
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,120
He said he wanted some time alone??

561
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,040
(Mom)

562
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:33,160
- Hello? - Duk-mi, are you home? Alone?

563
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,200
Yeah.

564
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,800
What??Why's an adult like you alone at night?

565
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,560
Why aren't you with the Director and??

566
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,080
Actually, no need for me to tell you every little thing.

567
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,200
Anyway, Eun-ki says he has something

568
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,760
- on your birthday. - He does?

569
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,160
So you spend it with Director Gold, alright?

570
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,280
Give your mom a chance to rest.

571
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,640
Okay, it? about time after 33 years of birthday dinners.

572
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,640
I'll take you all out to a buffet this time.

573
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:03,080
Before that, when is Director Gold's birthday?

574
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,080
Why do you ask?

575
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,600
I should cook for his birthday at least, if not yours.

576
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,280
And when you do ask him when his birthday is,

577
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,760
also ask him what time he was born, and??

578
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,880
I'm hanging up.

579
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,360
Damnit.

580
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,160
I was going to get a reading about their future as a couple.

581
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,640
Come on, no need for that!

582
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,120
It's obvious they're meant to be.

583
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,600
Just like you and me.

584
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,840
Don't even joke about that kind of thing.

585
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:35,120
Director Gold may not know his birthday.

586
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,040
Why not?

587
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,960
He was adopted.

588
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,160
I heard he was adopted in America when he was very young.

589
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,360
Adopted?

590
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,120
Thank goodness he grew up so fine.

591
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,760
Thank goodness, indeed.

592
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:05,720
I'm??I'm sure he grew up under good parents.

593
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,880
Right?

594
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,360
There are many good people out there in the world.

595
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,160
Who is this?

596
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,880
Director Nam.

597
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,040
At which gallery?

598
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,840
Director Nam at Choikang Judo Center.

599
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,040
Oh!

600
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,520
Mr. Pathetic!

601
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,520
Ha! Who was the person who could barely stand up

602
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,040
and threw up like a pathetic drunk?

603
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,080
Director Nam, what are calling about?

604
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,320
- What are you up to? - Work.

605
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:49,000
You're still working with him after giving him up? Wow.

606
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,480
Giving him up doesn't mean I won't ever see him again.

607
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,640
Besides, friendships can last longer than love.

608
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,120
Don't be so heartbroken for too long.

609
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,280
They say couples go to hell and singles go to heaven.

610
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:10,320
You sound like you're enjoying my misery.

611
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:14,480
Rather than enjoying it??I just feel less lonely.

612
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,920
Now that I have a comrade.

613
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,000
Tell me when you're craving a drink.

614
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,560
I'll repay my debt.

615
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:23,000
Ha??I really could do for a drink right now,

616
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,600
but I'm not going to drink.

617
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:28,160
I don't want to interrupt you and your work,

618
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,040
and I want to do some thinking with a clear head, too.

619
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,000
Alright, well stay strong.

620
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,080
I will.

621
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,280
A friend, huh?

622
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,440
(Curator Sung)

623
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,440
Knock, knock.

624
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,640
Isn't this too late for a morning call?

625
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,560
Could you open the door?

626
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,560
What?

627
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,280
Miss Duk-mi.

628
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,240
12 hours was just too long.

629
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,880
So I surrender first.

630
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,000
Thank goodness.

631
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,080
I almost surrendered first.

632
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,880
Then I should've hung in there a little more.

633
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,920
No, that was enough.

634
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,640
Did you have breakfast yet?

635
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,320
Even if you did, tell me you didn't.

636
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,560
What?

637
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,880
Do you know how energy-consuming it is to

638
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:04,120
hold yourself back, waiting for someone?

639
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,640
Miss Duk-mi, you surrendered not because you missed me,

640
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,040
but because you were hungry, didn't you?

641
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,240
Forget it, I'm full. I'm not eating.

642
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,760
Go on and eat.

643
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,200
Did I ever tell you?

644
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,480
You're very pretty when you eat.

645
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,480
Hmpf.

646
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,480
You're not going to ask?

647
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,720
About me and her?

648
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,080
You told me so last time,

649
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:46,120
not to rush to conclusions about what to do with Eun-ki.

650
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:54,240
Same with you, no need to rush to conclusions.

651
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,960
Just don't forget that you have someone

652
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,000
right next to you, who's always on your side.

653
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,160
Alright?

654
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,040
Coffee! Espresso!

655
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,440
- Rinse your mouth with this. - Hey!

656
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,960
(Cheum Museum of Art)

657
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,000
Curator Sung.

658
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,240
These are the estimates for our museum merchandise.

659
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,640
Considering that our target customers are

660
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,800
women in their mid 20s to their late 40s,

661
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,040
and taking into account the cost of production,

662
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,960
about $25 per piece would be a reasonable??

663
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:55,120
I'm the heiress to TK C&T.

664
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,680
Studying business management was a given.

665
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:00,760
Good job.

666
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,360
Hyo-jin, can you also do the estimates for

667
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:06,280
our brochures and our postcards next?

668
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,280
Sure.

669
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,400
- Hello? - Hello, Curator Sung.

670
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,520
Mr. Cha??

671
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,800
What is it?

672
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,920
May I see you for a second?

673
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,640
Just the two of us.

674
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,000
Just the two of us?

675
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,400
Hello, Curator Sung.

676
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,720
I'm sorry to call you out when you're busy.

677
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,160
Oh, no.

678
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,240
I can always make time for a meeting with you.

679
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,360
Actually, Director Ryan??

680
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,720
Our Director?

681
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,840
I think he's a bit upset because of the exhibit.

682
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,440
I didn't mean to deceive him,

683
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,760
but in the end, it feels like I have.

684
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,640
I'm sure he's not.

685
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,240
Director Gold is not someone to be upset over something like that.

686
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,640
Right?

687
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:58,680
Of course not.

688
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,560
You see, I really wanted to

689
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,640
do this exhibit for my mother.

690
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:10,440
My mother injured her hand in an accident before I was born

691
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,360
so she can no longer pick up a brush.

692
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,760
An accident?

693
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,000
Are you alright?

694
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,200
The only series she painted under the name Lee Sol

695
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,000
are those paintings of soap bubbles.

696
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,280
But Grandpa threw them all out on purpose,

697
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,000
telling her to just forget everything.

698
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,080
My mom cried so much at that time.

699
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,360
Now this series is all that's left for her to remember the past,

700
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,760
but she keeps saying no??

701
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,360
My mom's always been my fan,

702
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,360
so this time, as her fan,

703
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,160
I want to make her dream a reality.

704
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:59,560
You will help me won't you, Curator Sung?

705
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,520
Yes.

706
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,200
I'm so happy to hear that.

707
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,600
Then I'll be counting on you.

708
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,480
What do you think?

709
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,440
I like the concept.

710
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,920
It's easy and direct, just as I advised.

711
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,040
So you overcame your slump?

712
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,480
Geniuses never fall into a slump.

713
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,440
You know that I'm Choi Da-in, who's the top in media art, right?

714
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,960
Yeah, yeah.

715
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,360
Well, talk to you later.

716
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,080
Mommy! Look at this!

717
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,840
(List of Works for the Exhibition)

718
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,840
Hello?

719
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:21,600
Ah!

720
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,200
Yes, hello.

721
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,080
Why did she paint nine pieces of just soap bubbles?

722
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,080
Pirate ship.

723
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,480
Amusement park.

724
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,080
Soap bubbles.

725
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,160
Children.

726
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,800
All the things that Yun-je loved

727
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,600
were always in her heart.

728
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,880
What is it? Did something happen?

729
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:59,240
Your mother called me just now.

730
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,000
About your birthday coming up.

731
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,440
Argh, that mother of mine??

732
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,000
According to your mother,

733
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,520
you've announced that you're going to have dinner

734
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,880
just you and your boyfriend that day.

735
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,080
But I'm yet to hear anything.

736
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,440
You must have another boyfriend, huh?

737
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,520
I??I was being considerate.

738
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,000
I didn't want to burden you.

739
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,680
I had my own plans for you, you know.

740
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,120
Yet you were going to just let your birthday pass

741
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,880
without telling me anything.

742
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,360
And then yesterday, you abandoned me for 10 hours!

743
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,480
You said you wanted to be alone yesterday!

744
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,080
I even went to your place an hour early

745
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,320
just to say hello.

746
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,720
Still??How can you not text or call me even once?

747
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,360
Gosh, please.

748
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:40,000
Fine. From now on, even if you say you want to be alone,

749
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,600
I won't leave you alone.

750
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,960
In fact, I'll even follow you to the bathroom.

751
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,760
- Really? - Don't regret it.

752
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,120
I think I might like that.

753
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,760
That's right, your mother asked me for my T.O.B.

754
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,760
What is that?

755
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,040
Oh, T.O.B??That's "time of birth".

756
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,520
But why would she ask me for that?

757
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,240
My mom's really into fortune-telling.

758
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,720
She was probably trying to see if we're compat??

759
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,400
It's nothing.

760
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,000
Let's just say she's into Eastern philosophy.

761
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,080
I know what "compatibility" means.

762
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,120
My mom always gets ahead of herself.

763
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,080
But what do we do?

764
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,120
I don't know what time I was born.

765
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,680
Director.

766
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,200
When is??

767
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,120
your current birthday?

768
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,840
In September.

769
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,240
The day I was adopted.

770
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,080
Aren't you curious about when you were really born?

771
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:02,080
Shall we find out when your real birthday is?

772
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,840
That's a name I failed to protect.

773
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,800
And artwork??

774
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,040
which I failed to protect.

775
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,800
I'm not telling you to forgive her.

776
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,640
You may find her harder to understand and

777
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,360
get upset and come to blame her, when you do see her.

778
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:31,120
Still, go see her and??

779
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,040
If you come to hate her,

780
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,280
I'm always on your side

781
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,200
so I can even help you with your revenge. Like this!

782
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,800
That's it? That's almost nothing.

783
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,160
Too weak? Then??

784
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,160
Like this!

785
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,400
I'll let you know after I do see her.

786
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,960
I thought about it all last night,

787
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,400
about why I teared up

788
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,120
when I first saw that painting.

789
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Mommy, look at this!

790
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,280
Mommy, did you see that?

791
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:54,760
Happiness,

792
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,000
and a sense of yearning.

793
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,760
That's what I felt from the painting.

794
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,520
I know.

795
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,840
It could have been a momentary thing,

796
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:14,800
and that doesn't change the fact I was abandoned.

797
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:19,000
Still, I want to move on now.

798
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,040
I even have someone to hold my hand.

799
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,040
Though it won't be easy.

800
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,440
I'm sure it'll all be alright.

801
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,560
Director.

802
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,880
Director, are you here to see Si-an?

803
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,720
He's not home yet.

804
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,000
I have something to show you.

805
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:49,400
To show you, Mrs. Cha.

806
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:44,840
Bubbles that represent blossoming hope, despite their fragility.

807
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:06,120
Bubbles that symbolize a child's toy.

808
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:10,160
And an affectionate gaze toward these bubbles.

809
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,840
I heard from Si-an

810
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:32,080
that you're also a fan of Lee Sol's works.

811
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:34,520
And that you were the one who suggested this exhibit.

812
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:40,000
Director, I have a favor to??

813
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:52,000
By any chance??

814
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,240
Do you remember?

815
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,480
The name Yun-je.

816
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,040
I'm Yun-je.

817
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,080
Heo Yun-je.

818
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:13,040
And an affectionate gaze toward these bubbles.

819
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:20,000
These paintings contain a mother's affection.

820
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,240
(Her Private Life)

821
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,680
Are you alright? Where are you now?

822
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:16,680
Director?

823
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,320
I'm sorry I made things awkward for us.

824
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:21,000
I'm really sorry.

825
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,840
So I was right in the end, Brother.

826
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,600
If it's hard for you to look from Heo Yun-je's perspective,

827
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,640
tell yourself that you're here as Director Gold.

828
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:31,000
