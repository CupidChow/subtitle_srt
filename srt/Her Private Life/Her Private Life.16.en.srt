(Final Episode)

4
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,520
Mom!

5
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,040
Duk-mi's scribbling again!

6
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not scribbling! I'm drawing!

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,040
Well, it looks like scribbling to me,

8
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,000
so I'm calling it scribbling!

9
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,040
Hey!

10
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,360
Mom!

11
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,840
Duk-mi,

12
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,520
I told you not to hit Eun-ki!

13
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,480
I said you'd be in trouble if you scribbled again, didn't I?

14
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,240
This isn't scribbling!

15
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,800
Sung Duk-mi, just what are you??

16
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,680
What are you going to be when you grow up?

17
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,280
An painter who draws art!

18
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,120
I'm going to fill a big gallery with my art.

19
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,200
Hey, stop it!

20
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,440
Stop, stop!

21
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,320
- Hey! - Stop it!

22
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,160
Don't!

23
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,880
Did you have a good dream?

24
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I did. A dream that was good because it's a memory.

25
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,760
But it was a little sad at the same time, too.

26
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,840
I was playing with Yun-je, Eun-ki and Duk-su.

27
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,360
What have you been doing since you woke up?

28
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,200
I've been drawing.

29
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,000
Drawing your sleeping face.

30
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,400
Did you make me look pretty?

31
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,520
Your beauty is rather surreal,

32
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,680
so it's quite hard to convey it on paper.

33
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,360
In my dream,

34
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,760
I was drawing with Yun-je.

35
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,440
We were drawing with chalk, absolutely everywhere.

36
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,440
But then Eun-ki said he was going to tell on us for scribbling.

37
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,800
So I told him,

38
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,880
"I'm going to become a painter someday,

39
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,120
and my art is going to be hung in art galleries."

40
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,440
Though I didn't end up being a painter,

41
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,840
I did become someone who hangs paintings.

42
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,480
"When we visit an exhibition today,

43
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,320
we are not directly observing works of art.

44
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,160
What we are observing is the curator's notion of what art is.

45
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,040
In short??

46
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,880
The ultimate artist is not the producer

47
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,640
but the curator, his activity of selection."

48
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,080
Slavoj Zizek?

49
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,160
I wholly agree with him.

50
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,160
Curators are artists, too.

51
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,040
You even made me draw again,

52
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,480
Curator Sung Duk-mi.

53
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,840
The exhibition hall is my canvas.

54
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,360
But you know??

55
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,880
Right now, I feel like

56
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,400
your face is my canvas.

57
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,160
My I draw some pictures?

58
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,760
What will you draw with?

59
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,440
I'm really motivated to get creative right now.

60
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,080
How should I draw?

61
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,200
Shall I try?

62
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,560
Alright, shall we start painting our canvas, then?

63
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,840
What? Canvas?

64
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,080
Let's first head over to Mr. Noh Seok's collection.

65
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,920
Sure.

66
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,160
- Alright. - Alright.

67
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,000
- Did you check everything? - Yes.

68
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,640
Okay! Make sure they're tuned into

69
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,080
channel two at all times.

70
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,040
Okay, and as for the microphone??

71
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,480
Always check the volume.

72
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,840
Ah, ah. Yes, it's working.

73
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,200
C E G!

74
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,840
Welcome to Cheum's 5th Anniversary Exhibition!

75
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,920
About this much?

76
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,800
Just a little more to the right.

77
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,640
Is this okay?

78
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,920
It's crooked! Lower the right side a little more.

79
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,160
Miss Hyo-jin, please hurry!

80
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,080
Yes, yes. I'm done.

81
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,160
Done, done, done!

82
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,400
- Great. - Nice!

83
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,560
That looks great.

84
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,560
I know.

85
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,440
Nine??

86
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,040
- Let's check the projector. - Sure.

87
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,040
- Has the brightness been set? - Yes.

88
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,120
So it should look brighter once the lights are dimmed?

89
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,200
Yes.

90
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,440
Cheum's 5th Anniversary Special Exhibition,

91
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,120
THE ROOM THE LIFE.

92
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,840
Today's finally our opening day!

93
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,480
Hyo-jin, this is your first exhibition. How are you feeling?

94
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,040
I've got butterflies.

95
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,800
It's as if I'm meeting someone I've only imagined.

96
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,960
It was such hard work,

97
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,120
but still??I'm excited.

98
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,000
Are you sure it's not because you'll be seeing Mr. Cha Si-an?

99
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Ah, you got me.

100
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,440
So, Director Gold.

101
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,640
How did you come up with the title?

102
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,120
I was inspired by someone's room.

103
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,160
Why, what was their room like?

104
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,520
It was inspiring and fun.

105
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,160
And filled with much happiness.

106
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,560
"Fill your room with things you love

107
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,360
so that your life can become much happier."

108
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,000
We're finally the first ones here!

109
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,120
Finally the first ones!

110
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,240
I can't wait for them to open up.

111
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,440
What kind of art will there be? Photos?

112
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,200
Mr. Cha Si-an, could you face the front, please?

113
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,120
- Thank you. - Look this way for us, too.

114
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,280
This way, too.

115
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,200
- How do you feel? - Wave to us, please!

116
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,760
I'm feeling very good.

117
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,000
Mr. Cha Si-an, smile for us.

118
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,400
- This way. - That's great!

119
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,080
- That's great. - This way. Over here!

120
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,920
That's great.

121
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,760
Oh my God!

122
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,880
Hyo-jin?

123
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,160
That person over there??

124
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,240
Is he a sculpture on display?

125
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,040
Si-an does look like a sculpture, doesn't he?

126
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,480
He's so handsome!

127
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,080
Secretary Kim? Give it, give it, give it!

128
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,840
Oh my God!

129
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,080
Hyo-jin?

130
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,760
Isn't that what you designed?

131
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,800
Mom.

132
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,640
Yeah, what is it?

133
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,920
I could just die right now.

134
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,840
No, no, no! You can't die just yet, Hyo-jin!

135
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,440
Don't say such a terrible thing.

136
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,480
Oh my God! Hyo-jin, I'm so proud of you.

137
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,040
As incredible as we say art is,

138
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,040
could it be more so than living people?

139
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,000
No matter how pathetic I may be,

140
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,280
I'm far more superb than those haughty paintings

141
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,640
hanging up on that wall.

142
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,080
Because I'm still here, alive and living.

143
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,840
(Roh Seok)

144
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,520
These eyes??They're not speaking of sadness

145
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,080
before a farewell, or of enlightenment before death.

146
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,760
He's staring at the person he loves.

147
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,800
That's what he wanted to leave behind:

148
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,680
this gaze directed towards that person.

149
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,440
It's his greeting to that person.

150
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,480
"Hello, I'm still here."

151
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,160
"I'm always here, looking at you."

152
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,440
Hello.

153
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,840
(Hello)

154
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,320
Soap bubbles, rocking horse, ferris wheel, pirate ship??

155
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,600
They're all things that a child might like.

156
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,600
I think I know what feeling she put into these paintings.

157
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,000
We're smiling.

158
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,600
Both of us.

159
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,440
Very happily.

160
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,720
(Fill your room with things you love)

161
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,200
(so that your life will become much happier)

(THE ROOM, THE LIFE)

163
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,800
Congratulations, Mom.

164
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,400
It's your first exhibition.

165
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,560
Thank you, Si-an.

166
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,360
And thank you to you too, Yun-je.

167
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,840
Thank you, Ms. Lee Sol,

168
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,000
for letting us exhibit your valuable works.

169
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,240
Thank you, Curator Sung Duk-mi.

170
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,560
Congratulations.

171
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,880
Um??May I take a picture for you?

172
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,920
- Let's take one. - Yes.

173
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,000
Duk-mi just happens to be a great photographer.

174
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,960
Would you like to order?

175
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,880
- I'll have an IA. - One IA,

176
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,640
and one condensed milk latte without the espresso shot.

177
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,200
You drink it without the espresso?

178
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,160
I can't drink coffee.

179
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,440
Since I take after a certain someone.

180
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,800
Then I'll have the same.

181
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,880
One condensed milk latte without the espresso shot.

182
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,120
What would you like, Mr. Cha Si-an?

183
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,040
Then I'll have the same thing as Curator Sung.

184
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,840
An iced americano.

185
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,640
Then that's two condensed milk lattes without the espresso,

186
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,360
one iced americano,

187
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,800
and one iced americano that's extra delicious.

188
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,000
Have you always been unable to drink coffee?

189
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Ms. Lee, didn't you change your bias to me?

190
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
- Ju Hyuk. - Yes.

191
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,120
There may be an entrance to a fandom, but there's no exit.

192
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,640
A bias is a bias,

193
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,280
and Si-an's Si-an.

194
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,120
I guess you're not so interested.

195
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,520
Ms. Lee.

196
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,520
Yes, Mr. Cha Si-an.

197
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,080
What's this music that's playing now?

198
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,840
It's my first time hearing it.

199
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,400
The music's great, huh?

200
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,080
There's this band, FADE??

201
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:25,000
Oh, he's the vocalist and guitarist.

202
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,960
Ju Hyuk.

203
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,520
They're going to release an album soon, too.

204
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,560
I see. FADE??

205
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,560
It's great. I'll be looking forward to your album.

206
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,480
Once it's out, I'll gift one to you.

207
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,120
Directly, in person.

208
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,440
Yes, well then??

209
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,080
Ju Hyuk, please pinch me.

210
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,040
Let's go in first.

211
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,080
Let's go.

212
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,840
Hello, I'm Yun-je's mother.

213
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,200
When I heard you were coming,

214
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,040
I stayed up all night, thinking about what I should say.

215
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,520
But I still have nothing to say,

216
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,480
other than that I'm sorry.

217
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,160
Yun-je told me the whole story.

218
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,240
Thank you for looking after him with such loving care,

219
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,000
even if it was brief.

220
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,160
(Sung Duk-su)

221
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,520
So you were here, Duk-su.

222
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,160
When you were little, I once brought you here

223
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,040
with Eun-ki and Duk-su.

224
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,840
At that time, Duk-su saw one of the monks

225
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,840
and almost choked on his laughter.

226
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,480
He kept saying, "Baldie! Baldie!"

227
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,640
I was so embarrassed and so sorry.

228
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,000
That's why I brought him here.

229
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,720
So he could laugh all he wants.

230
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,720
I'll make you laugh, Mom.

231
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,160
I have something for you.

232
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,720
The pictures alone show how well you looked after him.

233
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,560
Yun-je looks like he's at ease.

234
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:56,040
Thankfully, he got along well with Duk-mi and Eun-ki.

235
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,760
He ate well, too.

236
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,680
(Heo Yun-je, 7 years old Mom, I miss you)

237
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,120
After sending Duk-su off,

238
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,040
I wasn't in my right mind.

239
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,160
When I finally came around??

240
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,560
He'd already been adopted.

241
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,920
So you went back??

242
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,640
To the orphanage where Yun-je was.

243
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,080
I should've gone a little sooner??

244
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,000
There aren't just one or two things I'm regretting.

245
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,120
I don't know how I can face you or Yun-je.

246
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,360
It's me who should be saying that.

247
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,320
But it was an accident. You didn't abandon him.

248
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:03,120
I have another son named Si-an.

249
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,280
The person who helped me search

250
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,120
after I lost Yun-je

251
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,040
is Si-an's dad.

252
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,480
"After losing your child,

253
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,440
how could you start a family like nothing happened

254
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,600
and live on?"

255
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,680
Yun-je could've despised me and chosen not to understand me,

256
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,760
but this is what he said:

257
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,760
He read that a wife who's lost her husband is a widow,

258
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,040
a husband who's lost his wife is a widower,

259
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,120
and a child who's lost his parents is an orphan.

260
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,440
But for parents who've lost their child??

261
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:52,080
the grief is so great that there's no name we can assign them.

262
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,040
He told me no one has the right to point fingers at me

263
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,720
for making the decisions I did so that I could live on

264
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,160
and pull through those times.

265
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,840
So he told me not to be sorry.

266
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,760
So while it may be shameless of me??

267
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,200
I want to take that as Yun-je having forgiven me.

268
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,440
So Mrs. Sung, you too??

269
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,520
Don't let yourself feel troubled by your regret.

270
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,560
What do you think they're talking about?

271
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,040
I think she's asking about what time you were born.

272
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,200
What's that in your hand, Dad?

273
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,040
Huh? Oh, this?

274
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,720
That's pretty. Did you pick it up here?

275
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,080
Yeah.

276
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,720
The day we brought Duk-su here.

277
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,240
The day you brought Duk-su here?

278
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,680
Your mother was crying inside,

279
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,520
and I'd stepped out first.

280
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,720
Then I found this stone on the ground.

281
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,040
So I picked it up, almost in a trance, and??

282
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,480
It was warm.

283
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,080
Just like Duk-su's hands.

284
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,200
So I held onto it tight like I was holding Duk-su's hand,

285
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,120
and brought it home.

286
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,360
So that's why??

287
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,320
And ever since then, I've been all over the country

288
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,240
looking for rocks like a madman.

289
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,120
To help Duk-su make some friends?

290
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,000
Friends?

291
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,400
Is that what they'd be?

292
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,840
Can I  hold his hand, too?

293
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,120
Of course! Here.

294
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,560
It really is warm.

295
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,960
Duk-su's hand, I mean.

296
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,280
Mom.

297
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,360
Once my CD matures, should we live together?

298
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,960
What's got into you all of a sudden?

299
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,160
I've been asking you to all this time,

300
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,760
but you said you'd rather die.

301
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,600
Let's live together, until I get married.

302
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,160
Until you get married?

303
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,120
I think I'll get married before you do.

304
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,080
Are you seeing someone?

305
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,920
I've been praying for a partner at church.

306
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,120
Praying?

307
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,120
I don't need anything else.

308
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,960
I just want him to be kind and gentle with words,

309
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,560
know how to appreciate the little things,

310
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,000
look like the average-Joe version of Jung Woo-sung,

311
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,200
and have a small building to his name.

312
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,480
Man??

313
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,200
I thought you were avoiding marriage for my sake,

314
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,160
but your high standards were what was stopping you!

315
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,040
If I'm going to marry someone, he should fit my standards.

316
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,680
Fine.

317
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,080
Then I'll live with you and my new stepdad,

318
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,720
who has a small building to his name.

319
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,200
You get married first, alright?

320
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,560
Okay, okay.

321
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,440
Wait, you??

322
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,520
You don't have a girl?

323
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,160
What are you even saying? What does that mean?

324
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,120
Come on, do you have a girl? Do you?

325
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,520
Ah, mother and son. What a beautiful sight.

326
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,160
Ooh, I want to read this.

327
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,880
"The Brothers Lionheart"

328
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,080
Lionheart?

329
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,160
Then I want??

330
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,040
- This one? - This one?

331
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,520
- This person? - You want to read this one?

332
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,960
- This person. - You want her?

333
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,040
(Book Street)

334
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,160
Railroad.

335
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,040
The Road to Si-an.

336
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,160
Now it's The Road to Ryan.

337
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,000
No, The Road to Heo Yun-je.

338
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,040
T.R.T.H.?

339
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,120
How about T.R.T.J.?

340
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,040
R.J.?

341
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,560
This is the art school I attended in high school, for college prep.

342
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,040
They have art schools for that?

343
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,520
Of course.

344
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,000
I bet I can draw David better than you can.

345
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,040
Oh, you're going to draw me?

346
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,120
What do you mean?

347
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,200
I apologize.

348
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,680
Why are you buying so much red?

349
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,080
Because I'm going to paint you.

350
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,000
And red suits you best.

351
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,200
But??

352
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,280
Are you going to keep painting at home?

353
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,880
I thought of getting a studio, but

354
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,480
I'm only going to paint from time to time, so it's not worth it.

355
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,840
From time to time?

356
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,800
Oh, it smells up the house, doesn't it?

357
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,760
Blue looks good on me, too.

358
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,840
- Blue? - And yellow.

359
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,280
Sure it does.

360
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,880
What does that mean?

361
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,680
For your information, I look good in any color!

362
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,120
Wait, didn't you say you had something important at 5?

363
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,120
Do you want to join me?

364
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,200
Duk-mi,

365
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,160
why are we here?

366
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,760
To buy tickets for Si-an's concert.

367
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:33,160
But Si-an said he'd give us invitations.

368
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,160
I'm T.R.T.S.

369
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,240
Seats for invitees are all on the second floor.

370
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,040
I'm aiming for the 5 front rows on the first floor.

371
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,440
Watch carefully.

372
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,840
Hold on.

373
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,080
Let me fill my stomach first.

374
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,080
I'm good.

375
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,280
Alright, look.

376
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,080
Can you see how this reads "Coming Soon"?

377
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,040
When the clock strikes five, this will change to "Purchase".

378
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,160
When that happens, select a date,

379
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,040
select which concert, and then click "Purchase".

380
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,480
After that, go for any seat in the front row!

381
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,160
It just has to be in the first five rows.

382
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,680
Then click "Reserve This Seat".

383
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,240
That's easy enough.

384
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,720
Of course it is.

385
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,840
Just wait until you meet my worst enemy, T.S.H.B.T.

386
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,720
T.S.H.B.T.?

387
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,800
I know a T.R.T.S.??

388
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,080
Ah, 3 minutes to go.

389
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:35,040
The time now is 5 p.m.

390
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,840
(This seat has been taken)

391
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,800
Ugh, T.S.H.B.T.!

392
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,160
Duk-mi.

393
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,120
What is it?

394
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,160
Did this work?

395
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,800
Did what work?

396
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,000
(Reservation Information, 1st floor, standing ticket)

397
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,800
It worked, right?

398
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,160
What did I tell you? Whatever I do, I??

399
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,120
My boyfriend had the hands of a God!

400
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,400
Well done, what a good boy!

401
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,560
Yun-je! Heo Yun??

402
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:40,680
Since Ryan Gold the artist is from New York??

403
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,800
Let's start with NY art trends.

404
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,200
Duk-mi.

405
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,520
You should go to bed.

406
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,920
We received a lot of feedback saying the hall's too dark,

407
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,240
making it difficult to enjoy the art.

408
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,280
So we were thinking of adding spotlights here and here.

409
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,040
What are your thoughts?

410
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,240
If we make it any brighter than this,

411
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,640
wouldn't the bubbles "disappear" too fast?

412
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,000
Then I'll try adjusting the light angles and

413
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,360
get back to you.

414
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,640
Alright.

415
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,880
If you need anything redone, tell me as soon as possible,

416
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,320
before I leave Korea.

417
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,160
Are you going somewhere?

418
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,480
Oh, I'm going back to New York.

419
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,760
I had a purpose in coming here??

420
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,880
- To get over my slump. - Oh!

421
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:27,160
I like my studio and it's nice having a new friend,

422
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,160
but since I'm originally based in New York and everything's there,

423
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,400
living here comes with some inconveniences.

424
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,320
I can only imagine, yes.

425
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,600
I'll see you in New York, with Ryan.

426
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,720
Sure.

427
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,560
Why did I hear my name being mentioned in my absence?

428
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,960
Ms. Choi says she's going back to New York.

429
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,400
That's great news.

430
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,120
You always say the sweetest things.

431
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,800
You made a wise decision.

432
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,680
Career-wise, it's better for you to be in New York.

433
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,280
Have a safe flight, and keep in touch.

434
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,560
What gives? You never shake hands.

435
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,480
Thank you. And I'm sorry, too.

436
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,760
To both of you.

437
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,160
What's this?

438
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,160
Ryan, did you start painting again?

439
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,800
Everyone in New York has been asking about you.

440
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,000
"When will the genius Ryan make his comeback?"

441
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,040
Not yet.

442
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,920
I don't have any intention of returning yet.

443
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,040
- Why not? - Because I don't want to.

444
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,120
Just don't go telling people, alright?

445
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,000
I'll look forward to it.

446
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,960
The return of Ryan Gold the artist.

447
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,080
What is that?

448
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,120
Nice and refreshing mint chocolate!

449
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,560
I was just in the mood for it.

450
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,400
Thank you.

451
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,120
Tired, huh?

452
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,560
Director.

453
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,760
You've got no desire to make a comeback?

454
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,160
I already made my comeback.

455
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,120
Aren't you an artist as long as you paint?

456
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,280
Uh??

457
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,080
That's true, but??

458
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:47,760
New York is where Ryan the artist was born, raised,

459
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,440
and first got acknowledged.

460
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,800
And I thought New York might be better for

461
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,440
you to do your creative work.

462
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,120
Do you really want to send me back to New York?

463
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,920
That's not what I meant.

464
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,120
I'm just worried I might be holding you back.

465
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,760
I won't deny it.

466
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,640
But you're not the only reason.

467
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,760
The bigger reason is that after a three-year hiatus,

468
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,520
I'm not at that level where I should be.

469
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,000
We're talking about coming out from retirement, here.

470
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,360
If I can't convince the public with my art??

471
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,080
I'm scared of negative comments.

472
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,160
You can do it.

473
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,080
I can do it!

474
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,320
So we'll get to have a drink together.

475
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,320
Before I go back to New York, that is.

476
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,120
New York?

477
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,960
You're going for good?

478
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,440
I came to say goodbye.

479
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,800
Though it was brief, thanks for being my friend.

480
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,440
Come on, at least act sorry to see me go.

481
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,880
Act sorry?

482
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,920
We have phones.

483
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,560
Call me if you ever need a friend.

484
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,120
Or??

485
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,000
How about you open a judo center in New York?

486
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,080
Wouldn't it be faster for you to open an art academy in Korea?

487
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,240
This is actually a secret, but??

488
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:34,080
I suck at drawing.

489
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,160
But you're an artist.

490
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,520
Then I guess art lessons are a no-go.

491
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,960
If you ever have children,

492
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,080
I'll be that fabulous auntie from the U.S. to them.

493
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,240
Fabulous auntie from the States?

494
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,000
That sounds nice.

495
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,120
Well, goodbye my artist friend.

496
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,840
Be well, friend.

497
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,000
Didn't you have to work today?

498
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,760
I don't want to interrupt you.

499
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,000
Tonight I won't paint even a dab. I'm going to be with you.

500
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,200
Wait here.

501
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,760
Let's have dinner after I change.

502
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,720
It's become warmer

503
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,600
and more complete,

504
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,400
Mr. Ryan Gold.

505
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,760
Duk-mi, where are you?

506
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,480
Oh, I'm here!

507
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,320
What do you want to eat?

508
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,320
Pasta made from scratch by Yun-je?

509
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,840
That was nice Ju Hyuk, but let's run through it once more.

510
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,800
Yes, sir!

511
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,440
- Dong-ryul. - Oh, Seung-min!

512
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,320
- Work's busy? - Yes.

513
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,720
- Hello. - Hello, Sun-joo.

514
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,360
She's now Ju Hyuk's manager.

515
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,040
I manage his fan club.

516
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,000
Oh, I see.

517
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,320
We'll be in your care.

518
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,760
Oh, thank you very much.

519
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,360
Honey, we have to go. Let's go, let's go.

520
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,120
- We'll get going then. - Sure, bye.

521
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,040
Please take good care of Ju Hyuk.

522
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,120
Please take good care of him.

523
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,200
- I will. - What are you doing?

524
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,680
I mean it, please do take good care of him.

525
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,400
(Choikang Judo Belt Promotion Exam)

526
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,040
Okay, starting now is

527
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,400
Choikang Judo Center's belt promotion exam.

528
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,520
Attention!

529
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,880
At ease!

530
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,480
Attention!

531
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,600
Bow!

532
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,680
Gun-woo said he doesn't feel so good today.

533
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,520
No, Gun-woo will be fine.

534
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,240
Alright, let's start with the backward breakfall.

535
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,680
Backward breakfall! One, two, three!

536
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,400
Great.

537
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,800
Film him! Film him!

538
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,400
Great! Next is forward breakfall.

539
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,360
Alright. One, two, three!

540
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,320
Good! All rise.

541
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:32,520
Next is the side breakfall. One, two, three!

542
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,040
So cute!

543
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,080
Oppa, he's too cute isn't he?

544
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,160
What are you doing? You should be filming Gun-woo.

545
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,320
I'm only filming what I find cute.

546
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,160
Give me a break. Film Gun-woo. Quick! Hurry up!

547
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,720
Next, Kang Gun-woo?

548
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,880
What's your coach's name?

549
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,480
Nam! Eun! Ki!

550
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,640
Sir, yes sir!

551
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,000
That's right.

552
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,800
Here, your yellow belt.

553
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,360
Back to your spot. Go back!

554
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,120
Alright, next.

555
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,040
- That's right, Yoo-sub. - Yes, Curator Sung.

556
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,120
Mr. Ahn's insurance contract for his exhibition at

557
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,520
Mono Art Gallery has been signed, right?

558
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,640
Yes, now we just need to fix the delivery date.

559
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,640
Hello, this is Sung Duk-mi from Cheum Art Gallery.

560
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,320
I'm making arrangements to send you Mr. Ahn's drawings.

561
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,280
Yes.

562
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,960
Oh my God, are you sure?

563
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,120
Thank you.

564
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:02,120
Does that mean Curator Sung's going to the States?

565
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,240
Duk-mi's going to America?

566
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,560
Oh, nothing's confirmed yet.

567
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,880
Mono Art Gallery made an offer.

568
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,120
They wanted to know if Curator Sung would be

569
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,920
available to curate Mr. Ahn Myung-sub's exhibition.

570
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,720
Or if she could at least recommend someone.

571
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,160
If they weren't after someone with at least 5 years' experience,

572
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,000
I would've gone.

573
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,120
Thank goodness.

574
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,640
Curator Sung will probably go, right?

575
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,120
If she went, she'd be gone for at least 6 months and up to a year.

576
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,400
And what, leave Director Gold behind?

577
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,400
She won't go, will she?

578
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,080
But she loves her work. She'll go, right?

579
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,080
- I don't think so. - I don't think she'll go.

580
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,000
How about we bet $5 each?

581
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,520
- Not going. - I'm in for going.

582
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,040
- I'm in for not going. - I think she'll decide to go

583
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,720
- and then change her mind. - That's not fair.

584
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,040
She'll go.

585
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,120
Should I butt out?

586
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,480
You should've done that a long time ago.

587
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,080
Why aren't you talking about it?

588
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,520
The New York offer.

589
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,760
Oh??

590
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,120
Was it you who??

591
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,720
No, I only found out today, too.

592
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,040
That Mono Art Gallery

593
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,480
wants you to come.

594
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,040
Have you thought about it?

595
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,640
Yes.

596
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,840
Have you come to a decision?

597
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,920
Yes.

598
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,480
So you're going.

599
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,560
Yes.

600
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,680
You chose well.

601
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,200
This is a good opportunity for you, Duk-mi.

602
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,520
Then??Does that mean

603
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,880
we'll have to do long distance now?

604
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,840
That's quite romantic.

605
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,720
No, I'm going to go with you.

606
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,160
Come with me, Mr. Ryan Gold the artist.

607
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,160
I've analyzed all your artwork prior to retirement,

608
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:55,920
plus current trends in the New York art sphere.

609
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,920
Your current paintings??

610
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,600
They're wonderful enough to cancel your retirement.

611
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,880
No, actually, they could

612
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,600
create bigger shockwaves than your original debut.

613
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,800
Trust me

614
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,800
and my eye for art as a curator.

615
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,960
I trust you

616
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,080
and your talents as a curator.

617
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,600
But uh??If I go to New York now, I'll be jobless.

618
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,760
What do I live on?

619
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,520
I'll sustain you.

620
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,120
- Really? - Really.

621
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,720
But I'm a carnivore,

622
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,120
so I need to have steak every day.

623
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,920
Will you be alright with that?

624
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,160
Every day?

625
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,160
Steak?

626
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,880
That's alright. I hear steak is cheaper in New York.

627
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,120
I know lots of cheap places to eat in New York.

628
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,240
Do you?

629
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,160
I've always regretted not being able to send you abroad to study,

630
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,480
but in the end, you're going.

631
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,000
- Take care of yourself. - I will.

632
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,760
At least you're going with Director??

633
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,840
It's "Yun-je," Mrs. Sung.

634
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,360
I'm relieved you're going with Yun-je, at least.

635
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,280
Please take good care of my Duk-mi for me.

636
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,840
Of course, I'll call you often.

637
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,120
You're going to let his mother know too, right?

638
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,120
Of course, we're going to see her today.

639
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:29,480
She'll be sorry to hear it. She finally reunited with her son??

640
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,920
You don't have to call us often,

641
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,920
just call your mother often.

642
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,360
We'll call both our moms often.

643
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,760
Thank goodness you can paint again.

644
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,960
It's all thanks to Duk-mi.

645
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,320
Thank you, Duk-mi.

646
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,080
They won't be here??

647
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,280
So must you go, too, Mom?

648
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,040
Aw, Si-an??You've become a baby again.

649
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,520
Are you going back to

650
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,080
where Si-an's father is?

651
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,240
Yes.

652
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:04,280
Both of my sons are leading their own lives.

653
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,160
It's time for me to do so, as well.

654
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,080
I met Yun-je again thanks to my volunteer work

655
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,080
of teaching Korean to overseas adoptees.

656
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,280
I'm going to work even harder from here on out.

657
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,000
But Mr. Cha Si-an looks extremely sorry to see you go.

658
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,960
Oh, it's actually not because of us,

659
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,000
- but because of a fan. - A fan?

660
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,120
Yes. Who was it again?

661
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,840
T.R?? Something.

662
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:29,080
The Road to Si-an.

663
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:32,600
She's on hiatus right now.

664
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,320
A hiatus means it's only temporary. I'll be??

665
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,320
I mean, I'm sure she'll be back soon.

666
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,920
Mr. Cha Si-an.

667
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,880
Cha Si-an!

668
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,120
Mom, Duk-mi and I will be back.

669
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,000
As you all know??

670
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,440
Can't you not go?

671
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,760
Nope, sorry.

672
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,880
I'll be back before you know it.

673
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,120
Says who?

674
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,840
This won't be our last meeting, so I'll keep it brief.

675
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:28,000
Thanks for all your hard work.

676
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,200
Director, if you're going to come back as an artist,

677
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,400
you could hold your exhibition here, at Cheum.

678
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,960
So why the long face?

679
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:37,280
You look rather excited, don't you, Hyo-jin?

680
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:43,440
I guess I'll now have to introduce you to your new director.

681
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,160
This??I had no choice.

682
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,000
Hi! How are you, everyone?

683
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,560
I'm Director Eom So-hye, the new director!

684
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,120
That's my mom!

685
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,440
You look so excited!

686
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,120
Duk-mi??My Duk-mi??

687
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,520
How am I going to live without you?

688
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,920
I'll call you every day.

689
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,480
You think phone calls will do? For people like us?

690
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,760
We see each other 360 days a year.

691
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,080
She says she'll come back. Time'll fly!

692
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,520
Hey, Eun-ki you punk.

693
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,560
I know you already went through this

694
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:30,000
when you had to move to the Olympic training center,

695
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,360
but not me.

696
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,720
The longest time I didn't see Duk-mi was

697
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,160
when I was at the postpartum care center

698
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,600
after I had Gun-woo. That was the only time!

699
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,960
No, think again.

700
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,160
I dressed up as your husband and sneaked in, remember?

701
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,120
- We saw each other. - Oh yeah??

702
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,160
Oh!

703
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,000
Director??

704
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,120
- Please be good to Duk-mi. - I will.

705
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:55,000
She likes handsome men the best.

706
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,440
- Hey! - She's only half-drunk.

707
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,080
She likes pretty men, too.

708
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,120
There you go.

709
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,640
- Lee Sun-joo! - And cute guys??

710
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,120
drive her crazy.

711
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,360
I got the picture.

712
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:08,240
I'll try to be handsome, pretty, and cute all at the same time.

713
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,000
I remember you being shy

714
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,240
when you were little??

715
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,240
Me?

716
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,160
Yeah you, Yun-je.

717
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,080
Seriously?

718
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:24,040
Director, please coach Eun-ki in love, too.

719
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,080
Cheers!

720
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:28,320
He's always been funny.

721
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,320
Director.

722
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,040
I'm not a director anymore.

723
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,120
That's right. Then??

724
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,160
Lion!

725
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,120
It's not "Lion", it's "Ryan".

726
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,560
Alright, then choose.

727
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:48,120
Lion, Ryan, Yun-je.

728
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,440
Which would you like me to call you?

729
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,600
Then??Will you call me whatever I want you to?

730
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,080
Of course. Tell me what you want.

731
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,720
For me to tell you,

732
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,000
you need to listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

733
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,040
You said so last time, didn't you?

734
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:17,320
That my works are now much better than before.

735
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,080
I didn't know, before,

736
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:29,120
that the world was so full of things I want to paint.

737
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,960
The sound of laughter,

738
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,320
the scent of the wind,

739
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,520
the warm sunlight,

740
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,240
and??

741
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,120
the temperature of the person whom I love.

742
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,280
It may seem like this is too sudden,

743
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,760
but let me off just this once.

744
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,480
I thought it just had to be this moment.

745
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,360
I'm asking you because I don't want to postpone it any longer.

746
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,600
Ms. Sung Duk-mi??

747
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,080
I wish, more than anyone else,

748
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,880
to paint??

749
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,640
your happiness with you.

750
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,360
Will you marry me?

751
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,280
Since I'm a fangirl,

752
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,080
I'll answer you in my own way.

753
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,600
I'd love to.

754
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,120
I'll become your bias.

755
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:27,960
Will you...

756
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,040
be my bias, too?

757
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,120
For all eternity.

758
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,000
Thank you.

759
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,480
One copy of Si-an's new album, please.

760
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,600
- I'll take a whole box. - Me, too.

761
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,200
- A whole box for me, too. - Me, too.

762
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,760
Wow, this is great!

763
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,280
Amazing.

764
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,680
Why are you carrying it like it's so light?

765

(We Are Each Other's Stars FADE)

(Seoul Elementary School)

767
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:10,000
Gun-woo, be nice to your friends,

768
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,880
and ask your teacher if there's anything you don't know.

769
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,960
Gun-woo, go get 'em!

770
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,680
I will!

771
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,600
Goodbye, Mom.

772
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,360
Goodbye, Dad.

773
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,080
Have a good day at school!

774
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,520
Jae-ha!

775
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,200
Let's go.

776
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,680
Let's go, let's go! Free time! Free time!

777

(One Year Later)

778
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,120
My darling Moo-san! My darling Moo-san!

779
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:18,000
Oh my God! Oh my God!

780
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,440
Moo-san! Oh my God!

781
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,800
Moo-san, you know how much I missed you, right?

782
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,840
- Of course I do. - You really do? Really? Really?

783
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,160
Yes.

784
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:36,640
I missed you so much! Oh my God??

785
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,800
Moo-san, why did you put on so much weight?

786
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,720
Oh my God, your face is all swollen!

787
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,640
You liked the food in there?

788
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,080
Okay!

789
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,600
Secretary Kim? Come on!

790
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:51,960
Moo-san?

791
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:57,120
Moo-san, you need to go on a diet now.

792
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,000
Here.

793
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,120
Say "Ah!"

794
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,040
A man needs to be handsome. You know that, right?

795
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,760
He should be handsome until the day he dies.

796
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,000
One more spoonful? Okay.

797
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Say "Ah!"

798
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,160
You're much more handsome now!

799
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,640
- Ms. Yang Eun-ah. - Yes?

800
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,960
You've never made coffee before, have you?

801
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,560
No??

802
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,000
Watch closely.

803
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,520
You rip this, and??

804
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,320
Oh my God!

805
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,080
Is my Hyo-jin making coffee right now?

806
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:43,600
Now that is what you call a valuable team member.

807
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:46,000
I should've brought Moo-san here??

808
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,640
Oh my God! Unbelievable!

809
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:54,400
The reason why I called you all of a sudden is

810
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,160
because I had someone to introduce to you.

811
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:01,720
It's true that I've been handling matters

812
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:05,000
very well on my own,

813
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,280
but our work load has increased.

814
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,400
It's difficult to handle on our own.

815
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,720
I think my Moo-san has also been feeling a little lonely,

816
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:13,400
because I've just been too busy.

817
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:20,000
So I think it's time we invited a vice-director.

818
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,120
Come in!

819
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,480
She's not coming in.

820
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,080
Come in!

821
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:41,120
Hello, I'm Cheum's Vice Director Sung Duk-mi.

822
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,920
- Curator Sung! - Curator Sung!

823
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,120
Have you all been well?

824
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,160
Why, you're as glad to see her as you were glad to see me.

825
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,680
What a relief. Well, come over here!

826
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,120
I'll leave you to say hello, then.

827
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,000
So I heard you became the head curator.

828
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,600
Cu. Sun??Oh wait.

829
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,920
Vice Director, I perfectly filled the void you left.

830
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,520
What about you, Yoo-sub? Are you officially a curator now?

831
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,520
Yes.

832
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:13,400
Oh, and I'm going out with Curator Yoo.

833
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,880
Wow, I'm so over this.

834
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:21,040
Why does this gallery have so many couples?

835
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,760
Is Director Ry??

836
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:26,040
I mean, Mr. Ryan Gold coming, perhaps?

837
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,400
Ryan Gold, our artist?

838
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:34,080
"The genius artist,

839
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:39,440
Ryan Gold has returned in splendor

840
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:44,160
after four years of absence."

841
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:48,040
So, uh??What does it mean?

842
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:53,040
In other words, our son-in-law has returned to the art scene!

843
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,240
Ah! Wow.

844
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:59,000
This is why I said you should study English with me.

845
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,280
Give me a second.

846
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:03,080
Mom!

847
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,360
Duk-mi!

848
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,960
Duk-mi!

849
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:11,480
My goodness??My dear daughter!

850
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,560
Let me see you.

851
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:23,000
Is today my birthday?

852
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,280
Our daughter has returned with splendor,

853
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,160
so I should prepare a feast, shouldn't I?

854
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,680
Congratulations, Vice-Director Sung Duk-mi.

855
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,800
Moment Magazine looks forward to working with you.

856
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,680
I should be saying that. I look forward to it.

857
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,040
Dad.

858
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,920
Father, are you crying?

859
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:42,000
Oh, no, no. Come on, eat.

860
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,480
Gosh, you.

861
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:47,880
So??when is our dear son-in-law coming?

862
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:48,880
Oh, you mean Yun-je?

863
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,960
His schedule is full until the first half of next year,

864
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,720
so he won't be able to come to Korea for now.

865
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,160
That only shows how successful his comeback was,

866
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,120
so don't be so disappointed.

867
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:57,920
Disappointed, who?

868
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,760
We fixed a date for the wedding.

869
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,000
Wedding?

870
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,880
Wasn't Eun-ki getting married first?

871
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,160
- Eh? - What?

872
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,120
What?

873
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,640
What? I'm not seeing anyone.

874
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,840
You've been calling Ms. Choi pretty often.

875
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,480
Hey, that's because that girl??

876
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,200
"That girl"?

877
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,240
Isn't that expression used between close friends?

878
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,920
- Right? - Yeah.

879
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:25,720
No!

880
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,000
I have someone else.

881
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,160
Really? You do?

882
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,160
I just got goosebumps.

883
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,160
Just shut up and eat, if you know nothing.

884
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:33,880
Ah, so he has someone!

885
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:35,160
So you do have someone! But??

886
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,760
But who? Who do you know that I don't?

887
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:37,880
Tell us!

888
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:41,640
Careful.

889
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:48,400
You're here?

890
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,480
Welcome back!

891
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,600
Sun-joo!

892
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,320
So, is this Wriggly?

893
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:57,840
Hello, Auntie!

894
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,200
Are you going to be cuter than Gun-woo?

895
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,200
Yes!

896
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,080
You said you weren't going to have another child.

897
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,240
That's what everyone says.

898
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,240
Anyway, congratulations.

899
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,280
That's right.

900
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:12,040
Today, Si-an and Ju Hyuk are hosting their first

901
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:15,480
joint concert for their project album. Do you want to go?

902
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,360
I do! Of course I have to go.

903
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,640
You guys are fangirling as soon as you've reunited?

904
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:22,640
Oh, that's right.

905
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,840
Don't be so shocked when you see Ju Hyuk.

906
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,160
Why?

907
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,040
He thinks he's some superstar.

908
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,200
It's fine, that kind of delusion can be worked on.

909
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,840
That's not what's important right now.

910
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,080
This guy's got a girl.

911
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:35,120
- What? - No I don't!

912
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,080
Is it her? That artist?

913
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,920
It's not that artist. He says it's someone else.

914
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,640
- I told you I don't! - Who is she?

915
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,080
- You didn't hear anything? - No.

916
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:43,080
You didn't know either, huh?

917
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,360
- What have you been up to? - No!

918
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,760
- What have you been up to? - Nam Eun-ki.

919
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:49,240
- No, I was just kidding! - You've grown up, have you?

920
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,080
- Who? Is it someone I know? - Who is it?

921
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:53,280
Nam Eun-ki's??

922
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,000
- ?宇hrowdown! - ?宇hrowdown!

923
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:01,240
Alright, today we'll learn about body drops.

924
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,120
But before we do??

925
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:06,040
- Subscribe! Subscribe! - And click the like button??

926
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:08,240
- Please! - Please!

927
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:12,120
So, when is a body drop appropriate,

928
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:15,240
- Coach Nam Eun-ki? - Well??

929
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:18,360
Let's say your opponent has grabbed you

930
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,080
and is trying to do the shoulder throw.

931
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:21,400
But when the opponent's front leg is blocking you,

932
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,720
you might hurt your tailbone due to the opponent's knee.

933
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:24,800
Allow me to demonstrate.

934
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:29,000
It's too short.

935
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,720
You might not get hurt if the opponent's leg is short...

936
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:35,520
Hey!

937
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:38,720
Shhh??The camera's rolling.

938
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,720
That really hurt.

939
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,440
Just bear it. It's not easy making money.

940
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,000
Are you sure we can make money out of this?

941
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:51,080
Mister, you're good at eating, right?

942
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:55,280
Come here. Let me throw you down just once.

943
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:58,000
But why? Mukbangs are the trend these days.

944
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:00,480
It'll be my treat.

945
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,720
Get down from me.

946
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:02,960
Let's do mukbang!

947
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,080
Let's turn off the camera first.

948
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:06,800
Coach, spare me!

949
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,040
(Vice Director Sung Duk-mi)

950
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:25,640
Vice Director Sung Duk-mi,

951
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:28,920
let's start the meeting.

952
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,000
Alright.

953
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:15,280
Yes, this is Sung Duk-mi.

954
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,400
Your voice says you're not all that thrilled to hear from me.

955
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:20,760
It's been less than a week since I got here.

956
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:25,640
I feel like it's been 7 years, not seven days.

957
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,280
Is everything going well with your exhibition?

958
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,480
We just finished a meeting, and I thought of you??

959
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:32,600
Is everyone at Cheum well?

960
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:35,000
Nothing's changed. Including Director Eom.

961
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,880
How about that place, then?

962
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,080
Where?

963
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:41,440
That place where we took fake paparazzi shots.

964
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,480
Um??

965
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:45,400
Here?

966
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,720
It's the same as ever.

967
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,160
Except for one thing.

968
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:53,120
One thing? What is that?

969
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,720
Um??My Lion's not here.

970
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,480
Then is it the same now?

971
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:08,120
What happened?

972
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:10,920
When did you arrive? What about the exhibition?

973
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:13,080
I flew right over as soon as the planning was done.

974
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:15,200
I missed you that much.

975
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,280
I said I'd go to you!

976
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:19,080
Well, who should I blame for making me like this?

977
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,960
To be honest, I was at my limit, too, missing you.

978
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:31,040
- Ms. Sung Duk-mi? - Yes?

979
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:32,680
This is how you stan a bias.

980
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,120
You're quite a successful fanboy.

981
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:41,400
Do you want me?

982
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:42,480
Yes.

983
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:40,600
Are you all

984
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:42,840
fangirling or fanboying right now?

985
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:45,320
I hope you find success one day.

986
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:12,600
(Her Private Life)

987
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,240
(Thank you to Lee Han-wi for making a special appearance)

988
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:41,400
(You are all someone's bias)

989
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:42,840
(And thank you to our viewers for watching "Her Private Life")
