2
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,080
(Her Private Life)

3
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,920
Why aren't you asking me anything?

4
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,120
I had a dream.

5
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,080
A scary dream?

6
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,000
It wasn't just a dream,

7
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,800
but a nightmare you could say is my memories.

8
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,440
A dream about the day I was abandoned at the orphanage.

9
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,760
I hardly have any memories from before I was seven,

10
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,760
which is when I was adopted abroad??

11
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,040
But that day is an exception, I still remember it somewhat.

12
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,040
That moment when she pulled her hand away from mine, so coldly.

13
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,520
It's so vivid.

14
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,920
So that's why??

15
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,160
So that's why I hate letting go.

16
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,120
I hate being left behind,

17
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,840
left to bear that feeling of loneliness.

18
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,800
Are you alright now?

19
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,640
I'm with you now, aren't I?

20
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,160
Guess it can't be helped, then. We'll just have to stay together.

21
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,920
You're going to make me go to work without sleeping a wink?

22
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,680
Yes.

23
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,440
You know, I often used to have nightmares when I was little, too.

24
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,920
I don't remember what they were about exactly,

25
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,040
but I'd wake up screaming and crying.

26
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,640
And whenever I did, I'd force my family to stay up.

27
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,800
Whenever that happened,

28
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,840
instead of forcefully putting me back to bed

29
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,800
my mom would stay up and play with me all night.

30
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,120
So tonight,

31
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,960
I'll stay up with you, all night.

32
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,040
All night?

33
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
All night.

34
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,800
- Let's go! - To where?

35
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,040
Where else?

36
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,840
However, once you go in you can't come back out.

37
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,880
Follow me.

38
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,120
Now where was that lock?

39
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,160
What is this?

40
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,760
The War of the Flowers: Hwatu.

41
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,920
To go or no to go? "Go-stop."

42
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,280
This philosophical game with all the joys and sorrows of life.

43
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,160
Is this what you meant when you said you'd stay up with me?

44
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,160
Yes.

45
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,320
Is there anything else you wanted to do?

46
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,160
No, no there isn't.

47
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,880
The colors are very intense.

48
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,880
If playing cards are all about symbolism,

49
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,520
hwatu cards have strong design elements.

50
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,040
That doesn't really matter.

51
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,880
Now, if I'm to give you a brief overview of the rules??

52
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,120
Look here. Do you see five birds?

53
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,800
Three birds, one bird, one bird. That's a "godori."

54
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,000
That's five points. No need to learn their names.

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,720
And see how it says "gwang" here?

56
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,520
Collect five of these, and you get "oh-gwang."

57
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,080
That's 15 points for these five cards.

58
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,280
These're two really good sets.

59
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,840
And then, do you see how some cards are

60
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,280
wearing a ribbon across their chest like in the Miss Korea pageant?

61
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,200
The ones without any writing are "cho-dan,"

62
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,760
the ones with the red ribbons are "hong-dan,"

63
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,960
and the blue ribbons are "cheong-dan."

64
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,480
They're three points each. So that's three, three, three.

65
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,120
In summary, that's five, five, three, three, three.

66
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,280
As for the rest, the junk cards, the more you get the better.

67
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,800
You won't really get it until you play, so??

68
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,160
- The more you get the better? - Yes, yes.

69
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,600
That's enough of an explanation.

70
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,400
That's it?

71
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,080
You don't learn go-stop by listening to the rules.

72
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,240
You've got to take a few hits not to forget.

73
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,320
Alright, let's start!

74
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,200
Take a few hits?

75
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,240
No, no, no! That was invalid. Invalid!

76
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,640
This one's a bonus.

77
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,920
Why? Why take mine?

78
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,160
It's a congratulatory gift.

79
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,280
- But??- Alright.

80
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,320
One moment.

81
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,960
I should really say "go" here,

82
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,120
but I'll take pity on you and just say stop.

83
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,680
- Take pity on me? - That's 10 points times two.

84
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,600
In total, that's 20 hits but I'll go easy and make it two.

85
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,920
Why? Why? Why 20 points?

86
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,040
That's "pi-bak" so it's worth double.

87
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,760
- Not taking this gives you double? - Yes.

88
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,040
Then you should've told me!

89
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
I'll just hit you two times.

90
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,920
You know that it's no fun if I go easy on you here

91
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,800
just because we're dating, right?

92
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,960
But??How could you??

93
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,520
Did that hurt a lot?

94
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,520
Bomb.

95
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,760
One, two, three!

96
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,120
Woo-hoo! All mine.

97
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,880
Alright, let's put one here.

98
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,840
My sugar's recharged.

99
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,000
Let's go for another round.

100
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,080
Let's stop now. This is no fun.

101
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,120
Is it really no fun?

102
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,040
Maybe it is a little fun.

103
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,840
How many was I supposed to give you?

104
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,840
Was it five?

105
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,880
Five?

106
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,280
Didn't you have 50 points?

107
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,080
It's so much fun, right?

108
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,560
One more round?

109
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,160
How did you come here from the countryside?

110
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,520
I rode my bike!

111
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,880
Is that a chicken or what?

112
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,840
Beautiful, huh?

113
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,800
This is nice.

114
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,120
I'll get going. I got to see you, at least.

115
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,840
I'm all recharged now.

116
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,120
Sorry to have woken you up. Go in.

I'll order them. I'll make sure I do!

Alright.

00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,960
I've already entrusted my life to my husband,

so why shouldn't I be able to trust you with this?

You know, you're right.

133

If you don't have time for your friends,

134
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,400

Don't neglect your health just because you're down.

138

You need to take care of yourself especially at a time like this.

- I'm the best, right? - Yes.

140

How are you? Feeling much better now that you came out?

141
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,440
So, uh??Did you make up with your husband?

142
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,120
To be honest, I want to apologize to you.

143
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,840
I feel like I got you involved and worried.

144

147

Forgive your husband.

148
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,240
It was clearly wrong of him to secretly copy our files,

149
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,320
but his report wasn't inaccurate.

150
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,280
Besides, we're partly at fault too, for making T.R.T.S. look like

she was stalking a non-celebrity.

It's time already.

166
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,960
I'll get going first, then. Bye!

167
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,160
Alright, bye!

168
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Nam Eun-ki.

169
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,800
Don't tell me??

170
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,720
I confessed my feelings to Duk-mi.

171
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,160
You're crazy! You're crazy! You're crazy!

172
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,760
What are you trying to do?

173
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,160
Well, I can't just keep on suppressing it.

174
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,560
What are we going to do with you?

175
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,720
Curator Sung!

176
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,960
Oh, sorry. I'm a bit late, right?

177
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,760
- Did the meeting start already? - Not everyone's here yet.

178
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,160
Hyo-jin's not here yet, either?

179
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,240
I'm already here, thank you.

180
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,480
Curator Sung, you go and call Director Gold,

181
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,240
and Hyo-jin, give this to me and follow me.

182
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,320
Why?

183
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,120
Director?

184
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,240
Director Ryan?

185
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,120
(A Perfect Guide to Go-Stop)

186
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,280
Aren't we on the clock, Director?

187
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,720
I felt like I was conned last night,

188
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,800
so I was just checking.

189
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,760
Conned?

190
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,000
But I gave you a tailored private lesson.

191
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,480
You never told me the most important thing.

192
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,720
What is the most important thing?

193
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,600
12-10-5-11-8-3!

194
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,000
It's too early for that.

195
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,360
I'll do some intensive training for you next time.

196
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,520
So let's go to the meeting first.

197
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,680
Oh.

198
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,600
You actually fell asleep after smacking me like that?

199
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,080
Did it hurt a lot?

200
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,640
Did it really hurt that much?

201
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,320
You create a miniature exhibit room, like this,

202
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,040
and put the works on display.

203
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,280
We could also add in a sofa

204
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,640
or other small furniture or electronics, like a TV.

205
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,120
My Little Museum!

206
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,320
- That's cute. - That's pretty good.

207
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,800
Did you brief our artists and our collectors on this?

208
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,160
We sent them our proposal,

209
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,080
and the feedback has been quite positive.

210
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,960
Have a chat with the designer and simplify the overall design.

211
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,280
And as for those artworks,

212
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,200
see whether if you can make them magnetic instead.

213
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,920
Then for production cost and minimum quantity??

214
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,360
So??We're really going to make these and sell them?

215
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,920
At our souvenirs shop?

216
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,120
Don't have high sales expectations. A product like this??

217
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,000
I think they'll sell out.

218
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,760
I'll put in the order.

219
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,360
I'll make sure they sell out. Please don't worry!

220
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,560
As for the actual size and the miniature furniture,

221
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,960
it'll be best to decide on them after you run a survey

222
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,920
with our previous customers.

223
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,480
Alright.

224
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,200
How's the schedule coming along for the special exhibition?

225
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,120
We finished editing the brochure,

226
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,880
and the first sample from the print shop will be out soon.

227
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,080
- What about the press release? - We're still on it,

228
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,720
and our ad for the monthly magazine is currently being re-edited.

229
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,000
Cheum Museum's 5th-anniversary special exhibition isn't far off.

230
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,680
I know you're all busy, but please check your progress

231
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,320
once more so that all goes smoothly.

232
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,840
Let's end the meeting here.

233
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,360
Our next day off will really be our last day off, huh?

234
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,720
What will you do on your day off?

235
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,480
I'll be going to an orphanage, to volunteer as an art teacher.

236
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,880
Volunteer at an orphanage?

237
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,920
What's with that tone?

238
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,680
No, it's just that I thought it's so you.

239
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,240
Of course I'd like to get some rest on my day off, too.

240
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,720
But when I do go, I feel so good afterwards.

241
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,520
Do you go there by yourself? It must be tough.

242
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,200
Then do you want to join me?

243
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,120
- I'll join you! - Really?

244
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,120
- What about you, Curator Sung? - I'm up for it.

245
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,640
Then why don't we all go together?

246
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,800
What, me too?

247
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,240
Yes. Yay??

248
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,360
Mmm, delicious.

249
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,640
About Duk-mi.

250
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,840
After denying it furiously,

251
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,560
it turns out she was indeed dating Director Gold!

252
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,600
- Really? - Yes!

253
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,920
I thought she was only ever good at chasing after idols,

254
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,200
but maybe that raised her standards?

255
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,600
He's handsome, competent, humble??

256
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,960
Seriously, this has made me take a second look at Duk-mi.

257
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,200
Was I showing off too much?

258
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,480
Oh, don't worry!

259
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,080
Give Eun-ki some time, and he'll bring home a nice girl.

260
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,840
Is our Eun-ki just somewhat of a catch?

261
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,560
Excuse me.

262
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,160
It's the fathers-in-law who love the daughters-in-law most.

263
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,280
When Eun-ki brings home a girl, I'll??

264
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,000
Honey,

265
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,680
you just do nothing but wipe your rocks.

266
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,920
That's the trend among fathers-in-law these days.

267
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,000
(Sung Duk-mi Duk-mi, are you off work?)

268
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
(When are you coming home?)

269
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,720
Nam Eun-ki!

270
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,080
Ed. Nam.

271
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,000
What brings you here?

272
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,080
Don't you get tired of working out?

273
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,600
You're making yourself sweat until this hour??

274
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,040
How can an athlete get sick of athletics?

275
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,080
It's been a while, want to go for a walk with your mom?

276
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,280
Alright.

277
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,240
Wait here, I'll go take a shower.

278
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,240
Okay.

279
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,080
I never realized you grew this tall!

280
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,080
I can't even look at your face anymore because my neck'll hurt.

281
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,880
Here. Look all you want.

282
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,040
Ha! Gosh??

283
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,320
It's tough, isn't it?

284
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,760
What is?

285
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,000
Unrequited love.

286
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,640
I heard about Duk-mi and Director Gold from Young-sook.

287
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,000
Should we sit here for a moment?

288
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,840
"That's great!" "Congratulations!" are what I should've said to her,

289
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,560
but those words just wouldn't come out.

290
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,720
I could only think about how hard

291
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,000
- it must be for you. - Mom??

292
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,120
I don't want you to have a hard time, Eun-ki.

293
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,600
Was it hard for you, too?

294
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,080
When you met Dad?

295
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,200
It was.

296
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,160
I was always the one who was torn to pieces.

297
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,040
I went crazy for a while, there.

298
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,920
Still, it's all good.

299
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,000
It led to my having a son.

300
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,040
You gotta admit, your son sure is something, isn't he?

301
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,600
He really is.

302
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,560
That's why I don't want to give him away to anyone.

303
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Son,

304
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,600
you should meet someone whom you love,

305
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,960
and who loves you back.

306
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,600
That's all I want for you.

307
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,880
Why does having feelings for someone have to be so hard?

308
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,920
It's not like I can control my heart??

309
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,920
This feels more complicated than

310
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,960
how I've felt before any match.

311
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,120
Hey, don't forget that at least you have your cuckoo mother.

312
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,560
Of course not.

313
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,760
Let's go.

314
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,400
What's all this?

315
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:32,400
Colored pencils, pastels, crayons, felt-tip pens??

316
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,640
You prepared all this by yourself?

317
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,400
I'm just grateful that you're coming with me.

318
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,120
- Hyo-jin's coming with us? - I know, right?

319
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,920
Good morning.

320
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,800
- What is all that? - Give that to me.

321
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,680
White Ocean CDs.

322
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,080
So I can convert the children into Si-an's fans.

323
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,560
Oh, goodness.

324
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,920
So... isn't Director Gold coming?

325
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,200
Oh yeah. I thought he was, since he's started to warm up to us.

326
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,480
Did you guys break up?

327
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,080
Ugh, Ms. Kim Hyo-jin!

328
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,680
Sorry, it's become a habit.

329
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,920
Director Gold was pretty busy this week.

330
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,360
He really should rest today.

331
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,920
Director.

332
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,840
Sorry I'm late, I had something come up.

333
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,080
Curator Sung, you'll be going with Director, right?

334
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,320
Okay.

335
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,120
- Let's go. - Let's go!

336
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,640
You should've said that you were coming.

337
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,480
I wanted to surprise you.

338
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,760
But what are all these stuffed toys?

339
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,360
I'll be going to an orphanage, to volunteer as an art teacher.

340
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,720
Hey, brother.

341
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,520
Mr. Cha Si-an.

342
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,280
Come on, I told you to forgo the honorifics.

343
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,000
I'm not seeing Curator Sung today.

344
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,040
Yeah, she's volunteering today at an orphanage.

345
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,920
Orphanage? That's great.

346
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,080
One moment.

347
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,840
I won't take long.

348
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,160
My fans gave me these teddy bears,

349
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,560
but I haven't had the time to donate them yet.

350
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,520
Could I ask you to instead?

351
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,560
Gosh??Is Si-an really an angel?

352
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,240
Excuse me, it was me who brought them.

353
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,120
Well done, Driver Gold.

354
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,080
"Driver Gold"?

355
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,440
Please go, Driver Gold.

356
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,760
Driver Gold is going.

357
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,240
(Hanbit Orphanage)

358
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,760
Everyone, everyone! Please look over here!

359
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,440
Well done! Alright everyone,

360
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,000
we're going to do something super fun, now.

361
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,120
But before that, you all need to grab a seat.

362
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,920
Can you do that for me?

363
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,040
- Yes! - Yes!

364
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,160
Thank you, let's go!

365
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,120
- Over here. - Over here!

366
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,880
Yay, we're the best!

367
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,520
- Over here. - Here!

368
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,600
Hey, over here!

369
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,640
Don't!

370
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,160
Director!

371
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,040
- Join us! - Hurry over!

372
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,880
- Come! - Hurry up!

373
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,400
Hurry over here, Director!

374
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,280
- Come on! - Join us!

375
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,520
Why did you start giving free art lessons?

376
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,200
Isn't it better to make financial contributions?

377
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,240
Will knowing more about art change things?

378
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,400
It's not like they can afford to buy any artworks.

379
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,880
Why? Was that an ignorant question?

380
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,960
No-no.

381
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,720
Uh??Hyo-jin.

382
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,560
Did you fall in love with Mr. Cha Si-an the moment you saw him?

383
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,080
Yes, of course.

384
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,000
Then??

385
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,880
If you were asked to go back to the time when you were

386
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,000
still unaware of his existence, could you?

387
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,800
No way, I don't think so.

388
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,680
Why not? You'd still be eating well, going to nice places

389
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,400
and doing fun things even without knowing of Cha Si-an.

390
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,400
How would I forget Si-an?

391
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,360
Now that I've come to know him, he's engraved on my heart.

392
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,720
Do you know happy Si-an has made me?

393
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,440
So??Isn't it possible that art is the same way?

394
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,560
Of course, material support is important.

395
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,280
You can still have a good life without art.

396
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,040
But??

397
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,120
By giving these children a chance like this to

398
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,080
get to know art naturally, by drawing and coloring something

399
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,640
and coming to learn of its beauty??

400
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,640
I think their lives will be a little more fulfilling

401
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,440
and a little happier, too.

402
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,080
That's what I believe, anyway.

403
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,080
Because that's how my life is.

404
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,320
Rock, paper, scissors! Rock, paper, scissors!

405
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,320
Woo-hoo!

406
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,560
Everyone, do you see this pretty teacher here?

407
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,240
Yes!

408
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,920
In this class, we're going to draw a portrait of

409
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,520
this pretty teacher here and hold an exhibition!

410
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,720
So you'll get to see how your other friends

411
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,960
saw and expressed the same person you drew.

412
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,480
- Can you all do that? - Yes!

413
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,120
I'll help you, too.

414
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,240
Ready??

415
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,720
start!

416
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,600
Good luck.

417
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,040
Director.

418
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,320
If you want to draw your girlfriend as well, here.

419
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,120
Good luck!

420
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,880
Please don't move!

421
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,000
Oops, sorry.

422
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,120
Please don't move!

423
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,000
Looks exactly like her, right?

424
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,440
Why, it's just like her!

425
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Duk-mi!

426
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,720
Please don't move!

427
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,720
Oh, sorry.

428
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,000
Shall I draw you too, Mister?

429
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,840
Huh?

430
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,040
Me?

431
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,080
Uh??

432
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,320
- Pass me some crayons. - Sure.

433
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,160
Can you make my eyes a little bigger?

434
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,120
And then? What next?

435
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,000
Red??

436
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,960
Alright, here we go!

437
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,000
Here we go.

438
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,040
One, two, three, click!

439
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,560
Okay, well done.

440
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,640
Well done! Now come over here.

441
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,560
Next up, Yu-bin. Come a little closer.

442
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,120
One, two, three!

443
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,120
Look at the camera! Look at the pretty sis.

444
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,360
One, two, three!

445
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,400
Kimchi!

446
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,120
One more time. One more time!

447
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,920
Give me a big smile.

448
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,200
One, two, three!

449
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,320
- You want me to draw your hand? - Yes.

450
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,400
As in, not sketch your hand but trace around it?

451
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,400
Yes.

452
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,400
Uh??

453
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,160
I'm Ryan Gold.

454
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,040
I know.

455
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,000
What's wrong with this? I like this better, it's cute.

456
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,840
Fine.

457
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,880
Pink.

458
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,120
Maybe another color.

459
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,120
Here, like this.

460
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,560
Just like this. Vroom!

461
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,400
Vroom!

462
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,840
Vroom!

463
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,040
Ah, all done.

464
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,160
Wow. Even my hands are pretty, don't you think?

465
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,360
Alright, since mine's all done,

466
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,600
I'll do your hand, Director.

467
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,000
Light blue. I already had this color in mind.

468
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,160
Here.

469
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,920
Your hand is really pretty.

470
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,680
Done!

471
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,000
Isn't it a work of art?

472
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,520
It's great.

473
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,040
Please hang it up at Mono Art Gallery.

474
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,400
Let me think about it.

475
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,880
Mister!

476
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,720
What's your name, Mister?

477
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,440
Ryan Gold.

478
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,160
Ryan Gold?

479
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,240
That's so weird. Don't you have a Korean name?

480
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,640
(Ryan??

481
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,240
You must be happy to be so loved.

482
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,400
No kidding.

483
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,760
Come back soon, Mister.

484
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,960
Goodbye.

485
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,800
Thank you.

486
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,720
Let's go.

487
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,040
I want to ride in the good car, too.

488
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,320
- We'll see you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow.

489
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,120
Get in. The same way you got here.

490
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,120
We're going together.

491
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,880
Shall we go too, then?

492
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,000
Whoa! She said to go the same way we got here.

493
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,160
Yes ma'am.

494
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Put these on.

495
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,000
If I put these on, you won't be able to focus on the road.

496
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,680
I look great with sunglasses on.

497
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,160
How do I look?

498
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,680
You know??

499
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,280
I actually didn't expect you to show up.

500
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,280
That's why I never mentioned it.

501
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,560
I'm glad I came.

502

After building good memories with the person I love,

503
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,080
I no longer hate the place I used to hate.

504
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,320
Now look to the front.

505
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,440
I don't want to.

506
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,440
Enjoy the scenery.

507
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,200
I like this scenery much better.

508
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,120
This piece was created in 1987.

509
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,320
I want it.

510
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,720
What's your name, Mister?

511
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,080
That's so weird. Don't you have a Korean name?

512
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,280
You know, children really like you.

513
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,280
Are you jealous?

514
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,840
You want me all to yourself?

515
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,320
I can finally tell you this now,

516
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,040
but remember how we first met at that auction?

517
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,920
When you told me that,

518
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,200
I thought you were a nutjob.

519
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,320
So I've heard.

520
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,080
But Director,

521
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,040
Do you really not remember your Korean name?

522
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,560
To be honest, it feels like it's someone else's name.

523
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,920
I've never once liked it, you see.

524
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,160
As if it's not mine.

525
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,520
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have brought it up??

527

Heo Yun-je.

528
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,280
Heo Yun-je?

529
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,040
Well, I want to like that name.

530
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,200
Because it's the name of the person I like.

531
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,600
Hi, Heo Yun-je.

532
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,040
How long do you plan to hold my hand?

533
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,720
It's not me who's holding on.

534
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,240
Oh.

535
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,960
So it's all over if I let go, huh?

536

One.

Two.

538
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,600
Do you want to stay for dinner?

539
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,120
I'll make it from scratch.

540
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,680
To make the dough, you first need flour.

541

- Let's see. - Is it all done?

542
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,440
Wow!

543
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,080
How long do we have to leave it for?

544
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,600
About 30-40 minutes?

545
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,800
What do we do for those 30 minutes, then?

546

Will this be enough?

550

We need to eat our soup.

Let's eat it later.

Wow, it really is him.

- What's this about? - Well??

579
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,440
He said he's a fan of judo athlete Nam Eun-ki, so I told him

580
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,800
you're an acquaintance of mine, but he wouldn't believe me.

581

I'm a fan, Mr. Nam Eun-ki.

I'm annoying, aren't I?

588
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,200
So you know. I was debating whether or not

589
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,480
I should say something since you didn't seem aware.

590

You see, the thing is??

591

I don't have any friends.

No drinking buddies.

593

Actually, I do have one friend??

Actually, no.

595
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:52,560
I do have a friend whom I have to pretend he's a friend??

596
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:57,320
But now it's getting hard for me to pretend that he is a friend.

597
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,040
That makes us friends, then.

Well, fine. Just for tonight. Just tonight.

599

One look and I can tell that you are the type to tire people out.

600
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,360
You're good at reading people.

601
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,640
So you confessed your feelings to her?

602
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,080
You're brave.

603
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,720

Why?

605
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,360
Well??I've known Ryan for ten years now,

606
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:52,160
but it was my first time seeing that kind of expression.

607
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:00,040
It was enough to instantly make me think, "Wow, he really likes her."

608
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:07,120
I've never come across anything I couldn't get my hands on,

609
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:10,720
so I think there's just one thing left for me to do now:

610
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,320
backing down.

611
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,480

you did a great job with this survey,

630
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,040
but I think your questions are a little too direct.

631

- Which questions? - All of them.

632
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,680
Yes, Professor.

633
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,480

While preparing the brochure, I was doing some research

648
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,080
and there's no information about her out there,

00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,040
When can I see it?

661
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,400
He sent it for delivery just now.

662
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,560
I'll let you know when it arrives,

663
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,360
so you can take a look before it goes into the storage.

664
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,160
Thanks.

665
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,360
Good morning!

666
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,960
Everyone.

667
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:36,720
Director Eom?

668
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,280
No,

669
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,080
Chairwoman of TK Cultural Foundation.

670
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,080
Mr. Gold,

671
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:47,040
do you care to have a chat with Chairwoman Eom So-hye?

672
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,600
Follow me.

673
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,760
Congratulations, Chairwoman Eom So-hye.

674
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,440
I thought I'd need things like authority and rights to

675
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,520
speak with you, so??

676
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,480
You have a peculiar way of holding a conversation.

677
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:29,080
Well. To be honest, I hate exchanging words.

678
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,640
I'll just do all the talking,

679
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:34,680
so you just listen, Mr. Gold.

680
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:41,280
Cheum Museum's 5th-anniversary Celebrities' Collection exhibit...

681
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,760
Cancel it.

682
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,000
Chairwoman.

683
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,840
Mother.

684
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:51,840
Hyo-jin?

685
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,040
This is the goods,

686
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,160
I mean, art merchandise I came up with myself.

687
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:00,640
Okay, I got it. You can leave.

688
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,640
And Hyo-jin?

689
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:06,040
You're not someone who should be doing that kind of work.

690
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,760
My darling Hyo-jin, you are TK's??

691
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,400
I'm the daughter you've practically given up on.

692
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:20,080
The one to whom you can give a credit card so she won't annoy you

693
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,720
and who only does as you ask.

694
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Hyo-jin??

695
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,920
How come you've never asked me, Mother?

696
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,400
What I like,

697
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,680
or what I want to do.

698
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,120
Why aren't you curious about those kinds of things?

699
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,120
I find myself curious about those whom I like.

700
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,880
Hyo-jin. Is there anything??

701
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,080
I don't know about you?

702
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,520
This??I made this.

703
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,560
Curator Sung entrusted me with

704
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:00,000
a task I could do well.

705
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,480
Curator Yoo helped me,

706
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,640
and Mr. Yoo-sub cheered me on.

707
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,000
And Director??

708
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,480
Anyway, I want to keep doing this.

709
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,200
Not because of Cha Si-an,

710
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,160
but because I've come to like this job!

711
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,920
Even if that's so,

712
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,840
idols are a no-go.

713
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,240
Hyo-jin, what is the meaning of this?

714
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:41,080
Let us do the special exhibition.

715
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,840
I really want to see this come to fruition.

716
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,080
If I can't??

717
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:57,840
there will be no one left beside you, Mother.

718
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,120
Not even me.

719
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,400
What's with this atmosphere?

720
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,800
One that proves no parents can win against their children.

721
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,760
Do you think the special exhibit will happen?

722
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,480
- Director? - Yeah.

723
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,160
Are you alright?

724
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,920
I'm so upset right now!

725
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,000
Director.

726
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:56,920
Things are looking up, right?

727
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,680
Oh my.

728
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,840
Si-an.

729
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,600
Curator Sung, aren't you going home?

730
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,080
You go ahead first.

731
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,040
What time do you think Director will leave?

732
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,480
I have to put Lee Sol's work in storage.

733
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:04,040
Oh, I'll do that. You can go ahead first.

734
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,160
Could I?

735
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,040
Then??Thank you for your work!

736
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,120
We'll see you tomorrow, then.

737
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,760
- Bye. - Bye!

738
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:20,280
How about we go for a drink?

739
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,160
Didn't you see what happened earlier?

740
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,480
I have to go home and fight my last battle.

741
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,840
Hyo-jin, you're really amazing.

742
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:28,840
Go you!

743
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,400
By the way, do you know how to catch a bus?

744
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,440
Let's go. I'll show you how.

745
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,680
Yes, Mr. Park.

746
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,760
I've arrived and am on my way now.

747
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,400
Si-an doesn't know yet, does he?

748
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,400
Alright.

749
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,880
I'm not hungry.

750
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,080
Cha Si-an.

751
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,640
Mom?

752
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,360
I know you're working, but you should still eat.

753
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,200
Oh what? Mom, what happened?

754
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,120
My son??

755
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,400
Why've you grown so thin?

756
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,520
When did you get here?

757
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,120
If you'd told me, I would've come to greet you.

758
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,920
I thought you might be busy.

759
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,360
You dazzle on TV, but you're still a baby.

760
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,960
You still are, Si-an.

761
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,640
Of course I still am. I missed you to death!

762
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:50,040
Aww, did you?

763
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,280
Director.

764
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,120
Were you looking at the painting?

765
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,960
This woman I know looks at paintings

766
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,680
whenever she has a tough day.

767
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,800
So??

768
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,120
Who's this woman?

769
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:36,360
Still, I'm glad we're able to do this special exhibition.

770
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,400
Yes.

771
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,320
It's a relief.

772
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:49,760
I'm curious about something.

773
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,000
So I was told that

774
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
when you're curious about someone,

775
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,320
it means you like them.

776
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:03,000
You have two pieces by Lee Sol, right?

777
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,040
When did you first see her work?

778
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,960
Three years ago,

779
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,040
at a gallery in New York.

780
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,040
That's when it began,

781
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,400
my inability to paint.

782
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,600
I??

783
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,800
can't paint.

784
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,600
You knew that, right?

785
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,960
At first I thought it was Stendhal syndrome.

786
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,280
I thought I'd get better soon, but??

787
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,440
I tortured my poor doctor friend for three years,

788
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,880
but it was all in vain.

789
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:14,200
- So that's why??- That's why I come back to this.

790
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:19,760
It was all because of Lee Sol's art,

791
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,000
so I thought something might change

792
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
if I collected all of her works.

793
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:30,160
But you know??

794
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,880
I've actually seen this painting before.

795
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:40,040
Not three years ago,

796
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,480
but further back in the past.

797
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:51,000
When I was very young.

798
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,040
By young you mean??

799
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,600
Before I was Ryan.

800
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,400
When I was Heo Yun-je.

801
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,960
I saw her paint that.

802
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,080
If you saw it being painted, then??

803
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:22,240
Lee Sol's painting is??

804
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:27,440
Lee Sol??

805
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,760
is probably someone I know.

806
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:39,480
Mom, don't be surprised when you get inside.

807
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:42,040
Do you have a surprise waiting for me?

808
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:45,200
I'm collecting paintings for an exhibition.

809
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:47,640
Paintings?

810
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,840
What you painted,

811
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,440
the Lee Sol pieces.

812
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:02,680
Probably??

813
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,280
my mother.

814
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,000
Strange, isn't it?

815
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:27,120
I don't remember the face of the person who painted it,

816
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:29,080
but I remember the painting.

817
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,000
So that's why you were looking at the painting??

818
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,040
I'm alright.

819
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,280
You're not.

820
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,080
Even if you insist you're alright,

821
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,040
you're not alright in here.

822
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,120
Because there's no way you can be.

823
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,800
