00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,040
You'll bring negative energy.

4
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,920
Mom, fortune-telling is supposed to be done at night.

5
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,800
What spirits are active at dawn?

6
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,600
You know nothing.

7
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,320
You get the best results when the teller's mind is clear

8
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,120
and you're her first customer.

9
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,560
I heard she got possessed on a trip to France.

10
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,000
By the spirit of a duchess!

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,640
And because she's a duchess, she takes your outfit seriously.

12
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,080
What was that word again?

13
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,080
Dress code?

14
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,360
Yes, that.

15
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,160
Once she's in touch with the spiritual world,

16
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,280
she'll start speaking in French, so pay attention.

17
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,520
- Mother. - Yes?

18
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,360
What, me?

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,040
- Who else? - What, French?

20
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,320
French??

21
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,960
Your daughter's marriage. Doubtful.

22
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,400
Your daughter is very promiscuous.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,040
Promiscuous?

24
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,520
I've been wishing her to be so my whole life.

25
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,160
Your daughter's man's hair is yellow, blue and pink.

26
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,440
Your daughter falls for a foreigner.

27
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,160
Love. Lucky.

28

(Episode 7: Fan girls use all of their luck in love to fangirl)

29
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,120
We don't even know the security code,

30
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,000
so why bother to bring her food?

31
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,920
What is the world coming to?

32
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,800
- This is the latest trend. - Jeez!

33
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,400
I told you to warn me before you start talking.

34
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,920
It's the trend nowadays to respect your children's privacy.

35
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,720
That means we're sophisticated parents!

36
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,840
Ha! If we get any more sophisticated,

37
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,440
we won't be able to share a table with our children.

38
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,800
Then again, all the mothers I know who know the passcode to

39
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,200
their children's places are now practically the maids.

40
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,160
Ugh, it's obvious her place is a pigsty.

41
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,800
It's better off I don't see it for real.

42
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,880
It wasn't something to get angry at you about.

43
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,280
I just didn't expect to find you there.

44
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,600
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,120
Are you...

46
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,120
very angry?

47
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,120
Yes.

48
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,080
But??

49
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,320
I'm sorry, too.

50
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,640
For entering without your permission.

51
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,120
Hyo-jin was behind you.

52
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,280
Curator Sung?

53
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,160
Yes?

54
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,000
- Sung Duk-mi. - Yes?

55
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,360
Mom!

56
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,360
Your??mother?

57
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,000
Duk-mi!

58
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,480
I'm so proud of you, my dear daughter.

59
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,360
About what?

60
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,560
It's nice to meet you. I'm the director of Cheum??

61
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,000
Do you love my Duk-mi?

62
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,760
Mom, what are you saying? He's my boss!

63
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,560
He takes you home,

64
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,160
and he's kissing you where it's wide open.

65
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,800
Kiss who?

66
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,240
So you must love her.

67
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,720
No, uh??Curator Sung Duk-mi and I are both at

68
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,760
the same museum, and??

69
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,120
Is that how you two fell for each other? While at work?

70
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,800
No, uh??We didn't fall for each other??

71
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,920
Did you have dinner?

72
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,680
No, uh??Dinner?

73
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,800
You shouldn't skip your meals!

74
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,960
Do you have any rice at home?

75
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,360
Home? As in my place?

76
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,000
No, I don't.

77
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,560
I guess we can't help it, then. Let's go.

78
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,120
- Where?? - Go where?

79
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,800
You said you don't have any rice at your place.

80
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,160
You shouldn't send him off on an empty stomach, now!

81
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,080
Mom! There's nothing between Director Gold and??

82
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,680
Yes, yes.

83
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,200
Let's go. We've plenty of rice and other food at our place.

84
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,400
Come on, let's go.

85
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,160
Mom! Go where?

86
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,000
No wonder I suddenly felt like cooking chicken soup.

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,160
I guess it was all to meet you, Director.

88
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,400
Are you alright with brood hen?

89
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,880
Chicken?

90
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,200
Yes, I like chicken.

91
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,520
Let's go!

92
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,840
- What chicken? - Curator Sung??

93
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,520
Mom!

94
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,040
Mom! Are you crazy?

95
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
Mom!

96
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,400
Uh??Is there anything I can help you with?

97
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,040
Help me? Please!

98
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,040
You're our guest, so just have a seat.

99
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,400
This is uncomfortable for him, that's why. So let's just??

100
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,680
- Honey. - Yes?

101
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,720
I guess you're making him uncomfortable.

102
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,000
Go out, and come back in about ten??

103
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,800
Oh no, not at all!

104
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,960
I'm perfectly fine.

105
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,720
I won't be long.

106
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,280
I guess you collect viewing stone, or art stones.

107
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,760
It's a great hobby.

108
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,080
Great hobby? Please.

109
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,560
I'm worried that our house will collapse.

110
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,040
This is how to view them best,

111
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,680
to really appreciate the beauty of nature within the rocks.

112
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,160
Do you collect them yourself?

113
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,680
Of course.

114
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,120
I go to all the places that produce fine stones.

115
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,360
- And this is??- Dinner's ready.

116
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:01,000
These stones capture the essence of nature in their form,

117
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,080
and it's not just about their cut that's important,

118
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,520
but their display too, that's important in the art.

119
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,760
Is he about to do a 10 years' worth of talking today?

120
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,680
Why's he suddenly getting all excited?

121
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,040
Oh, hurry up!

122
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,880
This is called a suban, where the stones are rested.

123
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,840
And this detail's like a pedestal, and this, a crane's head.

124
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,160
With those kinds of images in mind, you??

125
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,920
What did you say your name was?

126
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,040
Na Yi-eon?

127
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,040
Ryan Gold.

128
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,680
- You're from abroad? - Mom.

129
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,880
Yes.

130
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,520
Your daughter. Falls for a foreigner.

131
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,080
Coming. Love. Lucky.

132
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,040
Do you want more rice?

133
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,080
I was told it's etiquette to eat as much as you can

134
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,400
when you're invited, so I had more than enough.

135
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,080
- I see. I??- Uh??

136
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,160
I really like how you eat so well.

137
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,040
Mom, then we'll get??

138
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,200
You can't just leave straight away.

139
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,040
Of course not.

140
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,800
I've more stones to show you.

141
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,000
There are these stones with intricate patterns, and??

142
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,360
You need to have dessert.

143
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,280
That's quite alright. You don't have to??

144
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,520
No, it's that I want dessert.

145
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,440
So, uh??

146
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,880
Why don't you take him to your room and have a chat?

147
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,120
Where? Mom!

148
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,800
I'll call you once it's ready, so don't come out until then!

149
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,800
Mom!

150
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,360
I'm sorry.

151
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,800
It's fine.

152
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,080
I'm sorry.

153
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,880
You're the slowest man in the world,

154
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,000
so why are you up and moving today? It's not helping!

155
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,360
Just let them be for a while.

(Art Competition)

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,520
(Certificate of Excellence/ Grand Prize)

158
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,760
Why did you give up on art?

159
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,080
My dad may be at home wiping stones all day now,

160
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,920
but he was once an aspiring businessman.

161
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,080
It was around the time when I was to go study abroad,

162
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,640
But he got into big trouble,

163
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,720
and almost had us on the streets.

164
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,560
Mom told me to just go and not worry about them,

165
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,520
but how can I do that?

166
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,000
It was obvious we'd be separated if I did that.

167
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,440
So I gave up.

168
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,040
If I had gone to study abroad though,

169
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,160
you'd have met me, not as a curator,

170
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,000
but as an artist.

171
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,720
A sensitive and neurotic artist like Ryan Gold.

172
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,120
Are you alright with that?

173
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,680
Not living a life as an artist?

174
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,120
I just have a cry now and then.

175
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,880
When regret sweeps over me,

176
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,560
I just have a ton to drink,

177
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,080
then cry. Then it gets better.

178
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,200
Then I find myself with things to laugh about again,

179
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,040
and then I feel happy again.

180
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,000
Goodness me??

181
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,840
Why, that Sung Duk-mi??

182
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,240
- Huh? - Ed. Nam?

183
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,920
What brings you here, without a word?

184
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,080
Duk-mi's home, and??

185
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,400
Duk-mi? She's home?

186
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,200
Yes.

187
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,480
She should have told me she was coming.

188
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,920
So what about her? Why?

189
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,520
And she brought the Director home!

190
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,560
She brought the Lion?

191
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,800
- To our house? - Yes.

192
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,000
Is she out of her mind?

193
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,960
Move! I'm here!

194
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,800
You should stay longer.

195
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,600
Hey. How did you two come here together?

196
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,640
We met on the ground floor.

197
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,360
So, is our guest leaving already?

198
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,400
Yes, I kept him for too long.

199
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,880
Oh goodness me. I almost forgot.

200
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,880
Don't leave just yet, but give me one minute.

201
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,160
W-wait.

202
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,160
Hello, I'm Nam Se-yeon, editor at 'Moment,'

203
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,000
which is an art magazine.

204
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,920
Oh.

205
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,600
I'm Ryan Gold, at the Cheum Museum of Art.

206
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,680
You're here to request an interview, huh?

207
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,120
I was planning to visit you at the museum someday,

208
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,560
so when I heard you were here, I came over in a rush.

209
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,080
I'm not saying this because she's a close acquaintance,

210
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,480
but her company produces excellent art magazines

211
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,160
which are now rare in Korea. So do give it some thought.

212
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,240
I will.

213
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,080
I'll consider it in a positive light.

214
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,280
Thank you, Director.

215
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,080
Um, I packed some of the foods you seemed to enjoy.

216
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,400
Oh, thank??

217
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,680
T-thank you for the food.

218
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,200
Then we'll get going.

219
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,840
- "We?" - Thank you for today.

220
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,200
Director, please visit us again.

221
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,520
Go.

222
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,120
- I'll be in touch. - Sure.

223
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,880
Mom, I'm hungry!

224
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,480
What? You didn't have anything to eat?

225
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,040
Young-sook, I told you to stop feeding him.

226
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,080
Goodbye.

227
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,480
Do come visit us again.

228
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,800
I'm sorry, I didn't expect my parents to invite you.

229
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,280
It was awkward, right?

230
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,720
To say it was awkward??

231
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,040
I ate too much, didn't I?

232
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,040
Right, you sure ate a lot.

233
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,680
Once again, I apologize.

234
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,080
I'm truly sorry.

235
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,080
Alright.

236
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,000
And??

237
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,800
thanks for today.

238
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,360
Have a safe drive.

239
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,560
Director, Director??

240
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,800
Please. Like he's the only director around. Ha!

241
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,080
What are you doing here?

242
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,160
Everyone's waiting at home to congratulate you.

243
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,880
Congratulate me? For what?

244
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,080
It's not like I won gold.

245
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,040
Oh, so a silver medal no longer gets you excited, huh?

246
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,680
I was sure I was going to win gold this time.

247
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,080
This is all because of my name.

248
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,760
The "Eun" in Eun-ki means silver! Why not Keum-ki instead?

249
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,880
Keum-ki?

250
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,720
That doesn't sound bad at all.

251
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,000
Hey, I'll call you Nam Keum-ki from now on, then.

252
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,760
Nam Keum-ki. How about that?

253
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,200
Hey, Nam Keum-ki!

254
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,800
Hey, don't call it with my full name.

255
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,840
It sounds a bit weird.

256
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,600
Why? It's a perfect fit for you.

257
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,600
Nam Keum-ki. Hey, Nam Keum-ki!

258
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,040
Ugh.

259
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:42,960
Here.

260
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,360
What, a gold medal?

261
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,480
It's chocolate. Go on.

262
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,560
You know something?

263
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,560
No.

264
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,120
Gold Medalist: Nam Keum-ki.

265
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,400
Are you out of your mind?

266
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,480
As long as you keep winning these,

267
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,160
you'll be the number one judo athlete I know.

268
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,640
To me, you're the best and the most awesome

269
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,160
judo athlete out there.

270
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,400
Well done.

271
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,320
So let's go and have dinner, Keum-ki.

272
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,120
Come on, let's eat!

273
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,760
- Please. - Let's go!

274
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,600
Food that Keum-ki loves!

275
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,760
Don't call me that.

276
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,640
Hey, if you're so sick and tired of silver medals,

277
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,080
can I sell one?

278
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,200
I'm short on money for the concert ticket.

279
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,280
- No. - Why not?

280
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,680
- I said, no. - Why not?

281
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,240
- Because it's mine. - You said you're tired of it.

282
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,120
Cheap bastard.

283
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,000
You said you've a ton! Give one to me.

284
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,280
Lift it up properly, like a man.

285
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,200
Then we'll get going.

286
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,720
- "We?" - Thank you for today.

287
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,240
What did she pack for me, anyway?

288
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,720
(Stir-fried anchovies/ Perilla leaves)

289
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,440
Freeze the bulgogi and heat it up later.

290
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,960
I saw that you like unripe kimchi,

291
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,360
so I packed some.

292
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,200
Once you finish them, tell me.

293
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,400
This gwantongseok with a tunnel will bring

294
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,960
great luck on your way.

295
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,200
I hope all goes well for you, Director Gold.

296
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,200
I thought it was as heavy as a rock,

297
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,000
and they really did pack me a real rock.

298
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,840
Congratulations on becoming a VVIP member on T.R.T.S.

299
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
What are you doing?

300
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,440
This is your hand, not his lips!

301
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,080
Why did you get lost in the mood?

302
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,120
You should've been all, 'What are you doing?'

303
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,840
You're so honest with your instincts.

304
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,040
I'm so embarrassed!

305
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:46,120
Will I find complete happiness?

306
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:52,160
How much more do I have to endure...

307
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,960
Hey, you're still up?

308
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,920
Yes, I was waiting for you, honey.

309
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,280
Why wait? You must be tired, too.

310
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,640
- Do you want some beer? - Sure.

311
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:24,200
So, what about that transfer?

312
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,080
Well.

313
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,600
They promised to transfer me

314
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,000
once I do a good job with this one show.

315
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,080
- Really? - Yes.

316
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,120
What's this show about?

317
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,280
Oh, that?

318
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,920
Well, uh??

319
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,960
Don't tell me??

320
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,800
It's not about pseudo-religion, is it?

321
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,760
Huh? No, it's not about pseudo-religion.

322
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,080
But it's??

323
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,080
We're interviewing people who are living their life to the fullest.

324
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,040
Oh, then that's okay. As long as it's not about pseudo-religion.

325
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,720
Right?

326
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,480
As long as it's not about pseudo-religion.

327
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,880
Pseudo-religion is a big no.

328
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,840
Right, a pseudo-religion is a big no. Ugh!

329
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,160
Mom??

330
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,360
Gun-woo.

331
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,280
You're in your dreamland.

332
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,640
You're not awake right now.

333
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,080
So let's go. I'm an angel who looks just like your mom.

334
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,680
(Here's a photo of Si-an)

335
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,360
His smile is just too cute.

336
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,680
That sharp jawline of his just stands out.

337
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,120
A fan girl who's just started out, maybe?

338
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,280
This is an excellent photo that used a radial filter to

339
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,280
maximize exposure to make up for the inadequate lighting,

340
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,040
while putting the focus on the subject's expression

341
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,520
that was captured in that perfect moment

342
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,760
with a medium shot, to tell a story about him.

343
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,640
Latte knows a thing or two about photos.

344
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,120
(Cheum Museum of Art)

345
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,440
Thank you, Latte.

346
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,560
I welcome all compliments and advice.

347
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,040
Ms. Kim Hyo-jin.

348
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,280
What is it?

349
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,160
There's no need for you to come into work anymore.

350
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,320
You're fired.

351
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,080
Fired? Why?

352
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,880
If you don't like that, then how about being sued?

353
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,160
Choose. Will it be the pink slip, or a lawsuit?

354
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,160
Sue me for what?

355
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,560
Stalking.

356
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,160
You saw me last night, didn't you? Near Curator Sung's place.

357
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,160
I think you got the wrong person.

358
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,720
I found something interesting on social media.

359
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,040
"CU-patch."

360
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,280
- What is that? - Someone I'll be suing.

361
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,520
What? Why sue just me?

362
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,760
So you admit, do you?

363
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,280
Why not sue T.R.T.S. as well, then?

364
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,080
She's the same in that she stalked you, too.

365
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,560
There's something between you and T.R.T.S., isn't there?

366
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,120
Alright, I'll sue both of you.

367
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,040
I'll delete it.

368
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,400
I'll be watching you.

369
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,800
Oh my gosh!

370
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,080
(List of fans who are invited to Cha Si-an's autograph signing)

371
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,360
- Oh my gosh. - Oh my gosh.

372
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,840
Is something wrong?

373
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,520
It's an invitation to Si-an's autograph signing event.

374
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,760
Congratulations.

375
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,040
It's obvious I'm going, duh.

376
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,320
I mean, T.R.T.S.

377
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,200
(The Road to Si-an)

378
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,000
I'd posted on my social media that I gave up on this event

379
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,320
and just bought album.

380
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,240
But you've been chosen!

381
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,880
- This is??- It's destiny, that's what it is.

382
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,000
I bought a whole box to go to this event,

383
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,080
and she bought just one CD to get a ticket?

384
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,320
I bet she'll go on about how she and Si-an are meant to be.

385
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,160
When is this event?

386
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,560
On our museum's day off next week.

387
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,400
Don't worry, I'm not planning to skip work for this.

388
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,440
So T.R.T.S. will be there, will she?

389
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,600
That Duchess was spot on.

390
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,120
She told me Duk-mi will bring home Tom or Jack,

391
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,320
and she brought home Ryan!

392
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,480
We need to learn English if we're going to meet our in-laws.

393
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,880
Do it with me.

394
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:32,720
- Son-in-law. - Son-in-law.

395
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,120
- My son-in-law. - My son-in-law.

396
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,240
- Si-an. - Son-in-law.

397
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,480
Si-an?

398
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,440
- My son-in-law. - My son-in-law.

399
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,320
- Son-in-law. - Son-in-law.

400
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,720
- My son-in-law. - My son-in-law.

401
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,320
Congratulations, Duk-mi!

402
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,080
It's all thanks to you.

403
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,880
- My son-in-law. - My son-in-law.

404
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,640
Si-an??Si-an!

405
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,840
- My son-in-law. - My son-in-law.

406
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,000
One, two, three, four,

407
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,040
five, six, seven, eight.

408
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,120
Two, two, three, four,

409
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,120
five, six, seven??

410
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,440
One, two, three!

411
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,960
All rise!

412
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,720
Attention! Address the Director.

413
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,480
(Softness overcomes hardness)

414
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,240
It's strange.

415
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,240
I never liked children before I had my own.

416
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,240
Why is my son such a darling?

417
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,880
Did cooing over idols lead to cooing over my son?

418
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,760
Or am I cooing over my son because I no longer have

419
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,480
the time to coo over idols anymore?

420
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,360
Sun-joo.

421
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,600
How'd you get married?

422
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,520
Because I got pregnant.

423
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,160
No!

424
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,960
I mean, how did you start dating your husband?

425
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,960
And not some idol.

426
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,680
When I'd realized it, I had fallen for him already.

427
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,080
- What, not some idol? - No.

428
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,120
When I liked idols, my idol was my boyfriend,

429
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,720
and when I was dating,

430
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,520
my boyfriend was my idol.

431
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,360
At least that's how it was for me, back then.

432
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,080
Do you think it'll be the case for Duk-mi?

433
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,680
Will she fall in love, before she realizes it?

434
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,400
- Not with some idol, but??- With the Lion?

435
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,080
Does it bother you?

436
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,760
That Duk-mi might fall for the Lion?

437
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,320
What are you talking about? Jeez.

438
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,160
Guys, no fighting!

439
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,160
No fighting! Play nicely.

440
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,040
Come on, play nicely.

441
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,360
Tsk, that Eun-ki idiot.

442
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,880
You're the biggest idiot in the world!

443
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,800
Gun-woo!

444
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,320
It's Mommy!

445
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,800
Okay! There's more.

446
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,000
That's right. Thank you!

447
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,960
Secretary Kim.

448
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,480
The next time you're here,

449
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,080
inform me at least three hours beforehand.

450
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,880
I don't want you intruding on us

451
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,040
unannounced, like today.

452
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,280
Mr. Gold.

453
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,760
I'm Eom So-hye!

454
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,120
Are you telling me to get your permission to

455
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,000
visit my museum?

456
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,120
So you admit you tried to privatize this museum?

457
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,080
Oh my God!

458
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,120
Don't put it like that.

459
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,280
I detest words like confession, questioning, and arrest!

460
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,040
Director Eom, we're in a meeting right now.

461
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,520
I'm an extremely busy person as well!

462
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,840
I have to deliver snacks for my darling Hyo-jin,

463
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,400
and deliver food for

464
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,160
my husband every day, who's in prison.

465
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,040
It's really hard, you know.

466
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,440
Cu. Sung.

467
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,960
What are you doing on our next day off?

468
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,600
When the museum's next closed?

469
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,800
That's when Si-an's autograph signing is.

470
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,360
Why do you ask?

471
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,680
I've made some new friends from

472
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,240
W-O-J-E.

473
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,360
Short for Wives of the Outlaws of Justice and the Economy.

474
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:20,680
And they'd like to visit the museum when it's quiet.

475
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,680
Will you be our docent and guide us?

476
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,760
You will, right?

477
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,680
Alright.

478
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,360
Okay, I'll see you next Monday, then.

479
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,800
Curator Sung won't be free.

480
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,320
If you want to visit when it's still quiet,

481
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,160
come right at our opening time.

482
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,320
Are you two dating?

483
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,000
This is why office dating is a big no.

484
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,880
You're ruining the mood for all of us.

485
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,680
So you know that everyone's mood has been ruined.

486
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,040
I hope you realize who we all owe it to, too.

487
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,600
You're mad, aren't you?

488
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,680
Because you won't be able to see her then.

489
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:04,040
Director Gold has a meeting with Mr. Cha Si-an that day.

490
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,680
It's not because of his private schedule.

491
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,440
Oh, is that right?

492
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,280
I'd like to participate in many things as I can.

493
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,080
May I also go to that meeting?

494
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,440
Hyo-jin?

495
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,080
Ms. Kim Hyo-jin.

496
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,520
Are you free that day?

497
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,520
Yes.

498
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,400
Great.

499
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,040
Then you'll be the docent on that day, next week.

500
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,160
For your mother and for the members of WOJE.

501
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,360
Director!

502
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,960
Hyo-jin, you'll be our docent?

503
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,080
If you will, your Mom will be so happy!

504
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,680
Make me proud, alright?

505
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,960
I'm so happy!

506
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,560
- But Mother??- Take care, everyone! Bye!

507
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,640
Now that I think about it, I've another appointment??

508
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,440
- Mother! - Yay, I'm so excited!

509
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,040
- She's so hilarious. - Wow.

510
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,880
Thank you, Director.

511
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,920
It's nothing, Curator Sung.

512
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:17,120
First of all, Cha Si-an??Three of Lee Sol's works.

513
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,000
And with Mr. Roh Seok, that's??

514
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,080
That's thirty??No, thirty-one in total.

515
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,600
Did you measure their actual sizes?

516
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,240
Oh, Director Gold told me to do that

517
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,000
after the contracts are signed.

518
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,880
By the way, wasn't Director Gold pretty awesome just now?

519
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,840
Just now?

520
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,160
How?

521
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,960
Just now, when he shut up Director Eom with that punch.

522
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,640
Do you find that charming? Well, I don't know.

523
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,080
Director Gold and Curator Sung never made a show of

524
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,560
their relationship until now,

525
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,600
but just then, he couldn't make it any more obvious!

526
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,120
I thought he was cool.

527
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,080
Well??

528
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,080
What??

529
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,640
What did you just say?

530
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,120
We're still awaiting confirmation,

531
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,040
but we're expecting about five to seven participants,

532
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,280
and about fifty works in total from their collection.

533
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,000
It'll all be up to how we categorize the works,

534
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,920
and how we go about our concept.

535
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,640
Should we group them by collector or theme?

536
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,680
You're early.

537
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,040
We'll finish up here.

538
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,480
Alright, I'll leave you to it.

539
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,440
I'm Choi Da-in.

540
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,400
I didn't introduce myself properly last time.

541
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I'm Sung Duk-mi, curator at Cheum.

542
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,720
Nice to meet you.

543
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,400
What about the atelier? Did you settle on one?

544
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,360
Are you in a relationship?

545
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,280
I heard you are, with Ms. Sung Duk-mi.

546
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,760
So it's true?

547
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,720
I don't see why I should answer that question.

548
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,120
Ha??So you won't deny it.

549
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,600
Let's have dinner next time.

550
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,520
I'm off.

551
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,440
Hey, Choi Da-in!

552
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,000
I missed you, Ryan.

553
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,520
Choi Da-in??Da-in.

554
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,080
Why does her name have to be pretty as well?

555
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,560
When I'm just Duk-mi.

556
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,200
- Sun-joo. - Yes?

557
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,040
A hug is just a way of saying hello in the U.S., right?

558
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,840
You know, like between friends.

559
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,160
Not just hugs.

560
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,680
Rubbing cheeks and kissing also counts as a hello.

561
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,840
Right?

562
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,520
Hey! How does a kiss count as a hello?

563
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,000
That's something special.

564
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,360
Ju Hyuk, why are you wearing that on your head?

565
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,960
I'm not sure why I'm wearing this either.

566
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,040
Will you ask my master for me?

567
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,160
"Master?"

568
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,960
Sun-joo, did you make him wear it?

569
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,160
He looks so cute, right?

570
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,560
Ju Hyuk!

571
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,720
Go make yourself some tea that's good for your throat. Anything.

572
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,040
Man, what's wrong with her?

573
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,040
- What? - This is abuse of power.

574
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,120
- It's fangirling. - It's abuse of power.

575
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,200
This is healthy fangirling.

576
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,080
- Does he look healthy to you? - Yes.

577
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,560
He's all pale!

578
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,160
- You think so? - Poor thing.

579
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,120
Choi Da-in.

580
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,160
Choi Da-in, come on out.

581
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,120
What do you think?

582
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,640
It's my first work in Korea.

583
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,480
So you really are in a slump.

584
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,840
You're just too honest sometimes.

585
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,480
I'd love you more if you'd lie from time to time.

586
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,680
Where did you even get this?

587
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,960
You said you got a girlfriend,

588
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,720
so I couldn't just pass it over.

589
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,680
It's my gift to you.

590
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,360
Hop in. I'll drop you off.

(Eun-ki Bastard)

592
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,080
- Yes, what? - What are you doing today?

593
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,680
I'm off to Si-an's autograph signing.

594
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,160
I knew it!

595
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,040
Idols are your life, right? Fangirling is the best, huh?

596
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,040
Of course.

597
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:09,400
When I liked idols, my idol was my boyfriend,

598
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,080
and when I was dating,

599
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,920
my boyfriend was my idol.

600
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,160
- Sung Duk-mi. - Yeah?

601
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,000
How about a movie in a long while after that?

602
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,360
After the autograph signing event?

603
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,600
Hey, don't you know I've tons to do after that?

604
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,160
I have to upload a review, select photos, photoshop??

605
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,080
What movie?

606
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,880
Hey, you can photoshop later!

607
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,160
Photoshopping is love.

608
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,400
You have to do it right after you take photos.

609
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,200
Hey, is Cha Si-an more precious to you than your friend?

610
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,840
Eun-ki, you're second most precious after Si-an.

611
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,680
So stay in your tent, because it's a dangerous world outside.

612
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,840
- I'm hanging up. - Duk-mi.

613
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,200
Sung??Sung Duk-mi!

00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,120
I'm so happy for you that you're going to the event.

620
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,480
As always, I'll be looking forward to your excellent photos.

621
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,720
I will capture vivid shots of Si-an for you,

622
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,320
so you'll feel like you're seeing him up close.

623
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,120
Something's definitely up.

624
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,800
I'm going to ask T.R.T.S. myself.

625
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,040
Huh? Director?

626
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,560
Are they meeting up near here?

Hello, everyone!

Hello everyone, it's nice to meet you.

631

- Did you wait long? - Yes!

632
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,720
Me too, me too!

633
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,680
- Shall we call him out, then? - Yes!

Let's call him up on stage.

637

Please come on out!

638
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Oh my gosh!

Wow! Hello, Si-an.

Gosh, Si-an.

Everyone, you all want to hear his voice, right?

645

Yes!

646
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:43,120
But before that, you know that we have a lucky draw, right?

647

Yes!

648
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,200
That? right.

649
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,520
Then I'll ask Si-an to draw our lucky winners.

650
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,040
But before that, please say hello to your fans.

Yes. Hello, everyone.

also making me nervous.

00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,080
Thank you.

659
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,080
I'll start with third prize.

660
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:18,040
Alright, then please come up to the box.

661
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,120
Please draw each winner, one by one.

662
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,640
First off, third prize.

663
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,600
Hey!

664
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,040
Number 23.

665
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,160
Where are you, number 23?

666
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,400
We've a book voucher for you. Congratulations!

667
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,880
As for the second prize, it'll be a photo card!

668
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,280
Who will be the lucky winner of the photo card?

669
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,800
- Please draw a number. - Sure.

670
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,520
Number 8.

671
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,520
Number 8!

672
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,720
Ah! Congratulations. You're our lucky winner!

673
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,200
Oh, no. Please sit down. Yes, that's right.

674
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,160
As for our winners of second and third prizes,

675
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,120
please collect them after the event.

676
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:00,160
Now, as for the first prize!

677
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,000
A selfie with Cha Si-an is up for grabs!

678
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:08,000
You know, I entered my name for this, too.

679
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,520
Alright, then??

680
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,200
Is it the camera, or the subject that's great?

681
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,360
Please draw a number!

682
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,840
Sorry? I didn't hear that. One more time, please.

683
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,040
Number 17.

684
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,520
Number 17! Where are you?

685
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,320
Number 17. Number??

686
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,520
Number 17. Seventeen!

687
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,600
Congratulations.

688
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,920
You've just won a selfie with Cha Si-an!

689
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,240
Please come on up.

690
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,240
Eh??Oh my gosh!

691
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,640
A selfie?

692
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,360
Come to the front.

693
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,680
Come on up.

694
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,600
Si-an, please stand in front, too.

695
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,360
Um??For the selfie, you should take off your mask.

696
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,080
Take it off.

697
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,040
No.

698
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,560
You need to take this selfie

699
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,600
before Si-an can start giving out autographs.

700
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,760
Oh what?

701
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,080
I'll just take it like this.

702
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,600
You're awesome, Cha Si-an.

703
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,200
You need to hang this up on your wall, yes!

704
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,680
Congratulations!

705
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,440
And here's Kong, another special gift for you.

706
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,840
Congratulations!

707
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,720
She has tears in her eyes.

708
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,160
Don't cry now.

709
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,720
Once again, congratulations.

710
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,120
What?

711
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,600
You took a selfie with Si-an?

712
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,360
Yes, that's right.

713
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:31,440
Hey, that Duchess is something.

714
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,600
She said you'll have great luck on love, and she was spot on!

715
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,760
Are you saying that I've just used up all my luck?

716
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:39,760
What's this that I'm hearing? What more can you ask for?

717
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,640
Fan girls are supposed to use their luck on fangirling.

718
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,800
Here's the mint chocolate that you ordered.

719
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,880
Ah.

720
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,400
Thank you.

721
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,200
Just send me the review, so I can upload it online.

722
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,200
Alright.

723
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,360
T.R.T.S.?

724
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,000
What is it?

725
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:08,400
- Sindy's??- What about Sindy?

726
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,120
She just called for me.

727
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,000
T.R.T.S., I have a question.

728
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,280
Why would Sindy do that?

729
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,920
T.R.T.S.! T.R.T.S.!

730
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,480
Duk-mi?

731
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,520
Duk-mi!

732
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,640
Oh no??

733
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,160
T.R.T.S.!

734
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,040
Why is she following me?

735
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,760
I've something to ask you!

736
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,400
Um??T.R.T.S??

737
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,640
Why's she doing this to me?

738
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,120
But, uh??

739
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,240
Ms. Kim Hyo-jin!

740
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,720
Ah, Director!

741
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,720
- T.R.T.S. is just??- What are you doing here?

742
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,000
Um, before that??

743
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,040
Over there!

744
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,080
Ugh! Because of you, I lost her?

745
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,120
"Lost her?" Lost who?

746
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,400
T.R.T.S.!

747
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,040
The one who took your pictures!

748
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:19,000
Oh, so that was T.R.T.S.

749
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,960
Damn, I almost had her??Ugh!

750
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,920
Gosh, that was really close.

751
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,720
Should I get started, then?

752
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,760
What am I doing?

753
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,360
Photoshopping is love.

754
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,600
Photoshopping is love!

755
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,760
What do I do??

756
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:01,680
(The Road to Si-an)

757
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,640
(T.R.T.S.'s chatroom)

758
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,960
Why isn't she here yet?

759
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,000
I've been waiting for this all day! Did something happen?

760
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,760
Ugh, this is frustrating.

761
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,480
Oh no. I lost out on the tickets again!

762
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,920
- No way. - I've been waiting for this.

763
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,160
Maybe T.R.T.S. didn't go to the autograph signing today?

764
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,720
But she literally hit the jackpot.

765
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,240
I'm sure she made time to go.

766
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,960
But where's her preview?

767
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:40,960
Did something happen to her?

768
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,400
Maybe something did happen.

769
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,080
No, no, no, no??

770
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,480
Hey, it must've been a legendary event.

771
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,640
But it's never taken this long for her to upload the photos.

772
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,360
No photos??

773
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,400
Come on, pick up.

774
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,800
Pick up, pick up, pick up!

775
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,200
Your call cannot be connected at this time.

776
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,920
Please leave a message after the tone.

777
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:19,000
She hasn't uploaded the photos, and she won't pick up.

778
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,880
No, no.

779
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,720
Maybe it's a yes?

780
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,560
Curator Sung.

781
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,360
Curator Sung?

782
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,760
Director, what brings you here?

783
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,120
I came to return this.

784
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,120
Oh.

785
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,800
Oh no! I'm so sorry!

786
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,040
I guess I'll have to wash it off.

787
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,320
- May I use the bathroom? - Sure.

788
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,120
No! You can't.

789
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,320
- I can't? - You can't.

790
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,120
Because??

791
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:33,240
My place is a mess. It's a pigsty.

792
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,080
Oh.

793
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,480
Then I guess I'll have to??

794
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,360
go home like this.

795
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,840
I guess we need to do something about that.

796
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,080
If it's okay with you??

797
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,240
- There's a door sill. - Oh, sure.

798
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,840
Alright, come on up this way.

799
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,520
Door sill. Alright!

800
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,640
Now, this way.

801
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:13,560
- Come through this way. - Uh, sure.

802
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,960
- Here, this way. - Alright.

803
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:16,800
Here.

804
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,080
- This is the bathroom. - Alright.

805
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,600
This way. Uh, no. This way.

806
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,040
- There's another step. - Uh, sure.

807
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,000
- Yes, be careful. - Ah.

808
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,920
Here?

809
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,760
Yes, that's it. That's the basin.

810
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,000
- I'll leave you to it, then. - Yes, alright.

811
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Remember to keep your eyes closed!

812
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,160
Uh??

813
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,120
Curator Sung?

814
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,160
Yes?

815
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,920
This is paint, so water won't rinse it off.

816
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,880
Do you have acetone, by any chance?

817
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,840
I do. But one moment!

818
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,520
Uh??You still have your eyes closed, right?

819
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,320
Don't ever open them!

820
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,120
- Alright. - I'm coming in.

821
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,240
This may be a bit uncomfortable, but please try to bear it.

822
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,120
Alright, now follow me.

823
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,080
This way.

824
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,440
I'll wipe your hand off with the acetone.

825
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,160
The sofa's right here. If you'll come this way.

826
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,280
By the way, Curator Sung.

827
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,440
Just how messy is your place?

828
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,280
You may faint from the shock.

829
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,160
Is it coming off?

830
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,200
Yes, it's coming off fine.

831
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,160
I could smell paint in your room.

832
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,720
Do you still paint these days?

833
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,160
From time to time.

834
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,120
I've been curious.

835
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,000
About what?

836
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:36,760
When you couldn't paint, because you broke your arm??

837
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,520
How did you endure it?

838
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,160
I endured it with my left hand.

839
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,000
Left hand?

840
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,800
I'm right-handed.

841
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,880
But because I couldn't use my right hand at all,

842
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,760
I started to paint with my left hand.

843
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,320
So you ended up painting as well as you did

844
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,760
with your right hand, is it?

845
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,360
No. I suck at painting with my left hand.

846
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,000
No, but it was fun.

847
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,720
Before then, I couldn't quite enjoy painting because

848
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,640
I felt pressured to produce good results each time.

849
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:27,680
But painting with my left hand was just so much fun.

850
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,600
It was like when I used to scribble on paper, as a child.

851
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,040
All done.

852
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,800
Thank you.

853
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,320
No, it was me who got the paint on you.

854
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,400
Now that I think about it,

855
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,400
it's a bit unfair.

856
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,440
What is?

857
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:55,720
You had a full tour around my place.

858
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:57,400
So why can't I?

859
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,400
Let's be fair, and let me see your place, too.

860
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,280
No, you can't!

861
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,600
I'm a great person,

862
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,520
so be confident.

863
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,600
I like you.

864
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:50,960
I choose you,

865
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,040
and you shall be blessed with a kiss.

866
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,120
From me.

867
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,120
(Her Private Life)

868
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,360
You want to continue this pretend relationship?

869
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,560
I'm scared that if I confess and he rejects,

870
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,320
we won't be able to go back, even as friends.

871
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:49,520
I want to work with Ryan, right next to him.

872
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,360
I like him, you see.

873
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:54,000
To tell you the truth, Director Gold??I??

874
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Sung Duk-mi!

875
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,680
Date a guy to whom you can tell him honestly

876
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:59,120
and with confidence, that you're a fan girl to the bone!

877
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:01,120
People would say you're being jealous.

878
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,800
When was I being jeal??

879
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:04,880
I like you.

880
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,080
I like you.
