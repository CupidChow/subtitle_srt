You're totally dressed for a date!

Well, you can say I'm doing both.

You're really open about this after dropping the bomb on us.

How should I return your notebook, T.R.T.S.?

I'll contact you later.

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,320
what's a nickname I'd never use?

No, no.

35
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,320
That wasn't a stanning accident. That was just an accident.

36
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,280
It's caught around the button??

00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,640

Gosh, it's hot in here.

Has the summer heat arrived already?

Be gone!

I'm losing my mind.

00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,080
I shouldn't have tagged along on that business trip.

Is it too humid out?

Ju Hyuk, is it raining outside?

53
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,640
It's not raining, and I'll have an iced mocha.

54
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,640
One sec.

55
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,920
- Where's Duk-mi? - Not here yet.

56
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,400
She's probably sleeping in after going on that business trip.

57
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,120
Wasn't it a one-day trip?

58
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,480
Huh?

Hi, Sun-joo. Hi, Eun-ki.

Iced americano for me.

What?

62
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,200
I heard your business trip with Lion was an overnight trip.

63
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,200
So?

64
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,680

How could a single woman go on an overnight trip with a??

66
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,400
Hey!

67
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,280
What do you take Director Gold for, huh?

68
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,560
Director Gold isn't that kind of person.

69
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,360
Even just now,

70
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,480
a motorbike BAM! rear-ended his car.

71
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,120
Oh my.

72
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,480
But he told the motorcyclist to just watch it next time,

73
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,640
and took him to the hospital!

74
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,840
Since when did you rate him so highly?

75
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,480
Wait, so tell us.

76
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,360
Nothing happened between you two?

77
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,840
No.

00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,120
Too bad.

Why isn't Ju Hyuk coming in?

80
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,440
I told you, Ju Hyuk's at the hospital.

81
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,680
- What? - What?

82
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,440
I told you. A motorcycle rear-ended Director Gold's car.

83
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,480
Oh, I didn't tell you that that was Ju Hyuk's bike?

84
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,520
What?

Ryan.

87
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,760
Ryan Gold.

88
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,200
Why is Ryan's name Ryan?

89
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,440
Gestaltzerfall!

90
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,720
Jeez, you scared me.

91
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,760
That's what this is, right?

92
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,560
- Gestaltzerfall. - Hallelujah!

93
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,960
That phenomenon when you repeat something

94
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,320
like "Ryan...Why is Ryan Ryan?"

95
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,200
and the name Ryan becomes more and more unfamiliar.

96
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,960
Right now, the name Ryan

97
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,200
feels very unfamiliar, right?

98
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,640
It's not like that.

99
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,160
But why do you two look so tired? Did you pull an all-nighter?

100
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,200
We were told to reorganize all the works in our collection

101
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,160
according to ISO standards. That Ryan guy ordered us to.

102
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,840
And right when we're already busy preparing for the exhibition.

103
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,760
We've always said we should find a day to do just that.

104
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,280
So Director Gold knows exactly what needs to be done.

105
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,920
It may be hard for us now, but I'm sure in the long run,

106
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,280
things will be much easier for us.

107
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,640
Easier? How?

108
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,640
Now that you're dating the Director,

109
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,120
- we can't vent about him. - Nope.

110
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,720
And we can't order the intern around

111
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,000
because she's Director Eom's daughter.

112
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,120
I think work is harder now than when Director Eom was our boss.

113
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,160
I see.

114
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,560
Well, don't let that get to you. Vent all you want,

115
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,080
and let's shower Hyo-jin with work, too.

116
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,080
We would, if she were here.

117
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,440
- She's not here? - Good morning.

118
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,480
- Ms. Kim Hyo-jin. - Yes?

119
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,600
What time do you think it is now, and you're just getting here?

120
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,960
Are we going to have a group dinner? Like, to welcome me?

121
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,040
Ms. Kim Hyo-jin!

122
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,920
Now's not the time to??

123
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,600
How does barbecue paid for by my mom sound?

124
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,240
I'm in! Definitely in!

125
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,880
Then let's all go for dinner tonight, with my mom's card.

126
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,320
Oh yeah.

127
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,680
You all know that I'm Director Eom's daughter, don't you?

128
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,080
- Yes. - Yes.

129
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,200
Mom said to keep it a secret,

130
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,080
but there's no such thing as a secret in this world.

131
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,080
Isn't that so, Curator Sung?

132
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,800
Here's your iced americano.

133
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,960
Thank you.

134
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,760
Ju Hyuk, just go home.

135
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,200
I know the doctors said you were fine,

136
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,880
but it must hurt, since you fell off your bike.

137
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,360
Don't make me a heartless manager. Go get some rest.

138
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
Ju Hyuk?

139
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,160
Ms. Lee.

140
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,440
Yes?

141
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,080
Are you rich?

142
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,080
I'd say I'm richer than you.

143
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,640
Then I'll be your slave.

144
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,600
Will you?

145
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,360
How much will do for you?

146
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,760
- 750 dollars. - 750 dollars?

147
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,880
750 dollars? What's the 750 dollars for?

148
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,400
Dude, I wouldn't even buy a vacuum for 750-dollars.

149
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,160
Then??760 dollars?

150
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,680
760 dollars?

151
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,840
I thought Director Gold said he wouldn't ask you to

152
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,120
pay for the damages. And that he paid all your hospital bills.

153
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,960
So why do you need that money?

Test?

157
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,520
Please send the notebook to my PO box.

158
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,800
I'm extremely busy,

159
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,080
so I may not be able to go to the post office for a while.

160

If you need it urgently, come pick it up in person.

Yoo-sub.

163
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
Director.

164
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,920
Are you very busy?

165
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,840
You're suddenly curious?

166
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,560
Oh??I meant to say that you're off to a busy start.

167
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,120
There was that accident, and you had to go to the hospital??

168
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,960
No kidding. It's been an unusually busy day today.

169
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,120
So I was thinking, if there is anything I can help you with,

170
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,160
tell me as soon as it comes up. For example,

171
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,160
going to the bank, running an errand,

172
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,800
or going to the post office.

173
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,760
Ah, that's right.

174
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,640
Now that you mention it, I needed to go to the post office.

175
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,360
Really? I'll go instead.

176
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,120
Mr. Cha Si-an??

177
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,320
Mr. Cha Si-an?

178
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,840
Yes, he said he'd be coming to the museum today.

179
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,840
Right now?

180
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,080
It looks like it.

181
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,120
So when will you go to the post office for me?

182
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,600
Um??I should first finish up what I was doing, right?

183
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,640
Next time.

184
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,160
Yes, Mr. Cha Si-an.

185
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,160
Brother!

186
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,560
The museum??

187
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,640
I was wondering if I should be present, as the curator-in-charge.

188
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,240
Then please excuse me.

189
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,320
The museum??

190
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,840
Would you like some coffee?

191
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,040
- One moment. - Sure.

192
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,440
- I apologize. - That's alright.

193
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,840
Then??Please go on.

194
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,360
I wanted to know which other celebrities were participating.

195
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,640
I can ask about that, right?

196
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,160
Confirmed so far are you, novelist Mr. Roh Seok,

197
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,000
movie director Moon Seok-cheon,

198
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,160
and ballerina Ms. Oh Hyang. You know her, don't you?

199
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,840
We're also in talks with three international celebs.

200
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,280
You didn't invite me purely for marketing purposes, did you?

201
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,440
I don't want to play second fiddle.

202
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,880
Of course not, no.

203
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,920
Then I can be a little ambitious, right?

204
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,240
I thought it might be boring with just the paintings.

205
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,640
How about collaborating with a visual artist?

206
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,360
Do you have someone in mind?

207
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,480
There's an artist I'm working with right now.

208
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,000
Through my single album and this exhibition??

209
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,040
I want to present one unified perspective.

210
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,360
Does that sound strange to you?

211
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,880
No.

212
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,520
In fact, I'm now more excited because I have a feeling

213
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,720
this exhibition will be very original and fresh.

214
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,400
Then let's discuss the exhibition concepts

215
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,440
with that artist you mentioned.

216
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,160
Please give me the artist's contact details.

217
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,320
I will, along with the artist's profile.

218
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,560
Since we're here, may I have a tour?

219
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,920
- Let's go, then. - Sure.

220
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,480
I'm your fan, oppa.

221
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,600
- You're so handsome! - Thank you.

222
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,760
"What turned out to be fate when we thought it was coincidence,

223
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,120
and what turned out to be a mere coincidence

224
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,360
when we believed it to be fate??

225
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,760
Wow, I really like this.

226
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,920
Who wrote this?

227
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,560
I??

228
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,080
My mother's touch lies in every corner of this museum.

229
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,240
Oh, but it's a secret that I'm the former Director's daughter.

230
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,000
- Are you Cha Si-an? - Yes.

231
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,760
Can I get a picture with you, please?

232
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,400
Photography is not allowed inside the??

233
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,640
Sure.

234
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,000
I'll take it for you.

235
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,360
I can't believe I get to photograph you like this,

236
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,080
without a telephoto lens!

237
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Si-an??

238
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,000
Si-an??

239
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,160
Please take a good one.

240
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,600
Sure.

241
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,680
Mr. Cha Si-an called the Director "brother" back there, right?

242
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,040
Did you know that those two were that close?

243
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,520
I'll see you again, then.

244
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,040
We're all going for dinner. Would you be free to join us?

245
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,160
May I join you, then?

246
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,000
No.

247
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,760
You're callous at home,

248
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,560
but even more so at the museum.

249
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,560
Well, have fun tonight, then.

250
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,560
Though it's belated,

251
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,720
we welcome Director Gold

252
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,080
and Ms. Kim Hyo-jin to

253
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,600
the Cheum Museum of Art!

254
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,560
- Thank you. - Welcome to the team.

255
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
So, how do you know Cha Si-an so well?

256
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,560
I heard him call you "brother" earlier.

257
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,280
Was it because of that scandal?

258
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,320
I wouldn't say we're close??

259
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,000
But??

260
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,360
when did the two of you start dating?

261
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,520
Huh?

262
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,160
I've been really curious about that, too.

263
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,120
Who was it? Who fell for whom first?

264
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,280
Um, group dinners are an extension of work, and we should separate...

265
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,320
Curator Sung, don't kill the mood for us!

266
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,960
Come on, Director. Give us some office-dating tips.

267
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,640
Do you want to tell them?

268
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,920
Or should I?

269
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,040
It was at that auction in China where we first met, right?

270
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,320
Oh, so you two were already acquainted.

271
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,480
At that time, I??

272
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,120
She said, "I want you."

273
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,120
What?

274
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,520
That's what she said.

275
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,920
Delicate lines and harmonious features??

276
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,160
It's an impressive masterpiece with perfect proportions.

277
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,040
I want you.

278
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,880
I said that?

279
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,560
Didn't you?

280
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,240
No, you're right. I did??Yes, I did.

281
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,680
Curator Sung, you're so bold!

282
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,680
And after that, when we met in Korea??

283
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,480
at a hotel, was it?

284
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,000
She was after my room.

285
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,360
Director??

286
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,120
I refused her,

287
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,800
but we bumped into each other againi at the museum.

288
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,760
So that's why you fired her.

289
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,040
Mhmm.

290
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,960
But he must've regretted it,

291
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,480
because he showed up at the cafe saying,

292
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,760
"I'm sorry," "I miss you," "Forgive me for everything."

293
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,000
What you're saying is??

294
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,720
You're not going to come back?

295
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,120
I refuse to go back.

296
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,040
He had tears in his eyes when he apologized, so I??

297
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,040
So!

298
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,160
Curator Sung didn't let me leave all night long.

299
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,160
All night.

300
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,080
All night?

301
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,680
What are you talking about, Director Gold?

302
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,120
You wouldn't let me go home that night, remember?

303
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,400
You said you'd sleep while holding hands.

304
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,600
Is this for real?

305
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,920
Yes.

306
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm a bit like that.

307
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,120
Then what about all those rumors with Cha Si-an?

308
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,160
- Why didn't you say anything? - Well, that's??

309
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,040
How can he say that he's dating his subordinate

310
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,040
when he's only just been appointed director?

311
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,080
But we understand.

312
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,040
Thanks.

313
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,480
Ha!

314
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,000
Alright, cheers!

315
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,440
You don't have to force yourself, Director.

316
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,960
I'm going to drink.

317
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,800
What are you doing? Taking care of your boyfriend?

318
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,320
Well??Director Gold can't even drink coffee, so??

319
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,760
I can hold my liquor, though.

320
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,560
There's this drinking game my friends told me about.

321
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,360
What game?

322
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,680
Text your friends,

323
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,400
and the last person to receive a reply drinks as a penalty.

324
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,800
- Sounds like fun! - Everyone up for it?

325
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,280
Alright, whip out your phones!

326
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,960
Oh, my phone turned off. The battery died.

327
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,200
Director!

328
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,240
Come on,

329
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,880
your girlfriend says her phone's dead.

330
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,840
Oh.

331

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,880
Charge her phone as much as you love her.

333
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,080
Charge!

334
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,160
While her phone's charging, why don't we do a love test?

335
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,440
Love test?

336
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,040
All you have to do is answer my question at the same time.

337
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,120
If your answers aren't the same, then drink up!

338
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,120
Uh, Hyo-jin? As I just said before,

339
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,800
group dinners are an extension of work??

340
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,400
- Black-bean or spicy noodles? - One, two, three!

341
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,440
Black-bean noodles.

342
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,440
Director!

343
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,040
Oh! Oh??I see.

344
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,920
There you go!

345
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,360
He's really downing it.

346
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,600
Where was your first kiss?

347
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,440
One, two, three!

348
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,560
- In his office. - In my car.

349
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,480
- In his office? - In my office?

350
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,280
Who did you kiss in the car, then?

351
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,240
Well, it all started in his office,

352
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,040
then we ended up in his car.

353
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,160
Then when was your last kiss?

354
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,240
- One, two, three! - One, two, three!

355
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,520
- Yesterday. - Just now.

356
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,840
Just now??That wasn't a kiss, it was a peck! A peck.

357
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,680
Gosh.

358
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,840
Next!

359
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,440
Next.

360
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,400
Welcome to the team!

361
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,120
- Chug! Chug! Chug! - Chug! Chug! Chug!

362
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,400
Director.

363
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,520
Director Ryan?

364
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,160
Yes, Curator Sung!

365
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,440
I knew this would happen.

366
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,840
All my foreign friends fall victim to rice wine.

367
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,920
Don't underestimate rice wine ever again.

368
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,720
Why, that??

369
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,520
Karaoke for round three?

370
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,680
No!

371
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,120
Director!

372
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,120
Director, you should go home.

373
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,880
Leave Hyo-jin to us, we'll take her home.

374
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,200
Come on, let's go!

375
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,640
Let's go, Ms. Intern!

376
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,200
You got zilch on that love test!

377
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,040
Something's fishy.

378
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,880
Something's definitely fishy.

379
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,000
Director.

380
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,040
Do you think you can walk over there?

381
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,120
Watch out??

382
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,720
It's not the hand holding that I don't like,

383
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,240
but the letting go, after you hold hands.

384
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,600
It feels as if all warmth has been drained,

385
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,520
and I'm left alone in this world.

386
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,360
You don't know it then. You only realize much later that

387
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,040
you've just been in a stanning accident.

388
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,760
So a stanning accident is when you've discovered someone

389
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,520
and can't stop thinking about them?

390
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,720
That's right!

391
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:06,120
Everyone has a moment like that.

392
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,480
For me, it was one of T.R.T.S.' photos.

393
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,880
It was as if Si-an was looking straight into my eyes!

394
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,400
And that just stirred me.

395
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,280
Thank you both.

396
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,360
Thank you everyone.

397
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,080
I look forward to watching "21st-Century Super Fangirls"!

398
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,960
Same here. Hope you get stellar ratings!

399
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,680
- Stellar! - Bye.

400
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,280
- Goodbye. - We'll be looking forward to it!

401
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,640
Good job, everyone.

402
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,920
Producer, wasn't the title of our show

403
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,840
"Fangirls: Their Distorted Love"?

404
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,080
If we air this, it may start a huge controversy.

405
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,480
Either way, once this airs

406
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,440
I'm dead meat.

407
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,160
Master.

408
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,080
Here.

409
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,080
You didn't need to come with me.

410
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,920
You think I'd entrust you with the card?

411
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,120
Please trust me, Master.

412
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,920
Because I'm all yours now.

413
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,800
Don't call me "Master"!

414
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,040
Why do you play the guitar?

415
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,360
Is it your dream to go pro? Or is it just a hobby?

416
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,800
For now, just a hobby.

417
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,160
Oh, and this is interest.

418
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,160
(Club Free Live)

419
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,240
Performance tickets?

420
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,320
Are you playing here?

421
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,040
You said it's just a hobby.

422
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,160
You never know what life may bring.

423
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,080
You may not know what life will bring,

424
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,440
but you probably know money's a scary thing.

425
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,840
Since you're planning to pay me back, that is.

426
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,400
That's really pretty, huh?

427
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,000
It's got a heavier tone than it looks,

428
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,040
so it's more for rock or heavy metal.

429
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,160
Then what about this one?

430
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,160
This one has shorter reverberations,

431
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,960
but that's actually a feature of this guitar.

432
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,000
It has that funky, psychedelic tone.

433
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,840
You're really into this, aren't you?

434
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,680
Your eyes are sparkling.

435
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,080
I was the same when I was doing what I loved.

436
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,040
My eyes would sparkle.

437
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,800
Like, when you're fangirling with that friend of yours?

438
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,040
Yes.

439
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,160
When we hardcore fangirled, we'd lose track of time,

440
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,320
and even if we pulled an all- nighter, we wouldn't feel tired.

441
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,520
You still sparkle, Master.

442
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,560
What's this one?

443
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,880
- That's an acoustic guitar. - Then what about that one?

444
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,080
- That's an acoustic guitar, too. - Then what about this one?

445
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,760
- This isn't a guitar. - Then what's that?

446
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,440
At least be light, if you're going to be drunk!

447
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,520
You're just so??

448
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,480
pretty.

449
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,120
Have it straight away, if you're badly hung over.

450
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,200
Director.

451
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,840
Director Ryan?

452
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,640
I've lost it, haven't I?

453
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,040
And what was that?

454
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,040
Director. Director?

455
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,160
Knock, knock.

456
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,160
- The passcode. - Passcode?

457
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,280
The passcode's??

458
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,280
a secret, though.

459
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,000
Then come enter it yourself.

460
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,480
Are you getting mad at me?

461
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,640
Mad at you? No!

462
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,840
I'm asking very politely.

463
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,000
Tell me the passcode, or press it yourself.

464
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,600
Alright, I'll tell you.

465
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,720
If you sing for me.

466
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,760
Sing?

467
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,520
What, here?

468
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,120
Alright, then I'll sing for you.

469
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,600
But in return, tell me your passcode.

470
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,080
Promise me.

471
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,000
- I promise. - No going back on your word.

472
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,840
The runway's ahead of me,

473
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,240

Please write the date Si-an made his debut,

Please write the birthdate of the White Ocean member

The colors of his pants? List the colors in order?

Alright??Y Live??

498
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,840
(Y Live)

499
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,920
White Ocean??

500
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,080
(Recommended Videos: 708)

501
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,760
708 videos?

502
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,960
Last question.

503
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:12,160
Please mark the exact location of the mole near Si-an's mouth,

504
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,000
which he always covers up with concealer

505
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,760
because he's very self-conscious about it.

506
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,360
Where? Where is it?

507
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,040
Why isn't it anywhere?

508
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,960
Why? I looked through

509
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,440
thousands of photos, yet??

510
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,560
Where is it?

511
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,440
Hey, Brother!

512
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,240
Where is it? Where?

513
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,480
Brother??

514
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,120
It??It must've been a shadow.

515
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,720
I thought there was something on your face.

516
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,200
Oh, I got told that a lot when I had my mole.

517
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,680
When you had one?

518
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,600
So you don't now?

519
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,920
I got it removed.

520
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,120
Removed?

521
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,400
Why? Who said you could?

522
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,040
Do you know how much your fans loved that?

523
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,800
That's why I had it removed in secret. I didn't like it.

524
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,880
Oh, but if you look closely, you might still see it.

525
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,040
Where? Where? Where?

526
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,280
Here.

527
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,160
Near my chin??

528
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,480
- Enjoy. - Thank you!

529
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,520
Who is this person?

530
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,600
Why? What is it?

531
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,400
There's a member who signed up just yesterday,

532
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,000
but she got everything right on the level-up test today!

533
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,320
Really? Who's this person?

534
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,080
Latte?

535
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,360
Isn't that a record?

536
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,600
Do you think our test was leaked?

537
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,640
No! Latte must be a hardcore fan like us.

538
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,800
Oh, that's right.

539
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,000
- Brother. - Yes?

540
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,560
See you after work.

541
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,600
I found one more piece by Lee Sol.

542
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,080
I found one more piece by Lee Sol.

543
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,560
Mom.

544
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,320
Is our intern not going to come in today

545
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,840
because she's hung over?

546
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,000
She must be so happy she can work for fun.

547
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,200
I'll have a stern chat with her and make myself clear.

548
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,000
Tsk, tsk.

549
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,840
- Ms. Intern, to your left! - Oh what?

550
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,840
You look so gorgeous. Have a good day at work!

551
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,600
You're just so gorgeous, Miss Intern!

552
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,160
You're like a butterfly!

553
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,440
A stern chat, you say?

554
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,200
Director Eom?

555
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,840
Hi!

556
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,200
I really wanted to keep it a secret,

557
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,480
but my hubby, Moo-san, was begging me.

558
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,280
He wanted to see our darling Hyo-jin at work,

559
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,040
and our darling Hyo-jin on her way to work.

560
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:25,320
I must admit, he overdoes the doting over Hyo-jin.

561
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:29,920
But don't let this pressure you, okay?

562
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,040
Alright, we won't concern ourselves.

563
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:36,040
Oh, one more thing. I think it's time to replace

564
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,000
the artwork in my Moo-san's office.

565
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,160
Do you have a particular piece in mind?

566
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:45,000
I think this year will be an unlucky year for my hubby.

567
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,160
In terms of his reputation.

568
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:51,000
So I think he needs something to ward off bad luck.

569
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,040
Something like a lion, or??

570
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,080
I have a meeting with Mr. Cha Si-an,

571
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,960
so I'll clock out first.

572
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,920
Curator Sung,

573
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,560
don't contact me unless it's something extremely important.

574
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,480
I'm here??

575
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:13,440
I hate lions.

576
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,760
I hate lion!

577
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,440
Make it a tiger, please. A tiger.

578
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,320
Bye!

579
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,480
Curator Sung, did you fight with Director Gold?

580
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,120
He's really cold to you today.

581
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:33,880
You nagged at him for drinking too much, didn't you?

582
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,240
Nag at him? Have a fight?

583
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,360
No way.

584
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,240
You have three works by Lee Sol.

585
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,520
Yes, I introduced just one on that TV show.

586
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,440
And this is my most recent find.

587
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,320
Three from my collection,

588
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:18,200
and one which you purchased for a client.

589
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,280
That means we'll have the whole series if we find 5 more.

590
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,560
Five more?

591
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,120
Are you saying there are nine in total?

592
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,880
How do you know that?

593
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,600
Nothing's known about Lee Sol.

594
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,040
I heard it somewhere.

595
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,600
Well, I think at this rate

596
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,800
we should have all of her works in time for the exhibition.

597
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,280
You're still in touch with that client, right?

598
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,040
Yes.

599
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,880
Then why don't we request to borrow it?

600
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,440
If they sell it to me, even better.

601
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,680
You can keep looking.

602
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,360
Yeah, Mom.

603
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,400
Is Director Gold not joining us for lunch?

604
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,520
No, I guess he doesn't have the appetite.

605
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,120
Did you guys break up?

606
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,080
Hey, they only just started dating.

607
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,160
Just a sec.

608
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,160
Why buy a sandwich when she just had lunch?

609
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,720
It's for Director Gold, duh.

610
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,560
- Oh. - Good times for them.

611
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,400
Director Gold.

612
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,600
Ryan!

613
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:35,760
What I'm seeing right now??surely it can't be real.

614
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,080
You still drink just milk, right?

615
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,800
Curator Sung Duk-mi.

616
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,320
I'm sorry, I bought just his.

617
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,040
Oh, that's alright.

618
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,240
Hold this for me.

619
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,440
I missed you, Ryan.

620
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,000
I'm giving you three seconds.

621
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,520
Why? You said you missed me, too.

622
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,440
Three, two??

623
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,960
Two seconds will do, thank you.

624
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:10,560
What happened? You didn't even say you were coming.

625
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,040
I don't have a number yet.

626
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,840
Should we take a walk and catch up as we go?

627
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,440
- Go where? - To my studio.

628
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,440
Your studio?

629
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,280
In Korea?

630
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,600
Now you're curious, right?

631
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,400
Let's go.

632
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,720
Where's your car?

633
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,200
Is it this way?

634
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,080
I missed you, Ryan.

635
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,240
Curator Sung.

636
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,200
Yes?

637
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,240
I'm sorry.

638
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:48,080
Oh, sorry. I was just spacing out.

639
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:48,800
What is it?

640
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,720
The concierge at Director Gold's residence

641
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,080
just called, and??

642
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,040
And?

643
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,800
The floor upstairs had a leak, so they need to check now

644
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,080
whether his unit's been affected, too.

645
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,920
A leak?

646
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,240
But he has some paintings at his house.

647
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,080
Did you try calling him?

648
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:09,000
Well??They said he's not picking up.

649
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,440
He's not picking up?

650
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,400
Why not?

651
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,080
Yes, yes. Alright.

652
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,000
Bye.

653
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:20,120
First, let's go to the one in Pyeongchang-dong.

654
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,520
Weren't we headed to your studio?

655
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,000
I'm looking for one now.

656
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,080
I'll just make a few more calls.

657
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,160
Curator Sung,

658
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,880
shouldn't you go and check out

659
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,000
Director Gold's place?

660
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,080
I'm not the owner, though.

661
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,080
But you are his girlfriend.

662
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,400
Girlfriend? My a??

663
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,680
I mean, yes, I'm his girlfriend.

664
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,640
They said that it's pretty urgent

665
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,040
and that they're happy to have you instead.

666
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,160
I'll call the building managers

667
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,920
and send a text to let Director Gold know.

668
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,120
Uh??You know the passcode, right?

669
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,000
Huh?

670
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,360
Yes, of course.

671
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,440
I guess I should go, then. Right?

672
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,880
Call me if anything comes up.

673
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:13,720
Sure.

674
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,400
They have all the fun,

675
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,080
and I do all the hard work.

676
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,000
The previous tenant was also a famous artist,

677
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,600
and she went abroad after finding success.

678
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,160
This place brings good luck.

679
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,880
Please excuse me. Have a look around.

680
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,960
I like it.

681
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,320
How does it look to you?

682
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,520
If you're going as far as getting a studio,

683
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,760
how long does that mean you're planning to stay in Korea?

684
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,960
What about you? How long will you stay?

685
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:58,040
Was I ever vague with you?

686
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,120
Because from what I remember, no.

687
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,040
Vague? No.

688
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,680
But you did charm me.

689
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,880
Choi Da-in.

690
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,640
It's just that??

691
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,680
My head's a bit of a mess right now.

692
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,320
Half the people say they like me, that I'm the best.

693
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,080
And half of them are out to get me.

694
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,120
Whether I'm an artist or a con artist??

695
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,360
I don't even know anymore.

696
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:21,960
That's??

697
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,640
I know, it's all bullshit.

698
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,840
"Just ignore the criticism and negativity."

699
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,080
That's what you told me, right?

700
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,960
But how can I? I mean, I'm human, too.

701
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,200
I need someone to be the standard.

702
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,960
Someone who will evaluate honestly and without bias.

703
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:43,760
Someone who will provide honest advice for me and my works.

704
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,400
Choi Da-in, the artist, is desperate for someone like that.

705
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,680
Someone like you.

706
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,040
Of course, I'm desperate as a woman, too.

707
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,320
I'll be that artistic standard.

708
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,960
But that's all I'll do.

709
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,040
You're so stingy.

710
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,160
Oh, I still have it.

711
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,600
A leak?

712
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,440
I'm off.

713
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,120
Ryan!

714
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,320
What could be the matter?

715
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,160
I'm relieved to say there are no problems.

716
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,120
Thank you.

717
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,320
I didn't realize it then when I came last time,

718
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,160
but his house is like a museum.

719
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,120
How beautiful.

720
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:53,880
This is really nice.

721
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,240
Director.

722
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,000
What are you doing here?

723
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:58,160
The unit upstairs had a leak, so I came to check??

724
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,080
The checking's all done, from what I can tell??

725
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,680
I'm asking you, what are you doing in an empty house when

726
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,080
the owner isn't even present?

727
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,720
I just??

728
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,840
Your house was beautiful, so??

729
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,040
Is that an excuse to snoop around my house?

730
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,040
Are you deluded into thinking that we are really dating?

731
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,880
Are you trying to act like a girlfriend who came to visit?

732
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:34,640
It's not like that. I??

733
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,160
Please leave,

734
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,000
Curator Sung.

735
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,080
I'm sorry.

736
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,800
Hey! You're the curator, right?

737
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,960
Si??Si-an??Mr. Cha Si-an.

738
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,880
So I meet you in the elevator today.

739
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,600
But??is something the matter?

740
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,520
Did you fight with Director Gold?

741
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,800
Oh, no. It's nothing like that.

742
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,680
He's done something wrong, huh?

743
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,400
Did he lie or something?

744
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,160
Do you know Lee Sol?

745
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:55,600
I purchased it at the behest of a client.

746
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,880
I'm sure he's regretting it.

747
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,080
So cheer up, alright?

748
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,640
Director, I couldn't come empty- handed so I brought a gift.

749
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,120
I hope you like this fragrance.

750
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,080
It's not like that. I??

751
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,440
Please leave,

752
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,080
Curator Sung.

753
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,160
I'm sorry.

754
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,000
Have it straight away, if you're badly hung over.

755
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,600
Sweet dreams.

756
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,800
If you ever need a hand to hold onto,

757
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:27,000
and don't want to let go after holding onto it??

758
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,800
I'll lend you mine.

759
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,120
Your call cannot be connected at this time. Please??

760
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:18,960
Wow, how can Si-an be so nice with his words and actions?

761
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,080
Right, Duk-mi?

762
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,720
He yelled at you?

763
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,400
And that's besides the fact that he hasn't thanked you.

764
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,960
So? What else did Si-an say?

765
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,680
I mean, is that something to get angry about?

766
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,040
You lied so he wouldn't be troubled, that's all.

767
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:33,160
Si-an must be good at sympathizing with others, too.

768
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:36,000
Hey. Did you sell off your sympathy, then?

769
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,800
Ugh. Hey!

770
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,960
Just forget about it.

771
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,600
Call him a bastard, buffoon, lion jerk or whatever.

772
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,600
Do you know what I really hate?

773
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,200
All the while,

774
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,720
while Lion was yelling at me??

775
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,840
I was thinking, "What if he's disappointed in me?"

776
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,520
"What if he hates me?"

777
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,040
And that scared me more.

778
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,160
I'm such a loser.

779
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
That's why, Duk-mi,

780
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,160
you should just live for idols.

781
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:18,040
Don't ever fall for men in real life.

782
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:37,360
Will I find complete happiness?

783
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,400
- Wait, so that's Ju Hyuk? - How much more do

784
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:44,040
I have to endure

785
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:50,880
before love finds its way to someone like me, too?

786
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,160
It makes me more lonely??

787
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:57,000
Wasn't she the one who told me not to fall for men in real life?

788
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,280
You think that's something you can control?

789
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:17,040
Will I find complete happiness?

790
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:23,560
How much more do I have to endure

791
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:30,160
before love finds its way to someone like me, too?

792
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,720
It makes me more lonely??

793
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,200
Ah, Director Gold.

794
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,200
What brings you here at this time?

795
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,960
Have you seen Curator Sung by any chance?

796
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:10,760
She went out to meet a client this afternoon,

797
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,320
then went straight home.

798
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,280
I see.

799
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,480
After S stepped out of R's house,

800
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,640
she headed straight to UG Club in Hongdae

801
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:41,080
for a date with another man.

802
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,360
(UG Club)

803
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,480
Excuse me.

804
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,240
Is the concert over already?

805
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,200
- Yes, it is. - Yes.

806
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,720
Is that an excuse to snoop around my house?

807
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:36,360
Are you deluded into thinking that we are really dating?

808
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:42,120
Are you trying to act like a girlfriend who came to visit?

809
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:47,480
Please leave, Curator Sung.

810
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,080
Curator Sung!

811
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:26,920
Director.

812
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,440
My words were too harsh.

813
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,000
It wasn't something to get angry over.

814
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,040
I just didn't expect to find you there.

815
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:41,800
I'm sorry.

816
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:48,000
Are you...

817
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,040
very angry?

818
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:51,280
Yes.

819
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:59,200
But??

820
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,760
I'm sorry, too.

821
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,520
For intruding without your permission.

822
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:07,400
(Her Private Life)

823
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,040
Do you love Duk-mi?

824
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:09,800
Yes.

825
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,640
Don't come out.

826
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:13,680
I heard you're dating Ms. Sung Duk-mi.

827
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:14,440
Are you really?

828
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:16,160
I don't see the need to answer that question.

829
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,240

I have news that you might like, Curator Sung.

01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:24,360
What is it?

833
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:25,400
Well, you see??

834
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:26,800

No, you can't!
