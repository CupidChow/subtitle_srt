3
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Curator Sung.

4
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,760
Are you alright?

5
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,680
Wait right here.

6
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,040
What gives?

7
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,960
That woman there??

8
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,200
She's my girlfriend.

9
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,640
She's my girlfriend, you hear me?

10
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,320
That woman??

11
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,520
Congratulations.

12
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,160
I've told him not to park illegally so many times,

13
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,640
yet he keeps on doing that.

14
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,600
Right.

15
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,360
That woman there??She's my girlfriend.

16
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,640
She's my girlfriend, you hear me?

17
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,320
It's kind of hard to be hard on him since he's so much older.

18
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,160
Congratulations.

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,120
Whoa.

20
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,640
Director Gold.

21
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,400
Are you alright?

22
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,960
Should I get you a condensed milk latte?

23
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,640
Director Gold.

24
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,040
I think what you did was perfectly reasonable.

25
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,800
Anyone would have taken it the wrong way,

26
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,720
especially after what happened earlier. Besides??

27
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,480
Black cars with tinted windows are quite sketchy.

28
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,800
Even I'm a bit weary of them.

29
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,080
Plus??

30
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,120
You were only looking out for your employee, so??

31
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,320
Anyway, I'll forget about what just happened.

32
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,000
In fact, I already did!

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,440
I mean it. Really.

34
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,120
- Curator Sung Duk-mi. - Yes?

35
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,760
I'll do it.

36
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,680
Do what?

37
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,000
Act as your boyfriend.

38
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,880
What?

39
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,160
Have me, for a little bit.

40
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,560
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,040
That was just too funny.

42
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,080
You know, this is the first time I'm laughing today.

43
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,000
I didn't say that to make you laugh.

44
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,120
Then what??Do you like me?

45
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,240
Most certainly not.

46
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,280
Then why'd you say you'd be my boyfriend?

47
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,280
What, have you? I don't want one bit of you.

48
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,640
Don't want a one bit??

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
"For a little bit."

50
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,880
Didn't you hear me say "for a little bit"?

51
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,200
I meant I'd pretend to be your boyfriend, just for a short time.

52
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,280
What?

53
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,160
Let's pretend to date, you and me.

54
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,480
Curator Sung.

55
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,400
Yes.

56
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,040
Why don't you think about what I said a bit more?

57
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,840
I know you're embarrassed about what just happened, but??

58
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,840
Your personal information was leaked in less than a day.

59
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,400
Your family, friends, and other private matters could be next.

60
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,680
Are you really alright with that?

61
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,440
If they find out you're his fan,

62
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,000
and that you're T.R.T.S??

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
- Chills. - Chills.

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,080
I'll be dead and gone before you know it.

65
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,240
- Like dewdrops. - Yes.

66
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,120
But??

67
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,360
It was I who accompanied you to Mr. Cha Si-an's place,

68
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,040
and I who lent you that jacket.

69
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,760
Mr. Cha's agency was unaware that I also own that jacket??

70
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,800
Things grew out of hand because of the agency's lies,

71
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,760
so I don't think lying again is the best way out of this.

72
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,040
What if that single lie could just settle everything?

73
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,080
Although, as Curator Yoo said,

74
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,080
the best thing would be to show everyone your boyfriend.

75
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,160
I have to have one to show one.

76
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,000
Exactly.

77
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,520
Well let's say I decided to lie about this.

78
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,880
Where would I upload your picture?

79
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,120
If I suddenly uploaded it onto social media,

80
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,920
wouldn't it be so obvious that I'm faking it?

81
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,880
Leave that part to me, I'll do some thinking.

82
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,800
You just think about whether you're in or not.

83
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Well then.

84
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,600
(Joint Hospital)

85
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,640
You stand out more like this, you know.

86
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,200
Who'd recognize you here?

87
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,000
You never know.

88
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,240
A granddaughter who's here visiting her grandma could be Si-an's fan.

89
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,720
Hey.

90
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,600
Cha Si-an may be the world to you because you're his hardcore fan,

91
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,240
but the rest of the world doesn't care about him that much.

92
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,880
In fact, they don't even know who Cha Si-an is.

93
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,000
Cha Si-an? He's nothing!

94
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,080
You may not know Cha Si-an, but be sure to know Sung Duk-mi.

95
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,280
Because she will have no mercy on those who curse her baby.

96
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,240
Cha Si-an??ugh! That bastard.

97
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,480
A??fake??what?

98
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,400
A fake relationship.

99
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,160
Couldn't pretending to have a boyfriend solve everything?

100
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,040
After all that's happened, I can't believe it's now come to this.

101
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,080
Hey, just stop being a fangirl and get yourself a real relationship!

102
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,120
I can't stop being a fangirl just because I say I will.

103
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,120
No-one can stop the descent of the God of otaku.

104
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,080
Who are idols to make you use your life as a shield?

105
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,160
It's not shielding. Rather, it's??

106
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,080
Forget it. What would a muggle know?

107
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,160
Why that??

108
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,800
Sons sure are the best.

109
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,760
You tell your son your mother's sick,

110
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:04,160
and he arranges for a surgery with the best doctor

111
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,480
at the best hospital in town.

112
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,880
After he ended up that way,

113
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,600
I told you to try for another son, didn't I?

114
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,320
Mom??

115
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What, did I say something I shouldn't have?

116
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,440
Why take someone else's son, for what?

117
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,000
Mother.

118
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,720
It was I who found this hospital for you,

119
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,000
and I who booked the surgery with your doctor!

120
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,120
It's your daughter-in-law you owe it to, not your son!

121
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,000
Oh? What's wrong with your face?

122
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,600
You've grown so thin!

123
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,840
Has she been mistreating you?

124
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,960
You should treasure your husband, you know.

125
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,400
He's a hundred times better than those men

126
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,000
who drink all day, smoke all day and

127
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,680
cheat on their wives just because they bring home money.

128
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,400
You think earning money is the only thing he's incapable of?

129
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,080
Can he do housework? Does he walk around with a smiley face?

130
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,480
Does he entertain me with witty banter?

131
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,160
Nope, and I really don't know why I even keep him around

132
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,080
when he can't do one single thing right.

133
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,680
Well, he has his good looks!

134
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,440
I mean, look.

135
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,640
Look how handsome he is.

136
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,120
Now that's true shielding.

137
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,720
Grandma!

138
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,200
- I'm here. - Respect.

139
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,160
(Episode 4: I Protect My Baby. Shield of Blood)

140
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,000
Are you feeling better?

141
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,720
Who??

142
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,120
I'm Ryan Gold, Director of Cheum Museum of Art.

143
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,080
Oh! I'll ask just a few questions!

144
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,160
I'll answer just one.

145
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,200
I'm really into suing and taking legal action.

146
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,040
Just so you know, before you start writing groundless rumors.

147
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,760
One more thing. The person you're after is on leave today.

148
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,040
So I suggest you turn back.

149
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,200
What, is he her boyfriend?

150
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,120
What did he say? What?

151
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,280
Mr. Cha Si-an's fans anda reporter are here at the museum.

152
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,200
I told them you're on leave, so don't come in today.

153
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,080
Welcome.

154
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,720
Ju Hyuk, can I get a coffee?

155
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,000
With an extra shot?

156
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,280
Yes. Make it two.

157
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,680
Actually, no. Three, so I can wake up.

158
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,160
Why? Did something else happen?

159
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,400
I got a text from Lion.

160
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,080
He told me there's a reporter in front of the museum,

161
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,640
and not to come in today.

162
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,160
Your name being thrown around in fandom gossip and your name being

163
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,280
included in a news article are two entirely different matters.

164
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,000
Should I just do an interview to announce that

165
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,120
- Cha Si-an and I are nothing? - Hey.

166
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,040
Whatever you say in that interview,

167
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,240
the headline will be "The Shocking Truth about Si-an's Woman!"

168
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,120
Right?

169
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,960
Hey, hey! People! Hide!

170
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,600
What kind of situation is this??

171
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,240
- Hello. - Three iced americanos.

172
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,720
The reporter said that lady's on leave, right?

173
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,200
Can we take his word for it?

174
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,160
Well I don't trust reporters or the news anymore.

175
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,520
I wanted to get a good look at her face.

176
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,320
From what I saw on Sindy's webpage,

177
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,920
I have to admit she's quite pretty.

178
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,080
What if she is? She's still old.

179
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,080
You know, my cousin said that

180
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,240
that curator seems like she could be a hardcore fangirl.

181
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,840
She thinks she might have seen her in the TVXQ fanclub.

182
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,040
There may be people who've never stanned,

183
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,560
but there's definitely no one who's only stanned once.

184
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,480
Then are you saying that this lady could be Si-an's fan?

185
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,200
If she really is one of Si-an's fans??

186
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,640
I won't forgive her for upsetting his other fans!

187
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,080
I'm going to kill her and go to heaven.

188
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,560
Ugh!

189
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,720
My card, please.

(Collection of Ahn Myung-sub's Works)

191
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm sorry I'm late, Director Gold.

192
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,400
I thought I told you you don't need to come in.

193
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,040
Weren't there people waiting outside?

194
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,640
No. I was at the cafe,

195
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,280
and came in after making sure everyone left.

196
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,120
I'm sorry for troubling you.

197
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,320
I'll do my best to avoid the reporters, and??

198
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,760
Instead of avoiding them,

199
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,120
why not use them to your advantage?

200
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,160
Use them?

201
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,800
As in letting them see you with me.

202
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,080
For example,

203
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,000
we could come to work together and leave together.

204
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,600
I'm sure at some point an article would appear.

205
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,440
We'd see an article, yes.

206
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,400
"Was Cha Si-an's Girlfriend Two-Timing?"

207
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,160
"Cha Si-an's Public Breakup"

208
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,680
"Has Cha Si-an Been Stabbed in the Back?"

209
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,320
And then my obituary would follow.

210
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,200
Oh.

211
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,720
Mr. Cha Si-an's fans won't believe

212
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,280
what his agency or the media are saying, at least for now.

213
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,840
They'll probably find the information circulating in their

214
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,120
fandom to be more credible.

215
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,680
They'll find info from their fandom to be more credible?

216
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,040
Just as they believed

217
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,320
his stalker's claims, rather than his agency's announcement?

218
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,280
Well, yes. Wouldn't they?

219
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,720
Then we should use the same approach.

220
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,440
Same approach?

221
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,640
Let me look into that a bit more first.

222
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,080
By the way, did you book a meeting with Mr. Ahn?

223
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,120
Yes. Mr. Ahn says this afternoon works for him.

224
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,880
That works for me, too.

225
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,680
Alright, then I'll discuss the time and let you know.

226
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,240
I think T.R.T.S. is the person who knows me best.

227
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,240
She must be a special fan. Ms. T.R.T.S., I mean.

228
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,640
The fans who take photos of celebrities

229
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,200
and upload them are called "homepage masters."

230
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,040
T.R.T.S. is a special presence not only to me,

231
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,680
but to my other fans, too.

232
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,120
There was once a rumor that

233
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,280
we didn't look very happy at our concert because we had fought,

234
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,040
and that we'd be disbanding soon.

235
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,360
At that time, T.R.T.S. gathered all the photos taken by

236
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,120
the homepage masters at the concert and

237
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,960
used them as evidence to reassure the fans

238
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,320
that we look fine and that we'd never argued.

239
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,320
Ever since then, everyone trusts T.R.T.S.

240
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,200
I think she's more competent than my agency.

Are they now sending??

252
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,920
Oh no.

253
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,160
It's nothing.

his stalker's claims, rather than his agency's announcement?

257
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,040
Then we should use the same approach.

258
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,800
Don't tell me??

259
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,680
I apologize, I should've come sooner.

260
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,080
No, it was thoughtless of me to add to your workload

261
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,200
during this busy time, when you've just been appointed.

262
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,120
I've made you suffer too, haven't I? Ms. Sung.

263
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,120
Not at all.

264
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,400
I ended up troubling you because of my inexperience.

265
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,880
I apologize, Mr. Ahn.

266
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,840
As Curator Sung Duk-mi said,

267
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,280
the special exhibition to celebrate Cheum's 5th anni??

268
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,840
Oh, let's put that behind us.

269
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,840
I admit I was being too greedy.

270
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,200
With all due respect, Mr. Ahn,

271
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,440
I'd like it if you let yourself be even greedier.

272
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,000
This is a proposal from Mono Art Gallery in New York.

273
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,520
Mono Art Gallery in New York?

274
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,360
They've always wanted to hold an exhibition of your works

275
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,000
in New York, and I think now an opportunity has presented itself.

276
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,280
What, at this age?

277
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,960
You're at the prime age to make your international debut.

278
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,520
Congratulations, Mr. Ahn.

279
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,640
I owe it all to you, Ms. Sung.

280
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,720
Thank you.

281
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,000
I've always wanted to curate an overseas exhibition

282
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,280
with Mr. Ahn's works.

283
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,560
I've always been sorry about him being a late bloomer.

284
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,120
Oh, I know Mr. Ahn's work best.

285
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,240
So if you'll leave it to me,

286
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,320
I'll prepare it to perfection.

287
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,480
Alright.

288
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,200
I'll get you in touch with a Mono Art Gallery representative.

289
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,080
Thank you.

290
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,040
Um, so??Director Gold.

291
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,120
What's that approach that you mentioned before?

292
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,600
The one used by the stalker?

293
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,640
Oh.

294
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,600
I'm not sure whether you've heard of this term,

295
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,240
but there are these "homepage masters."

296
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,080
Homepage masters?

297
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,840
They take photos of idols and upload them online.

298
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,440
In other words, they're fans who are well known in the fandom.

299
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,880
And?

300
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,880
I have something to return to a Cha Si-an homepage master,

301
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,560
and I was thinking of asking her for a favor while I'm at it.

302
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,040
Her words would be taken much more seriously

303
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,800
than whatever excuse we put out,

304
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,880
since she's Mr. Cha Si-an's homepage master.

305
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,800
But do you think she'll accept our request?

306
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,120
Because I don't think so.

307
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,240
You see, she owes me something.

308
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,080
If she agrees, will you do it?

309
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,160
No!

310
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,440
I'm the sort of person who just can't lie, so??

311
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,080
Curator Sung.

312
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,040
I'll just wait quietly until the rumors subside,

313
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,280
even if it takes some time. Please excuse me.

314
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,800
Get in.

315
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,080
You got a taxi, right?

316
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,200
I did. Hey, just wait.

317
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,480
Did he come just now?

318
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,320
- Oppa! Oppa! - Oppa! Oppa!

319
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,120
Si-an! Si-an!

320
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,360
Those rumors??They're not true, are they?

321
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,240
Oh what?

322
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,600
Hey, are you crazy?

323
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,240
- Oppa! Oppa! - Oppa! Oppa!

324
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,240
Oppa, wait!

325
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,320
Oppa! Oppa!

326
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,800
- Taxi! Taxi! - Taxi! Taxi!

327
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,840
I told you to go easy on them.

328
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,000
They're my fans.

329
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,200
I didn't mean to. It's just that she??

330
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,800
You must be tired. Get some rest.

331
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,160
Hey! Can you not drive properly?

332
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,120
- We're being trailed. - Trailed?

333
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,120
- Si-an! - Cha Si-an!

334
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,680
Si-an, look at me! This way! This way!

335
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,520
Si-an!

336
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,040
Si-an!

337
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,520
Oppa!

338
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,560
Oppa! Si-an oppa!

339
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,280
Good work today, Si-an.

340
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,760
Go in and rest well.

341
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,040
What the??

342
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,680
That's right. One, two??

343
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,440
A van carrying Cha Si-an, member of popular idol group

344
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,880
White Ocean, ran over a woman in her 20s.

345
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,120
According to the Gangnam Police, Mr. Cha's van

346
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,480
ran over Ms. Kim, identified as one of Mr. Cha's fans,

347
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,160
in a parking lot of an apartment complex

348
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,960
at around 10 p.m. this evening.

349
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,080
Mr. Cha Si-an??

350
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,560
Honey.

351
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,320
You haven't seen me for three days,

352
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,040
so don't tell me you're going to go running to Duk-mi.

353
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,120
Honey, take your time and take Gun-woo with you.

354
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,080
Gun-woo, make sure you finish all your kimchi.

355
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,480
Feed him kimchi.

356
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,400
She's actually going.

357
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,640
Of course.

358
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,240
Duk-mi's the only friend she has left.

359
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,880
Hey, but it's not like she has two husbands!

360
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,040
It appears she leaped in front of the van,

361
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,560
but the police are still investigating the exact cause.

362
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,040
Sung Duk-mi.

363
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,920
Duk-mi.

364
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,360
Sun-joo, Si-an's??

365
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,560
Neither Si-an nor the victim were hurt badly.

366
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,480
I'm sure they're fine.

367
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,120
This accident is all my fault.

368
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,080
I'm to blame for all this!

369
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,680
How is this your fault?

370
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,320
It's those stalkers who are the problem.

371
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,600
That fan who leaped in front of Si-an's van isn't a stalker.

372
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,240
In fact, she was the exact opposite.

373
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,000
She was just one of those fans who quietly supported him at home.

374
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,360
How do you know that?

375
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,560
So what's the conclusion to this whole scandal

376
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,960
that was uploaded on Sindy's homepage?

377
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,360
There are no further comments from his agency,

378
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,080
so now I want to ask Si-an directly.

379
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,080
I'm just so frustrated and depressed that I want to die.

380
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,000
After that post, she kept writing about how she was

381
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
in front of his agency, in front of his apartment??

382
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,720
But after the accident, there've been no more updates.

383
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,120
I mean, if she can't handle this one small scandal

384
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,000
how does she even fangirl?

385
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,480
I didn't think this through.

386
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,840
I shouldn't have just left this to be resolved with time.

387
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,080
What are you going to do if you don't just leave it?

388
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,320
Lion's right.

389
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,000
All it takes is one lie.

390
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Curator Yoo Kyung-ah.

391
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,880
When can I get that list of celebrities who are confirmed for

392
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,000
our special exhibition?

393
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,840
There are still some that we need to double check.

394
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,680
I'll have it ready for you tomorrow.

395
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,880
Do you think Mr. Cha Si-an will participate?

396
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,320
There was that accident yesterday, after all.

397
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,240
I'll contact Mr. Cha Si-an.

398
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,360
- And Yoo-sub? - Yes.

399
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,720
Check the storage room and see whether there's room for

400
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,720
the borrowed works.

401
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,520
Yes, sir!

402
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,160
And Curator Sung Duk-mi.

403
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,240
Curator Sung?

404
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,840
Huh?

405
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,240
Yes.

406
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,000
Why don't you help me with the primary selection of

407
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,160
Mr. Ahn's works?

408
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,720
Alright.

409
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,080
Um, Director?

410
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,960
Is something wrong?

411
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,040
You were spacing out during the meeting.

412
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,320
Sorry about that.

413
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,000
To be honest, it's because of the scandal??

414
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,920
That lie??Fake relationship, pretend boyfriend??

415
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,960
I thought about giving it a try.

416
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,160
I was thinking about what you said and it does seem irresponsible to

417
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,880
just leave this to time.

418
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,920
Mr. Cha's accident yesterday has been bothering me, too.

419
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,400
Okay, let's give it a try.

420
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,760
But what are your plans, exactly?

421
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,320
I'm thinking of reaching out to that homepage master I mentioned

422
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,600
for an interview.

423
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,120
What, an interview?

424
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,240
With T.R.T.S.?

425
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,160
Yeah.

426
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,000
Has he completely misunderstood the concept of a homepage?

427
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I mean, where do we even start?

428
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I almost corrected him, right there on the spot!

429
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,320
Why do you keep on laughing?

430
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,720
What are you going to do?

431
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,560
I have a plan of my own.

432
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,040
(T.R.T.S. started following me)

433
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,440
Heellooo.

434
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,720
"Heellooo"?

435
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,960
Why, is that weird?

436
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,800
What are you doing?

437
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,400
Well, shouldn't I act the exact opposite of myself,

438
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,200
who's intelligent and elegant, so he'll have no clue it's me?

439
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,040
I don't think he'll know, even if you just act normally.

440
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,480
Really?

441
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,400
Alright.

442
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,160
(Heellooo)

443
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,080
(Ryan Gold)

444
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,720
(The Road to Si-an)

445
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,920
Ms. T.R.T.S.?

446
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,000
This is Ryan Gold, Director of Cheum Museum of Art.

447
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,640
I'm not sure if you remember me,

448
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,520
but we met once before at the airport.

449
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,600
You fell from the ladder

450
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,240
while taking photos, right?

451
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,800
Oh! You're the one I fell on top of.

452
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,120
Yes.

453
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,800
That air mattress is me.

454
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,640
I'm so sorry about that.

455
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,520
I didn't contact you to hear your apology.

456
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
You see, I have your notebook.

457
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:41,040
Oh, so you had that.

458
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,160
If you returned it to me, I'd be oh so thankful.

459
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,920
So??

460
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,160
Is that all you wanted to discuss?

461
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,040
Well, uh??

462
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,360
You see??

463
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,520
Cheum Museum of Art??

464
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,720
Isn't that the place where that curator in Si-an's scandal works?

465
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,080
Actually, that's why I contacted you today.

466
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,040
Why?

467
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,720
That curator's my girlfriend.

468
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,760
Whoa!

469
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,560
What's this energy I'm getting?

470
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,120
This is really fun.

471
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,800
Keep going! What's Lion going to say?

472
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,120
So you're saying you want me to upload pictures of the two of you

473
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,040
along with an interview, on my homepage?

474
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,040
Yes.

475
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:45,000
Unfortunately, I can't won't be able to go there personally??

476
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,720
However, there is another way.

477
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,160
How about it?

478
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,640
Curator Sung.

479
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,720
We need an accomplice.

480
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,720
A fake paparazzi

481
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,000
who will take pictures of us, the pretend couple,

482
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,280
on a pretend date.

483
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,360
Yes, and I happen to have just the right person.

484
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,280
(Closed)

485
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,720
Director.

486
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,160
Hello, Director Gold.

487
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,400
It's my first time meeting you here.

488
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,280
- Curator Sung. - Yes?

489
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,520
See me for a moment.

490
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,480
Me?

491
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,080
Is she the "just the right person" person?

492
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,640
Yes. She's quite the photographer.

493
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,480
She'll take pictures of us pretending to be a couple?

494
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,240
Yes.

495
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,840
- She will? - Yes.

496
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,680
Why? What is it?

497
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,040
Nothing.

498
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,000
Well??

499
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,440
I guess it could be more assuring to see it for yourself.

500
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,360
- What was that? - Nothing.

501
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,400
I looked up some paparazzi photos,

502
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,120
since they might help you pose.

503
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,120
How about something like this?

504
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,160
Or like this?

505
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,000
Lee Sun-joo.

506
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,720
But this is nothing!

507
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,760
I mean, you're a couple in your 30s.

508
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,880
Isn't that so, Director?

509
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,000
Why don't we go with the office-couple concept,

510
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,040
where we're concerned that our colleagues might find out?

511
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,760
- Are you crazy? - What?

512
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,760
- Would you be able to do this? - Yeah.

513
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,760
Don't look at the camera.

514
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Come on??

515
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,560
I can't tell if you're a couple or a boss scolding his subordinate.

516
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,160
What? We're having coffee together, so anyone

517
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,600
- would think we're dating. - Ha! Whatever.

518
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,080
If having coffee together means being in a relationship,

519
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,040
I would have over 3,000 lovers by now.

520
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,240
Then what would you do, Ms. Lee Sun-joo?

521
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,000
If you were her lover.

522
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,160
If it were me??

523
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,960
Sun-joo, who'd ever do this at work?

524
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,960
Hey, what can't you do when you're in love?

525
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,640
I hear real office couples get more steamy than this.

526
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,160
Like animals at the zoo!

527
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,800
Well, this is a museum.

528
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,320
Isn't art a product of lust and desire?

529
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,080
I want to see desire and lust in your method acting.

530
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,680
I mean, it's just acting.

531
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,320
Ready, action!

532
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,840
Duk-mi!

533
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,120
You want this man.

534
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,960
Got it? So look at him with that look in your eyes.

535
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,480
What do you want me to do?

536
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,600
Let's just do this right.

537
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,920
Then I'm really going to.

538
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,640
Let's do it.

539
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,040
Director, you're too stiff right now.

540
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,240
Could you try to move more naturally?

541
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,440
Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!

542
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,960
Does Ms. Lee Sun-joo??

543
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,080
normally enjoy this kind of thing?

544
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,240
"This kind of thing"?

545
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,200
As in seeing you with someone else,

546
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,120
or seeing you get physically intimate with someone.

547
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,080
Of course, she's mad for it.

548
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,160
She really loves it.

549
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:32,560
She's really interested in what I do and whom I meet.

550
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,560
Yet she tells me not to get married.

551
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,840
And you're fine with that?

552
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,640
Doesn't that make you sad or upset in any way?

553
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,880
I can't say I like it, but it's nothing to complain about.

554
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,880
Why do you put up with that?

555
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,240
Well, she has a lot of money.

556
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,040
Guys, I'm loving the chemistry between you two.

557
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,240
I've got more butterflies than you!

558
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,800
Let's call it a day.

559
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,960
That's Curator Sung's private life.

560
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,480
It doesn't concern me.

561
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,320
It's none of my business.

562
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,920
- Your makeup looks great today. - Really?

563
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,440
Director, let's go.

564
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,480
Where?

565
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,640
We're already done with the photos, aren't we?

566
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,840
Director, have you never been in a relationship?

567
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,160
If you're going to do this, you should do it properly.

568
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,120
Let's go!

569
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,080
One!

570
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,400
Two!

571
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,800
Alright! Great, Choikang Judo!

572
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,000
Alright! Now do it properly.

573
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,000
- Kang Gun-woo! - Soy, yes soy!

574
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,960
It's not "soy".

575
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,160
Repeat after me. "Sir, yes sir".

576
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,760
Soy, yes soy!

577
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,720
- Sir! - Sir!

578
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,520
That's right.

579
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,000
Sir, yes sir!

580
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,040
Soy, yes soy!

581
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,120
Forget it.

582
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,240
By the way, why are you still here?

583
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,600
Your mom's waiting at home.

584
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,400
Mom says she's busy,

585
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,440
and told me to play with you.

586
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,080
Play with you?

587
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,880
Ugh, I told her I'm not a babysitter??

588
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,760
Why is your mom busy?

589
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,560
She's on a date.

590
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,360
What? On what?

591
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,000
D-A-T-E.

592
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,040
D-A-T-E.

593
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,360
Okay.

594
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,640
Alright, I'll explain the concept.

595
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,520
It's simple, really.

596
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,040
You guys will go on a date,

597
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,040
and I'll photograph you secretly, like a real paparazzi.

598
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,440
So don't you go looking for me, even if you can't see me.

599
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,160
Do we have to go this far?

600
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,560
Director Gold, have you never been in a relationship?

601
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,000
I have.

602
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,240
I've had many girlfriends, and many dates.

603
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,800
Right.

604
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,760
Then do exactly what you did those many times.

605
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,160
Let's go.

606
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,120
Come on!

607
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,920
Stop. Stop! Stop!

608
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,640
Hey, you call this a date?

609
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,040
You call this a date?

610
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,760
Why? What about this?

611
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,120
Right now, you two look like a couple that's been married for

612
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,360
30-40 years, and are out together

613
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,400
because they can't be bothered to cook at home.

614
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,160
And not just that, you look like you got into an argument.

615
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,240
How very detailed.

616
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,080
I mean, you're on a date!

617
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,040
- Something like this. - Hey!

618
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,400
Or??Something like that!

619
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,840
Hey.

620
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,000
Are you crazy? Just take pictures.

621
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,120
How can I just take pictures?

622
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,520
You need to deceive thousands of people.

623
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,680
Or at least hold hands.

624
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,200
Let's go. Go!

625
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,920
I look forward to working with you, Director.

626
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,080
I memorized both your names, so no need for further introduction.

627
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,080
If you don't want to hold hands,

628
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,120
how about we just walk together, side by side?

629
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,520
I'm the one who suggested this,

630
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,160
so let's do this properly while we're at it.

631
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,200
Yes, yes!

632
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,880
Yes! Yes!

633
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,880
Date??Date??

634
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,080
- One! - Ha!

635
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,480
- Two! - Ha!

636
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,120
Wow. There's a limit to the fangirl life and shielding.

637
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,160
Now she's given up on her life, has she?

638
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,360
Your call cannot be connected at this time. Please??

639
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,960
Oh, now you won't even answer my calls?

640
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,280
Why that?? Damnit!

641
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,080
Why isn't she picking up?

642
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,160
- One! - Ha!

643
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,120
- Two! - Ha!

644
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,160
Kang Gun-woo!

645
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,680
Soy, yes soy!

646
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,640
Um??

647
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,480
Hand me your phone.

648
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,640
- Two! - Ha!

649
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,240
(SOS)

650
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,840
- One! - Ha!

651
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,920
Done.

652
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,040
Now copy what they're doing.

653
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,120
Good! One more!

654
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,040
Yes!

655
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,400
That's very natural.

656
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,040
(Help me Choikang Judo Center)

657
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,760
Gun-woo??

658
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,040
(My Son)

659
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,040
What? What's wrong with this?

660
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,440
Duk??Duk??

661
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,080
Oh no, what do I do?

662
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,560
Oh no??Damnit!

663
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,280
Gun-woo??

664
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,880
Gun-woo.

665
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,920
Are you hurt? What happened?

666
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,160
I'm not hurt.

667
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,200
Where's Duk-mi?

668
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,640
But you texted Mommy.

669
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,720
Coach did.

670
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,440
You sent the text? Why?

671
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,440
You and Duk-mi wouldn't pick up, so I borrowed his phone.

672
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,560
So where's Duk-mi?

673
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,000
Where is she, and why are you here alone?

674
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,440
Why are you so desperate to know where she is?

675
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,160
It's not like you two are infatuated with each other.

676
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,520
Infatuated? Ha.

677
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,280
I just think she's idiotic, that's all.

678
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,040
She's out of her mind, right?

679
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,440
How could she go on a date with some man

680
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,000
just to cover up for an idol?

681
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,160
Then who else would she date, if not some man?

682
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,840
Wow??

683
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,080
You're the same.

684
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,080
As if not stopping her weren't enough.

685
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,680
Hold on, hold on.

686
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,520
So you're saying that you prank-called

687
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,400
a mother using her child's safety as bait?

688
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,200
Why you??

689
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,120
Uh, Mrs. Kang.

690
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,160
Your son is watching.

691
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,320
Gun-woo, close your eyes.

692
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,480
Gun-woo, don't close your eyes.

693
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,040
I'll see you later.

694
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:41,960
Let's go, Gun-woo.

695
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,800
What's Sung Duk doing, and where is she?

696
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,400
Gun-woo, go get changed.

697
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,120
Nam Eun-ki.

698
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,080
- You like Duk-mi, don't you? - Hey!

699
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,320
How could you say such a thing?

700
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,840
I'm just worried for her in a brotherly way, that's all.

701
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,760
Oh, don't give me that bullshit.

702
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,600
You're not even related. So what brother?

703
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,480
Listen.

704
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:11,120
To women, there are just two types of men.

705
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,560
Men you want to put up your guard against,

706
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,160
and men you don't want to put up your guard against.

707
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,280
But in order to be either one of those,

708
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,160
you need to first quit that brother-sister act.

709
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:25,320
Don't you think you're too old to play house?

710
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:33,720
That hand??

711
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,600
What's she saying?

712
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,480
Hey, you should've told us before you left.

713
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,920
What?

714
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,080
I see.

715
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,400
So Gun-woo's alright?

716
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,320
Alright, then.

717
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,520
I'll call you. Bye!

718
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,120
Director.

719
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,920
Sun-joo said she had to go because something came up.

720
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,760
What about the photos?

721
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,720
She says she took plenty.

722
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,240
- Then let's go. - Alright.

723
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,560
There are so many kids here.

724
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,440
This is great place to bring your kids.

725
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,200
Did you come here when you were a kid, too?

726
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,560
Of course.

727
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,920
I'm sure every boy and girl in Seoul has been here.

728
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,640
Director.

729
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,840
Why don't we stay a bit longer?

730
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
It's been a long time since I came to a theme park,

731
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,640
and you've only been going back and forth between

732
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,280
your house and the museum ever since you arrived in Korea.

733
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,280
- Plus the hospital. - Right.

734
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,800
Also, you never know.

735
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,880
Those girls over there could be Cha Si-an's fans.

736
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,520
It's like having witnesses.

737
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:11,480
Then let's make sure we have as many witnesses as possible.

738
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,560
Oh, I'm on selfie mode.

739
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,400
Director.

740
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,640
Why are you taking photos?

741
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,000
Director, smile!

742
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,840
Pose for me.

743
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:43,880
Just take selfies.

744
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,600
Well yes, this is a great place to take selfies.

745
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,440
Try this. Just this once.

746
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,440
- Is it off? - Yes, it's off.

747
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,000
Look at this. What you do, is??

748
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,120
You should get this off your hair first.

749
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,480
Lions!

750
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,320
A lion!

751
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:29,680
So cute.

752
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,160
Over here.

753
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,560
Have a seat.

754
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,120
Say "Lions!"

755
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,160
My name is Ryan.

756
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,960
Lion! Make a peace sign!

757
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,800
Lion, smile!

758
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,000
Don't smirk. I want a smile!

759
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:49,920
Can you take one for me, too?

760
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,840
Oh, sorry.

761
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,520
This reminds me of when I was still in school.

762
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,480
It's embarrassing to say this with my own mouth,

763
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:33,480
but I won many prizes at art competitions.

764
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,080
Anyway, I thought I'd major in art,

765
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,080
and naturally go onto becoming an artist.

766
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,240
Until one day,

767
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,880
when I suddenly broke my wrist right before the entrance exams.

768
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,120
I had to re-sit my college entrance exams.

769
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,040
Anyway, the doctor told me then

770
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,800
that I may not be able to use my wrist again

771
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,080
and it really scared me.

772
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,920
In case you may never be able to pick up a brush again?

773
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,280
Yes.

774
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,280
In retrospect,

775
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:09,240
that dark period became an asset, too.

776
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,200
How?

777
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,480
Because back then, my wish wasn't

778
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,600
"Let me get into an art college and become an artist."

779
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,680
It was just??

780
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:23,760
"Please let me be able to pick up a brush again."

781
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:27,280
Look.

782
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,760
It's not very professional,

783
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,000
but it's still nice, don't you think?

784
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,200
My name's not Lion.

785
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,280
It's a present.

Next!

790
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,720

Director.

794
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,920
You're the first man to throw me down like this.

795
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:41,880
Wow!

796
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,480
Uh??did you hurt your head?

798
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:06,520

What's your name?

803

Min-ho.

Min-ho, why don't you hold my hand, and??

805
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:31,080
Want to go look for your dad with me?

Director, over here.

808
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,880
I saw him last around here.

809
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,760
- The playground? - Yes, around here!

810
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:26,600
- Hey! Min-ho! - Daddy!

811
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:31,080
Are you alright? I was worried about you.

812
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,480
Are you hurt anywhere? Huh?

813
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,720
Let me see.

814
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,880
That's why I told you to stick close to me.

815

Director.

816
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,440
Did you say you don't like holding hands?

817
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,480
Oh.

818
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,120
But I didn't want to let go of that child's hand like that.

819
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,120
Why?

820
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,440
Because it reminded me of my past.

821
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,160
And it's not the hand holding that I don't like,

822
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,960
but the letting go, after you hold hands.

823
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,240
It feels as if all warmth has been drained,

824
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,160
and I'm left alone in this world.

825
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:23,360
So??You don't ever hold hands with anyone?

826
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,480
Well, I like holding hands very much.

827
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:34,120
Sun-joo says it gets worse when I'm drunk.

828
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,040
It's a drunk habit?

829
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,760
So, uh??

830
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,760
If you ever??

831
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:45,800
If you ever need a hand to hold onto,

832
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:49,080
and don't want to let go after holding onto it??

833
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,760
I'll lend you mine.

834
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,040
How nice.

835
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,160
Oh my!

836
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,960
Let me borrow just this much today.

837
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,360
Sure.

838
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,600
Thank you for taking me home.

839
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,840
It's a given. You're my girlfriend.

840
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,800
I had fun today.

841
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,120
Though it was just a pretend date.

842
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,200
I hope this solves everything.

843
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,320
As for the photos, I'll send them to that homepage master.

844
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,680
Alright.

845
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,600
I'll get going, then. See you tomorrow.

846
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,720
Gosh, talk about a pang of conscience.

847
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,360
God, you scared me!

848
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,440
Why are you so startled? Did you do something bad?

849
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,160
Do something bad?

850
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,320
This life is already a mess because of

851
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,960
all the bad things I did in my previous life.

852
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,840
That's why this time, I'm going to be super good.

853
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,560
Why doeos it have to be Lion?

854
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,000
What?

855
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,200
If you needed a fake boyfriend, anyone would do, right?

856
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,200
So why Director Gold?

857
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,960
When you have me.

858
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,280
Oh, I get it.

859
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:21,880
You need money, huh?

860
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:22,560
What?

861
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,000
I guess that was your chance.

862
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,120
To rip money off me by pretending to be my boyfriend.

863
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,120
Hey, what do you take me for?

864
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,120
Here, take this.

865
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,120
This is all I have right now.

866
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:34,520
If you need more, wait until my pay day.

867
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,520
That's not what I??

868
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,440
Editor Nam's going through tough times.

869
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:41,120
Let's be honest, art magazines don't make money anymore.

870
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:44,160
You may never get back the money you lent her.

871
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I didn't lend her that money. I gave it to her.

872
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,200
Whoa, what a filial son!

873
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,840
Anyway, if you need money??Tell me. But only small amounts.

874
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,600
For larger amounts, go to Sun-joo.

875
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,840
Just say it if you need money.

876
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,960
Why beat around the bush?

877
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:02,040
- What, are we unrelated? - Yeah, we're unrelated.

878
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,640
I'd love it if we were unrelated.

879
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:06,120
Let's be honest. Who'd believe it if we said we're dating?

880
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:10,440
You're really no help. No help at all!

881
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:11,440
See you.

882
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,800
Dear Ms. 'The Road to Si-an.'

883
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:25,640
I've attached the photos we took using the concept you suggested.

884
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,360
Thank you once again for accepting my request,

885
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:29,520
I understand it may have been a difficult decision.

886
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,000
P.S.

887
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,160
Please also find attached photos for proof.

888
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,160
Photos for proof?

889
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,040
Perfect.

890
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,560
Alright, should I get started, then?

891
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,120
What??What's with that look on my face?

892
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,800
I'm just so innocent!

893
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,360
My desires are just so??So innocent.

894
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,880
Gosh, it's hot in here.

895
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,080
(Photos to prove that Si-an's dating rumors are false)

896
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,360
Sindy's nothing but a pretentious liar.

897
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,360
She said that jacket's the only one in Korea!

898
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,280
Thanks to her, we've been branded a psycho fandom.

899
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:12,600
Is this for real?

900
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,920
T.R.T.S. is cleaning up Sindy's mess, isn't she?

901
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:19,760
Ugh!

902
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,360
They're dating??

903
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,200
but he sent her out alone?

904
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,000
Who is it?

905
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,360
Who's there?

906
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:55,680
Mr. Cha Si-an.

907
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:57,280
Yes.

908
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,400
Are you up?

909
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,440
Here's some water. You must be thirsty.

910
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,680
How did I get here?

911
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,520
How??

912
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,760
Based on what I witnessed yesterday,

913
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:37,440
from there to here??

914
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,080
You swam.

915
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:18,000
You took off your clothes by yourself,

916
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,360
and let's just say that blanket was to keep you warm.

917
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:21,840
Any other questions?

918
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:23,560
No.

919
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:25,560
That's a wise answer.

920
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:28,080
Well, get dressed. I need to go to work.

921
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:28,880
Sure.

922
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:45,480
Um??

923
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,480
You'll keep this a secret, right?

924
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:51,280
Brother.

925
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:55,080
Your cast??

926
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,280
It's supposed to be on your right arm.

927
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,400
Well, goodbye!

928
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:15,120
Why, Si-an?

929
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,720
Why!

930
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:28,120
Good morning.

931
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:33,680
Cu. Sung.

932
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:39,160
Do you know what Inuits do to vent out their anger?

933
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,440
- Inuits? - Yes.

934
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:46,040
When they are angry,

935
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:48,040
they just walk and walk.

936
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,040
Until their anger dissipates.

937
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:56,080
When it does, they mark that spot with a stick,

938
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,760
and turn back.

939
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,120
And as they head back, they get themselves together.

940
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:06,160
Cu. Sung. You were mad at me that day,

941
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,560
after I slapped you, right?

942
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,640
Yes. On that day??

943
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:15,080
However, I'm sure you'll control your anger wisely

944
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:18,680
like those Inuit people.

945
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,000
What do you think?

946
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,160
Is this enough?

947
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:35,040
Here's a stick with flowers!

948
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:44,440
Secretary Kim.

949
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,920
Orange!

950
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:50,080
As a means to apologize?

951
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:52,640
Good morning.

952
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:56,000
Curator Sung, we re-opened the web forum, and it's clean.

953
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,280
So clean!

954
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,080
And we didn't get one call today!

955
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,520
I'm sorry you had to go through all that.

956
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,600
Now that it's all been taken care of,

957
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,120
we can just go back to focusing on work.

958
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:09,280
But how could this happen, in just one day?

959
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,560
Well, you see??

960
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,160
S-Sindy?

961
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:25,560
Oh, this is our intern.

962
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:26,480
In??Intern?

963
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,520
We asked for an extra hand,

964
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,160
and Director Gold hired her, I guess.

965
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,400
Hello.

966
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,040
My name is Kim Hyo-jin, and I'll be working here today

967
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:36,600
as an intern at the Cheum Museum of Art.

968
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,800
I look forward to observing many things,

969
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,240
and confirming many things.

970
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,600
I'll be in your care.

971
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:47,600
What exactly does she want to observe and confirm?

972
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:55,640
Um??

973
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:58,680
There's something I've been keeping from you.

974
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,120
I'm dating Director Gold.

975
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:07,160
What did you just say?

976
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:11,480
He's my boyfriend!

977
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,360
- What? - What?

978
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,600
You??You've got to be kidding me.

979
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,040
No way!

980
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Honey!

981
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,520
(I'm sorry)

982
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:40,160
Oh my gosh!

983
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:41,920
(Her Private Life)

984
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:44,560
So I guess no one knew they were dating.

985
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,040
I'm going to set it all straight, even if it means

986
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,080
blowing your cover!

987
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:49,160
Director, I'd like to take up judo.

988
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:50,160
What's up with you?

989
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:52,760
Why are you so desperate to throw me down?

990
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:54,040
Do you like him?

991
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:56,360
More than you can imagine, yes.

A grown-up man should take full responsibility for

993
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,120
what he's done, and the consequences of his actions!

994
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,040
I understand it's awkward and embarrassing. Still??

995
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:02,360
Something's not right.

996
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,000
I'm going to reveal it, no matter what.

997
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,960

He's looking at someone he loves.
