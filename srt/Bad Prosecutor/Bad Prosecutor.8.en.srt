There's a National Prosecutor Generals' Conference at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

Hurry up and say what you need to say.

This is Prosecutor Jin. Call the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

The Prosecutor General won't be able to make it.

11
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:32,870
Mr. Kim Tae Ho, you are under immediate arrest for

12
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,080
concealing murder, instigated fabrication of evidence,

13
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,310
threatening, abduction, and attempted instigated murder.

14
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,770

I told you, didn't I?

17
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,050
You're done for now.

18
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,790
Why did you do it?

19
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,800
I'm asking out of pure curiosity.

20
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,990
What the hell

21
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:35,290
were you trying to gain by being loyal to someone,

22
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,640
to the point of throwing away your sense of duty as a prosecutor?

23
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,170
Sense of duty?

24
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,010
Did we ever have it in the first place?

25
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:54,760
We're nothing but hounds of the authority whose master changes every five years, aren't we?

26
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,560
I needed power because I wanted to break free.

27
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,450
To be a strong Prosecution that doesn't answer to anyone.

28
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:08,420
I needed the power to rise to a position where I could make that a reality.

29
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,970
To fight authority, you got help from another man in power?

30
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,570
It just sounds to me like you chose a different master.

There is a thing called a necessary evil.

32

I just did my best to protect the organization.

33
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,250
I wasn't wrong, Prosecutor Jin.

34
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,000
No. You were wrong.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,560
To protect the Prosecution?

36
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,940
Who are you to protect us?

37
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,870
Don't be mistaken, Mr. Kim Tae Ho.

38
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,940
Neither power nor positions protect us.

39
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,750
Only the law and the people protect us.

40
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,250
I'll prove to you

41
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,940
just how wrong that shallow conviction of yours is.

42
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,160
I'll show you how easily that so-called power you believe in

43
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,020
can crumble down.

44
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,260
You think you're right, don't you?

45
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,320
Even if each individual prosecutor is the same as a government office,

46
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,410
hierarchy still exists among prosecutors.

47
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:19,020
Even if obeying the higher order is a deeply rooted problem of the Prosecution,

48
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:23,190
it's a clear fact that it's the essential leading power of the Prosecution so far.

49
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:30,260
You probably think of yourself as righteous, but you're not, Prosecutor Jin.

When looking at the organization as a whole,

51
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,770

or a confounding species ruining us all. Nothing more, nothing less.

- She's the one.

168
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,140
- What?
- A normal person would've

169

at least closed their eyes in that situation,

170

but she didn't.

171

She didn't even bet an eye.

Well... I don't think he was ordinary, if anything.

262
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,780
He was quite the kid.

263
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,030
He'd fall from the fourth floor while hanging on the window

I thought I needed to take him to the hospital at first.

267
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:51,700

That's just like him.

269

He also got in a lot of fights.

270

He said fists were the answer to turn bad guys into humans.

271
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:07,400
He could never stand the sight of someone bullying the weak, whether it be a student or a teacher.

Her main missions were... anti-terror, punishment, and retaliation.

It's 11 o'clock. What about it?

505
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:16,330
If Tae Hyeong Wook really worked out at 11,

506

then the clock shown here shouldn't be 11 o'clock.

Then the actual time of Tae Hyeong Wook's workout was... one o'clock in the morning.

509

It's two hours after the Chief's death.

However, inferring that they're the same person just by the appearance from behind

is a little hasty, isn't it?

Oh, this?

652
00:49:50,817 --> 00:49:52,157
It's an MP3.

653
00:49:52,157 --> 00:49:53,197
An MP3?

654
00:49:53,197 --> 00:49:54,977
Do you also happen to have it with you as well?

655

He said that's what he was looking for.

657
00:50:13,307 --> 00:50:15,987
I think I'll need some explanations.

658

Please tell me.

659
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:28,577
Why do you have that with you, Director?

660
00:50:28,577 --> 00:50:30,657
Forget it. It's nothing.

- You want me to repeat it?

662

I said forget it because it's nothing.

Are you telling me to believe you?

What is it that one would kill a man for it?

Answer me because I'm really about to get pissed off.

Prosecutor Jin...

You asked about my family's whereabouts last time, right?

670
00:51:05,237 --> 00:51:07,787
They're dead. All of them.

An incident disguised as an accident.

00:51:11,697 --> 00:51:14,607
There was nothing I could do.

Is it the same one related to the incidents so far?

At the end of the day, you...

knew about everything and didn't tell me.

This isn't something for you to take part in, Jung.

677
00:51:36,777 --> 00:51:39,367
This is something I have to do alone.

Don't even call my name.

Listen to a person when he tells you something.

Do you think you're the only one like yourself here ever?

Do you?

683
00:51:59,307 --> 00:52:03,707
He's not someone you can just go against, ever.

684
00:52:03,707 --> 00:52:06,147
He can just kill you again if he tries.

685
00:52:06,147 --> 00:52:10,857
He can also make your mother and friends in there disappear without a trace.

Prosecutor Jin, I'm telling you for your sake.

I decline.

It's not like I didn't know from the beginning.

Pretending not to know something isn't my style.

I haven't told anyone yet.
