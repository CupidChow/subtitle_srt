What right do you have to take our suspects?

494
00:42:24,818 --> 00:42:28,111
They're core material witnesses for a top-secret investigation.

495

Please open up.

496

Even so, this is a bit...

What the hell do you mean, "this is a bit"?

498

Do you guys... even know what we have to testify to?

499
00:42:40,048 --> 00:42:41,628
This is an obstruction of an investigation.

500
00:42:41,628 --> 00:42:43,438
Open it up right now before I sue you!

501
00:42:43,438 --> 00:42:46,928
You can end up jobless while focusing on your performance.

502

Before the problem gets serious, take out your keys.

503

- Prosecutor Jin was kidnapped?
- By whom?

504
00:42:52,568 --> 00:42:53,948
One of two things is certain.

505
00:42:53,948 --> 00:42:56,448
It's either CEO Seo or ordered by CEO Seo.

506
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:58,218
We have to find Prosecutor Jin's location first.

507
00:42:58,218 --> 00:43:01,158
- The problem is how to find him-—
- Here.

508
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:03,838
This is a couple's app.

509
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:06,438
- Are you dating Jin Jung?
- Not yet.

510
00:43:06,438 --> 00:43:09,398
You have this when you're not even a couple?

511
00:43:09,398 --> 00:43:10,478
You installed it secretly.

512
00:43:10,478 --> 00:43:13,848
From what I know, she also installed it on your phone, Joong Do...

513
00:43:13,848 --> 00:43:15,118
It's a two-timer.

514
00:43:15,118 --> 00:43:17,238
Very nice for now. You did great.

515

Let's take off right away.

516
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:21,378
I installed it.

517
00:43:23,485 --> 00:43:25,318
Hell!

518
00:43:25,318 --> 00:43:28,388
This guy is finally looking down.

519
00:43:28,388 --> 00:43:30,648
You lasted a long time.

520
00:43:39,688 --> 00:43:42,908
Your face is badly beaten.

521
00:43:49,878 --> 00:43:52,458
In addition to the allegations so far,

522
00:43:54,128 --> 00:43:57,178
I'm adding kidnapping and instigated the assault.

523
00:43:58,018 --> 00:44:01,508
You really have no intention of changing your mind?

524
00:44:02,695 --> 00:44:05,268
I think you're too good to get rid of, Prosecutor.

525
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:07,238
Go f*** yourself.

526
00:44:08,945 --> 00:44:12,513
I'm getting curious at this point.

527
00:44:12,513 --> 00:44:16,908
What drove you to this point, Prosecutor Jin?

528
00:44:16,908 --> 00:44:18,668
My family upbringing.

529
00:44:20,258 --> 00:44:23,328
There's this saying that my father always used to tell me.

530
00:44:24,848 --> 00:44:27,688
I thought it was old-fashioned back then, but

531
00:44:29,658 --> 00:44:32,508
no other saying is more correct than that.

532
00:44:33,448 --> 00:44:36,358
"Anti-justice cannot beat justice."
 (T/N:"Jung" means justice in Korean)

533
00:44:38,378 --> 00:44:40,648
Anti-justice cannot beat justice?

534
00:44:45,158 --> 00:44:48,728
Do you consider yourself just, Prosecutor?

535
00:44:52,288 --> 00:44:55,548
It's what I realized from my experience in life,

536
00:44:55,548 --> 00:44:58,048
but what's really dangerous...

537
00:44:58,048 --> 00:45:01,618
isn't evil. It's justice.

538
00:45:01,618 --> 00:45:05,788
Evil is followed by a sense of guilt but not justice.

539
00:45:05,788 --> 00:45:07,708
As long as you're just,

540
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:11,088
you think you can do whatever you want to others.

541
00:45:11,088 --> 00:45:13,278
You drive people to the edge and

542
00:45:13,278 --> 00:45:16,788
you don't care how much you hurt them.

543
00:45:16,788 --> 00:45:19,628
Because you're just, you're right.

544
00:45:22,838 --> 00:45:27,128
Do you know when a person becomes the cruelest?

545
00:45:29,058 --> 00:45:33,228
It's when you believe you're just.

546
00:45:34,448 --> 00:45:36,488
Thinking you're the only righteous person

547
00:45:36,488 --> 00:45:38,878
with a deviated sense of justice

548
00:45:38,878 --> 00:45:41,828
is arrogance, Prosecutor Jin.

549
00:45:43,178 --> 00:45:45,988
You're greatly mistaken, CEO Seo.

550
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:50,638
I've never thought that I was right. Not even once.

551
00:45:50,638 --> 00:45:54,198
I just can't forgive people like you and

552
00:45:55,078 --> 00:45:58,128
I'm sure about you being wrong.

553
00:46:01,168 --> 00:46:03,598
I'm in a lot of pain right now.

I don't have the energy to talk, so leave.
