00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,120
Senior!

3
00:01:00,497 --> 00:01:02,970
Are you hurt anywhere? Are you okay?

4
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,290
Yes, I'm all right.

5
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,120
Please do me a favor.

6
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,650
This is a ledger with the list of drug buyers.

7
00:01:16,727 --> 00:01:18,230
They're all usernames.

8
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,650
The culprit is in there.

9
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,420
The one who killed Chief Prosecutor.

10
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,790
From two weeks before Chief Prosecutor's death until the day of the incident,

11
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,550
there were a total of five drug buyers.

12
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,810
Please confirm their identities.

13
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,580
All right. I'll look into it.

14
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,150
It's important, so please get this done as—

15
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,620
I think someone was on your tail.

16
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,550
Hey, you bastard!

17
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,530
- Get him!
- He's over there!

18
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,740
Hey, go block the exit!

19
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,760
The rest of you, come up!

20
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,990
Since when have you been tailing me?

21
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,200
Since you left the office.

22
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,790
Your lack of shame knows no bounds.

23
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,780
How can you be this brazen?

24
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,970
I should be the one saying this.

25
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,120
I heard Prosecutor General said that you...

26
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,200
should put all your effort into capturing Prosecutor Jin with me.

27
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,310
This is the end of your solo act, Shin Ah Ra.

28
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,690
We're a family, you know.

29
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,430
Family?

30
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,480
Us?

31
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,440
Don't even say that as a joke.

32
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,430
I'm disgusted just listening to it.

33
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,830
We'll see about that.

34
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,710
I'm sorry, Prosecutor.

35
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,930
I think we lost him.

36
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,720
That's interesting.

37
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,190
Hey!

38
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,120
Hey, come this way!

39
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,540
Where did he go?

40
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,390
Where the heck did he go?

41
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,880
Jung!

42
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,450
J-Jung...

43
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,700
Jung, get yourself together!

44
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,250
Jung!

45
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,460
Get yourself together.

46
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,670
Can you get up?

47
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,560
Let's go to the hospital.

48
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:10,710
Hang in there a bit longer. We're almost at the hospital.

49
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,510
We can't go to the hospital.

50
00:07:13,227 --> 00:07:14,690
The hospital will report me.

51
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,680
- We definitely can't—
- Is getting reported the issue here?

52
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,780
You're going to die!

53
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,170
Who is it?

54
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,920
Who's there?

55
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,600
He's bleeding too much.

56
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,170
Careful, careful now.

57
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,970
Luckily, he missed his organs.

58
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,990
The problem is that he lost too much blood.

59
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,540
His blood type is B.

60
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,860
What's your blood type?

61
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,850
- Hey.
- Yes?

62
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,720
- She's asking about your blood type.
- O-Oh, okay.

63
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,530
I-I'm t-type A.

64
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,500
Sitting around here won't solve anything.

65
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,260
- We should contact the hospital right away and—
- It's fine.

66
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,300
No need to do that.

You already know even if I don't tell you, right?

70
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,450
He needs to be at complete rest for a while.

71
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,880
Thank you.

72
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,530
Buy me a drink later if you're thankful.

73
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,660
Relationships are really a funny thing.

Thanks for your work. Get home safely now.

Hey, Park Jae Kyung!

It's not like I don't know what happened to you, but

isn't it about time for you to get back into things?

81
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,310
You didn't become a prosecutor to live like this forever, did you?

82
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,680
Wake up and pull yourself together.

83
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,930
Bye now.

84
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,560
What happened?

85
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,380
I'm not sure...

86
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,180
When I found him, he was already...

87
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,380
You must be tired. Get some sleep.

88
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,660
I'll look after that guy.

89
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,450
N-No, I'll keep nursing him.

90
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,690
You're Shin Ah Ra, right?

91
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,050
44th class of the training institute.

92
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,050
How do you know about me, Director?

93
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:38,570
How could I not know when you're next to Prosecutor General Kim Tae Ho?

94
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,110
Let's take our time with the talks later.

95
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,590
Get some sleep for now.

96
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,350
I'll bring you a blanket and a pillow.

97
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,420
Prosecutor Jin escaped the scene?

98
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,010
How?

99
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,990
I think Prosecutor Shin Ah Ra helped him.

100
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,850
Traces of blood were found at the scene,

101
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,880
but I think they were Prosecutor Jin's.

102
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,650
Looking at the shape and the amount of traces,

103
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:20,580
it seemed that somebody attacked Prosecutor Jin.

104
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,740
What?

105
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,820
Did you not know?

106
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,440
What about the attacker?

107
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,110
We're investigating right now.

108

Thank you.

I don't think your mom will stay quiet if she finds out you're the last in your class.

110
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:32,270
That's why... you need to go in and be my shield, Dad.

111
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,650
I'm scared of your mom, too.

112
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,010
Okay then.

113
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:43,000
I can sacrifice myself with no problem for my dear son.

114
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,330
What do we do, son?

115
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,370
I think I left my phone at the press.

116
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,560
Stop lying.

117
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,500
You're lying because you don't want to go in with me, huh?

118
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,000
Hey, don't you know that your daddy's a journalist?

Can't I come with you?

121

I will be right back. Stay here and eat your ice cream.

122

No, I want to come with you and look!

127
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,490
How's your wound?

128
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,730
- Did you seal it?
- It's okay. Everything's done.

129
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,520
So why would you go there alone?

130
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,370
You can never act on your own from now on.

131
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,020
Never, never again.

132
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,430
- Why are there so many shoes?
- Did I make you all worry?

133
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,590
- You're here?
- I'm sorry.

134
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,740
Oh, I brought these.

135
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,800
All right...

136
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,240
What's this?

137
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,130
This is gunpowder and lighter.

138
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,200
Hey, why did you bring them?

139
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,860
- This is the best way to sear the wound.
- Sear where?

140
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,550
Don't do it! Do it when you get hurt.

141
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,620
- Who are those people?
- I'm okay.

142
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,550
- Look, it barely brushed against it.
- The three siblings.

143

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,430
Prosecutor... did you at least see...

146
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,530
the face of the one that stabbed you?

147
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,280
I couldn't see the face, but...

148
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,080
I saw sterile gloves on the hands.

149
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,650
It's probably the same person.

150
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,240
The one that left the syringe at my house.

151
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,420
Why would that bastard... keep trying to kill you?

152
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,360
There must be a reason for trying to stop the investigation.

153
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,450
Something that must stay hidden even by killing a person.

154

I'll just follow you.

It's easy. Don't make it too complicated.

157

We catch and beat the crap out of the stabber or the planner...

158
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,550
Either of them, for sure.

159
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:05,250
Even better if we catch both of them.

160

00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,560
It's a warning, Prosecutor Shin.

168
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,060
In fact...

169
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:46,300
I also don't have the face to meet that kid.

170
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,670
What kind of Prosecutor General can't even cover up for a family member?

171
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,620
Prosecutor Jin probably understands.

172
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,780
I would be glad if that was the case.

173

How's Prosecutor Jin's body recovering?

174

Pardon?

175
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,950

Where is he right now?

177

How did you... know that Prosecutor Jin was attacked?

178
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,550
I got the report from Prosecutor Oh.

179
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,210
He said there were traces of Prosecutor Jin's blood at the scene

180
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,900
and that you took him to get him treated.

181
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:30,660
It'll be bad if the wound doesn't get treated and develop complications.

182
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,660
Never mind. Let's take Prosecutor Jin to the hospital right now.

183
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,470
That would be better.

184

Yes, it's me. Bring out the car.

185
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,120

186
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,590
Senior!

187
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:03,830
Don't tell anyone at the office about me being here.

188
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,400
Not even the Prosecutor General?

189

I don't trust anyone, but you, Senior.

191

I clearly gave you an order.

195

I can get the punishment for disobeying your order later.

196

After arresting everyone involved in this case.

197
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,110
How did it go?

198

There's no suspicious character in the call history.

199

They're all investigators or office-related people.

200

What about the mobile carrier location tracking?

201
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,600
About where they have been.

202
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,830
We did all that a long time ago.

203
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,210
But the broadcasting station's radius is too wide.

204
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,610
I don't think I can pinpoint a location.

205
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,990
We placed one of Eun Ji's guys as a tail,

206
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,910
but Prosecutor Oh is also, you know...

207
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,870
quite the player as well.

208
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,240
We really can't kidnap him?

209
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,080
No, we can't. Put away that idea.

210
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,000
It seems certain that there's a location where Prosecutor Oh meets the one behind the scenes.

211
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,550
The problem is...

212
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,710
how to find out that location.

213
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,550
That's... with a location tracker.

214
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,600
Come on. What if things go wrong, and we end up at Incheon again?

215

Maybe we can put it on his car, but not on him.

216

We can't even put it on his car, actually.

217

Wasn't his car smashed and is being repaired?

Look up the repair shop for Oh Do Hwan's wrecked car.
