811
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:34,950
Taking into account the cruelty of the crime,

812
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:38,430
total lack of any sign of remorse,

813
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:42,670
and the bereaved family's request for severe punishment,

814
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:47,610
the suspect, Kim Hyo Jun, is sentenced to twenty years in prison.

815
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:04,770
There was enough room for re-investigation.

816
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:07,230
Why did you forcefully press charges?

817
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:10,170
Because it was an appropriate press of charges?

818
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:15,650
I guess you were promised quite a big thing?

819
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:17,710
From Chief Lee Jang Won.

820
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:32,450
Sorry, but you can't enter the premises during probation.

821
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:35,180
Guard Han Dae Hun, please come to the security office.

822
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:36,990
Okay.

823
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,740
People are going to be surprised

824
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:50,700
to discover that the ace of our office, Oh Do Hwan,

825
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:55,780
is this rotten to the core...

826
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:59,570
making anybody a culprit just to climb up in his career?

827
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:03,170
You came all the way here to say that?

828
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:04,280
What?

829
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,370
I guess you have a lot of time nowadays, Prosecutor Shin,

830
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:09,190
to be nosy about someone else's case?

831
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:13,840
It's not being nosy, it's a matter of crossing a line, Prosecutor Oh.

832
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:18,840
If you're a Prosecutor who wears a suit of law, shouldn't you have some sense of conscience at least—

833
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:22,160
Why did you do that?

834
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:25,700
Answer me, you asshole!

835
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:27,480
Why did you do that?

836
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:34,390
Are you naive or just stupid?

837
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:35,980
What?

838
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:38,490
Hey.

839
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:40,680
What do you think the prosecution is about?

840
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,190
Justice? Truth? Human rights?

841
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:45,410
I hope that you're not seriously thinking that.

842
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:49,180
I swear that there's no one in here who wishes for those things

843
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:53,560
because this place is a place that can bury and rig any case

844
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,460
if that means you can get what you want!

845
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:58,730
A place that suspends prosecution on a crime if you know people and have a background.

846
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:00,100
A place that sacrifices the majority for the minority.

847
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:02,760
A place that strikes anyone who rebels against the profit of the organization.

848
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:07,810
A place where a defect like you, who rampages alone, can't ever survive!

849
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:13,280
That's... what the prosecution here is...

850
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,300
Prosecutor Jin.

851
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:25,420
Let's have a meeting with the Chief soon.

852
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:28,640
Just consider this as having paid your fees for a lesson.

853
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:31,750
Naive or stupid...

854
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:35,690
What?

855
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:38,420
Just what do you think of me?

856
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:46,010
Don't be mistaken. I know it all, too.

857
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:49,130
I know that you all call me a defect,

858
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:53,330
and that this place is rotten to the core, as you said.

859
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:55,730
Do you know what the problem is, though?

860
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:01,340
These assholes keep crossing the line because I keep pretending not to know.

861
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:04,310
Jin Jung, don't do it.

862
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:08,920
This time, you guys crossed the line way too far.

863
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:15,820
So this time, I'll... crush all the assholes like you guys.

864
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:06,280
[Bad Prosecutor]

865
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,610
I've been assigned to work here starting today. I'm Park Jae Kyung.

866
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:11,560
You need to speak, or this one will really drop you.

867
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:13,570
He's a guy who runs an entertainment establishment in Gangnam.

868
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:15,380
I think he's connected to Chief Lee Jang Won.

869
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:16,810
I'm going to call Jin Jung over.

870
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:18,530
I don't treat a bad guy as a human being.

871
01:03:18,530 --> 01:03:19,780
It's a search and seizure warrant.

872
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:21,900
How dare you, you arrogant bastard? Are you the Prosecutor General!

873
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:23,170
Chief Lee Jang Won... let's get him together.

874
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:24,680
Let's just make one thing clear.

875
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,140
Every operation will be carried out as I see fit.

876
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:27,820
Send Yoo Jin Chul off to China.

877
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:29,780
It's the 10 AM plane to Shanghai. Go and secure Yoo Jin Chul.

878
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:31,320
The plane already left, so this is it.

879
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:34,370
There's still a way. Let's just do something crazy for once.
