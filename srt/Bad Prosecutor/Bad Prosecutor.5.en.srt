00:13:53,944 --> 00:13:55,684
Get him!

168
00:13:57,124 --> 00:13:59,684
Get him! Stop there!

169
00:14:00,704 --> 00:14:02,984
There he goes!

170
00:14:02,984 --> 00:14:04,364
Corner him!

171
00:14:04,364 --> 00:14:06,544
What are you doing?

172
00:14:07,834 --> 00:14:09,094
Stop!

173
00:14:09,094 --> 00:14:10,804
Don't let him go!

174
00:14:16,374 --> 00:14:18,084
Follow him!

175
00:14:32,434 --> 00:14:34,134
Lee Chul Ki speaking.

176
00:14:36,114 --> 00:14:39,604
Oh, no... Are you okay?

177
00:14:40,604 --> 00:14:41,914
Yes.

178
00:14:43,184 --> 00:14:44,854
Yes.

179
00:14:44,854 --> 00:14:47,084
I'll be right there.

180
00:14:55,624 --> 00:14:58,114
- Is it Prosecutor Jin?
- No!

181
00:14:59,484 --> 00:15:01,444
How could that be?

182
00:15:01,444 --> 00:15:04,074
It's definitely not Prosecutor Jin.

183
00:15:04,074 --> 00:15:06,534
Are you a robot?

184
00:15:06,534 --> 00:15:08,674
Act properly if you're going to act or

185
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,784
answer the phone outside, man.

186
00:15:11,784 --> 00:15:14,464
That one has some loose gears.

187
00:15:16,254 --> 00:15:17,424
Get out.

188
00:15:17,424 --> 00:15:18,934
It's distracting.

189
00:15:20,994 --> 00:15:23,294
Get out, I said. You're distracting me!

190
00:15:23,294 --> 00:15:24,994
Thank you.

191
00:15:37,164 --> 00:15:38,794
Please come with us.

192
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:45,614
The police had already searched Prosecutor Jin's house...

193
00:15:45,614 --> 00:15:46,994
You never know, though.

194
00:15:46,994 --> 00:15:49,017
Perhaps something beneficial for Prosecutor Jin will come out.

195
00:15:49,017 --> 00:15:51,267
Let's head on over first.

196
00:15:55,091 --> 00:15:56,094
Hello, Manager.

197
00:15:56,094 --> 00:15:58,564
They said Prosecutor Jin disappeared.

198
00:15:58,564 --> 00:15:59,604
Sorry?

199
00:15:59,604 --> 00:16:01,204
[Unknown 010-247-1111]

200
00:16:08,474 --> 00:16:09,894
Hello?

201
00:16:13,424 --> 00:16:15,014
Yes, Prosecutor.

202
00:16:15,014 --> 00:16:16,804
Are you on the way?

203
00:16:18,184 --> 00:16:20,384
I'm sorry, Prosecutor.

204
00:16:20,384 --> 00:16:22,554
I don't think I can come.

205
00:16:23,614 --> 00:16:25,524
Prosecutor Oh Do Hwan is next to me! Please run away!

206
00:16:25,524 --> 00:16:27,374
Prosecutor Jin.

207
00:16:27,374 --> 00:16:29,914
You're only adding years to your sentence. Stop now and turn yourself in.

208
00:16:29,914 --> 00:16:31,564
I need to see the end of what I started.

209
00:16:31,564 --> 00:16:32,864
You're going to be caught anyway.

210
00:16:32,864 --> 00:16:34,774
You'll be the one getting caught, Prosecutor Oh.

211
00:16:34,774 --> 00:16:36,404
Wait for me.

212
00:16:36,404 --> 00:16:38,684
I'll come see you very soon.

213
00:16:45,144 --> 00:16:48,454
Investigations will continue without restraint.

214
00:16:48,454 --> 00:16:50,694
Leave your phone on at all times.

215
00:16:52,944 --> 00:16:55,634
Focus on arresting Prosecutor Jin for a while.

216
00:16:55,634 --> 00:16:57,244
Prosecutor General!

217
00:16:57,244 --> 00:17:01,644
- But Prosecutor Jin is—
- I know what you're going to say.

218
00:17:01,644 --> 00:17:04,494
I'm on the same page as you.

219
00:17:04,494 --> 00:17:06,004
However, Prosecutor Shin...

220
00:17:06,004 --> 00:17:08,754
you're a prosecutor, and I'm a prosecutor, too.

221
00:17:08,754 --> 00:17:11,374
Sometimes there's a need to trust and follow the organization's decision.

222
00:17:11,374 --> 00:17:14,574
Prioritize the organization's decision before the innocent person.

223
00:17:14,574 --> 00:17:15,834
Is that what you're saying?

224
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,804
It's for Prosecutor Jin's own good.

225
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:21,874
I don't understand what it is that's good for Prosecutor Jin!

226
00:17:26,904 --> 00:17:29,204
The press started to catch on.

227
00:17:29,204 --> 00:17:32,024
For now, I'm holding off the press for him.

228
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:35,334
Further down the road, no one knows what they're going to say about him.

229
00:17:37,454 --> 00:17:41,754
It's right to solve a problem within, not outside, right?

230
00:17:41,754 --> 00:17:45,054
Follow my orders on this one.

231
00:17:45,054 --> 00:17:49,764
Also... when Prosecutor Jin contacts you, persuade him to return.

232
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:53,344
I'll do my best on my end as well.

233
00:17:53,344 --> 00:17:55,284

[CEO Seo Hyeon Gyu]

235
00:18:00,824 --> 00:18:02,384
You may leave.

236
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:53,824
Hyeon Gyu.

237

Tae Ho.

238
00:19:03,054 --> 00:19:04,474
Yes.

239
00:19:05,304 --> 00:19:08,964
I understand you're busy after becoming the Prosecutor General,

240
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:13,014
but you still need to clean up your home.

241
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,114
Let's do a good job, okay?

242
00:19:20,374 --> 00:19:22,374
Yes, CEO.

243
00:19:22,374 --> 00:19:27,134
I've been thinking as to how I can help you.

244
00:19:27,134 --> 00:19:29,474
These are some guys who are good to use,

245
00:19:29,474 --> 00:19:32,744
so give them some seats and use them well.

246
00:19:34,454 --> 00:19:37,314
The Anti-Corruption and the Public Investigation.

247
00:19:37,314 --> 00:19:40,794
Those guys are exceptionally good with those things. They'll be helpful to you.

248
00:19:42,804 --> 00:19:45,424
CEO, this is still a little...

249
00:19:48,944 --> 00:19:50,694
Is there a need for you to go this far?

250
00:19:50,694 --> 00:19:53,104
I'm on your side, so why...

251
00:20:32,214 --> 00:20:34,404
You just want me as a figurehead?

252
00:20:35,264 --> 00:20:36,994
Damn...

253
00:20:39,324 --> 00:20:42,734
What about our internal and external CCTVs? Did they catch anything?

254
00:20:42,734 --> 00:20:44,044
Nothing at all.

255
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:45,564
What about the reports from the police agency?

256
00:20:45,564 --> 00:20:47,494
Even something like a card transaction history.

257
00:20:47,494 --> 00:20:49,134
Nothing from them yet.

258
00:20:49,134 --> 00:20:52,724
Since things like cards are sure to be tracked down.

259
00:20:59,594 --> 00:21:04,624
Investigator Park, there are people who work with Prosecutor Jin. A man and a woman.

260
00:21:04,624 --> 00:21:06,699
Please do a background check on them and find their personal information.

261
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:08,729
- As soon as possible.
- Okay.

262
00:21:09,954 --> 00:21:11,764
See you later.

263
00:21:17,991 --> 00:21:24,574
Miss... Come on, what the heck is this? It's so unspeakable.

264
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:28,887
The Big Boss is going to cry if he sees this.

265
00:21:30,434 --> 00:21:32,694
It's fine. They're my brothers.

266
00:21:39,804 --> 00:21:41,444
Ms. Baek Eun Ji?

267
00:21:43,444 --> 00:21:46,684
I'm from the Prosecution. Please come with us.

268
00:21:48,014 --> 00:21:50,124
Come on! Let go of this!

269
00:21:50,124 --> 00:21:52,394
Let go of me and talk to me!

270
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,154
You need to tell me what's going on first!

271
00:21:55,154 --> 00:21:58,054
Prosecutor Jin told you to do this, didn't he?

272
00:21:58,054 --> 00:22:01,844
I-I'll walk on my own feet.

273
00:22:01,844 --> 00:22:03,674
Hey, get him!

274
00:22:03,674 --> 00:22:05,624
W-Wait, wait a minute. No...

275
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,984
You're here because of that, right? Last week...

276
00:22:08,984 --> 00:22:11,899
T-The text messages that I hacked!

277
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:19,237
I apologize for using rough means.

278
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:21,760
The summons takes a long time, so...

279
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,320
Also, you two are not the type to come, even if I send the summons.

280
00:22:26,307 --> 00:22:28,177
Let me introduce myself formally.

281
00:22:28,177 --> 00:22:32,147
I'm Prosecutor Shin Ah Ra of Central District Prosecutors' Office Criminal Division 3.

282
00:22:36,787 --> 00:22:38,317
Baek Eun Ji.

283
00:22:45,067 --> 00:22:46,947
I'm Go Joong Do.

284
00:22:51,807 --> 00:22:53,747
Okay.

285
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,777
Why did you need us?

286
00:22:55,777 --> 00:22:58,537
Let me be brief and cut to the chase.

287
00:22:59,827 --> 00:23:04,587
Prosecutor Jin has been cornered as the suspected murderer of Chief Lee Jang Won.

288
00:23:04,587 --> 00:23:06,747
- What?
- What the...?

289
00:23:28,057 --> 00:23:29,887
I told you that I'll come see you soon.

290
00:23:29,887 --> 00:23:32,937
Who's the bastard that framed me?

291
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:36,997
Answer me.

292
00:23:36,997 --> 00:23:41,737
If you knew... What could you do if you knew?

293
00:23:41,737 --> 00:23:46,367
A criminal being chased for murder allegations. That's who you are right now.

294
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:48,887
Also, didn't I tell you already?

295
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:51,557
You're going to be caught anyway.

296
00:23:54,007 --> 00:23:55,827
Who is it?

297
00:23:55,827 --> 00:23:57,707
Step on it.

298
00:23:57,707 --> 00:23:59,157
Step on it if you don't want to die.

299
00:23:59,157 --> 00:24:00,927
What's going on?

300
00:24:02,177 --> 00:24:04,127
Step on it, punk!

301
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:12,457
He escaped from the Prosecutors' Office while being interrogated.

302
00:24:12,457 --> 00:24:15,107
So we're now searching for Prosecutor Jin.

303
00:24:15,107 --> 00:24:17,617
At this rate, Prosecutor Jin will be expelled and

304
00:24:17,617 --> 00:24:20,447
there will even be public wanted orders.

305
00:24:20,447 --> 00:24:22,887
Have you been contacted by him, perhaps?

306
00:24:22,887 --> 00:24:26,227
Or is there any way to locate him?

307
00:24:26,227 --> 00:24:28,687
I-I don't know.

308
00:24:31,277 --> 00:24:33,647
Prosecutor Jin has been located!

309
00:25:46,427 --> 00:25:49,257
Let's go, Buddy.

310
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:50,897
Come here.

311
00:25:51,607 --> 00:25:53,137
What's wrong?

312
00:25:53,777 --> 00:25:55,067
What—

313
00:26:21,897 --> 00:26:23,697
Have you eaten?

314
00:26:37,727 --> 00:26:39,477
Hey.

315
00:26:39,477 --> 00:26:40,887
Yes?

316
00:26:40,887 --> 00:26:44,157
Eat slowly. I'm getting indigestion from just watching you.

317
00:26:48,387 --> 00:26:51,537
Look how happy you are. With a hole in your head.

318
00:26:51,537 --> 00:26:54,027
The kimchi tastes good.

319
00:26:54,027 --> 00:26:55,077
What?

320
00:26:55,077 --> 00:26:57,317
The kimchi tastes good.

321
00:26:57,317 --> 00:26:58,527
- It tastes good?
- Yes.

322
00:26:58,527 --> 00:27:00,347
Is that so?

323
00:27:00,347 --> 00:27:01,917
Eat up, then.

324
00:27:03,817 --> 00:27:06,517
The pickled radish doesn't taste good.

325
00:27:10,817 --> 00:27:12,657
Framed?

326
00:27:17,187 --> 00:27:18,987
That's that, then.

327
00:27:18,987 --> 00:27:20,947
What are you going to do now?

328
00:27:22,257 --> 00:27:23,917
I'm going to find it and show them.

329
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:25,847
That they messed with the wrong person

330
00:27:25,847 --> 00:27:28,827
regardless of who they are.

331
00:27:28,827 --> 00:27:30,807
Your fighting spirit is there.

332

From two weeks before Chief Prosecutor's death until the day of the incident,

657
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:34,368
there were a total of five drug buyers.

658
00:55:34,368 --> 00:55:36,818
Please confirm their identities.

659
00:55:36,818 --> 00:55:39,468
All right. I'll look into it.

660
00:55:39,468 --> 00:55:41,618
It's important, so please get this done as-

661
00:55:44,928 --> 00:55:47,088
I think someone was on your tail.

662
00:55:49,348 --> 00:55:51,238
Damn it!

663
00:56:04,448 --> 00:56:06,298
Hey, you bastard!

664
00:56:07,368 --> 00:56:10,328
Go down, go down! Go down!

665
00:56:13,888 --> 00:56:15,658
Hey, punk, get in here!

666
00:56:15,658 --> 00:56:17,388
Go back up!

667
00:56:29,478 --> 00:56:30,928
Damn it.

668
00:57:04,248 --> 00:57:06,248
That little!

669
00:57:13,828 --> 00:57:15,918
- Hey, you!
- Stop!

670
00:57:18,488 --> 00:57:20,858
Oh, God.

671
00:57:20,858 --> 00:57:22,278
That crazy nut!

672
00:57:22,278 --> 00:57:24,218
Hey, come.

673
00:57:24,218 --> 00:57:26,418
You can't come, can you?

674
00:57:26,418 --> 00:57:28,088
- You can do it!
- Hold on, hold on.

675
00:57:28,088 --> 00:57:30,458
- I'm coming for you!
- You're coming?

676
00:57:30,458 --> 00:57:32,818
Don't. Don't do it. It's dangerous.

677
00:57:38,308 --> 00:57:40,108
Are you okay?

678
00:57:41,768 --> 00:57:43,748
Don't do it! Don't do it!

679
00:57:43,748 --> 00:57:45,438
I said, don't come!

680
00:57:45,438 --> 00:57:48,188
Hey, get him!

681
00:57:50,538 --> 00:57:52,228
- Hey, stop!
- Hey!

682
00:57:52,228 --> 00:57:54,178
Hey, bastard! Stop right there!

683
00:57:54,178 --> 00:57:56,038
Get him!

684
00:58:06,738 --> 00:58:08,478
Hey, stop right there!

685
00:58:12,708 --> 00:58:14,178
Hey, stop!

686
00:58:14,178 --> 00:58:16,488
Hey! Catch him, catch him!

687
00:58:20,478 --> 00:58:23,098
Whoa! God.

688
00:58:24,578 --> 00:58:25,978
Stop!

689
00:58:27,868 --> 00:58:29,698
Shit...

690
00:58:31,078 --> 00:58:33,888
Hey...

691
00:58:33,888 --> 00:58:35,548
Man!

692
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:06,208
Hey! Come here!

693
00:59:10,408 --> 00:59:12,258
What the hell?
