No, it wasn't.

303
00:24:18,532 --> 00:24:23,285
CEO Seo attempted to rob Chief Lee of the evidence of a crime, so

he ordered a person to murder him and disguise his death.

305

He then ordered me to fix up the case.

318
00:25:10,205 --> 00:25:13,425
I directly ordered you to fix up the case...

319
00:25:13,425 --> 00:25:16,685
as a suicide on that day?

320
00:25:18,865 --> 00:25:20,905
His death was really a waste, though.

321
00:25:20,905 --> 00:25:25,435
Chief Lee Jang Won. It seemed as though it was concluded as a suicide on the news.

322
00:25:25,435 --> 00:25:27,855
Lee Jang Won did kill himself, right?

323
00:25:35,305 --> 00:25:37,695
If it's hard for you to answer,

324
00:25:37,695 --> 00:25:40,265
I'll change my question.

325
00:25:41,925 --> 00:25:45,765
Did I ever... mention framing someone or

326
00:25:45,765 --> 00:25:49,855
fabricating the case even once?

327
00:25:49,855 --> 00:25:52,455
You didn't mention it directly per se, but...

328
00:25:52,455 --> 00:25:54,475
I think there was enough intent.

00:25:54,475 --> 00:25:58,925
Since when was the court a place for discussing intent?

330
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:01,405
You don't even have evidence, such as a video or voice recording.

331
00:26:01,405 --> 00:26:04,115
And your testimony also lacks credibility.

332
00:26:04,115 --> 00:26:05,915
In the end, are you not...

333
00:26:05,915 --> 00:26:08,225
blaming me for a crime you committed...

334
00:26:08,225 --> 00:26:11,575
voluntarily out of loyalty?

335
00:26:16,035 --> 00:26:18,045
This is all, Your Honor.

336
00:26:27,765 --> 00:26:30,965
We'll continue with the examination of witnesses.

337
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:32,795
Prosecution.

338
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:41,095
You're currently imprisoned at the detention center for allegations

339
00:26:41,095 --> 00:26:44,085
of murdering Chief Lee and attempted murder of me.

340
00:26:44,085 --> 00:26:45,715
Is that true?

341
00:26:45,715 --> 00:26:47,235
Yes. That is correct.

342
00:26:47,235 --> 00:26:51,445
During the investigation by the Prosecution, you didn't confess your motive for the crimes.

343
00:26:51,445 --> 00:26:54,415
Could you tell us here at this moment?

344
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:04,025
There will be a trial on CEO Seo soon.

345
00:27:04,025 --> 00:27:06,255
Cooperating with us...

346
00:27:06,255 --> 00:27:10,015
is the only way for you to reduce your sentence even by a little.

347
00:27:10,015 --> 00:27:12,705
Even if I do cooperate...

348
00:27:12,705 --> 00:27:14,485
you guys can't get that man.

349
00:27:14,485 --> 00:27:18,875
Did you already forget... who our prosecutor is?

350
00:27:20,915 --> 00:27:22,845
I was ordered to kill...

351
00:27:24,615 --> 00:27:28,225
Chief Lee Jang Won and Prosecutor Jin Jung...

352
00:27:29,475 --> 00:27:31,875
from CEO Seo Hyeon Gyu.

353
00:27:34,545 --> 00:27:36,125
That's all.

354
00:27:39,615 --> 00:27:43,405
Witness, do you do drugs by any chance?

355
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:48,525
There was a trace... of you buying drugs on the SNS.

356
00:27:48,525 --> 00:27:52,885
Your Honor, the defendant's question is irrelevant to this trial.

357
00:27:52,885 --> 00:27:57,425
It's a question to dispute the credibility of her testimony.

358
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:00,265
Prosecutor's objection is denied.

359
00:28:00,265 --> 00:28:02,285
Proceed, Defendant.

360
00:28:02,285 --> 00:28:04,475
Let me ask you again, Witness.

361
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:10,000
Is it a fact that you purchased a substance from a drug dealer?

362
00:28:15,585 --> 00:28:17,955
Yes. I do have.

363
00:28:17,955 --> 00:28:19,745
But that was...

364
00:28:19,745 --> 00:28:21,575
I'd like to submit the

365
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:25,475
books that show Ms. Tae Hyeong Wook's purchase of drugs from the dealer,

366
00:28:25,475 --> 00:28:29,515
her SNS conversations and...

367
00:28:29,515 --> 00:28:32,595
the purchase history as evidence.

368
00:28:49,835 --> 00:28:51,415
Defendant.

369
00:28:51,415 --> 00:28:53,915
Do you know where this place is?

370
00:28:53,915 --> 00:28:56,025
Yes, I do.

371
00:28:56,025 --> 00:29:00,975
This is the secret storage of the data about the cases you concealed and fabricated...

372
00:29:00,975 --> 00:29:03,875
also known as the "Library."

373
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,585
Is that true?

374
00:29:06,665 --> 00:29:09,175
There is no such fact.

375
00:29:10,945 --> 00:29:13,315
The case names that are written here...

376
00:29:13,315 --> 00:29:16,435
Are they the cases you were in charge of?

377
00:29:16,435 --> 00:29:17,625
Yes.

378
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:20,405
They're cases I took charge of.

379
00:29:20,405 --> 00:29:23,755
It was a case that caused a huge commotion in Korea in the past.

380
00:29:23,755 --> 00:29:27,705
[Humidifier Sterilizer Destruction of Evidence]
The Humidifier Sterilizer case... that produced hundreds of victims.

381
00:29:31,255 --> 00:29:35,905
Do you remember Mr. Jo Byeong Soo, who was the defendant at the time?

382
00:29:35,905 --> 00:29:38,915
I'm not sure because it's been too long.

383
00:29:40,165 --> 00:29:42,895
We have here a statement written by Mr. Jo Byeong Soo

384
00:29:42,895 --> 00:29:45,025
who was a manager at the research company then,

385
00:29:45,025 --> 00:29:49,075
saying he received hundreds of millions won... to be tried in court

386
00:29:49,075 --> 00:29:51,785
instead of the actual person in charge in his own handwriting.

387
00:29:51,785 --> 00:29:55,165
Defendant... didn't you get this memorandum...

388
00:29:55,165 --> 00:29:59,595
out of Mr. Jo Byeong Soo after you threatened and convinced him?

389
00:29:59,595 --> 00:30:01,805
No, I didn't.

390
00:30:01,805 --> 00:30:04,635
Then why did you have these documents?

391
00:30:04,635 --> 00:30:07,125
Why did you suddenly relocate your document storage...

392
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:10,015
right on the day search and seizure by the Prosecution began?

393
00:30:10,015 --> 00:30:12,425
It's just a coincidence.

394
00:30:12,425 --> 00:30:15,815
I was just trying to discard old documents and

395
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:18,875
didn't even know about the issuance of the warrant.

396
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:21,955
Also, I didn't even know such contents were in those files.

397
00:30:21,955 --> 00:30:25,155
Wasn't this your private space, Defendant?

398
00:30:25,155 --> 00:30:28,805
How could contents unknown to you be stored there?

399
00:30:28,805 --> 00:30:30,965
When you work as an attorney for a long time,

400
00:30:30,965 --> 00:30:35,295
you inevitably create... many enemies along the way.

401
00:30:35,295 --> 00:30:37,535
I'm guessing it might be the work of...

402
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:39,575
someone who held me in spite,

403
00:30:39,575 --> 00:30:42,645
to put me in a tight spot.

404
00:30:57,235 --> 00:31:01,035
You and I have met at the Library before.

405
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:04,065
I don't remember.

406
00:31:04,065 --> 00:31:07,405
You pointed a gun at me there, Defendant.

407
00:31:07,405 --> 00:31:11,215
Attorney Oh Do Hwan of Law Firm Kangsan was there as well and

408
00:31:11,215 --> 00:31:15,775
you instigated Secretary Kang Shin Jo to murder Attorney Oh and me.

409
00:31:15,775 --> 00:31:18,035
Do you admit that?

410
00:31:18,035 --> 00:31:20,725
They're baseless claims.

411
00:31:20,725 --> 00:31:22,755
I won't answer those kinds of questions.

412
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:25,435
You killed Prosecutor Park Jae Kyung, Defendant.

413
00:31:25,435 --> 00:31:27,045
Was it because of the MP3?

414
00:31:27,045 --> 00:31:28,835
Prosecutor! This is a warning.

415
00:31:28,835 --> 00:31:32,765
Because the contents inside it mustn't be exposed to the world?

416
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:35,305
Did you commit such an act because no one should

417
00:31:35,305 --> 00:31:37,575
know that you're a crazy psychopathic murderer?

418
00:31:37,575 --> 00:31:39,525
This is the court, Prosecutor.

419
00:31:39,525 --> 00:31:41,495
Mind your statements.

420
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:45,365
Prosecutor! Let go of the mic and stand back!

421
00:31:45,365 --> 00:31:47,205
This is your last chance.

422
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:49,255

You've crossed the line, you little brat.

I warned you. Go back to your seat!

426

You can't beat me.

427
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:03,905
Haven't you run out of witnesses?

Yes, he's here.

492
00:37:20,525 --> 00:37:25,215
It's CEO Seo who's sitting over there.

493
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:32,885
CEO Seo killed my family...

494
00:37:32,885 --> 00:37:34,405
and, on top of that,

495
00:37:34,405 --> 00:37:36,705
he also tried to kill me...

496
00:37:37,965 --> 00:37:40,455
to bury his crimes.

497
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:45,125
A trial is a process of excavating the factual truth of an incident and

498
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:48,905
testimonies at a court are vital proof for confirming the facts.

499
00:37:48,905 --> 00:37:52,995
Prosecutor Park's credibility is easily fulfilled by his position and

500
00:37:52,995 --> 00:37:54,799
please consider that there's no contradiction

501
00:37:54,799 --> 00:37:59,872
or logical errors in the testimonies of all witnesses so far.

502
00:38:04,685 --> 00:38:08,635
Defendant, is there anything you want to say?

503
00:38:11,465 --> 00:38:18,825
The witness' testimony doesn't secure any level of credibility.

504
00:38:18,825 --> 00:38:22,815
I'm submitting evidence to substantiate Prosecutor Park's testimony.

505
00:38:24,475 --> 00:38:27,655
There's no other evidence enlisted here.

506
00:38:27,655 --> 00:38:29,645

509

I'm submitting the blunt weapon the defendant used to attack the witness as evidence.

510
00:38:53,282 --> 00:38:56,195
Seo Hyeon Gyu will surely try to take this from me.

511
00:38:56,195 --> 00:39:00,555
You take care of it for me until we get Seo Hyeon Gyu to stand trial.

512
00:39:05,245 --> 00:39:08,355
He'd be more suspicious if he found out you don't have the evidence.

513
00:39:08,355 --> 00:39:10,995
It's an easily obtainable item.

514
00:39:13,295 --> 00:39:15,755
Made in Dongmyo. 9,700 won.

515
00:39:21,965 --> 00:39:25,375
It's evidence that wasn't agreed upon.

516
00:39:26,215 --> 00:39:27,725
I can't accept it.

517
00:39:27,725 --> 00:39:31,435
You're the one who talked about credibility, Defendant.

518
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:32,865
That evidence won't work.

519
00:39:32,865 --> 00:39:34,975
That evidence is fake.

520
00:39:34,975 --> 00:39:38,815
The Prosecution is mocking the court with fake evidence.

521
00:39:38,815 --> 00:39:41,555
What's your reason for claiming that the evidence is fake?

522
00:39:41,555 --> 00:39:43,755
Did you try to destroy the evidence or something?

523
00:39:43,755 --> 00:39:45,565
That's certainly not true.

524
00:39:45,565 --> 00:39:48,255
I'm submitting another piece of evidence.

525
00:39:52,245 --> 00:39:54,775
I'm attaching the NFS report stating that

526
00:39:54,775 --> 00:40:00,258
the defendant's fingerprints and the witness' blood were found simultaneously.

527

530

from this moment on applying for the avoidance of justice challenge.

531
00:40:19,645 --> 00:40:21,725
I'm worried about an unfair trial because...

of the witness and evidence that were not agreed upon.

533
00:40:24,305 --> 00:40:28,235
- Pause the trial immediately and—
- Enough is enough!

534
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,925
Defendant Seo Hyeon Gyu is not an attorney.

535
00:40:35,925 --> 00:40:38,655
He's just a criminal who filled his greed and wealth

536
00:40:38,655 --> 00:40:42,115
by concealing powerful people's crimes using the law.

537
00:40:42,115 --> 00:40:43,615
Defendant Seo Hyeon Gyu cruelly...

538
00:40:43,615 --> 00:40:46,385
took the lives of people who dared to

539
00:40:46,385 --> 00:40:49,855
stand in his way, whoever it is.

540
00:40:49,855 --> 00:40:52,765
He committed crimes using his status as an attorney...

541
00:40:52,765 --> 00:40:56,015
and used the law to conceal those crimes.

542
00:40:56,015 --> 00:40:58,875
He allowed criminals not to be punished...

543
00:40:58,875 --> 00:41:01,975
and solidified his power.

544
00:41:01,975 --> 00:41:04,025

The law is fair to everyone.

546
00:41:06,185 --> 00:41:08,705
No one can cheat the law.

547

Regardless of position,

authority and state of being,

549
00:41:12,015 --> 00:41:15,255
no one is allowed to stand above the law.

550
00:41:15,255 --> 00:41:17,578
Because the moment you let someone be an exception,

551
00:41:17,578 --> 00:41:21,178
the law loses its worth of existence as the law.

552
00:41:21,965 --> 00:41:25,535
The law exists to protect the people.

Clearly stating that it can't be used to benefit a particular individual,

554
00:41:33,085 --> 00:41:36,785
this prosecutor sentences the defendant Seo Hyeon Gyu as follows.

555
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:41,705
He's been manipulating countless cases and mocking the judiciary.

556
00:41:41,705 --> 00:41:47,105
In the process, he has committed terrible crimes such as murder and instigated murder.

557
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:50,600
He was consistent with lies and sophistry throughout the trial

558
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,035
and showed no sign of remorse.

559
00:41:53,035 --> 00:41:55,035
And including the fact that the bereaved families of the victims

560
00:41:55,035 --> 00:41:58,145
and the victims are demanding severe punishment,

561
00:41:58,145 --> 00:42:00,805
I request that the court...

562
00:42:00,805 --> 00:42:02,545
sentences the defendant Seo Hyeon Gyu

563
00:42:02,545 --> 00:42:05,525
to death, the capital punishment.

564
00:42:20,392 --> 00:42:24,255
In the trial of Seo Hyung Gyu, CEO of Gangsan Law Firm this afternoon,

565
00:42:24,255 --> 00:42:27,715
the prosecution demanded the death penalty, the gravest sentence in the court.

566

In addition, Seo Hyung Gyu's son Seo Ji Han

567
00:42:30,185 --> 00:42:32,465
has been found to be the real culprit of the Seocho-dong murder,

568

have been revealed through the incident, sparking a major stir.

571
00:42:42,895 --> 00:42:47,185
The court announced that it will conduct a full investigation of the cases from Kangsan law firm

572
00:42:47,185 --> 00:42:50,265
and will conduct retrials as necessary.

00:59:45,939 --> 00:59:47,719
Hey, get him!

818
00:59:47,719 --> 00:59:50,519
- Hurry, hurry!
- Got it? Just you.

819
00:59:50,519 --> 00:59:52,219
Look.

820
00:59:52,219 --> 00:59:53,689
Okay?

821
00:59:53,689 --> 00:59:55,079
Die!

822
00:59:57,409 --> 00:59:59,139
Don't come. Don't come!

823
00:59:59,139 --> 01:00:01,399
- At once! All at once!
- Don't come.

824
01:00:01,399 --> 01:00:03,299
- He's strong!
- Hey, stay put!

825
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:05,409
Why should we stay put?

826
01:00:05,409 --> 01:00:06,989
Whoa, whoa! Hey!

827
01:00:06,989 --> 01:00:09,529
- Hey, he's coming here!
- Whoa!

828
01:00:12,759 --> 01:00:14,459
- Hey!
- Whoa, hold on.

829
01:00:14,459 --> 01:00:15,959
- Where are you going? Come here.
- I can't, I can't!

830
01:00:15,959 --> 01:00:17,349
Get him!

831
01:00:17,349 --> 01:00:18,609
D*** it!

832
01:00:20,289 --> 01:00:22,799
- Come here.
- Hold on, hold on!

833
01:00:24,149 --> 01:00:25,909
I mean...

834
01:00:27,399 --> 01:00:28,759
Let's talk it out.

835
01:00:31,629 --> 01:00:33,209
What's wrong?

836
01:00:39,879 --> 01:00:42,089
♫ Let the best man win! ♫

♫ I pay back crap with a s*** ♫

839
01:00:47,749 --> 01:00:50,039
♫ Magic of the real sword, I dig into all the hideouts ♫

840
01:00:50,039 --> 01:00:52,549
♫ This ahjumma told me to write one more letter of apology ♫

841
01:00:52,549 --> 01:00:55,259
♫ The protagonist does the work here
and issues the arrest warrant ♫

842
01:00:55,259 --> 01:00:57,219
♫ An unfathomable crazy prosecutor ♫

843
01:00:57,219 --> 01:00:58,699
♫ Rip the subpoena ♫

844
01:00:58,699 --> 01:01:01,999
♫ You'd rather live in your fantasy, lock up all the bad guys ♫

845
01:01:01,999 --> 01:01:04,339
♫ Consider the circumstances my a**, beat
the hell out of the underling ♫

846
01:01:04,339 --> 01:01:06,159
♫ I hold a sword, but doesn't mean I'm a swordsman ♫

847
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:09,009
♫ Full of ambition, up to death's door, why not the drama? ♫

848

850
01:01:13,389 --> 01:01:15,219
How did it go?

851
01:01:15,219 --> 01:01:18,189
He says you should stay on the down low for now.

852
01:01:18,189 --> 01:01:19,429
For how long?

853
01:01:19,429 --> 01:01:21,209
Until Prosecutor Jin is taken care of.

854
01:01:21,209 --> 01:01:23,299
Tell Chairman Park.

855
01:01:23,299 --> 01:01:27,149
Stop annoying me and get me out of here first!

856
01:01:27,149 --> 01:01:30,329
And Chairman also wants to tell you this.

857
01:01:30,329 --> 01:01:32,129
"Stay quiet."

858
01:01:32,129 --> 01:01:34,849
If you don't want to retire permanently.
