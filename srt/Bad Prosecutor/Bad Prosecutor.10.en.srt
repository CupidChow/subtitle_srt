Additionally, to cover up this incident, the defendant

destroyed the evidence, bribed, and threatened the victims.

It's a request.

166
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:20,689
Your ass must be on fire

167
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:23,849
for you to be coming all the way here to get a useless item.

168
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,849
What's inside must surely be frightening for you.

169
00:12:30,252 --> 00:12:32,272
Wow...

170
00:12:33,956 --> 00:12:36,939
He would've been about 30 by now...

171
00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:38,539
if Joon Soo was still alive, right?

172
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:40,819
- This son of a—
- Prosecutor Jin!

173
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:46,299
Just go back.

174
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,239
You're soiling the taste of liquor.

175
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:53,559
Prosecutor Jin...

176
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:56,609
could you please excuse us for a moment?

177
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:06,309
You're not the obedient type, huh?

178
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:09,409
Your mother must've had a hard time.

179
00:13:11,619 --> 00:13:14,029
[Jung's Barbecue]

180
00:13:27,929 --> 00:13:32,409
Do you... call your mom often?

181
00:13:47,449 --> 00:13:50,359
[Mother]

182
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:55,279
Answer.

183
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,459
[Mother]

184
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:00,189
Please answer.

185
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:01,869
Answer!

186
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:04,839
Mom, answer, please!

187
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:13,499
Mom!

188
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:15,709
Yes, Son!

189
00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:21,579
The car behind you. The car!

190
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:29,889
- Oh, gosh...
- Are you okay, Mom?

191
00:14:30,756 --> 00:14:34,889
That damn bastard! How dare you drive like that?

192
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:36,969
- Come on, get up.
- Goodness, seriously.

193
00:14:36,969 --> 00:14:39,109
- I-It hurts, it hurts.
- Why?

194
00:14:39,109 --> 00:14:42,139
- Where? Do you think you got injured?
- Yes.

195
00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:47,729
I only told them to say hi...

196
00:14:47,729 --> 00:14:50,419
for the sake of our old times.

197
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:52,279
Enough is enough.

198
00:14:53,219 --> 00:14:55,429
I could just kill you here.

199
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:57,739
Then you would've done it already.

200
00:14:57,739 --> 00:14:59,269
If you're really capable of doing it,

201
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:02,789
you would've done it when you lost your wife and kid.

202
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:04,349
What?

203
00:15:04,349 --> 00:15:07,729
Couldn't you just forget everything and live on?

204
00:15:07,729 --> 00:15:12,679
I understand your desire to pay me back for what you got.

205
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:18,039
But Jae Kyung... it's not like your family will come back if you avenge them.

206
00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:21,439
Let's just forgive.

207
00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:24,909
Let's just forgive and forget everything and move on.

208
00:15:26,669 --> 00:15:29,289
Bring me the item.

209
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:32,189
You tell Prosecutor Jin to give it to me.

210
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:36,849
There's no need for him to experience what you went through.

211
00:15:41,996 --> 00:15:44,399
I said I'm okay. Why bother getting hospitalized?

212
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,339
They said you sprained your ligament, and your bone is fractured.

213
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:48,949
You're not okay at all, so just stay here.

214
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:51,399
I can just get outpatient treatment at home.

215
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:53,119
I have a group reservation tomorrow.

216
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,249
No, you can't go.

217
00:15:54,249 --> 00:15:57,259
You have to take the day off. You need absolute rest.

218
00:15:58,239 --> 00:15:59,999
Also, since you're here, get your checkup while you're at it and

219
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,869
take a break from the store for a few days. Is in it nice?

220
00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:07,119
You need to live long to see your son get married.

221
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:09,219
I don't want to become an orphan.

222
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:12,059
Let's live long together, Mrs. Lim.

223
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:15,759
I'm going to live until the 22nd century.

224
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,439
Let's do that.

225
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:20,339
I'm off now.

226
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:22,839
Get better soon. I'll call you.

227
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:30,479
Seo Hyeon Gyu?

228
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:33,369
The CEO of Law Firm Kangsan?

229
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:34,429
What about your mother?

230
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:35,949
Is your mother okay?

231
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:38,249
Fortunately, she's okay.

232
00:16:38,249 --> 00:16:40,849
The problem is that I'm not okay.

233
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:45,769
- Where are you right now?
- On my way to meet Prosecutor Oh Do Hwan.

234
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:48,039
I need to secure the black box.

235
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:52,099
Seocho-dong murder case happened because of the MP3.

236
00:16:52,099 --> 00:16:56,299
Whoever the real culprit is... he must also be connected to Seo Hyeon Gyu.

237
00:16:56,299 --> 00:16:59,069
You're going to catch the culprit first to get to Seo Hyeon Gyu?

238
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:02,009
I'll put them in jail myself.

239
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:05,619
Seo Hyeon Gyu messed with the wrong guy.

240
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:08,279
Jung, I understand how you feel but let's calm down a bit.

241
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:11,579
Even so, you can't just go to him without a plan—

242
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,999
♫ You can't bring me down ♫

243
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:16,099
Jin Jung...

244
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,479
Next up is...

245
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:21,769
K-Co Labs' Additional Collection of Taxes by the National Tax Service.

246
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:25,439
It's being investigated by the joint task force at the Northern District Prosecutors' Office, isn't it?

247
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,219
What do you think, Attorney Lee?

248
00:17:27,219 --> 00:17:28,569
You're a former prosecutor general.

249
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:29,969
You must know a lot of people in the joint task force.

250
00:17:29,969 --> 00:17:32,759
I think it'd be better to pass on this case.

251
00:17:35,369 --> 00:17:40,759
Attorney Oh... this isn't the Prosecutors' Office. Get yourself together.

252
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:52,389
The joint task force on Financial and Securities Crimes was formed ambitiously.

253
00:17:52,389 --> 00:17:55,259
However, in contrast to its beginning,

254
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:58,679
it still hasn't produced any meaningful results

255
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,949
according to popular opinion.

256
00:18:00,949 --> 00:18:04,659
The joint task force must be dead set on this case, right?

257
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:06,159
Exactly.

258
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:08,619
As you can see on the last page of the report,

259
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:11,129
the joint task force is currently doing an additional internal investigation

260
00:18:11,129 --> 00:18:13,999
on the officers' embezzlement allegations of tens of billions of won.

261
00:18:13,999 --> 00:18:15,709
Under the circumstances,

262
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:21,019
shall we protect the client while going as far as to make an enemy of the regime?

263
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:22,599
Please keep in mind that...

264
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:26,619
we might fall into the curse of the victor...

265
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:28,969
as well if things go wrong.

266
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:34,719
Attorney Oh.

267
00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:39,529
What are you doing?

268
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:41,159
What do you mean?

269
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:43,049
The thing just now.

270
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:45,709
You didn't even share the information beforehand.

271
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,729
Are you messing with me on purpose?

272
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:51,159
Gosh. I apologize.

273
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:53,402
I'll be careful next time.

274
00:18:54,969 --> 00:18:56,739
Hey!

275
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:02,769
You're laughing when I'm talking to you?

276
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:05,859
I heard you made a deal with my father using me.

277
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:12,089
You're making quite the scene thinking he's got your back.

278
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:14,429
Is it because you were born as a low-life?

279
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:18,159
You must've had a hard time...

280
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:20,349
being raised...

281
00:19:20,349 --> 00:19:22,669
under a mother who's not quite a mother.

282
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:25,649
- Please cut it out.
- From the way I see it...

283
00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:28,069
you take after your mom, Attorney.

284
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:31,649
- I heard your mom was the same. Sticking to this man and the other—
- I said to stop.

285
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:34,309
You should be the one to stop it.

286
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:55,269
Do you know... the difference between you and me?

287
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:03,969
Is that I'm allowed to do this.

288
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:08,479
Hey...

289
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:11,849
I got smacked in the face because of you.

290
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:14,089
Do you understand what I'm saying?

291
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:17,469
Because of a low-life jurk like you...

292
00:20:17,469 --> 00:20:19,199
the son of a bar hostess,

293
00:20:19,199 --> 00:20:22,318
I was smacked by Father, you punk!

294
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:31,029
Well...

295
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:33,509
what brings you here, Prosecutor?

296
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:35,639
I had something to say.

297
00:20:35,639 --> 00:20:37,519
Please take your leave...

298
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:40,799
or you can come with me to the Prosecution right now.

299
00:20:52,769 --> 00:20:54,279
Gosh, it must hurt.

300
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:55,839
Are you okay?

301
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,969
Just tell me what you want.

302
00:20:58,749 --> 00:21:00,669
Memory card.

303
00:21:03,849 --> 00:21:05,559
I know you have it. That's why I'm here.

304
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:07,239
Let's keep things easy.

305
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:10,159
Why do you want that all of a sudden?

306
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:12,469
I'm going to catch him.

307
00:21:12,469 --> 00:21:14,539
Do I need a different reason?

308
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:18,692
I could just arrest you for allegations of destruction of evidence, Oh Do Hwan.

309
00:21:18,692 --> 00:21:20,432
Bring it to me before that.

310
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:27,859
If you need it that badly...

311
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,899
The proof was filmed very well.

312
00:21:37,169 --> 00:21:38,899
What?

313
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:41,079
Am I handing it over too easily?

314
00:21:42,089 --> 00:21:43,519
It's simple.

315
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:46,369
Don't think too hard about it.

316
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:48,919
I don't need it anymore and

317
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:51,549
you need it now.

318
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:54,559
Cut the crap and say the real reason.

319
00:21:56,429 --> 00:21:58,499
Because he crossed the line.

320
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:03,189
This is the end of what I can do for you.

321
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:05,769
Good luck with the rest.

322
00:22:41,489 --> 00:22:45,899
There was one more guy on that day who came to Ye Young's house.

323
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:47,179
A fidget spinner?

324
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:51,819
Yes! T-The thing that kids spin on their hands.

325
00:22:51,819 --> 00:22:53,999
A fidget spinner.

326
00:22:55,929 --> 00:22:57,579
You didn't see the culprit's face?

00:48:12,979 --> 00:48:15,469
You won't get paid for overtime even if you do that.

658
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:18,009
Mister...

659
00:48:20,499 --> 00:48:22,849
I unlocked my dad's password.

660
00:48:26,259 --> 00:48:27,689
Take a look.

661
00:48:33,149 --> 00:48:35,909
Do you come to the theater often?

662
00:48:35,909 --> 00:48:37,329
Not often.

663
00:48:37,329 --> 00:48:40,439
But I do come with my wife and son sometimes.

664
00:48:40,439 --> 00:48:42,359
What about you, Executive Director?

665
00:48:43,299 --> 00:48:46,499
Why did you call us here?

666
00:48:46,499 --> 00:48:49,409
You're quite impatient, Executive Director.

667
00:48:49,409 --> 00:48:54,042
About your company's humidifier disinfectant...

668
00:48:54,042 --> 00:48:57,852
I think you two will have to take the blame for it.

669
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:03,069
I noticed that you two did a great job raising your children.

670
00:49:03,069 --> 00:49:05,339
Do your children know that, though?

671
00:49:05,339 --> 00:49:07,689
How you two merrily failed in a futures contract and

672
00:49:07,689 --> 00:49:10,429
your houses are about to be levied now.

673
00:49:10,429 --> 00:49:12,229
How do you know that, Attorney?

674
00:49:12,229 --> 00:49:15,389
What do you mean, how do I know that?

675
00:49:15,389 --> 00:49:16,939
Because the one who gave me this job...

676
00:49:16,939 --> 00:49:20,539
your chairman, told me. That's how I know.

677
00:49:37,369 --> 00:49:39,839
This is a good opportunity for you two, so

678
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,189
please make a good decision.

679
00:49:42,189 --> 00:49:45,309
And what if we refuse?

680
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:52,069
Well... I didn't think that far.

681
00:49:53,149 --> 00:49:55,179
I guess...

682
00:49:55,179 --> 00:49:58,839
I'll find someone else.

683
00:49:58,839 --> 00:50:02,049
We do need someone to take responsibility.

684
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:08,239
Honestly, though, that's too much of a hassle for me.

685
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:11,129
Why don't you just say yes?

686
00:50:16,829 --> 00:50:20,149
I'm sorry, but I don't think this is right.

687
00:50:20,149 --> 00:50:23,449
I can't be imprisoned for something I didn't do.

688
00:50:23,449 --> 00:50:25,379
I'd rather be an incompetent father

689
00:50:25,379 --> 00:50:28,519
than to be a cowardly one.

690
00:50:32,709 --> 00:50:34,549
Okay then.

691
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:38,209
If that's how you feel...

692
00:50:38,209 --> 00:50:40,639
Please don't come to me to talk about things like this ever again.

693
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:42,859
I'll be off now.

694
00:50:42,859 --> 00:50:43,909
What the heck? Let go.

695
00:50:43,909 --> 00:50:46,279
Let go! Let me go!

696
00:50:46,279 --> 00:50:48,099
I said, let me go!

697
00:50:48,099 --> 00:50:49,319
What is this?

698
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:51,589
Let me go, I said!

699
00:50:51,589 --> 00:50:53,169
Let go!

700
00:51:07,369 --> 00:51:10,029
Well, Manager Jo. So...

701
00:51:10,029 --> 00:51:11,709
have you made up your mind?

702
00:51:11,709 --> 00:51:14,699
Y-Yes. Yes, I did.

[Play again]

704
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:40,207
There was a reason Seo Hyeon Gyu was dying to find this.

705
00:51:44,939 --> 00:51:46,589
Prosecutor Jin.

706
00:51:46,589 --> 00:51:47,919
Yes?

707
00:51:49,819 --> 00:51:51,439
Stay out of this.

708
00:51:52,979 --> 00:51:54,799
This was my case from the beginning.

709
00:51:54,799 --> 00:51:57,739
Hand over the MP3 to me and take your hands off of it.

710
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:00,739
We already said we'd do this together.

711
00:52:04,829 --> 00:52:08,849
- This is enough to handcuff him—
- Listen to my order.

712
00:52:08,849 --> 00:52:10,099
I'm your superior.

713
00:52:10,099 --> 00:52:11,509
This isn't that kind of a matter.

714
00:52:11,509 --> 00:52:13,009
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

715
00:52:13,009 --> 00:52:14,859
Did you get scared after watching the video or something?

716
00:52:14,859 --> 00:52:17,979
Yes. I got scared.

717
00:52:20,389 --> 00:52:21,489
Leave.

718
00:52:21,489 --> 00:52:24,159
What's the matter? Really!

719
00:52:29,909 --> 00:52:32,229
Do you think this is a joke?

720
00:52:34,529 --> 00:52:38,049
You told me that... you don't want to lose anyone.

721
00:52:38,049 --> 00:52:40,439
I feel the same way.

722
00:52:40,439 --> 00:52:42,559
I can't stand to see that happen again.

723
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,999
So, Jung, trust me and

724
00:52:44,999 --> 00:52:47,610
you stay out of this. Okay?

725
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:53,609
I'm glad... that we're on the same page.

726
00:52:53,609 --> 00:52:55,309
I also can't stand by

727
00:52:55,309 --> 00:52:57,179
and watch something terrible happen to you.

728
00:52:58,569 --> 00:53:00,239
So let's do this together.

729
00:53:01,549 --> 00:53:03,279
They say to carry a burden together.

730
00:53:03,279 --> 00:53:05,759
Why are you trying to keep carrying it alone?

731
00:53:07,269 --> 00:53:10,259
Don't ever say you'll do it alone.

732
00:53:10,259 --> 00:53:11,609
Just say it one more time.

733
00:53:11,609 --> 00:53:14,069
I'm going to take you out of the case.

734
00:53:20,259 --> 00:53:22,799
He thinks he's the boss around here.

735
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:32,609
What's that?

736
00:53:35,219 --> 00:53:37,299
It's my mom's birthday.

737
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:43,879
Go to your mom.

738
00:53:43,879 --> 00:53:47,209
Go where? We've got so much work to do.

739
00:53:47,209 --> 00:53:49,999
You said it's her birthday. It only comes around once a year.

740
00:53:49,999 --> 00:53:53,769
She's not feeling well. How sad would she be if you didn't celebrate her birthday?

741
00:53:54,986 --> 00:53:58,269
The world won't end just because you take a break for a day.

742
00:53:58,269 --> 00:54:02,669
Also... tell her you love her...

743
00:54:02,669 --> 00:54:05,079
while you help her recover from her injuries.

744
00:54:05,079 --> 00:54:07,609
I regret that the most.

745
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:25,539
I'll be going, then.

746
00:54:25,539 --> 00:54:27,139
It's really a promise, okay?

747
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:29,039
Don't try to do anything alone.

748
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:30,709
Okay, okay.

749
00:54:30,709 --> 00:54:34,649
You're taking the MP3, too. What can I do?

750
00:54:34,649 --> 00:54:37,529
Hurry up and go. Your mom must be waiting.

751
00:54:37,529 --> 00:54:39,829
Okay. Oh, right...

752
00:54:40,899 --> 00:54:43,879
Thank you for the arrest warrant on Seo Ji Han.

753
00:54:43,879 --> 00:54:46,029
I don't know what you're talking about.

754
00:54:47,609 --> 00:54:49,809
Never mind, then. I'll be going.

755
00:54:49,809 --> 00:54:51,289
Hey, Prosecutor Jin.

756
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:55,579
We've got tons of work to do starting tomorrow. Don't be late.

757
00:54:55,579 --> 00:54:57,119
Don't be late yourself.

Why ask me to sing a song? Hurry up and blow it out.

771

You're getting the checkup tomorrow, okay?

Okay. Thank you, Son.

01:00:13,159 --> 01:00:15,649
I couldn't keep any of the promises I made to you, Mister.

818
01:00:15,649 --> 01:00:18,069
You did well. We're now accomplices.

819
01:00:18,069 --> 01:00:19,529
How dare you come here?

820
01:00:19,529 --> 01:00:21,059
May the deceased rest in peace.

821
01:00:21,059 --> 01:00:22,169
I'll never forgive you.

822
01:00:22,169 --> 01:00:24,659
Prosecutor Jin seems to have found a clue on the case.

823
01:00:24,659 --> 01:00:25,889
He has a helper?

824
01:00:25,889 --> 01:00:27,229
Tell this to your father clearly.

825
01:00:27,229 --> 01:00:28,949
I have the evidence of him committing murder.

826
01:00:28,949 --> 01:00:32,899
Your needless arbitrary actions and pride drove Jae Kyung to death.

827
01:00:32,899 --> 01:00:35,229
I'm getting curious at this point.

828
01:00:35,229 --> 01:00:38,559
What drove you to this point, Prosecutor Jin?

829
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:39,889
My family upbringing.

830
01:00:39,889 --> 01:00:43,300
