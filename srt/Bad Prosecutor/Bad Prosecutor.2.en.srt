00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,690
- Director...
- I always trusted you.

491
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,430
Okay.

492
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,500
They said that there's no such office rule.

493
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,060
Is that so?

494
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,380
Then that's too bad.

495
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:41,370
W-What do you mean, "too bad"?

496
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,880
Start.

497
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:46,480
Come with us.

498
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,300
Yes, you were quite violent.

499
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,180
Move aside so I can go.

500
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,900
Now...

501
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,570
Yoo Jin Chul.

502
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:10,200
We'll end up meeting again soon.

503
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,710
Do as you wish.

504
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,670
I'm serious.

505
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,770
I catch them when I say that I will...

506
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:18,150
because I don't pick and choose methods and means.

507
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,870
Let's go.

508
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,140
Send Yoo Jin Chul off to China.

509
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,450
So that neither Kim Tae Ho nor Jin Jung can find him again.

510
00:35:58,450 --> 00:35:59,890
All right.

511
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:16,210
Kim Tae Ho, you bastard...

512
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:19,550
You're saying... Prosecutor Jin brought Yoo Jin Chul and

513
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,530
Prosecutor Oh let Yoo Jin Chul go?

514
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:25,050
Also, Prosecutor Oh is following Chief Lee Jang Won's orders.

515
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,560
I think what you said before was right,

516
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,650
that the current Chief Prosecutor is connected to an entertainment establishment CEO.

517
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:36,740
But why did Prosecutor Jin catch Yoo Jin Chul?

518
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:40,530
I don't think he was simply after Yoo Jin Chul.

519
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:44,550
He's also aiming at Chief Lee Jang Won?

520
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:49,140
I think Prosecutor Jin didn't give up on the Seocho-dong murder case yet.

521
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,660
I'll go meet Prosecutor Jin as soon as you're done.

522
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,380
Prosecutor Jin would know more in detai—

523
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,610
You arrogant bastard, how dare you do a targeted investigation without reporting?

524
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:04,640
Are you the Chief? Are you the Prosecutor General?

525
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:09,770
Tomorrow is your inaugural ceremony as the Prosecutor General.

526
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:12,360
I was going to report to you after investigating quietly.

527
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,220
This bastard... running his mouth...

528
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,540
Stop thinking I'm a pushover, you bastard.

529
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,710
The reason why you're looking into Yoo Jin Chul...

530
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,660
do you think I don't know?

531
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,720
Wait and see.

532
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,580
Once I become the Prosecutor General, I'm going to strike you down first.

533
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,360
I shouldn't be showing you these things.

534
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,930
Just pretend that you didn't see it.

535
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,730
I'm sorry, Prosecutor.

536
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:02,350
Prosecutor Oh had ordered not to let anybody in.

537
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:06,150
I guess I'm anybody to you, Investigator Kang?

538
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,670
Let me tell you again nicely.

539
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,610
Move aside.

540
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,260
I'll cut to the chase since it's urgent.

541
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:24,670
Chief Lee Jang Won... let's get him together.

542
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,670
Promise that you'll help the Deputy Chief and me.

543
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,720
Then I'll release you right away.

544
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,280
Let's just make one thing clear.

545
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,210
Every operation will be carried out as I see fit.

546
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,120
Deal!

547
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,480
Gosh, shit!

[Prosecutor Oh Do Hwan]

549
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:52,330
- Hello?
- Let us leave now.

550
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,870
There's one thing I need to check, though...

551
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,840
but don't make it noticeable.

552
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,710
Crap...

553
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,000
Ouch...

554
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,650
Ouch! Ouch!

555
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,700
What's wrong?

556
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,650
You can't breathe?

557
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:38,770
Why can't you breathe?

558
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:40,320
What's wrong?

559
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:51,670
I think I got better.

560
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,570
You're seriously my lifesaver.

561
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:54,880
Thank you...

562
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,130
I didn't do anything, though.

563
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,450
It makes sense now.

564
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:05,530
The reason why you caught Yoo Jin Chul out of nowhere.

565
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:09,470
What's the use of working hard to catch him? They let him go right away like this.

566
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:11,590
Since Yoo Jin Chul has been exposed,

567
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,760
Chief Lee Jang Won won't stay still, either.

568
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,110
He'll try to cover up the case and attempt to send Yoo Jin Chul overseas.

569
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,740
Don't even expect cooperation from the police.

570
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:23,240
He's set to become the Prosecutor General tomorrow, so who'd go against him?

571
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,350
Okay, let's make a call first.

572
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,770
A call?

573
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:29,730
There's no need to stall time. Let's make it quick.

574
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,590
- Hey, Prosecutor Jin.
- Hey.

575
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:37,160
We're on the way. Get him.

576
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,160
- Let's go.
- Now?

577
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,270
You got someone to follow him?

578
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:48,980
- That's an investigation...
- You're being stuffy already.

579
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,800
You said you won't object to the way I work.

580
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,070
You and I are too different.

581
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:56,260
All you need to do is change.

582
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,540
Let's just look forward for now.

Geez, seriously...

585
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:05,588
He already escaped?

586
00:42:10,058 --> 00:42:11,668
Hello?

587

What?

00:42:15,018 --> 00:42:16,318
Yes.

589
00:42:17,658 --> 00:42:20,888
I think he noticed that we're after him.

590
00:42:20,888 --> 00:42:22,428
This was in the microwave.

591
00:42:22,428 --> 00:42:24,118
There was nothing else.

592
00:42:24,118 --> 00:42:26,828
He became so thorough all of a sudden.

It's Oh Do Hwan.

594
00:42:28,618 --> 00:42:31,838
He probably needs someone to take care of stuff before he got out.

595
00:42:33,678 --> 00:42:37,108
Initiated scanning for the target.

596
00:42:39,178 --> 00:42:40,928
By the way, who are these people?

597
00:42:40,928 --> 00:42:42,668
I'll explain later.

598
00:42:42,668 --> 00:42:44,768
- Let's go with plan B.
- You have a plan B too?

599
00:42:44,768 --> 00:42:47,638
The target entered Gyeongin Expressway.

600
00:42:50,528 --> 00:42:52,158
Yoo Jin Chul.

601
00:42:55,408 --> 00:42:57,778
We'll end up seeing each other again.

If you were going to track him like that,

why did you send us here?

604
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:07,458
Gyeongin Expressway is Incheon bound.

605

- If he goes all the way to the end...
- Yeonahn Pier!

606

Until then, please keep a low profile.

So tell me!

Why do I have to be out of the country?

How am I supposed to trust you?

632
00:45:33,598 --> 00:45:35,878
I need to talk to Chief Lee myself.

633
00:45:35,878 --> 00:45:37,498
Turn around.

Listen carefully, Mr. Yoo Jin Chul.

This isn't for Chief Lee's benefit.

638

It's for your benefit.

639
00:45:54,298 --> 00:45:58,558
I don't care what kind of relationship you have with Chief Lee. But,

640
00:45:58,558 --> 00:46:00,708
if I turn the car around here,

641
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:03,528

Geez! I talked too much.

We must be missing something.

What could that be?

647
00:46:26,018 --> 00:46:28,908
What if you request assistance?

648
00:46:28,908 --> 00:46:30,638
Like putting him on the wanted list?

649
00:46:30,638 --> 00:46:32,358
You think Chief Lee Jang Won will let that slide?

650
00:46:32,358 --> 00:46:35,208
I need a warrant to put him on the wanted list first.

651
00:46:35,208 --> 00:46:37,828
Right! The wanted list...

652
00:46:38,798 --> 00:46:40,188
What's with you now?

653
00:46:40,188 --> 00:46:41,688
There's no way we'll get a warrant for this.

00:58:55,818 --> 00:58:57,798
Please do.

822
00:58:58,808 --> 00:59:02,238
Make sure the inauguration ceremony goes smoothly tomorrow.

823
00:59:02,238 --> 00:59:03,968
Yes, Sir.

824
00:59:07,378 --> 00:59:09,348
Congratulations!

825
00:59:10,208 --> 00:59:12,108
Prosecutor General.

837
01:00:36,858 --> 01:00:39,938
My fellow prosecutors, who I respect and think of as family.

838
01:00:39,938 --> 01:00:41,588
Today,

839
01:00:41,588 --> 01:00:46,888
I become the prosecutor general at Central District Prosecutors' Office, where justice is protected.

840
01:00:46,888 --> 01:00:50,138
I promise my family members here.

841
01:00:50,138 --> 01:00:52,468
From now on, the Prosector's Office...

842
01:00:56,308 --> 01:01:00,698
From now on, the Prosector's Office will be trusted by the people of the country.

843
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:04,278
We won't obey the power, and we'll draw the sword to fight the power.

844
01:01:04,278 --> 01:01:07,588
I promise you that we'll be honest and upright,

845
01:01:07,588 --> 01:01:09,808
from now on...

846
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:12,758
What's going on?

847
01:01:20,758 --> 01:01:23,158
I'm so achy because I was hiding down here.

848
01:01:23,158 --> 01:01:25,528
Just stay there.

849
01:01:25,528 --> 01:01:28,388
T-That...

850
01:01:28,388 --> 01:01:29,448
Yes.

851
01:01:29,448 --> 01:01:32,578
Hello, reporters and prosecutors.

852
01:01:32,578 --> 01:01:34,398
I'm Jin Jung.

853
01:01:34,398 --> 01:01:35,818
Well...

854
01:01:35,818 --> 01:01:38,018
The reason why I'm up here is

855
01:01:38,018 --> 01:01:45,668
to tell you that the Prosecutors' Office is way more corrupt than you think.

856
01:01:50,388 --> 01:01:53,908
They destroyed evidence that proved someone's innocence and manipulated a case.

857
01:01:53,908 --> 01:01:56,768
And they closed the case the way they liked.

858
01:01:57,508 --> 01:02:00,158
It wasn't done by anyone else.

859
01:02:01,428 --> 01:02:03,148
But it was

860
01:02:03,148 --> 01:02:08,708
done by the best legal office in the country, the prosecution.

861
01:02:10,718 --> 01:02:13,148
Take a good look, everyone.

862
01:02:19,828 --> 01:02:22,208
What the hell are you doing right now?

863
01:02:22,208 --> 01:02:25,958
I'll let you know what I'm doing.

864
01:02:25,958 --> 01:02:27,338
Lee Jang Won,

865
01:02:27,338 --> 01:02:31,838
you're under arrest as the key suspect in Seocho-dong Murder case.

866
01:02:31,838 --> 01:02:33,618
What?

867
01:02:33,618 --> 01:02:34,658
Bring it here!

868
01:02:34,658 --> 01:02:36,678
What's this nonsense?

869
01:02:36,678 --> 01:02:39,368
Seriously!

870
01:02:39,368 --> 01:02:40,978
Congratulations.

871
01:02:40,978 --> 01:02:43,198
You're done now.

872
01:03:13,328 --> 01:03:15,268
[Bad Prosecutor]

873
01:03:15,268 --> 01:03:17,998
- Put Prosecutor Jin in prison.
- I can guarantee you.

874
01:03:17,998 --> 01:03:18,778
That's not necessary.

875
01:03:18,778 --> 01:03:20,448
I heard Deputy Chief Kim Tae Ho helped me.

876
01:03:20,448 --> 01:03:22,898
It was to remove a tumor in the Prosecutors' Office.

877
01:03:22,898 --> 01:03:24,848
Get rid of Prosecutor Jin.

878
01:03:24,848 --> 01:03:25,598
Drop the weapon, I said.

879
01:03:25,598 --> 01:03:27,148
Yoo Jin Chul is not here.

880
01:03:27,148 --> 01:03:29,298
I had no choice but to make a false confession.

881
01:03:29,298 --> 01:03:31,858
Let's look inside Lee Jang Won's USB drive now.

882
01:03:31,858 --> 01:03:33,968
We'll serve at least five years in prison, if it goes wrong.

883
01:03:33,968 --> 01:03:35,518
What's life without a risk?

884
01:03:35,518 --> 01:03:37,198
Let's go and catch the bad guys.

885
01:03:37,198 --> 01:03:40,131
What crazy nut would attempt to go through the Prosecutor's office?

886
01:03:40,131 --> 01:03:43,730
It would suck. There has to be someone like me, at least.
