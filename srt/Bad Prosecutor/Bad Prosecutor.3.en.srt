168
00:12:24,123 --> 00:12:27,233
What authority do you have to do this?

169
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:29,503
Hey, open it.

170
00:12:29,503 --> 00:12:31,493
Open it right now!

171
00:12:33,713 --> 00:12:36,823
When is the core reference witness coming?

172
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:38,693
What? He should be almost here.

173
00:12:38,693 --> 00:12:40,233
He's almost here.

174
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:42,003
Come in!

175
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,073
I said to come in.

176
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:50,323
Just walk off.

177
00:12:51,653 --> 00:12:53,683
Yoo Jin Chul is not coming.

178
00:13:02,243 --> 00:13:04,023
Please resume.

179
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,343
There was a brief commotion.

180
00:13:09,343 --> 00:13:11,393
- Yes.
- We'll wrap up soon.

181
00:13:12,203 --> 00:13:14,173
This isn't Yoo Jin Chul.

182
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,643
Where is this place? Why did we come here?

183
00:13:20,643 --> 00:13:23,683
- Yes.
- Going forward, the prosecution will...

184
00:13:23,683 --> 00:13:25,403
not obey the power

185
00:13:25,403 --> 00:13:27,753
and we'll draw the sword to fight the power.

186
00:13:32,663 --> 00:13:34,673
What's going on?

187
00:13:39,353 --> 00:13:42,023
Your manners suck.

188
00:13:42,023 --> 00:13:44,443
I didn't even start.

189
00:13:53,593 --> 00:13:56,403
- H-Hello?
- Yes, Jin Chul, it's me.

190
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:58,063
Can you hear me well?

191
00:13:58,063 --> 00:14:00,703
Yes, I hear you well, Prosecutor Jin Jung.

192
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,213
These people here don't trust my words.

193
00:14:03,213 --> 00:14:05,483
You go ahead and talk for me instead.

194
00:14:06,563 --> 00:14:09,013
Everything that Prosecutor Jin Jung...

195
00:14:09,013 --> 00:14:10,853
said is...

196
00:14:12,173 --> 00:14:14,073
all true and correct.

197
00:14:17,353 --> 00:14:22,693
The victim of the Seocho-dong murder case is named Park Ye Young.

198
00:14:22,693 --> 00:14:27,113
She was an employee at a hostess bar that I run.

199
00:14:28,263 --> 00:14:32,743
She was... being sponsored by

200
00:14:32,743 --> 00:14:34,613
Prosecutor Lee, who's over there.

201
00:14:38,663 --> 00:14:42,483
On the day of the incident, I witnessed the two together.

202
00:14:43,613 --> 00:14:48,523
I'll... explain more in detail when I'm...

203
00:14:48,523 --> 00:14:50,023
summoned to the prosecution.

204
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:52,003
Okay, cut!

205
00:14:53,373 --> 00:14:56,253
The witness in the footage is currently stored- no...

206
00:14:56,253 --> 00:14:58,163
Protected by me.

207
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,863
Too many people wish him gone.

208
00:15:04,853 --> 00:15:07,263
You know, Oh Do Hwan,

209
00:15:08,563 --> 00:15:11,043
I decided something after you got to me last time.

210
00:15:12,133 --> 00:15:14,413
"I'm never going to fight a losing battle."

211
00:15:16,693 --> 00:15:19,023
This is just the beginning for you and me.

212
00:15:19,023 --> 00:15:20,773
I look forward to it.

At the inauguration ceremony of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office's Prosecutor General,

217
00:15:44,053 --> 00:15:45,603
a shocking scene had played out.

218
00:15:45,603 --> 00:15:48,263
Chief Prosecutor Lee Jang Won, who was to take office as the Prosecutor General,

219
00:15:48,263 --> 00:15:50,833
became the key suspect in the Seocho-dong murder case.

220
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,943
Prosecutor Jin Jung made a national exposure as he barged into the ceremony,

221
00:15:53,943 --> 00:15:55,333
which is an unprecedented event...

222
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:59,633
The Prosecutor General position of Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office will remain vacant for a while.

Reporter Choi, are you really going to do this?

224
00:16:02,213 --> 00:16:06,383
You heard what that bastard did at the airport!

225
00:16:08,483 --> 00:16:10,703
My side is also going to make a statement of rebuttal.

What the hell were you doing, you bastard!

230
00:16:23,573 --> 00:16:24,563
My apologies.

231
00:16:24,563 --> 00:16:26,203
Apologies?

232

Apologies for causing this ruckus because you failed to do your job?

Hey, Oh Do Hwan.

Get your act together, you punk.

235
00:16:34,983 --> 00:16:37,533
Do you know what guys like you misunderstand?

236
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:40,343
They think all they need to do is hold on tight to the rope of connections!

237
00:16:40,343 --> 00:16:43,263
While not making any efforts themselves!

238
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:47,013
Mark my words, Prosecutor Oh.

239
00:16:47,013 --> 00:16:48,583
The rope?

240
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,783
It cuts more easily than you think.

241
00:16:50,783 --> 00:16:53,233
A rope isn't for being pulled up!

242
00:16:53,233 --> 00:16:55,263
It's for you to climb up!

243
00:16:55,263 --> 00:16:57,553
Are you really not the culprit?

244
00:16:57,553 --> 00:16:59,253
What?

245
00:17:00,523 --> 00:17:03,313
The contents of Prosecutor Jin's claims...

246
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:06,673
That you're the key suspect who murdered Park Ye Young,

247
00:17:06,673 --> 00:17:09,563
the victim of the Seocho-dong murder case.

248

It's not too late to say everything was a lie.

249

Then I'll let you keep your job as a prosecutor, at least.

250
00:17:46,673 --> 00:17:49,403
- What if I say no?
- Violation of the Aviation Law.

251
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,863
You'll be locked up for more than three years.

252

I'd like you to know that this meeting is the

253
00:17:54,383 --> 00:17:57,833
last chance you have, Prosecutor Jin.

254
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,413
Just for your information,

255
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:02,453
we can wrap things up without your cooperation.

256
00:18:02,453 --> 00:18:07,163
It's just the easiest and most efficient to have you cooperate.

257
00:18:07,163 --> 00:18:09,993
I have been curious about this thing for some time,

258
00:18:09,993 --> 00:18:11,433
but are you not embarrassed?

259
00:18:11,433 --> 00:18:14,433
What do you gain from being this loyal to that guy?

Is there something up there?

262

Don't be like that, Prosecutor Oh Do Hwan.

Because I'm honorable to myself.

310
00:21:06,543 --> 00:21:08,673
What about you, Director?

311
00:21:08,673 --> 00:21:11,973
Are you a prosecutor who's honorable to himself?

312
00:21:11,973 --> 00:21:14,563
Or have you become a rotten prosecutor

313
00:21:14,563 --> 00:21:16,343
who can't call out something that's wrong,

314
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:18,043
ignoring the injustice in plain sight

315
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:21,253
only going after one's own benefits

316
00:21:21,253 --> 00:21:23,273
and unable to feel humiliated?

317

00:22:21,413 --> 00:22:23,893
- Are you really not the culprit?
- What?

332
00:22:23,893 --> 00:22:26,603
The contents of Prosecutor Jin's claims...

333
00:22:26,603 --> 00:22:29,993
That you're the key suspect who murdered Park Ye Young,

334
00:22:29,993 --> 00:22:32,843
the victim of the Seocho-dong murder case.

335
00:22:36,383 --> 00:22:38,443
The situation is serious.

336
00:22:38,443 --> 00:22:42,513
Please tell me honestly so that I can help you, Chief.

337
00:22:52,483 --> 00:22:55,343
Take care of Prosecutor Jin first.

338
00:22:55,343 --> 00:22:59,793
Clean up the situation first... and get rid of Prosecutor Jin.

339
00:23:02,343 --> 00:23:04,803
Truth comes after that.

340
00:23:10,063 --> 00:23:11,933
How annoying.

341
00:23:17,163 --> 00:23:19,053
Hey, Kim Tae Ho!

342
00:23:22,883 --> 00:23:24,633
Abbreviated Indictment? Fines?

343
00:23:24,633 --> 00:23:26,873
Have you lost your mind?

344
00:23:26,873 --> 00:23:29,783
I got a call from the Incheon Prosecutors' Office...

345
00:23:30,503 --> 00:23:33,803
that Prosecutor Jin admitted to the charges and is remorseful,

346
00:23:33,803 --> 00:23:37,743
and taking into account that most of the nation is supporting him.

347
00:23:37,743 --> 00:23:41,013
They suggested making a request through an abbreviated order.

348
00:23:41,013 --> 00:23:44,643
Your college classmate is the Head of the Detective Team there, right?

349
00:23:44,643 --> 00:23:46,603
That's right.

350
00:23:46,603 --> 00:23:49,643
So... you merely agreed to that suggestion?

351
00:23:49,643 --> 00:23:53,113
I thought that there was no reason to oppose it.

352
00:23:53,113 --> 00:23:55,623
Although his methods were quite rough,

353
00:23:55,623 --> 00:24:02,543
all of that was eventually to get rid of the tumor within the Prosecution.

354
00:24:02,543 --> 00:24:04,913
How dare you...?

355
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:10,953
My subordinate prosecutor was here last time, but no one's around now.

356
00:24:14,263 --> 00:24:15,873
Fine.

357
00:24:16,563 --> 00:24:18,813
You're finally showing your true colors.

358
00:24:18,813 --> 00:24:22,223
I'm... the Chief Prosecutor.

359
00:24:22,223 --> 00:24:25,563
I'm keenly aware of the ones who are trying to stab my back.

360
00:24:25,563 --> 00:24:29,943
And the reason why you assigned the Seocho-dong murder case to Prosecutor Jin.

361
00:24:29,943 --> 00:24:34,643
You hypocrite who acts like a decent, righteous person on the outside.

362
00:24:34,643 --> 00:24:39,123
Look forward to it. Soon enough, I'll rip apart that

363

364
00:25:00,883 --> 00:25:02,553
Hello, Sir.

365
00:25:32,793 --> 00:25:35,003
Hey, this is not the guy!

366
00:25:35,003 --> 00:25:37,023
Who is this?

367
00:25:37,023 --> 00:25:40,923
This is Coco. Prosecutor Jin's dog.

368
00:25:43,143 --> 00:25:45,733
It's surprising that you have a dog.

369
00:25:45,733 --> 00:25:48,833
What do you mean "a dog"? Don't say such an upsetting thing.

370
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:50,873
Coco is my family.

371
00:25:50,873 --> 00:25:52,803
He looked like a troublemaker.

372
00:25:52,803 --> 00:25:54,903
Just like his "dad".

373
00:25:54,903 --> 00:25:57,793
It's problematic that he only listens to me.

374
00:25:57,793 --> 00:26:00,953
Kind of like I'm the one and only person in the world?

375
00:26:02,653 --> 00:26:04,643
Yes, I'm on the way.

376
00:26:19,183 --> 00:26:21,193
Who are those gentlemen?

377
00:26:22,533 --> 00:26:25,153
- My younger brothers.
- Younger brothers?

378
00:26:28,133 --> 00:26:31,583
It's a big family...

379

Miss... we all thought it would be a war,

380

but what's this? Making me a watchman...

381
00:26:38,403 --> 00:26:40,493
Because I'm bored.

382

Big Boss has been looking for you. Asking where you are.

383

So why did you have to retire out of the blue?

384
00:26:49,903 --> 00:26:53,833
Retire... Retire?

385
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:55,543
Wait a minute.

386
00:26:55,543 --> 00:26:59,463
Miss... are the rumors true?

387
00:26:59,463 --> 00:27:02,826
Is it because of that Jin Jung or Jin Chang guy—

388

It's hot. I should get a popsicle, too.

392
00:27:35,463 --> 00:27:39,603
Sir... is she the one that I only heard about?

393
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,673
Shut up.

394
00:27:45,383 --> 00:27:48,163
You shouldn't talk about her so carelessly like that.

395
00:27:51,243 --> 00:27:54,413
It's getting cold. Why would you even want an ice cream?

396
00:27:54,413 --> 00:27:57,053
Ice cream, even if I freeze to death. What do you want?

397
00:27:57,053 --> 00:27:59,933
I don't eat unless I get to pick and choose.

398
00:27:59,933 --> 00:28:02,303
Do you want me to pick on you and beat you up?

399

- Yes.
- We located Yoo Jin Chul!

Who else would do something that crazy beside you?

Even if you hate me, making assumptions like that is a bit too much.

Suspicions surrounding Chief Lee Jang Won of the Central District Prosecutors' Office regarding his sponsorship

673
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:31,950
of a woman in her 20s has been revealed to be true.

674
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:34,200
Our reporters have exclusively obtained the

675
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,640
photos of Chief Lee Jang Won and Ms. Park's secret meeting.

676
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,450
The more shocking truth is that Ms. Park, who is in the picture,

677
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:40,790
Ms. Park, who is in the picture,

678
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:44,540
is the victim of the Seocho-dong murder case, which occurred on the 12th.

679
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:48,110
Also, the meeting date at the bottom of the picture

680
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:51,580
matches with the date of the occurrence of murder.

The controversy about Chief Lee Jang Won's lies about having

682
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,230
no relationship with the victim,

683
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:58,740
also, Prosecutor Jin Jung's claim that Chief Lee Jang Won is

684
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:01,510
the most suspected culprit...

685
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:05,360
There's this quote that comes out in a drama.

686
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:07,540
"Evil is diligent."

687

It's a quote that I like.

What is it that you want to say?

Evil is actually diligent.

There's one thing that they don't know, though...

that I'm multiple times more diligent than them.

but I didn't murder her.

Gosh, what a problem for you, Prosecutor?

699
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:54,800
You got the totally wrong destination.

700
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,770
Chief Lee Jang Won... isn't the culprit.

701
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:00,940
The real culprit is someone else.
