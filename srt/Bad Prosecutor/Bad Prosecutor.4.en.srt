I need to figure that out.

79
00:07:57,758 --> 00:08:00,328
The only thing I can tell you right now is

80
00:08:00,328 --> 00:08:03,588
that he might not have killed himself.

81
00:08:03,588 --> 00:08:05,698

These are the people that the Chief contacted before his death.

84
00:08:13,238 --> 00:08:15,548
The conversation was all the same.

"Let's meet in the near future."

87
00:08:20,018 --> 00:08:24,298
He even ordered a present for his granddaughter's birthday next week.

88
00:08:24,298 --> 00:08:28,128
It doesn't make sense for him to kill himself.

You stay there for a while and don't think about anything—

103

104
00:09:14,648 --> 00:09:18,898
- Substantial evidence that you can't help but start an investigation.

Just sit tight and wait.

Hey!

109
00:09:29,578 --> 00:09:32,708
I'm not saying that I won't investigate because I don't want to.

110
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,318
The cause itself can't be established at all!

111

What is he talking about?

127
00:11:08,018 --> 00:11:12,508
It's still only a speculation, but since this is a grave matter,

128
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:16,518
I think we shouldn't leave even the smallest stone unturned.

129

So you're saying...

145
00:12:12,488 --> 00:12:14,618
That's true. Where did he go?

146
00:12:14,618 --> 00:12:16,588
I think he was here just moments ago.

147
00:12:16,588 --> 00:12:19,318
Such a bullcrap.

Why does he keep calling me?

153

Can you do that?

154
00:12:56,588 --> 00:12:57,948
What?

155
00:12:57,948 --> 00:13:00,128
One more yelling doesn't make a difference.

156
00:13:00,128 --> 00:13:02,618
- Skip over to the next one.
- Okay.

157
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:05,328
He hung up again.

158
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:08,698
- Where the heck did he go?
- Well...

159
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,908
We also kept checking after this scene,

160
00:13:12,908 --> 00:13:15,738
but he was the only one who went in.

161

Thank you.

Why does the camera angle change here?

164

That's obviously because the camera turned.

165
00:13:33,748 --> 00:13:35,818
The camera turned?

166
00:15:20,038 --> 00:15:22,618
I checked all the CCTVs in the hallway.

167
00:15:22,618 --> 00:15:27,138

169

Following that exit is the underground parking lot.

170

What about the CCTVs there?

171
00:15:33,518 --> 00:15:35,998
Perhaps, the black boxes on the cars?

172
00:15:35,998 --> 00:15:37,308

I understand the CEO's intentions, but

197
00:17:16,388 --> 00:17:18,568
there is such a strong will from the higher-ups

198

regarding this appointment.

199
00:17:22,468 --> 00:17:26,108
I think it'll be difficult to follow the CEO's appointments.

200

I'll visit the CEO soon and ask for his understanding, so—

soon after Ye Young was killed.

There was nothing special.

It was mostly what Mister bought her.

Bags, shoes, and perfumes...

251

Actually, Ye Young didn't really like those things.

That's why I was really surprised when Mister called me.

I was worried that he'd ask for me to return everything he had bought Ye Young.

An MP3?

267
00:21:50,738 --> 00:21:53,298
There is a cat house on top of the cat tower.

268
00:21:53,298 --> 00:21:56,378
I guess it must've been there. She was chewing on it one day.

- Yes.

Wait a second.

277

Nothing, but why are you asking?

278
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:31,758
Chief Lee Jang Won was looking into the

279
00:22:31,758 --> 00:22:34,348
Seocho-dong murder case on his own.

280
00:22:35,738 --> 00:22:39,968
You're saying that his death is related to Seocho-dong?

281
00:22:39,968 --> 00:22:42,948
Yes, it's highly likely, although we can't be sure yet.

282
00:22:42,948 --> 00:22:44,868
The MP3 that you just spoke of...

283
00:22:44,868 --> 00:22:48,298
I guess it could also be related to the incidents.

It's our homework to find out how it is related.

285
00:22:51,868 --> 00:22:55,348
It's surely an important item if the Chief was looking for it.

286
00:22:55,348 --> 00:22:57,798
The problem is its location.

287
00:22:57,798 --> 00:22:59,498
What about your end?

288
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:07,448
There are bruises and hemorrhaging from his head to his lower back.

289
00:23:07,448 --> 00:23:09,798
So he didn't fall on his head first vertically?

290
00:23:09,798 --> 00:23:13,148
Yes, I think his upper and lower body fell at the same time

291
00:23:13,148 --> 00:23:15,588
while his body was parallel to the ground.

292
00:23:16,638 --> 00:23:18,368
He might not have fallen on his own, then.
