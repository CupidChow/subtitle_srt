♫ The protagonist works here and issues an arrest warrant ♫

652
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:11,630
♫ A swordsman who goes beyond imagination ♫

653
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:13,710
♫ Tear up the summons, I'd rather have a fantasy ♫

654
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:16,700
♫ Catch the bad guys ♫

655
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:19,210
♫ It's a gangda that devours the green grass ♫

656
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:21,110
♫ It's the same as holding a sword, that swordsman isn't a swordsman ♫

657
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:23,840
♫ Full of ambition, up to the threshold of death drama ♫

658

♫ Babies on a single rope wander as if to block card prices ♫

01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:28,560
♫ From time to time, your other comments are subtitles under the courtroom ♫

660
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,800
♫ It's the same as holding a sword, that swordsman isn't a swordsman ♫

[Bad Prosecutor]

664
01:01:37,765 --> 01:01:39,775
I just did my best to protect the organization.

665
01:01:39,775 --> 01:01:43,085
I'll prove to you just how wrong that shallow conviction of yours is.

666
01:01:43,085 --> 01:01:44,635
Don't you know where this is?

667
01:01:44,635 --> 01:01:46,435
This is the Supreme Prosecution's Inspection Department, you jerk!

668
01:01:46,435 --> 01:01:49,105
[Background Check Result]
Your name came up on the drug dealer's list, Director.

669
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:50,155
I know nothing about that matter.

670
01:01:50,155 --> 01:01:51,345
Why the heck would you do something that crazy?

671
01:01:51,345 --> 01:01:53,735
- That's true.
- Your position at the Prosecution must be quite weak.

672
01:01:53,735 --> 01:01:54,925
Try saying you're sorry with your head on the ground.

673
01:01:54,925 --> 01:01:57,415
You're saying the blood on the boot is the same as mine, right?

674
01:01:57,415 --> 01:01:58,565
RH positive, type B.

675
01:01:58,565 --> 01:02:00,245
You almost died, you punk!

676
01:02:00,245 --> 01:02:03,318
Listen to a person when he tells you something. I'm telling you for your sake.

677
01:02:03,318 --> 01:02:06,128
Pretending not to know something isn't my style.
