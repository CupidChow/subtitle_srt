1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,300
Namsa University

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,560
Oh! Boarding House
H-hello.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,740
I-I am f-freshman Ch-Cha Bong Deok.
Episode 7. Serious About Him

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,300
I first met him when I just started at the university.

5
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:27,340
Seoul, which I first experienced at age 20 was a completely unfamiliar world.

6
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,270
An unknown place and unfamiliar people

7
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,120
In the atmosphere of the very excited freshmen,

8
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,440
everything felt so unfamiliar.

9
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,410
Then

10
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,720
Excuse me.

11
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,980
Yeah?

12
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:56,540
Aren't you a Japanese literature major?

13
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,320
I am.

14
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:02,110
If you're not taken, do you want to team up with me?

15
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,450
Will that be okay?

16
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,050
Of course.

17
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,730
- Okay. I'd like that.
- Really?

18
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,170
- Great.
- Really?

19
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:20,290
He was the first one who reached out to me.

20
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,830
Sit.

21
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,610
They have great tteokbokki here.

22
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,530
Boss, make it extra spicy, please.

23
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,900
Anytime you need company for lunch, call me.

24
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,590
Thanks.

25
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,470
Enjoy.

26
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,440
Is it too spicy?

27
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,220
No. I love spicy food.

28
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,750
Especially spicy rice cake.

29
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,680
Help yourself.

30
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,580
That's when it all began.

31
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,890
Good, right?

32
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,570
I started falling for him.

33
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,160
At first, I denied my feelings,

34
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,210
but I couldn't hide it.

35
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:02,390
I've liked him ever since.

36
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,710
Do you understand?

37
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:17,540
I don't know about you, but my feelings for him are deep.

38
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,780
If you're not serious about him, please stop now.

39
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,610
Stop what?

40
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,700
Didn't you listen to what I just said?

41
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:38,070
I'm never going to give up.

42
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:42,310
You might want to play hard to get or be flirting.

43
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,520
But my feelings for him are sincere.

44
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,890
Who do you think you are to judge me like that?

45
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,720
I'm okay with him not liking me back.

46
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,690
But, I'll never let you lead him on.

47
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,050
It's disgusting.

48
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,960
Let me…

49
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,740
Let me make one thing clear.

50
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,170
You might have the wrong idea about me,

51
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:32,000
but I am serious about Seol Won.

52
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,800
That'll be it for our last session.

53
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,460
I won't take any questions.

54
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,160
Thank you for everything.

55
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,600
Seonbae,

56
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,500
aren't you interested in dating at all?

57
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,580
Why do you ask such a random question?

58
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,360
Answer the question.

59
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,430
Your advice on my novel wasn't the only thing I was after.

60
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,600
I'm not answering that, so don't ask.

61
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,090
Did you spend time with me because I'm like Ji Su?

62
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,290
It's nothing like that.

63
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,640
You're not the most sociable person.

64
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,320
But you took the time to see me and offered kind advice to me.

65
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,190
I'm sure you also have some feelings for me.

66
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,700
I like you.

67
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,330
Hi!

68
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:58,390
At first, I was surprised to see someone who looked so much like Ji Su.

69
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,430
But she was different in so many ways.

70
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,390
Stop ringing! I'm coming!

71
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:27,010
- And I started gradually growing fond of her.
- Do you live here?

72
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,480
She still reminds me of Ji Su sometimes.

73
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,920
About that novel I asked you to critique…

74
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,780
- Sorry.
- Wait!

75
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,620
But I think I might have fallen for her.

76
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:53,080
I like you.

77
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,150
Will it be okay for us to become

78
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,720
more than just classmates?

79
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:36,180
If you're not serious about him, please stop now.

80
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,500
Seol Won!

81
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,140
Cheol Su!

82
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,950
What's that you're holding?

83
00:09:54,950 --> 00:10:01,060
I went shopping and bought some groceries.

84
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,980
Have you

85
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:13,010
known Bong Deok for a long time?

86
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,200
Bong Deok?

87
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,200
In college we had the closest senior-junior relationship.

88
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,530
Once you really get to know him,

89
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,180
you'll see that he's a great guy.

90
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,400
I see.

91
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:34,140
He seems to care for you deeply.

92
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:41,200
That's why he even gave me a warning.

93
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,930
Why would he give you a…

94
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,960
He told me not to lead you on.

95
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:15,020
But he was wrong.

96
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,740
I've given this a lot of thought,

97
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:26,750
and I decided that I don't want to be just another tenant to you.

98
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,790
Cheol Su.

99
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:34,960
I'm used to it, but because it might confuse you.

100
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,040
I've been thinking about it.

101
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,980
But I've been

102
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,340
having a hard time because of you

103
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,940
since the first day I moved in to the boarding house.

104
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,800
Here's the USB.

105
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,790
Maybe because I like you.

106
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:19,060
Cheol Su, I…
