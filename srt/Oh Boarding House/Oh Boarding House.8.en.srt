00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:13,600
Oh! Boarding House
Episode 8. Being Honest

2
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,400
He should be grateful for having a kind sister like me.

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,282
Not many sisters would bother

4
00:00:24,282 --> 00:00:28,792
to bring her brother food so early in the morning.

5
00:00:28,792 --> 00:00:32,565
I agree. But your mother made this food, right?

6
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:34,078
She did.

7
00:00:34,099 --> 00:00:37,825
But I took the time to deliver it.

8
00:00:37,825 --> 00:00:42,394
- That's something.
- Yes, of course.

9
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:45,610
She's so different from Cheol-su.

10
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:49,449
Oh! What is this?

11
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,558
I smell meat.

12
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:53,295
It smells nice.

13
00:00:53,295 --> 00:00:54,589
You little punk.

14
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:57,557
Cheol-su's mother made this for everyone.

15
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,998
Go set the table.

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,560
You must have—

17
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,195
What's up with all the noise so early?

18
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:28,878
Hey, Kim Hye Su. You've done your good deed for the day.

19
00:01:28,878 --> 00:01:30,720
Join us for breakfast!

20
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,293
Hey asshole.

21
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:36,533
Do you realize how much effort it took to bring this so early in the morning?

22
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:38,790
I said I'd come fetch it myself.

23
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:44,000
Blame Mom for making you deliver it.

24
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,114
Where's Bong Deok?

25
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,833
Bong Deok, time for breakfast.

26
00:02:34,763 --> 00:02:36,966
Dear Seonbae Seol Won ,

27
00:02:36,966 --> 00:02:41,820
I'm sorry I left suddenly only leaving this letter.

28
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,715
Boss, make it extra spicy, please.

29
00:02:55,715 --> 00:02:58,988
You might have heard it from Cheol Su,

30
00:03:05,565 --> 00:03:07,730
but I'm afraid if I stay at the boarding house any longer,

31
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:11,430
it will only make you feel uncomfortable.

32
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,583
Even though we were always close,

33
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,010
I could never be honest to you, and all I did was agonize.

34
00:03:35,221 --> 00:03:40,176
To tell you the truth, I liked you with all my heart.

35
00:03:49,508 --> 00:03:51,923
It's way too spicy.

36
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:56,107
Why does he even like this?

37
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:27,375
Seol Won

38
00:05:21,241 --> 00:05:22,565
Seonbaenim.

39
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:25,084
Ye Min!

40
00:05:25,084 --> 00:05:27,359
Are you going to continue to ignore me?

41
00:05:31,411 --> 00:05:34,515
You shouldn't have barged into our house like that.

42
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:41,839
I'll go my way. You go yours.

43
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:44,004
Seriously…

44
00:05:44,004 --> 00:05:47,071
when will you stop running away, Hwang Ye Min?

45
00:05:52,299 --> 00:05:57,979
Cheol Su

46
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:02,420
Missed Call

47
00:06:28,295 --> 00:06:34,818
You couldn't say it all this time.

48
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:45,174
You're a fool.
Cake for Seol Won

49
00:06:45,174 --> 00:06:50,760
Bong Deok

50
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:04,927
Let's do this.

51
00:07:04,927 --> 00:07:09,030
Let me show you how a proper spike is done.

52
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,990
Teach! Teach! Watch out!

53
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,820
Teach!

54
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,293
Teach, Teach, Teach. Are you okay?

55
00:07:23,293 --> 00:07:25,908
I told you to watch out!

56
00:07:25,908 --> 00:07:28,700
Hey! Teach! Teach! Teach!

57
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,463
Teach! Teach!

58
00:07:37,463 --> 00:07:40,690
How are you feeling? Do you recognize me?

59
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,088
Oh, Jae Wu ...

60
00:07:44,618 --> 00:07:47,714
How long have I been here?

61
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,920
I was worried about you! I thought you died!

62
00:08:03,056 --> 00:08:05,136
Jae Wu.

63
00:08:05,136 --> 00:08:06,182
What?

64
00:08:06,182 --> 00:08:08,607
When you kiss someone,

65
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,423
does that mean you're with them?

66
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,517
What?

67
00:08:18,356 --> 00:08:19,485
What the…

68
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,995
Look at who you're asking. On top of that, I'm a high school student.

69
00:08:23,995 --> 00:08:27,148
If you want love counseling,

70
00:08:28,998 --> 00:08:31,474
you can go ahead.

71
00:08:31,474 --> 00:08:35,152
I know all about dating.

72
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:37,864
- Really?
- Yeah.

73
00:08:37,864 --> 00:08:40,255
When did it start?

74
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,151
I don't remember exactly.

75
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:48,504
So lame. Stuff like that matters.

76
00:08:48,504 --> 00:08:51,953
Was it a Jamanchu* or an arranged date?
(Meeting a romantic partner naturally)

77
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:55,018
A Jaman… what?

78
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:59,696
It means "meeting someone naturally".

79
00:08:59,696 --> 00:09:02,752
You kids make up words for everything.

80
00:09:02,752 --> 00:09:04,678
I think so.

81
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,325
I think… it was.

82
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:14,591
Was it or do you think so?

83
00:09:14,591 --> 00:09:17,981
Did you admit it and receive a definite response?

84
00:09:20,386 --> 00:09:25,041
By the looks of it I see you did a half-ass job.

85
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:28,020
Teacher.

86
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:32,283
Confessing by yourself, creating misunderstanding,

87
00:09:32,283 --> 00:09:35,694
that's a no-no.

88
00:09:37,308 --> 00:09:40,503
It's okay. Things like that can happen.

89
00:09:45,245 --> 00:09:47,316
Seol Won

90
00:10:21,814 --> 00:10:23,720
Where are you going?

91
00:10:25,044 --> 00:10:27,087
Teach.

92
00:10:27,087 --> 00:10:29,482
- Teach! I
- What is it?

93
00:10:29,482 --> 00:10:33,620
I gave you free counseling, so can I go home early?

94
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:48,777
Stop the waterworks.

95
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:54,169
It's because the food is too spicy.

96
00:10:56,883 --> 00:11:02,986
Did everything go well with him?

97
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:07,609
Well, that's…

98
00:11:09,394 --> 00:11:15,303
He looks like an asshole, but I think he's a good guy.

99
00:11:15,303 --> 00:11:18,792
Think about yourself, idiot.

100
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:20,760
You, too.

101
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,950
I'm sure you had a tough time

102
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:29,691
until you finally decided to tell me.

103
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,668
Thank you.

104
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:52,290
And I'm sorry, Bong Deok.

105
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:55,819
I'm sorry…

106
00:12:00,267 --> 00:12:03,190
And thank you, Seonbae.

107
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:34,180
2021 - The 36th Namsa Literature Grand Prize
Kim Hye Su

108
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:40,569
You wanted to see me just to show this?

109
00:12:44,491 --> 00:12:47,882
I won the award thanks to you.

110
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,850
Thank you.

111
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:54,610
Let me treat you to a nice meal.

112
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,873
No, thanks.

113
00:13:03,602 --> 00:13:06,483
Do you have anything else to tell me?

114
00:13:10,602 --> 00:13:12,695
I don't.

115
00:13:20,764 --> 00:13:22,772
I see.

116
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:28,750
Thank you for helping me with my novel.

117
00:14:16,588 --> 00:14:22,308
The person you called is not answering.

118
00:14:23,711 --> 00:14:25,961
Was it a natural meeting?

119
00:14:25,961 --> 00:14:29,406
Did you admit it and receive a definite response?

120
00:14:29,406 --> 00:14:35,009
By the looks of it I see you did a half-ass job.

121
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:45,230
Seol Won!

122
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:48,874
Seol Won!

123
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:58,820
[Seol Won] Can you come meet me at the park?

124
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:14,090
Seol Won!

125
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:24,549
Cheol Su.

126
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,885
You had me worried.

127
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:29,526
I looked everywhere for you.

128
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:38,006
Actually, I was out meeting with Bong Deok.

129
00:15:47,204 --> 00:15:49,372
I see.

130
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:58,220
After all, we did rush things a bit between us.

131
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:02,825
So, that's fine.

132
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:08,990
You know, things like this can happen to anyone.

133
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,732
Thank you for everything.

134
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,716
I hope you…

135
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:40,003
Winter of that year
Merry Christmas!

136
00:17:40,003 --> 00:17:44,390
- You're late!
- Come join us!

137
00:17:46,384 --> 00:17:48,328
- I'm sorry.
- Make some room.

138
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,756
- Where's mine?
- Here!

139
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:54,143
- Wait!
- One, two, three!

140
00:17:54,143 --> 00:17:57,150
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

141
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,600
- I can't drink?
- No!

142
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,732
- But why?
- This is great!

143
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:06,934
You're so lame.

144
00:18:33,202 --> 00:18:36,803
- Today is a success, isn't it?
- It is.

145
00:18:36,803 --> 00:18:38,540
This is great.

146
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:49,700
Thank you to Channel Manager mielikki

147

Thank you to all moderarors and subtitlers

150
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,479
Seol Won.

151
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:34,280
Shall we go up to the room?

152
00:19:46,288 --> 00:19:47,939
Come on.

153
00:20:01,553 --> 00:20:04,103
