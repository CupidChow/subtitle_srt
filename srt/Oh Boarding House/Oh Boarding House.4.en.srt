1
00:00:33,926 --> 00:00:35,960
Excuse me.

2
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:43,199
Can you teach me how to exercise?

3
00:00:48,004 --> 00:00:50,130
Six.

4
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,378
Oh! Boarding House!
Episode 4. Oh, what a coincidence!
Seven.

5
00:00:54,378 --> 00:00:56,402
Eight.

6
00:00:57,259 --> 00:00:59,172
Nine.

7
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,909
Nine.

8
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:04,202
Nine.

9
00:01:04,202 --> 00:01:06,830
Nine.

10
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:08,594
Nine.

11
00:01:08,594 --> 00:01:12,385
- Just stop, will you?
- Just one more!

12
00:01:12,385 --> 00:01:15,899
Okay. Last one, for real.

13
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,300
You can do this! Okay!

14
00:01:20,576 --> 00:01:22,490
Let's move on!

15
00:01:25,262 --> 00:01:27,121
Clean Gym/ Pilates / Work-out /PT 
Nine.

16
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:29,279
Nine.

17
00:01:29,279 --> 00:01:31,330
Nine.

18
00:01:42,921 --> 00:01:44,668
Hi.

19
00:01:44,668 --> 00:01:46,454
Thanks for the help.

20
00:01:46,454 --> 00:01:49,494
If you're free after this, what do you say we go have some wine?

21
00:01:49,494 --> 00:01:51,777
It's my treat.

22
00:01:51,777 --> 00:01:54,578
Wine's not a good idea after workout.

23
00:01:54,578 --> 00:01:58,518
Consuming alcohol can cause muscle loss.

24
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,996
Did you stretch after you worked out?

25
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:03,122
Stretch?

26
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:05,029
If you don't stretch after working out,

27
00:02:05,029 --> 00:02:10,463
all the contracted muscles you used will be tight and sore for days.

28
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,427
Come with me.

29
00:02:11,427 --> 00:02:14,537
Let me show you how to properly stretch your muscles.

30
00:02:14,537 --> 00:02:17,257
Thanks. I'll pass.

31
00:02:17,257 --> 00:02:19,927
I told you. Stretching is a must.

32
00:02:19,927 --> 00:02:23,435
I told you I'd pass! I'm done!

33
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:29,369
Stretching is good…

34
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,440
Stretching is good.

35
00:02:51,348 --> 00:02:53,634
Isn't this your favorite drink?

36
00:02:55,365 --> 00:02:57,706
The Sorrow of Young Werther
I'm sorry I startled you, Seonbae.

37
00:03:03,128 --> 00:03:05,675
Isn't this your favorite drink, Ye Min?

38
00:03:07,341 --> 00:03:09,308
Are you okay? Did I startle you?

39
00:03:09,308 --> 00:03:10,962
Yeah.

40
00:03:10,962 --> 00:03:12,985
But I'm fine.

41
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:15,008
Why do you keep
sneaking up on me like this?

42
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:17,102
Every single time.

43
00:03:17,102 --> 00:03:18,971
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:19,654 --> 00:03:21,861
What do you want to do at night?

45
00:03:22,683 --> 00:03:24,119
Maybe grab some food?

46
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:26,513
What kind?

47
00:03:26,513 --> 00:03:27,728
Pasta.

48
00:03:27,728 --> 00:03:30,034
I had it yesterday.

49
00:03:30,034 --> 00:03:31,311
Salad.

50
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,689
That won't be enough.

51
00:03:32,689 --> 00:03:33,812
Soup and rice.

52
00:03:33,812 --> 00:03:35,446
- It'll make me fat.
- Pizza.

53
00:03:35,446 --> 00:03:36,951
That's even worse.

54
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:39,192
It's too greasy.

55
00:03:39,192 --> 00:03:40,953
Let's have sandwiches.

56
00:03:40,953 --> 00:03:42,602
- Sure.
- You like the idea?

57
00:03:42,602 --> 00:03:44,588
You don't look like you do.

58
00:03:44,588 --> 00:03:45,621
I like it.

59
00:03:45,621 --> 00:03:47,326
Okay.

60
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,190
I hope

61
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,623
I'm not making you feel uncomfortable.

62
00:03:56,794 --> 00:04:01,191
About that novel I asked you to critique…

63
00:04:01,191 --> 00:04:05,219
I'm sorry. I have class. I have to run.

64
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:07,513
- Sorry.
- Wait!

65
00:04:15,142 --> 00:04:18,735
Why does he act so weird whenever I talk to him?

66
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:22,005
Have I done something wrong?

67
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,108
Isn't this your favorite drink?

68
00:04:42,108 --> 00:04:45,317
I hope I'm not making you feel uncomfortable.

69
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:51,012
Why does she keep following me?
It's like she's stalking me.

70
00:04:52,803 --> 00:04:55,583
She freaks me out every time.

71
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:01,765
What the…

72
00:05:04,981 --> 00:05:07,387
What the heck?

73
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:11,410
Why is nobody answering the door?

74
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:17,783
Stop ringing! I'm coming!

75
00:05:24,098 --> 00:05:26,893
Seonbaenim, do you live here?

76
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,712
What a coincidence!

77
00:05:28,712 --> 00:05:30,933
What are the odds?

78
00:05:34,695 --> 00:05:36,555
What…

79
00:05:36,555 --> 00:05:38,199
Hi.

80
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:41,741
There is a stalker standing in front of my door.

81
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,894
Please be quick.

82
00:05:44,821 --> 00:05:49,190
Did you just call the police?

83
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:52,786
Did you do it for real?

84
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:55,268
- It's not what you think.
- No.

85
00:05:55,268 --> 00:05:56,893
- Just listen to me.
- I'm sorry.

86
00:05:56,893 --> 00:05:58,123
Hey!

87
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,591
Hey, look!

88
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,971
Seonbaenim!

89
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:06,966
Hey!

90
00:06:07,874 --> 00:06:09,401
What the heck?

91
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,117
What a coincidence.

92
00:06:20,843 --> 00:06:22,982
Seol Won.

93
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:25,494
Are you going somewhere, Cheol Su-nim?

94
00:06:25,494 --> 00:06:28,388
I'm meeting with my friends so I'm going to take a bus.

95
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,181
Me too.

96
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,386
I see.

97
00:06:39,224 --> 00:06:41,284
This is awkward.

98
00:06:41,284 --> 00:06:44,989
What do I say?

99
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:49,388
Should I talk about that movie we missed?

100
00:06:50,973 --> 00:06:52,633
This is awkward.

101
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:57,722
He'll be uncomfortable if I try to make small talk.

102
00:06:57,722 --> 00:07:03,103
Why is my heart pounding so when he's just my tenant?

103
00:07:03,103 --> 00:07:05,457
Oh right!

104
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:07,583
What time is it?

105
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,247
I'll be late.

106
00:07:11,247 --> 00:07:14,833
I think I'll have to catch a taxi.

107
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,014
I'll see you.

108
00:07:39,761 --> 00:07:41,794
Thank you.

109
00:07:56,342 --> 00:08:00,955
I'm going this way.

110
00:08:00,955 --> 00:08:03,806
I'm going that way.

111
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:06,620
I'll see you at home.

112
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,888
See you.

113
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,693
See you.

114
00:08:10,693 --> 00:08:12,323
Bye.

115
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:07,723
I'm not stalking you, so don't get the wrong idea.

116
00:09:07,723 --> 00:09:10,313
You aren't?

117
00:09:10,313 --> 00:09:11,828
What?

118
00:09:11,828 --> 00:09:12,984
Isn't this weird?

119
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:16,822
How can we cross paths so many times?

120
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:19,557
It's not like there's some weird destiny between us.

121
00:09:21,523 --> 00:09:23,376
Seonbae!

122
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:25,012
Here!

123
00:09:25,012 --> 00:09:27,501
You're early, too.

124
00:09:29,698 --> 00:09:33,291
What are you doing here?

125
00:09:37,014 --> 00:09:39,533
I met him on the way.

126
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:44,016
Anyway, why did you want to come here? I almost got lost.

127
00:09:44,843 --> 00:09:47,148
This place is famous. It's really good.

128
00:09:47,148 --> 00:09:49,197
Let's go in.

129
00:09:56,864 --> 00:10:00,196
I'll see you later. For real this time.

130
00:10:00,196 --> 00:10:01,936
Sure.

131
00:10:07,956 --> 00:10:09,962
What the heck?

132
00:10:13,794 --> 00:10:16,801
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

133
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:33,202
It's weird, but these

134
00:10:37,324 --> 00:10:40,286
repeated coincidences

135
00:10:40,286 --> 00:10:45,901
♬ as if we're in a movie scene
with flower petals everywhere ♬

136
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:48,729
♬ The color of spring ♬
are starting

137
00:10:48,729 --> 00:10:51,283
♬ is beckoning us ♬

138
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,884
very gradually
♬ The soft ♬
to feel like they're

139
00:10:52,884 --> 00:10:57,199
♬ spring breeze fills my heart ♬

140
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:00,334
♬ and it's about to blow ♬

141
00:11:00,334 --> 00:11:02,928
become more than coincidences.

142
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:08,496
♬ My days and my sky were once plain ♬

143
00:11:08,497 --> 00:11:14,112
♬ but you've painted them with color ♬

144
00:11:14,113 --> 00:11:16,280
♬ To me, you're like a birthday present ♬

145
00:11:16,281 --> 00:11:18,931
♬ To me, you're like a birthday present ♬
Do you want to go home together?

146
00:11:18,931 --> 00:11:23,972
♬ and I love it ♬

147
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:32,570
It's as if they were meant to happen.

148
00:11:35,331 --> 00:11:36,770
Perhaps it was

149
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,911
destiny that brought us together.

150
00:11:44,911 --> 00:11:47,956
♬ In this moment, I feel ♬

151
00:11:47,956 --> 00:11:53,702
♬ as if we're in a movie scene
with flower petals everywhere ♬

152
00:11:53,702 --> 00:11:59,318
♬ The color of spring is beckoning us ♬

153
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:04,935
♬ The soft spring breeze fills my heart ♬

154
00:12:04,935 --> 00:12:08,938
♬ and it's about to blow ♬

155
00:12:10,578 --> 00:12:16,300
♬ Words cannot explain what I feel ♬

156
00:12:18,391 --> 00:12:19,580
I'm going.

157
00:12:19,581 --> 00:12:21,200
See you.

158
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:39,373
Bong Deok, I have to go to an appointment I have.

159
00:12:40,563 --> 00:12:42,130
What?

160
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,511
How could there suddenly be an appointment so late?

161
00:12:44,511 --> 00:12:46,799
What about the second round?

162
00:12:50,782 --> 00:12:52,549
Well,

163
00:12:53,577 --> 00:12:57,731
I hope you enjoy the rest of the night.

164
00:12:58,498 --> 00:13:01,385
I'll see you later then.

165
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:16,335
Being honest is a difficult thing.

166
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:29,266
There are plenty who can't do that

167
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:34,390
and have to take a detour.

168
00:13:35,837 --> 00:13:39,880
Can you walk?

169
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,090
For some, that might not be difficult,

170
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:52,600
but sometimes it's the emotion you have to hide

171
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,940
♫ Someday I'll be shy ♫

172
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,780
that gives you the toughest time.

173
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,520
♬ Day by day ♬

174
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:08,220
♫ Someday I'll be fine ♫

175
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,390
♫ Someday I'll be sure ♫

176
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:24,610
Oh! Boarding House
