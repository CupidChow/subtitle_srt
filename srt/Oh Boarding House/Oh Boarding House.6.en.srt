1
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:17,410
Like I was someone possessed by something, I brought up watching a movie together,

2
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,210
but I'm still so nervous.

3
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,260
Seol Won,

4
00:00:31,883 --> 00:00:34,000
did you wait long?

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,640
Not at all.

6
00:00:39,178 --> 00:00:42,274
The movie's starting soon. Let's go in.

7
00:00:42,274 --> 00:00:43,970
Sure.

8
00:00:49,206 --> 00:00:51,141
May I see your tickets?

9
00:00:51,141 --> 00:00:55,422
Oh! Boarding House
Episode 6: What do you like?

10
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:59,794
♬ The moment your hand touched mine ♬

11
00:00:59,794 --> 00:01:02,608
♬ I'm not alone anymore ♬

12
00:01:02,608 --> 00:01:06,108
You paid for the movie,
so drinks are on me.

13
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:09,730
♬ In this moment I feel ♬

14
00:01:09,731 --> 00:01:13,018
♬ as if we're in a movie scene ♬

15
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:14,744
This is great.

16
00:01:14,744 --> 00:01:18,212
Are you okay?

17
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:22,400
Wake up. We're almost home.

18
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:31,524
Cheol Su, you're a total mystery.

19
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:33,765
What are you?

20
00:01:33,765 --> 00:01:37,395
When you're around, sometimes I'm happy and sometimes I'm uncomfortable.

21
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:43,430
Why do you keep picking me up and letting me down?

22
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,590
I'll carry you.

23
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,800
Maybe it's because I like you.

24
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,001
♬ In this moment, I feel ♬

25
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:24,780
♬ as if we're in a movie scene
with flower petals everywhere ♬

26
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,542
Good afternoon!

27
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:58,713
You're late.

28
00:02:58,713 --> 00:03:02,125
It's basic manners to be on time for anything.

29
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,175
You should learn to be flexible.

30
00:03:04,175 --> 00:03:08,253
You don't have to be so strict about everything.

31
00:03:08,253 --> 00:03:10,734
Do we have two sessions left?

32
00:03:10,734 --> 00:03:14,923
Can we not count this one? Think of it as a casual meeting.

33
00:03:14,923 --> 00:03:16,662
No way.

34
00:03:16,662 --> 00:03:18,864
Let's get started.

35
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:20,500
Cheapskate.

36
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,908
Look. you don't have to add an event to the story

37
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:34,881
just for character development.

38
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:38,251
You have to put yourself in their shoes

39
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:42,280
and let them speak for themselves.

40
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,600
Hey, Hui Su, are you listening?

41
00:03:55,497 --> 00:03:58,616
You're nicer than I thought.

42
00:04:02,115 --> 00:04:04,038
I just want your writing to get better.

43
00:04:04,038 --> 00:04:07,340
Plus, you're Cheol Su's sister.

44
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,678
Time's up. That's it for today.

45
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,200
What? Yes.

46
00:04:22,405 --> 00:04:25,043
Do you want to have soju--

47
00:04:25,043 --> 00:04:28,101
I can't. That'll ruin my routine.

48
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,769
This is it for today.

49
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:43,216
I heard you used to go out with Ji Su.

50
00:04:52,489 --> 00:04:55,796
How did you…

51
00:04:57,317 --> 00:05:01,075
Everybody at school knows about this.

52
00:05:01,075 --> 00:05:06,118
Some people told me that I remind them of Ji Su in some ways.

53
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,468
- Is that why…
- I'm sorry.

54
00:05:09,468 --> 00:05:12,580
I have a bus to catch.

55
00:05:17,136 --> 00:05:19,220
See you later.

56
00:05:31,045 --> 00:05:35,320
He's one tough puzzle to figure out.

57
00:05:54,092 --> 00:05:56,622
I thought your novel was great.

58
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:59,892
My name is Kim Hui Su, and I have a class with you.

59
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:04,029
I hope I'm not making you feel uncomfortable.

60
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,696
Do you live here? This is such a coincidence.

61
00:06:08,696 --> 00:06:10,706
Come with me.

62
00:06:10,706 --> 00:06:13,239
Awesome! Soju?

63
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,347
Cheapskate.

64
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,616
Why do I keep thinking about her?

65
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,370
Seriously.

66
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,082
What the heck?
Don't you know how to knock?

67
00:06:37,082 --> 00:06:40,095
Oh, I'm sorry.

68
00:06:40,095 --> 00:06:41,902
You idiot!

69
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:46,082
- Have some etiquette!
- What a whack job.

70
00:06:46,082 --> 00:06:50,740
Seriously! What the…

71
00:06:55,395 --> 00:07:00,236
Why does nobody lock the door in this house?

72
00:07:02,011 --> 00:07:04,390
My eyes…

73
00:07:07,492 --> 00:07:09,495
Where is it?

74
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,081
Did I surprise you? I'm sorry.

75
00:07:54,548 --> 00:07:56,308
It's fine.

76
00:07:57,524 --> 00:07:59,610
Thank you.

77
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,689
I'll wait outside till you're done.

78
00:08:35,302 --> 00:08:37,202
Teacher.

79
00:08:38,443 --> 00:08:42,422
A chicken bone got stuck in my throat during lunch,

80
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:47,347
and my body temperature suddenly dropped, and what do you call it…

81
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:54,023
My prefrontal lobe has not been functioning.

82
00:08:54,023 --> 00:08:59,735
So, I think I'll have to go home early today.

83
00:09:17,552 --> 00:09:19,492
I'll get back to the classroom.

84
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,716
Okay!

85
00:09:21,716 --> 00:09:24,318
- You can go.
- Huh?

86
00:09:26,336 --> 00:09:27,767
Thank you.

87
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,736
But,

88
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:36,921
you'll have to answer some questions for me before you go.

89
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,411
What?

90
00:09:47,502 --> 00:09:53,208
So, you want information about Hyeong Seol Won?

91
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,964
Yeah.

92
00:09:57,542 --> 00:10:02,168
Hyeong Seol Weon and I go back a long time.

93
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,092
Seol Won.

94
00:10:04,092 --> 00:10:07,395
Information about Seol Won.

95
00:10:11,172 --> 00:10:13,470
I have nothing.

96
00:10:18,756 --> 00:10:23,422
You're his cousin. You should know at least something.

97
00:10:24,053 --> 00:10:26,992
Whatever he likes is none of my business.

98
00:10:27,717 --> 00:10:31,937
If you're done, can I go now?

99
00:10:35,733 --> 00:10:38,361
I have many things to do.

100
00:10:38,361 --> 00:10:39,967
Okay.

101
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:42,830
- Get lost fast.
- Sure.

102
00:11:02,118 --> 00:11:08,030
What does Seol Won like?

103
00:11:28,841 --> 00:11:31,726
What does Seol Won like?

104
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:46,282
How do you like the movie?

105
00:11:46,282 --> 00:11:48,089
Why do people these days

106
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:51,178
get intimate as soon as they meet each other?

107
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:52,988
I agree.

108
00:11:52,988 --> 00:11:57,050
That was a quick development.

109
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,698
That's too much for me to watch.

110
00:12:05,222 --> 00:12:08,550
- What's wrong?
- I can't.

111
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,729
Yeah, this is too much.

112
00:12:12,729 --> 00:12:15,121
What are you doing?

113
00:12:15,121 --> 00:12:19,420
This is kind of weird.

114
00:12:42,907 --> 00:12:46,680
Why did you want to see me?

115
00:12:51,346 --> 00:12:53,705
I'll cut to the chase.

116
00:12:53,705 --> 00:12:57,576
How do you feel about Seol Won?

117
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,780
Why would I answer that?

118
00:13:30,689 --> 00:13:34,415
♬ Never give it up,
give it up, give it up ♬

119
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:38,511
♬ You can break it up,
break it up, break it up ♬

120
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:44,388
♬ Get yourself together ♬

121
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:46,232
♬ Be in the moment ♬

122
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:48,920
♬ Break it up, break it up, break it up ♬

123
00:13:48,921 --> 00:13:53,223
♬ You can shake it up,
shake it up, shake it up ♬

124
00:13:53,938 --> 00:13:58,786
♬ Make some noise ♬

125
00:13:58,786 --> 00:14:02,389
♬ without a care in the world ♬
