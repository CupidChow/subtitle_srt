1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:04,393
Mother, I beg for your help.

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:07,653
Mother

3
00:00:07,727 --> 00:00:09,706
The sercurity deposit is gone,

4
00:00:09,706 --> 00:00:11,733
and you got fired from your job?

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,800
Yes, Mother.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,086
You're still working part-time as a translator, right?

7
00:00:17,086 --> 00:00:18,800
I am, Mother.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,400
Please have mercy and take pity on this poor creature.

9
00:00:28,064 --> 00:00:31,865
Well, that kind of hardship happens to everyone.

10
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,600
All right, you can stay at the boarding house.

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,400
Mom, one hundred million won's gone.Is that okay?

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,705
You're the one who blew it, not me.

13
00:00:41,705 --> 00:00:44,600
You better pay me back within three years.

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,200
Well, of course.

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,884
Also, in exchange for staying here,

16
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:50,951
What?

17
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:53,458
you will operate the boarding house yourself.

18
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:55,622
Don't forget to study hard and find a new job.

19
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:57,431
You want me to manage the boarding house?

20
00:00:57,431 --> 00:01:00,393
What are you going to do while I do that?

21
00:01:02,231 --> 00:01:05,084
Son! I'm going to go on a trip abroad.

22
00:01:05,084 --> 00:01:07,334
Life is too short. You should enjoy it when you're young.

23
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:11,351
Mommy will have fun on her trip, so good luck, Son!

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,500
Goodbye.

25
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,000
A new tenant is coming today so be sure to make him feel welcome.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,600
He's handsome and tall.

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,900
I think he said he's a PE teacher or something.

28
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,100
Also, there's a whacko who lives in

29
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,500
the backroom of the second floor. Be. Careful.

30
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,760
And this is how I came to live at

31
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,073
Boarding House 5.

32
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,500
Oh Boarding House
Episode 1. Men of the Boarding House

33
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,800
What the hell! Hey! You're Jae Wu, right?

34
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,400
When did you grow so tall?

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's good to see you.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,700
What are you doing?

37
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,600
Don't get weird and all.

38
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,385
Nam Jae Wu, 18 years old
Seol Won's younger cousin

39
00:02:08,385 --> 00:02:09,765
Teen Aged Troublemaker
A bit of a jerk

40
00:02:09,765 --> 00:02:10,913
Big appetite
Sucks at video games

41
00:02:10,913 --> 00:02:12,867
I heard about the situation from Aunt.

42
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:15,873
Hyeong, I heard you got scammed and lost your deposit.

43
00:02:15,873 --> 00:02:19,172
Is that really the first thing you have to say?

44
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:24,113
Anyway, I was really worried about managing this boarding house.

45
00:02:24,113 --> 00:02:26,506
I'm glad that you're here, man.

46
00:02:26,506 --> 00:02:28,133
Bring it here.

47
00:02:28,172 --> 00:02:29,225
Me?

48
00:02:29,225 --> 00:02:30,739
Me? Help you?

49
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:31,900
What?

50
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,625
You seem to be misunderstanding the situation here,

51
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:38,600
but my mom is paying the same amount as the rest of the people here.

52
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,800
I'm a guest at this boarding house.

53
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,247
- But we're still family—
- Family?

54
00:02:50,247 --> 00:02:56,021
You shouldn't play the family card on me like this.

55
00:02:56,021 --> 00:02:58,800
Take a look. The rice cooker is empty, right?

56
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,500
Then what should you do? You should make more rice!

57
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,300
Got it?

58
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,100
I expect some meat, too, okay?

59
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,900
What's wrong with this thing?

60
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,300
Nothing's working out today.

61
00:03:27,648 --> 00:03:28,962
What the hell?

62
00:03:28,962 --> 00:03:30,629
What the hell! Who are you?

63
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:34,500
I'm Wang Ye Min, the guy in the backroom of the second floor.

64
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,879
Wang Ye Min, 24 years old
Namsa University Creative Writing Major

65
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,206
Supersensitive
Routine Scene: crazy

66
00:03:37,206 --> 00:03:39,273
The wacko mom mentioned.
Addicted to grape juice

67
00:03:39,273 --> 00:03:43,400
Oh, you're that whack—
- Yes. The whacko is me.

68
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,499
- I'm so sorry. I—

69
00:03:46,499 --> 00:03:50,897
You lost money in a scam, got fired, and are managing the boarding house.

70
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,060
I already know who you are.

71
00:03:54,007 --> 00:03:56,060
Okay. Nice to meet you.

72
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,000
Never mind the greeting. I just have one favor to ask.

73
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,241
I'm a writer.

74
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:04,513
Therefore a quiet environment is most important for me

75
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,400
so please keep it quiet.

76
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,000
I don't want to hear loud footsteps.

77
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,000
I hope you understand.

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,300
Yes, sir.

79
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,200
I should've just moved in with Bong Deok.

80
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,900
What's with that guy?

81
00:04:42,945 --> 00:04:44,932
Recently, in the Namsa-dong neighborhood in Seoul,

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,300
a burglar has been breaking into empty houses.

83
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,900
The culprit seems to be targeting residential areas where CCTVs are scant.

84
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,429
What do you mean robbing empty houses in the 21st century?

85
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,100
It's not enough to work hard.

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,900
Description of Suspect Kwak
Stocky, Wears Black, Copper Tanned Complexion

87
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,400
He's the loud one…

88
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Just die already!

89
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,400
Who's being so noisy right now?

90
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,800
Are you the new tenant?

91
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,000
If you have some common sense,

92
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,900
please stop walking on your heels and making noise.

93
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,000
Understand?

94
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,500
Okay.

95
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,800
You're the new tenant, right?

96
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,000
Welcome. This is the boarding house uniform.

97
00:07:13,523 --> 00:07:15,567
Come with me. Come.

98
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,500
He's handsome and tall.

99
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,500
I guess my mom's taste in men has changed a lot.

100
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:36,908
Is there a problem?

101
00:07:36,908 --> 00:07:39,400
Oh, not at all.

102
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,392
I think the guy in the next room is a little unstable.

103
00:07:43,392 --> 00:07:44,746
- Unstable, yes.
- Yeah, unstable.

104
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,100
I just met him today, and…

105
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,200
I agree.

106
00:07:49,238 --> 00:07:52,477
Let's both try to survive that whacko, okay?

107
00:07:52,477 --> 00:07:55,708
For now, get some rest. I'll call you when food's ready.

108
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:59,400
- Thank you very much.
- No problem. Relax.

109
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,100
Okay. Relax.

110
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,100
Excuse me.

111
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,000
Excuse me.

112
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,100
Excuse me!

113
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,700
And we've got a snorer, too.

114
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,700
I'm sorry.

115
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,600
Try putting these in your nose. They will help.

116
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,400
Hey, did you eat all of…

117
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,100
Bro, you're a hell of a cook.

118
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,000
Please keep up the good work.

119
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,994
And this must be the new roomer.

120
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,500
Looks like you got more work to do.

121
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,100
I'll set everything up quickly. Please be patient.

122
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,500
- Do it quickly.
- Yes. Have a seat.

123
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,500
That bastard.

124
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,100
I'm going to the restroom first.

125
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,000
What the… Was this yours, sir?

126
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,600
- Yeah.
- I didn't know. I'm sorry.

127
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,400
- Hey, you damn pig!
- Be quiet, for crying out loud!

128
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,800
I just said they're being noisy, so what's the big deal?

129
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:56,387
But you're asking for too much. Be reasonable.

130
00:10:56,387 --> 00:10:58,400
Give us some breathing room! Really.

131
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,300
Hey, hey, hey…

132
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,100
- You!
- What the hell?

133
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,246
Don't you think you're too much?

134
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,253
Me? What did I do?

135
00:11:06,253 --> 00:11:10,069
And you, kid. Bring me my food back!

136
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:13,239
- Do something, man!
- What do you want me to do?

137
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,986
- Come on. Do something.
- You messed with the wrong guy.

138
00:11:15,986 --> 00:11:17,653
You brought this on yourselves.

139
00:11:17,653 --> 00:11:20,900
Give me everything you have, you bastards!

140
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,982
Come on. Come on!

141
00:11:28,982 --> 00:11:31,330
Stop running.

142
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Bro. Hey, I was nice to you.

143
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,800
Is that a rabbit?

144
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,800
A rabbit?

145
00:12:32,205 --> 00:12:34,058
This person is…

146
00:12:34,058 --> 00:12:36,300
Are you okay?

147
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,800
the roomer that

148
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,300
Mom talked about.

149
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,400
Yes…

150
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:01,153
♫ Don't run away ♫

151
00:13:01,153 --> 00:13:05,580
♫ Look into my eyes, look at me ♫

152
00:13:05,581 --> 00:13:08,233
♫ Don't avoid me ♫

153
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,467
♫ You try. You try. ♫

154
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:15,213
♫ Never give it up, give it up, give it up ♫

155
00:13:15,213 --> 00:13:19,407
♫ You can break it up, break it up, break it up ♫

156
00:13:20,028 --> 00:13:23,727
Why, of all houses, did you break into this house?

157
00:13:23,727 --> 00:13:27,014
It was so quiet that I thought nobody was here.

158
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,400
I'm so sorry.

159
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,400
I'll repent and never commit crimes again.

160
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,500
I'm so sorry.

161
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,400
Let's go.

162
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,200
Thank you for everything.

163
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,900
Of course.

164
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,957
