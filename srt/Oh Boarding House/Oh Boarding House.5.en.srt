1
00:00:07,851 --> 00:00:11,811
Cheol Su. It's cold out here.

2
00:00:13,579 --> 00:00:15,719
Are you okay?

3
00:00:19,448 --> 00:00:25,057
Oh! Boarding House
Episode 5. Oh! Can't Touch Me.

4
00:00:25,057 --> 00:00:27,513
I can't get a taxi.

5
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,140
Police

6
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,369
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:57,980
Sorry to bother you.

8
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,427
- Good night.
- Night.

9
00:02:09,786 --> 00:02:12,195
I apologize.

10
00:02:12,195 --> 00:02:16,382
I didn't know you were Cheol Su's younger sister.

11
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:20,486
It's understandable that the story is obviously

12
00:02:20,486 --> 00:02:24,209
related to the prior situation.

13
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:28,402
Still, you could have listened to me before reporting me as a stalker to the police.

14
00:02:28,402 --> 00:02:31,189
That's why I apologized.

15
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:32,529
Huh?

16
00:02:32,529 --> 00:02:34,681
Are you annoyed with me?

17
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:38,391
And you're speaking casually on top of that.

18
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:41,511
No, I didn't raise my voice.

19
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:42,565
I'm sorry, Hui Su.

20
00:02:42,565 --> 00:02:46,380
I'm just trying to be comfortable as you suggested.

21
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,397
This was my first time coming to the police station,

22
00:02:52,397 --> 00:02:55,409
so it was a good experience as a writer.

23
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:57,710
I forgive you.

24
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,852
But in return, I have a favor to ask you.

25
00:03:02,852 --> 00:03:05,162
What is it?

26
00:03:05,162 --> 00:03:08,801
Critique my novel and give me some advice.

27
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:11,777
And be nice about it.

28
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:16,767
Okay, okay.

29
00:03:17,869 --> 00:03:21,483
Aren't there plenty others who can critique your novel, though?

30
00:03:21,483 --> 00:03:25,572
I had an epiphany when I saw your presentation.

31
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:29,526
That a writer needs fortitude and charisma.

32
00:03:29,526 --> 00:03:33,190
I'll read through it once and give you feedback.

33
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,504
At least ten times…

34
00:03:37,068 --> 00:03:38,921
Or five?

35
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,147
How about four?

36
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,385
Four times.

37
00:03:45,385 --> 00:03:46,945
Hooray.

38
00:03:46,945 --> 00:03:49,681
Can we use up one of the opportunities right now?

39
00:03:49,681 --> 00:03:53,806
Why don't we talk about it over drinks?

40
00:03:55,846 --> 00:03:58,036
Come with me.

41
00:03:58,036 --> 00:03:59,274
Awesome.

42
00:03:59,274 --> 00:04:00,434
Soju?

43
00:04:00,434 --> 00:04:02,877
I make the best somaek*.
(*Somaek: a mixture of soju and beer)

44
00:04:02,877 --> 00:04:05,250
I'm sure you'll like it.

45
00:04:44,282 --> 00:04:48,772
Come to think of it, is Seol Won dating anyone?

46
00:04:49,752 --> 00:04:54,130
What's going on between us?

47
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:08,409
Could it be that he's into me?

48
00:05:14,205 --> 00:05:17,225
What am I thinking? I must be crazy.

49
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,795
What the f*ck!

50
00:05:22,795 --> 00:05:25,115
That's what I want to say. You have a problem.

51
00:05:25,115 --> 00:05:26,314
How long have you been there?

52
00:05:26,314 --> 00:05:28,542
That's not the important thing.

53
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:31,003
Go out and see.

54
00:05:56,471 --> 00:06:00,900
The reason why I picked this place, paying 50,000 won extra,

55
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,500
was because it was clean and well-managed.

56
00:06:03,503 --> 00:06:06,029
This is not what I'm paying for.

57
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:09,796
This never happened with the old landlady around.

58
00:06:09,796 --> 00:06:12,345
You call this a boarding house?

59
00:06:12,345 --> 00:06:13,778
This is more like a pigpen.

60
00:06:13,778 --> 00:06:16,366
Right. This is your responsibility.

61
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:19,350
If this continues, we will hold an emergency committee meeting

62
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,293
and vote you out of the house.

63
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:25,647
You know the emergency committee meeting is a freaking dangerous thing.

64
00:06:26,702 --> 00:06:27,888
He's right.

65
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,123
What's the emergency committee?

66
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,829
Just play along.

67
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:34,373
He's right.

68
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:36,862
Do your duties.

69
00:06:36,862 --> 00:06:38,771
Come on.

70
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:06,814
Oh, a call.

71
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,572
Hello?

72
00:07:09,572 --> 00:07:11,064
I think I'm getting better.

73
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:14,400
The cake turned out amazing this time.

74
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:51,512
Routine is most important.

75
00:08:18,892 --> 00:08:22,178
It doesn't make sense that he hit the ball with just a finger.

76
00:08:26,218 --> 00:08:29,272
What is it? What?

77
00:08:29,272 --> 00:08:30,248
CONTRACT

78
00:08:30,248 --> 00:08:34,610
3. Kim Cheoul Su is allowed to administer physical punishment on Nam Jae Wu.

79
00:08:38,386 --> 00:08:40,706
My mom signed this?

80
00:08:40,706 --> 00:08:42,996
But why?

81
00:08:42,996 --> 00:08:44,300
From now on,

82
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,150
From now on, you will strictly abide by the study plan that I drew up.

83
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:52,398
A healthy mind requires a healthy body.

84
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:55,267
We'll begin with some basic physical training. Huh?

85
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:57,469
- Come.
- No, no!

86
00:08:57,469 --> 00:09:00,863
- Don't do this!
- Move it!

87
00:09:00,863 --> 00:09:02,820
Who did this?

88
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,390
- My cake!
- I'll kill whoever this!

89
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,290
I could die.

90
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,800
There's so much to do. When will I ever finish?

91
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,602
Cheol Su, I can do the cooking.

92
00:11:29,602 --> 00:11:33,292
I'll do it. I feel like cooking today.

93
00:11:33,935 --> 00:11:36,421
Take a seat. It's almost ready.

94
00:11:45,795 --> 00:11:47,855
It smells good.

95
00:11:49,592 --> 00:11:51,264
Do you like soybean soup?

96
00:11:51,264 --> 00:11:53,285
It's my favorite.

97
00:11:53,285 --> 00:11:55,502
Try it.

98
00:11:55,502 --> 00:11:57,216
Okay.

99
00:12:02,234 --> 00:12:05,321
It looks like the power's out.

100
00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:08,738
Yeah.

101
00:12:09,531 --> 00:12:14,230
Let me go get some candles.

102
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,573
I know where to find some.

103
00:12:18,397 --> 00:12:20,424
I'm sorry.

104
00:12:20,424 --> 00:12:22,543
That was…

105
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,304
There, too.

106
00:12:27,304 --> 00:12:29,425
I'm so sorry.

107
00:12:29,425 --> 00:12:32,450
I'll go find some.

108
00:12:39,124 --> 00:12:41,124
W-what?

109
00:12:41,903 --> 00:12:45,110
You can't touch me there.

110
00:12:49,871 --> 00:12:51,824
I'm sorry.

111
00:13:18,695 --> 00:13:21,228
Have at it.

112
00:13:21,228 --> 00:13:22,900
Thanks.

113
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,312
This is better than my mom's.

114
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,590
You're kidding.

115
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,961
You did so much work today. Eat up.

116
00:13:38,961 --> 00:13:41,414
Thank you.

117
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:49,094
When somebody cooks just for me,

118
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:53,800
it makes me feel warm inside.

119
00:13:57,308 --> 00:13:59,871
- You know,
- You know,

120
00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:02,318
You can go first.

121
00:14:04,862 --> 00:14:07,219
Well…

122
00:14:07,219 --> 00:14:08,186
Why don't we--

123
00:14:08,186 --> 00:14:10,139
You two.

124
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,783
What are you doing with the lights off?

125
00:14:17,104 --> 00:14:19,397
Hey, Bong Deok.

126
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:31,583
Also, you reset the fuse box when power goes out.

127
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:51,695
What the heck do you want?

128
00:14:51,695 --> 00:14:55,902
Hey. I made it like you told me.

129
00:14:55,902 --> 00:14:57,085
It was terrible.

130
00:14:57,085 --> 00:14:59,508
Nonsense.

131
00:15:00,214 --> 00:15:02,701
It's all you, not the recipe.

132
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:05,780
I should have trusted the internet, not you.

133
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,569
You're such an asshole.

134
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:11,605
I'll never help you with anything from now on.

135
00:15:11,605 --> 00:15:13,357
I'm hanging up.

136
00:15:20,703 --> 00:15:22,729
Yeah.

137
00:15:28,084 --> 00:15:30,090
Seol Weon.

138
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:32,899
Let's…

139
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:34,588
What?

140
00:15:34,588 --> 00:15:38,180
Let's go to the movies together tomorrow.

141
00:15:40,015 --> 00:15:42,115
A movie…

142
00:15:43,348 --> 00:15:45,215
Sure.

143
00:15:45,215 --> 00:15:48,907
I'd love to go to the movies with you.

144
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,900
♬ Don't you avoid me ♬

145
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,230
Great.
♬ You try ♬

146
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,480
♬ You try ♬

147
00:15:57,486 --> 00:16:01,371
♬ Never give it up,
give it up, give it up ♬

148
00:16:01,371 --> 00:16:06,198
♬ You can break it up,
break it up, break it up ♬

149
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:09,384
♬ Get yourself together ♬

150
00:16:11,186 --> 00:16:13,079
♬ Be in the moment ♬

151
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:15,797
♬ Break it up, break it up, break it up ♬

152
00:16:15,797 --> 00:16:19,703
♬ You can shake it up,
shake it up, shake it up ♬

153
00:16:19,703 --> 00:16:22,477
I'll let you get to sleep.

154
00:16:22,477 --> 00:16:24,350
Sleep tight.

155
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:28,015
You, too, Seol Won.

156
00:16:28,015 --> 00:16:28,820
Thanks.

157
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,480
Yes, yes!

158
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,420
♬ Never give it up,
give it up, give it up ♬

159
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:03,770
♬ You can break it up,
break it up, break it up! ♬
