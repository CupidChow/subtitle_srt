1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,173
Breaking news.

2
00:00:02,173 --> 00:00:07,240
The burglar in his 30's who has been breaking into vacant homes in Namsa-dong has finally been apprehended.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,473
Surprisingly he was caught ... 
Hello.

4
00:00:09,473 --> 00:00:12,879
My name is Kim Cheol Su and I'll be living with you.

5
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,215
I'm glad to be joining you.

6
00:00:16,215 --> 00:00:17,519
Kim Cheol Su, age 28
PE Teacher at Namsa High

7
00:00:17,593 --> 00:00:18,760
Jae Wu's homeroom teacher
Muscular and fit

8
00:00:18,813 --> 00:00:21,330
A possible anti-dater
Jae Wu's worst nightmare

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,800
Crap! Crap! Crap! Give me a break!

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,320
How can my homeroom teacher be living in the same house?

11
00:00:43,818 --> 00:00:49,160
Oh! Boarding House
Episode 2. Thank you for saving my life!

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,800
Yesterday

13
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,204
Looking at you, Jae Wu,

14
00:00:54,204 --> 00:00:57,484
I think you've caught something.

15
00:00:57,484 --> 00:01:00,124
Usually I'm in great shape,

16
00:01:00,124 --> 00:01:04,123
but it looks like I caught the flu that's been going around.

17
00:01:04,123 --> 00:01:07,860
I have the chills and I'm sweating a bit.

18
00:01:12,143 --> 00:01:16,050
I'm actually not feeling too sick,

19
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:19,520
but I'm worried my classmates may catch it.

20
00:01:21,904 --> 00:01:24,644
That's considerate of you.

21
00:01:24,644 --> 00:01:28,350
You should go see a doctor. Okay?

22
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,177
Yes! It worked!

23
00:01:30,177 --> 00:01:32,049
The BB cream magic!

24
00:01:50,237 --> 00:01:52,345
Let's do this!

25
00:01:53,595 --> 00:01:56,810
Today, we conquer the Bronze Rank*.
(League of Legends reference)

26
00:01:58,581 --> 00:02:02,210
- To the Summoner's Rift!
- Let's go!

27
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,580
Today

28
00:02:08,221 --> 00:02:10,034
I didn't know you lived here, Jae Wu.

29
00:02:10,034 --> 00:02:14,033
You said you were feeling sick yesterday, but today you're fine.

30
00:02:14,954 --> 00:02:17,588
Well, it's…

31
00:02:17,588 --> 00:02:20,054
I think yesterday…

32
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:24,400
I just had an upset stomach.

33
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,234
Upset stomach.

34
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:29,321
But you said it was the flu.

35
00:02:29,321 --> 00:02:31,180
What the fudge do I do?

36
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,020
I can't tell him I went to the PC Bang.
Or should I be honest?

37
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,778
Let's just come clean.

38
00:02:36,778 --> 00:02:38,824
I'm sorry I lied.

39
00:02:41,117 --> 00:02:42,851
Anywho!

40
00:02:42,851 --> 00:02:45,590
I'm glad to be your neighbor.

41
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:50,016
Sure…

42
00:03:01,487 --> 00:03:03,116
Fudge no!

43
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:06,753
I cannot live with him around!

44
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,333
The 374th Emergency Committee Meeting of Boarding House 5

45
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:14,688
I didn't know this room existed.

46
00:03:14,688 --> 00:03:18,109
And what are we doing here exactly without the lights on?

47
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:24,088
I believe the new tenant is not a good fit for this boarding house.

48
00:03:24,088 --> 00:03:25,908
That's a bit out of the blue.

49
00:03:25,908 --> 00:03:29,115
What do you mean he's not a good fit?

50
00:03:29,115 --> 00:03:31,878
Let's hear the reason why.

51
00:03:32,865 --> 00:03:35,118
There's no particular reason but

52
00:03:35,118 --> 00:03:37,750
** I can't tell them that I just wanted to play hooky.

53
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,078
Nam Jae Wu

54
00:03:39,078 --> 00:03:43,538
If you can't convince them now, you are dead meat.

55
00:03:44,618 --> 00:03:49,358
My knowledge in face reading tells me he doesn't belong with us.

56
00:03:49,358 --> 00:03:51,085
What the hell are you talking about?

57
00:03:51,085 --> 00:03:53,218
I think it makes sense.

58
00:03:53,218 --> 00:03:56,111
He's obviously the athletic type.

59
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,605
We, on the other hand, prefer to exercise our brains while sitting.

60
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:01,965
His physiognomy definitely is incompatible.

61
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,286
Seriously?

62
00:04:06,286 --> 00:04:10,173
It seems the decision has been made.

63
00:04:10,173 --> 00:04:13,120
Kim Cheol Su shall not join the boarding house.

64
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,453
You'd reject him just because of that?

65
00:04:16,453 --> 00:04:19,658
I'd like to hear from the landlord.

66
00:04:19,658 --> 00:04:21,540
Like Mom said, he's handsome.

67
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,433
But more importantly, he saved my life.

68
00:04:24,433 --> 00:04:27,513
- I think—
- I

69
00:04:27,513 --> 00:04:29,569
like Mr. Kim Cheol Su.

70
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,557
What? Why?

71
00:04:31,557 --> 00:04:34,790
You agreed before he doesn't belong here.

72
00:04:40,828 --> 00:04:43,028
I think he has good manners.

73
00:04:43,028 --> 00:04:44,981
He's cultured.

74
00:04:44,981 --> 00:04:47,934
Do I really have to do this?

75
00:04:47,934 --> 00:04:48,868
This place is weird.

76
00:04:48,868 --> 00:04:53,501
I think he's exactly the kind of person that we need at this boarding house.

77
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:57,228
- And I agree.
- Two to one.

78
00:04:57,228 --> 00:05:00,250
Under democratic principles by majority vote Kim Cheol Su's tenancy

79
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,030
in Boarding House 5 is approved.

80
00:05:04,381 --> 00:05:05,955
My dear Jae Wu.

81
00:05:05,955 --> 00:05:08,322
Good luck.

82
00:05:09,868 --> 00:05:12,311
Yes. Come in!

83
00:05:19,004 --> 00:05:23,255
I wanted to thank you again for saving my life.

84
00:05:23,255 --> 00:05:25,030
My pleasure.

85
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,084
It was nothing much, really.

86
00:05:28,084 --> 00:05:32,737
But thanks to you I realized again how precious life is.

87
00:05:32,737 --> 00:05:36,400
Well… I'm very happy about that.

88
00:05:38,594 --> 00:05:43,201
I'm actually a bit busy unpacking…

89
00:05:43,201 --> 00:05:44,594
Oh, sorry I'm so clueless.

90
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,301
No, what I mean is,

91
00:05:47,301 --> 00:05:50,660
I'll need some rest after unpacking.

92
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,414
I didn't get it.

93
00:05:55,701 --> 00:06:00,807
Go ahead and take some rest. I'll call you when the food is ready.

94
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:02,387
Okay.

95
00:06:22,747 --> 00:06:27,773
I'm tired in more than one way after being involved in a weird experience.

96
00:06:34,705 --> 00:06:36,525
What?

97
00:06:39,396 --> 00:06:41,076
Help yourself.

98
00:06:51,026 --> 00:06:53,139
Cheol Su.

99
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:55,986
Is there anything you need?

100
00:06:55,986 --> 00:06:58,699
Nothing, really.

101
00:06:59,646 --> 00:07:03,692
Would you like some coffee?
I'll know how to make drip coffee.

102
00:07:03,692 --> 00:07:06,620
I don't drink coffee.

103
00:07:15,663 --> 00:07:18,444
So, you don't drink coffee.

104
00:07:21,256 --> 00:07:23,776
Green tea it'll be, then!

105
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:37,901
Cheol-su! I made some green tea for…

106
00:07:41,681 --> 00:07:44,114
Are you okay?

107
00:07:44,114 --> 00:07:45,498
Let me see. Let me wash it for you.

108
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:46,868
Please…

109
00:07:46,868 --> 00:07:49,735
Can you please stop?

110
00:07:51,408 --> 00:07:53,838
- But you saved my—
- Just stop!

111
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:56,620
This is too much!

112
00:07:58,575 --> 00:08:00,928
I'm overwhelmed.

113
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:14,047
What are you doing?

114
00:08:14,853 --> 00:08:17,986
You're free to share your opinion.

115
00:08:22,488 --> 00:08:26,280
I think your novel is…

116
00:08:29,485 --> 00:08:32,612
is a very well-written one.

117
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:35,481
What is wrong with all of you?

118
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:36,692
The purpose of this class

119
00:08:36,692 --> 00:08:41,587
is to share constructive criticism to develop into better writers.

120
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:46,479
Why are we even here if everyone's lips are glued shut, not even offering constructive criticism?

121
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:47,827
Professor.

122
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,795
Yeah? M-me?

123
00:08:50,795 --> 00:08:54,939
Isn't the intimidation of all the students an expression of frustration

124
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:57,269
with your rigid teaching method?

125
00:08:57,269 --> 00:09:01,138
Can anything creative come out in such a rigid atmosphere?

126
00:09:01,138 --> 00:09:02,700
- Huh?
- Huh?

127
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,880
O-of course.

128
00:09:23,612 --> 00:09:25,364
Hi!

129
00:09:28,857 --> 00:09:32,490
I was really impressed with your novel, Seonbae-nim. (Term of respect for superior)

130
00:09:55,392 --> 00:09:58,418
Wh-who are you?

131
00:10:01,765 --> 00:10:05,852
My name is Kim Hee Su, and I have a class with you.

132
00:10:05,852 --> 00:10:08,675
Oh, okay…

133
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:10,595
What's up?

134
00:10:10,595 --> 00:10:14,581
I was wondering if you could critique my novel.

135
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:18,400
I'm sorry. I have a class soon.

136
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,160
Class?

137
00:10:25,074 --> 00:10:28,230
I didn't know there were classes so late.

138
00:10:44,883 --> 00:10:49,129
I just wanted to thank him for saving my life and do something for him.

139
00:10:49,129 --> 00:10:53,496
I guess he's not friendly, but he could have been nicer.

140
00:10:53,496 --> 00:10:55,988
Perhaps there's a way.

141
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,558
Something to show my appreciation that's not too much.

142
00:11:01,268 --> 00:11:02,695
How about sweets?

143
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:05,530
Everyone likes sweets.

144
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,875
Oh! Cake!

145
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,635
A cake will be perfect.

146
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:09,942
As a welcome gift.

147
00:11:09,942 --> 00:11:13,473
A cake won't make him feel uncomfortable.

148
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:15,009
The perfect welcome gift!

149
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:19,310
You could also write a thank you message on the cake!

150
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,020
Why didn't I think of that?

151
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,500
I'm so glad I have a friend like you.

152
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:31,018
I'll put my baking skills to good use and make the perfect cake for you!

153
00:11:31,018 --> 00:11:32,625
- You'll really do that?
- Yes!

154
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,878
Thank you, Bong Deok.

155
00:11:35,771 --> 00:11:38,544
That's one less thing to worry about!

156
00:11:38,544 --> 00:11:40,077
Let's eat.

157
00:11:40,077 --> 00:11:41,618
Sure.

158
00:12:11,971 --> 00:12:13,432
Bong Deok!

159
00:12:15,131 --> 00:12:16,571
Seonbae.

160
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:19,037
Here's the cake.

161
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:24,209
Thank you for saving my life

162
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:26,011
Did you really make this yourself?

163
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:28,111
You really learned well!

164
00:12:28,111 --> 00:12:31,350
I'm glad you like it.

165
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:33,351
Oh, right.

166
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:37,197
Why don't you move in here? Your room's too old.

167
00:12:37,197 --> 00:12:39,535
We have an empty room.

168
00:12:39,535 --> 00:12:41,060
Really? Then I guess--

169
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,595
Good timing. Perfect.

170
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,346
Cheol Su!

171
00:12:53,387 --> 00:12:56,242
♬ When I'm walking with you ♬

172
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:59,027
♬ I feel like I'm in a dream ♬

173
00:12:59,027 --> 00:13:02,858
♬ like snow in the spring ♬

174
00:13:02,858 --> 00:13:04,584
Are you okay?

175
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:09,357
♬ When will I finally tell you ♬

176
00:13:09,357 --> 00:13:14,050
♬ that I like you ♬

177
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,777
♬ Never give it up,
give it up, give it up ♬

178
00:13:17,777 --> 00:13:22,683
♬ You can break it up,
break it up, break it up ♬

179
00:13:22,683 --> 00:13:25,243
♬ Get yourself together ♬

180
00:13:27,757 --> 00:13:29,570
♬ Be in the moment ♬

181
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,243
♬ Break it up, break it up, break it up ♬

182
00:13:32,243 --> 00:13:36,344
♬ You can shake it up,
shake it up, shake it up ♬

183
00:13:37,277 --> 00:13:40,380
♬ Make some noise ♬

184
00:13:42,285 --> 00:13:44,418
♬ without a care in the world ♬

185
00:13:44,418 --> 00:13:48,030
♬ Such a big mess under one roof ♬

186
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,483
♬ Let's have a moment of laughter ♬

187
00:13:53,483 --> 00:13:54,924
♬ Let's have a day in peace ♬

188
00:13:54,997 --> 00:13:56,450
My cake…

189
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,177
You're always

190
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,890
- a lifesaver.
- I'm not!

191
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,080
Cheol Su.
