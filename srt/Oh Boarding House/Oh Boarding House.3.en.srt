1
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,837
My biceps have gotten smaller. I need to lift weights.

2
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:40,373
Do you want me to scrub your back?

3
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,313
What the f*ck?

4
00:00:45,096 --> 00:00:46,846
No.

5
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:50,006
Please just leave me alone!

6
00:01:04,494 --> 00:01:11,230
Oh! Boarding House
Episode 3. The Fifth Tenant

7
00:01:15,364 --> 00:01:17,457
Cheol Su-nim. Here.

8
00:01:17,457 --> 00:01:19,164
Use this.

9
00:01:20,593 --> 00:01:23,615
Well, you don't have to do this.

10
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:26,786
I do. No one can stop me now.

11
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:30,160
You've saved my life twice.

12
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:42,193
Are you okay?

13
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:48,002
Cheol Su-nim. Breakfast is ready.

14
00:01:48,002 --> 00:01:50,013
Let's go.

15
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,697
Sure.

16
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,920
I hope you like it.

17
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,259
Help yourself.

18
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,190
Thanks.

19
00:02:14,788 --> 00:02:18,560
I didn't make any for you.

20
00:02:21,793 --> 00:02:24,612
Oh, come on. What the heck.

21
00:02:26,804 --> 00:02:30,616
You can have mine, then. Here.

22
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:32,800
We have a school audit inspection today.

23
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,762
So, I think I'll have to go now.

24
00:02:36,528 --> 00:02:38,758
Come straight to school after eating.

25
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:40,173
Don't be late.

26
00:02:40,178 --> 00:02:41,900
Okay.

27
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,307
I just want to get to know him.

28
00:02:57,307 --> 00:02:59,830
Why is he so awkward around me?

29
00:03:02,637 --> 00:03:04,559
All right.

30
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,689
Then I'll go play just one morning game.

31
00:03:08,871 --> 00:03:10,394
You little punk!

32
00:03:10,394 --> 00:03:12,708
Cheol Su said not to be late.

33
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:15,714
If I was scare of him I wouldn't have gotten this far.

34
00:03:16,626 --> 00:03:18,810
What the…

35
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:36,592
Mr. Kim, I think I have a stomachache.

36
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:48,620
Seol Won: He needs a good scolding to get his act together.

37
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:54,518
Seol Won, you f*cker.

38
00:03:59,815 --> 00:04:03,139
Scrub the toilet

39
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:06,934
as you repent for your lies.

40
00:04:36,607 --> 00:04:39,891
Even my perfect acting isn't working.

41
00:04:39,891 --> 00:04:43,098
It's worse than anything I ever imagined.

42
00:04:43,907 --> 00:04:49,131
No matter how I'm going to kick that freaking homeroom teacher

43
00:04:49,131 --> 00:04:51,900
out of the boarding house.

44
00:05:01,591 --> 00:05:03,818
Oh, seriously.

45
00:05:05,946 --> 00:05:07,540
Seriously.

46
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:21,350
2021 Namsa High School Scholarship Report

47
00:05:25,183 --> 00:05:26,229
We're in trouble.

48
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:30,129
There must be some error. The scholarship report file wouldn't open all morning.

49
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:34,031
The school inspector is arriving soon, right?

50
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:35,426
I have a backup file at home.

51
00:05:35,426 --> 00:05:37,614
I'll ask someone to bring it.

52
00:05:37,614 --> 00:05:38,499
Knock, knock.

53
00:05:38,499 --> 00:05:40,901
Is anybody at the boarding house?

54
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:44,810
I forgot an important USB drive in my room.

55
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,052
I have classes, so I'm at school.

56
00:05:47,052 --> 00:05:51,393
Also, have some decency and take care of your own problems.

57
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:52,761
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:52,761 --> 00:05:55,561
I have an urgent situation here.

59
00:05:55,561 --> 00:05:57,544
Don't worry, Cheol-su.

60
00:05:57,544 --> 00:06:02,300
I can bring you the USB. It won't take long.

61
00:06:05,216 --> 00:06:08,078
It just had to be Seol Won…

62
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:12,637
All right!

63
00:06:12,637 --> 00:06:15,600
I finally get to do something for him!

64
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:25,391
That's disgusting.

65
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:47,407
What do we do? The inspector will be here soon.

66
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,160
I'll give him another call.

67
00:07:23,932 --> 00:07:27,198
Here's the USB.

68
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:28,588
This is it, right?

69
00:07:28,588 --> 00:07:31,617
I hope I arrived in time.

70
00:07:33,007 --> 00:07:35,796
Thank you. I'll see you at home.

71
00:07:50,547 --> 00:07:52,275
What?

72
00:07:52,275 --> 00:07:54,430
Is that all?

73
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,035
- What are you up to?
- Hey.

74
00:08:01,035 --> 00:08:02,476
Let's go out.

75
00:08:02,476 --> 00:08:05,360
I'm craving spicy food.

76
00:08:30,386 --> 00:08:33,346
Thank you for everything today.

77
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,147
Thank you for your hard work.

78
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:37,507
- Thank you.
- Thank you for everything.

79
00:08:37,507 --> 00:08:38,967
- Good work.
- Good work.

80
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:40,890
Thanks.

81
00:09:09,414 --> 00:09:13,314
Did he run all the way here?

82
00:09:16,099 --> 00:09:19,715
I could tell he's a nice guy,

83
00:09:19,715 --> 00:09:23,734
but it's like he has no limits.

84
00:09:39,797 --> 00:09:42,820
Anybody want these movie tickets?

85
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,923
What an asshole.

86
00:09:55,923 --> 00:09:58,921
You took the time to help him. I can't believe that's all he said.

87
00:09:58,921 --> 00:10:01,960
He's worse than I thought.

88
00:10:08,814 --> 00:10:11,225
Hello?

89
00:10:11,225 --> 00:10:13,480
Oh, Cheol Su-nim?

90
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,641
Yeah.

91
00:10:14,641 --> 00:10:16,814
A movie? I'd love to.

92
00:10:16,814 --> 00:10:18,303
Totally.

93
00:10:18,303 --> 00:10:20,516
Where should we… Okay.

94
00:10:20,516 --> 00:10:22,588
I'll see you there in a bit.

95
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:24,403
Bye.

96
00:10:24,403 --> 00:10:25,794
What's going on?

97
00:10:25,794 --> 00:10:28,570
Cheol Su-nim is treating me to a movie.

98
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,127
You can have the rest, Bong Deok.

99
00:10:30,127 --> 00:10:32,162
I've got to go.

100
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,307
He keeps on bugging me.

101
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,790
♬ Don't run away ♬

102
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:15,220
♬ Look me in the eye ♬

103
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,630
♬ Look me in the eye ♬

104
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,640
♬ You try ♬

105
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,050
♬ You try ♬

106
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,940
♬ Never give it up, give it up, give it up ♬

107
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,996
Why am I feeling nervous?

108
00:11:26,996 --> 00:11:29,850
The showing of "Behind Cut"
will soon begin.

109
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,700
♬ Get yourself together ♬

110
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,190
Cheol Su-nim?

111
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,320
♬ Break it up, break it up, break it up! ♬

112
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,420
I'm sorry to do this, but I don't think I can make it.

113
00:12:06,695 --> 00:12:07,814
This is stupid.

114
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:10,321
Such a bummer.

115
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,410
Seol Won.

116
00:12:23,582 --> 00:12:27,010
Did you see the movie?

117
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,110
No.

118
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,840
No. I didn't make it, either.

119
00:12:35,824 --> 00:12:38,413
Did you wait for me?

120
00:12:38,413 --> 00:12:39,926
I'm sorry. There was an ac--

121
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,342
Yes. I did.

122
00:12:42,342 --> 00:12:44,830
For quite a while.

123
00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:54,105
I'm so sorry about this.

124
00:12:54,105 --> 00:12:56,160
Next time,

125
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,683
I'll treat you to a movie and a nice dinner, too.

126
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:07,581
Sure.

127
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,604
Seonbae.

128
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:33,005
Cha Bon Deok, Age 25
Fifth tenant at Boarding House 5

129
00:13:33,006 --> 00:13:34,282
Seol Won's closest friend
Full of warm feelings

130

Baking Student
Can't handle spicy food

131
00:13:37,403 --> 00:13:40,719
You have an empty room, right?

132
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:44,488
I decided to move in starting today.

133
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:48,296
♬ Don't run away ♬

134
00:13:48,296 --> 00:13:50,353

♬ Break it up, break it up, break it up! ♬

142
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:21,619
You should have told me if you were coming.

143
00:14:21,619 --> 00:14:24,360
You were the one that suggested I move in.

144
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,697
Dear tenant,

145
00:14:25,697 --> 00:14:29,079
you certainly can move in, but I need the deposit and the contract

146
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:32,760
before you move in.

147
00:14:34,637 --> 00:14:36,419
Come on. Cut me some slack.

148
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:42,820
Dear tenant, there are reasons for these procedures.

149
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,495
Did you bring your stamp?

150
00:14:44,495 --> 00:14:48,313
It's at home.

151
00:14:48,313 --> 00:14:52,020
Seriously…
