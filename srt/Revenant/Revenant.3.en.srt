What is this?

43
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:01,389
I looked through some recent suicide cases
like you asked,

44
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:02,932
and I found something strange.

45
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,017
[Munchun] What?

46
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,061
A week ago,

47
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,480
Hong Miyoung,
a senior at Segang University,

48
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,233
hanged herself in the studio apartment
she was staying in.

HONG MIYOUNG
SUICIDE BY HANGING

50
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,612
And two days later,

51
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,823
Chae Minju, a Segang University senior
living in the same studio apt. district,

52
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,159
was found to have committed suicide
in the same way.

53
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,369
And also…

a senior at Segang University,
hanged himself the very next day.

57
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,129
[Hongsae] Isn't it a little strange?

58
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,714
Within a week,

59
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,800
three students from the same school
who lived in the same studio apt. district

60
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,761
committed suicide in the same way.

61
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,056
What about the preliminary investigation?

62
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,351
Preliminary results showed
no suspicions of murder, but…

63
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,560
But?

64
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,937
-[Hongsae] Well…
-[Munchun] Yes?

65
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,730
…a strange post appeared

66
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,649
on the Segang University
Bamboo Forest page.

67
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,359
The same noise was heard

68
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,277
on the day each victim died.

69
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,488
What was it?

70
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,614
The sound of high heels.

71
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:00,907
[Munchun] High heels?

72
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,325
Like the sound of stilettos?

73
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:03,993
Yes.

74
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:05,828
After that,

75
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,249
people heard the sound
of very aggressive knocking.

76
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,334
[♪ suspenseful music]

77
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,629
Where is the location?

78
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,839

Yes, that's right.

85
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,949
The hills and pine forests are all gone.

86
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,953
This is a common occurrence
when you study folklore.

87
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,914
The village that stood here
for many years disappears,

88
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,333
and a mirage-like city
takes its place overnight.

89
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,962
How do we find the location then?

90
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,298
People are more important than places.

91
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,508
Young people move around a lot,

92
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,802
but it is highly likely

93
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,555
that the elderly who have roots here
have not left the area.

94
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,392
If we look around, there will be people
who used to live in Jangjin-ri.

95
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,271
But we aren't local government workers.

96
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,605
How do we find those people?

97
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,775
In folklore studies,
there's something called a local survey.

98
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,403
[Haesang] We're bound to find something
using that method.

99

from senior centers.

-Even if they don't know themselves,

111
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:49,307
we can hear rumors about
whoever has lived here the longest.

If anyone knows about Jangjin-ri,

113

These cases aren't mysterious at all.

145
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,651
They're all suicide cases.

146
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,362
-I mean… are we sure they're suicides?
-[chimes]

147
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,364
We checked the CCTV footage,

148
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,533
and no one came in or out
at the time of the incidents.

149
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,327
Crime scene examination results
showed no signs of forced entry either.

150
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,998
What about the sound of high heels
and the knocking?

151
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,624
We looked into the details of the post

152
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,002
on the Segang University
Bamboo Forest page,

153
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,212
but those sounds were heard on other days,

154
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,256
not on the days
the deceased committed suicide.

155
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,342
As a result, it spread
like an urban legend among the students.

156
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:51,220
And anyway, the sound of high heels
and knocking is common

157
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,556
in studio apartment districts
since they aren't soundproof.

158
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,767
Wait, hold on.

159
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,606
So there…
[smacks lips, inhales deeply]

160
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,942
[exhales sharply]
…weren't any bruises on their wrists?

161
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,903
No, there were
no signs of a struggle anywhere,

162
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,154
including on the wrists.

163
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:11,449
All the deceased
were Segang University students.

164
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,327
Is there no connection between the cases?

165
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,121
They were in the same year
but had different majors.

166
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,290
They were struggling to make ends meet

167
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,167
and were very stressed about getting jobs.

168
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,252

Hey, take a look at this.

178
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:45,441
All the deceased students
were raising the same type of fish.

00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,903
Everyone says
they were struggling to make ends meet,

180
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:53,824
but isn't it strange that they bought
this unique and expensive-looking fish?

181
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,453
Yes, well,

182
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,622
let's forget about the fish.

183
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,501
I just met
with some of the deceased's friends.

184
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:08,005
This is a student Hong Miyoung recently
became friends with while working.

185
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,551
These are the students
in Nam Seokhoon's study group.

186
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,804
-[Hongsae] She's also in the group.
-[Munchun] Hold on,

187
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,389
it's the same student?

188
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,308
-Yes, of course. See?
-Oh, I see.

189
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,935
[Hongsae] Lastly, this was taken

190
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,812
at the most recent academy
Chae Minju attended.

191
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,772
The same female student is here as well.

192
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,652
Not only did she recently befriend
all the deceased,

193
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,071
but she's also a senior
at Segang University.

194
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,322
Her name is Lee Taeyoung.

195
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,324
-However…
-However?

196
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,619
She suddenly disappeared
after the deceased committed suicide.

197
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,705
She stopped showing up to work
without notice,

198
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,790
no one from the study group
could get a hold of her,

199
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,458
and she stopped attending the academy.

200
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,294
Isn't that strange?

201
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,130
[♪ suspenseful music]

202
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,844
[♪ music fades]

203
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:57,972
GWANGCHEON-SI
JANGJIN 1-DONG

204
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,807
[elder] Why, thank you.
[chuckles]

205
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,935
-He comes here often so I asked him.
-[bowl thuds]

206
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,812
Apparently, he knows
a lot about Jangjin-ri.

207
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,940
I mean, I didn't live there myself.

208
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,109
My younger brother lived there,

209
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,361
so I used to visit the place often.

210
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,571
Then do you…

211
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,117
-[elder] Yes?
-…recognize this?

212
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,870
Yes, this is right.

213
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,415
[elder] The Sacred Tree was here.

214
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,917
Jaegogae was here,
and the pine forest was here.

215
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,921
Yes, this region used to be Jangjin-ri.

216
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,798
Then, what is this place?

217
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,675
[Haesang] Do you recognize this area?

218
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,427
The Dukdali Tree used to be there.

219
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,848
Are you referring to the custom
of hanging duk on a tree?

220
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,642
[Sanyeong] What is that?

221
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,980
Duk means the "corpse of a young child."

222
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,524
[Haesang] In the past, the method

223
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,693
of burying a child was different
from that of an adult.

224
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,196
[♪ pensive music]

225
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,198
They weren't recognized
as a member of the family,

226
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,076
so they couldn't be buried
at the family burial site

227
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,204
and were rarely formally buried
in coffins.

228
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,331
Instead of a coffin, they were put in jars

229
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,084
and buried in remote areas
without a tombstone

230
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,253
-or hung from a tree.
-[insects chirping]

231
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,421
The tree from which

232
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,549
a young child's corpse, duk,
was hung was called a Dukdali Tree.

233
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,013
[elder] Exactly.

234
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,350
That's why it was called
the Dukdali Tree for generations,

235
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,810
but the younger people

236
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,813
called it the "Suicide Tree" too.

237
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,524
[sucks teeth]
And strangely enough,

238
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,944
a lot of people hanged themselves
from that tree.

239
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,405
Could that tree…

240
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,657
still be around?

241
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,617
[chuckles]
My gosh.

242
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,286
Do you really think
that tree would still be around?

243
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,664
Ten years ago, they cut everything down

244
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,541
to build a new city.

245
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:52,378
Was there anything
about a red hair accessory in the village?

246
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,046
A red hair accessory…

247
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,675
[sucks teeth]
I don't recall anything about that.

248
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,468
-Then…
-[elder] Yes?

249
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,181
Have you seen this person before?

250
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,685
Oh, isn't he a professor?

251
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,229
[elder] I remember him saying
he was a professor.

252
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,480
Do you know this person?

253
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,399
Yes, that's definitely him.

254
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,151
Of course I do.

255
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,612
[elder] He came by often
when my younger brother was alive.

256
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,698
Are you talking about the brother
who lived in Jangjin-ri?

257
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:21,824
[elder] That's right.

258
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,118
What did he talk about when he visited?

259
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,494
Why did he come here?

260
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,371
I don't know anything about that.

261
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,082
I only exchanged greetings
with him a few times.

262
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,794
He was very close
to my younger brother though.

263
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,839
And your younger brother's family?
Where are they now?

264
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,841
His eldest son

265
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,635
is working on a fishing boat.

266
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,304
The eldest son's daughter…

267
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,474
lives nearby.

268
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,851
She attends Segang University.

269
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,437
May I know her number?

270
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,731
It's really important.

Well, the girl…

273
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,238
was really young at the time,

274
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,908
so she probably won't know much.

00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,493

00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,328

That's right.

There are many ways to commit suicide.

318
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,129
[Haesang]
You can use sleeping pills, jump,

319

or slit your wrists.

320
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:09,301
But why does it seem like
they made a pact to hang themselves?

321
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,764
The suicide ghost of someone
who hanged themself caused their deaths.

322
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,933
Ordinary people don't feel that energy,

323
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,394
but it's hard for people who are depressed

324
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,270

an unfortunate situation

325
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,148

326
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,858
It wasn't a ghost.

327
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,361
All of them were ruled suicides.

328
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:28,445
And the location?

329
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,240
They died in the studio

00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,658
All in this vicinity, right?

331
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,412
I'm sorry,
but may I take a look at their case files?

Hey, my gosh.

333
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:41,250
I told you they were just suicides,

334
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,168
so just go home, Professor Yeom.

335
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:44,753
[Munchun] Gosh…

336
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,424

00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,806
One more person will commit suicide soon.

339
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,685
I don't believe in that kind of thing.

340
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,817
[Munchun] Why did you park your car here?

341
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,527
It's a residential parking zone.

00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,821

She hasn't been back for over a week.

Did you notice anything strange
before Ms. Lee Taeyoung disappeared?

347
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:28,380
For example,
you heard the sound of high heels

348
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,175
or loud knocking on a door.

349
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,259
How did you know?

350
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,221

00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,107
If you happen to see
Ms. Lee Taeyoung in the future,

355
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,026
please call me.

356
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,487
-[room manager] Okay.
-[Hongsae] Thank you.

357
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:57,618
What are you doing?

358
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,787
What? What do you mean?

359
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,371
Were you eavesdropping?

360
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,456
No, I wasn't.

361
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,709
[scoffs]
Why would I eavesdrop on your conver…

362
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,338
Are you going to keep addressing me
in such a casual manner?

363
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,131
Yeah.

364
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,307
Also, I really wasn't eavesdropping,

365
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,309
I was just…

366
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,776
But why are you…

367
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,820
looking for Ms. Lee Taeyoung?

368
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,488
Do you know Ms. Lee Taeyoung?

369
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,406
How do you know her?

370
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,367
Why did you come here?

371
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,077
Well…

372
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,288
[Hongsae sighs]
It's really strange, right?

373
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,708
Why does something bad happen
to everyone who knows you?

374
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,002
They either die…

375
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,754
or disappear.

376
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,176
Your grandmother
passed away recently, right?

377
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,764
Yet you don't look sad at all,
seeing as you're out and about like this.

378
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,432
You already seem suspicious,

379
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,977
so don't do anything
more suspicious and stay home.

[Haesang] How did it go?

384
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,292
Did you find out anything
about Ms. Lee Taeyoung?

385
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,169
Yes.

386
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,755
According to the manager,
she hasn't been back in a while.

387
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:39,386
The police were looking
for Ms. Lee Taeyoung too.

388
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,388
It seems that way.

389
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,602
With the police on the move,
she'll be found soon enough.

390
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,479
Then, naturally,
we'll be able to meet her.

391
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,069
[Haesang] I think
we should look into the tree before that.

392
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:59,031
Three people have already died
because of that tree.

393
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,199
What do you mean?

394
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,409
We must hurry and find that tree.

395
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,747
Remember how the Dukdali Tree
was also called the "Suicide Tree"?

396
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,584
Suicide ghosts usually reside in trees
that someone had hanged themself from.

397
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,877
Hold on,

398
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,379
have you forgotten why we came here?

399
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,298
We came to find Ms. Lee Taeyoung.

400
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,843
We need to find her
and figure out why my dad came here.

401
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,512
Ms. Sanyeong,

402
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,059
someone else will die soon
because of that tree.

00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,445
What about the people who will die
because of the evil spirit?

405
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,531
It'll only torment you more
if you refuse to save someone…

406
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,660
who you know is going to die.

407
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,250
It's more important to me
that I get rid of this evil spirit.

[Taeyoung's great-uncle] Oh, right.

You should say hello.
This is the person I was talking about.

459
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,708
it's about the Dukdali Tree
you mentioned yesterday.

-What about it?
-What type of tree was it?

A pine tree.

00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:38,550
But you're not actually
Taeyoung's friend, right?

528
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,135
What?

529
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:44,013
You wouldn't refer to your friend
as "Ms. Lee Taeyoung."

00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:02,031
I want to know
about the village called Jangjin-ri

00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,415
Yes, apparently.

Who told you that?

541
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,419
Taeyoung's great-uncle.

Yes, he lives nearby.

545
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:26,097
Could I have his contact information
or address by any chance?

546
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,935
Taeyoung left some stuff behind,
and I didn't know what to do with them.

That's enough. If I don't get the deposit

When have we ever investigated

We'll just have to persuade them
to cooperate.

in the Jangjin-ri area.

00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,444
It's the same over here.

701
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,946
She visited Hong Miyoung every Saturday.

702
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,744
Lee Taeyoung was friends
with the deceased,

703
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,621
so that explains why she visited them.

704
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,915
But visiting every week
on the same day, at the same time,

705
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,583
and in the same clothes?

706
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,168
Isn't that strange?

707
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,254
There's something more strange than that.

708
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,506
[smacks lips]
Now, look…

709
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,175
In that alley,

710
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:01,594
there's a single road
leading to Hong Miyoung's study hostel.

711
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,596
My point is that

712
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,723
if you come from that study hostel,

713
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:09,352
you have to pass
the front of this convenience store.

714
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:10,895
And?

715
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:13,064
I wanted to observe her route,

716
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:14,941
so I checked this store's CCTV footage
from that camera.

717
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:16,859
I checked all of it…

718

719
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,988

-What?

720
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,491
I checked all of the CCTV footage

721
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,618
following the time she shows up,

722
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:27,787
and it clearly shows her going in

723
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,206
but never shows her leaving.

724
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,458
It's as if she disappeared into thin air.

725
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,001
[sighs]

726
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,879
Are you sure you checked it thoroughly?

727
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:42,051
We can go in together
and check again if you want.

728
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:44,428
What are you trying to say then?

729
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,807
Are you saying she's a ghost or something?

730
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,269
Now you're bringing up ghosts too?

731
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,396
Have you been meeting with Professor Yeom?

732
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,064
Who is Professor Yeom?

733
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:57,024
These are the records from 2010.

734
00:37:57,108 --> 00:38:00,486
All the trees in the Jangjin-ri
pine forest were disposed of.

735
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,447
[Haesang]
Every single one of them was disposed of?

736
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:07,118
Yes. I was also involved in the project,
so I'm sure of it.

The tree is gone,

Yes, is this the only copy?

750
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,995
We took it to commemorate
my younger brother's house

751
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,413
before it was demolished,

752
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,499
so they must have a copy somewhere too.

753
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,794
So Ms. Lee Taeyoung may have
a copy of the photo as well.

No, not yet.

764
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,872
[Haesang] You have to find her quickly.
She's in danger.

765
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,375
Do you remember
what I said about the rope,

766
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,126
that one more person was going to die?

767
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,837
Ms. Lee Taeyoung had a photo
with a ghost residing in it.

768
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,089
If we don't find her soon,

she will die too.

Professor Yeom,
you really don't listen to me.

773
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,184
Didn't I tell you
to leave this case alone?

What the heck? He hung up.

00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,274
Who was it?

778
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,571
How could he hang up
after just saying his piece?

779
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,824
Plus, he never listens.

780
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,284

is it because he has a lot of money?

[Munchun sighs]

782
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,415
By the way,

783
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:20,584
didn't you say Ms. Lee Taeyoung's
great-uncle lives nearby?

784
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,586
-Yes.
-Try calling him again.

785
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:25,965
I told you I already called him.

786
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,385
Hey,

787
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,930
is calling someone
the same as meeting them in person?

788
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,808
Who do you take after?

789
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,978
Why do I have to teach you
how to do everything?

790

We only made it this far thanks to me.

791

I decided
on the direction of the investigation,

starting with the deceased's records
and the CCTV footage.

793

You haven't taught me anything.

Ma'am,

880
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,794
something bad happened

881
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,713
to Ms. Taeyoung's close friends,

882
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:59,381
so we want to find her

883
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:02,593
and ask her why these things happened.

884
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:04,762
I said I don't know.

885
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:06,680
Ms. Lee Taeyoung…

886
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:08,932
could be in danger too.

887
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,934

888

889
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:18,275
What do you mean by "those people"?

890
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:20,611
It's all because of them.

Taeyoung was really scared.

892
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:25,199

NAM SEOKHOON, CHAE MINJU

908
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:49,032
[Hongsae] She borrowed some money,

909
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:51,118
but the interest rapidly increased?

910
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,078
[Taeyoung's great-aunt] Mm.

911
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:55,122
So it's an illegal moneylending business.

912
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:58,542
[Munchun] People who don't understand
may ask, "Why use that kind of money?

913

914
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,505

917
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:10,304

918
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,222

919

921
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,811
Thank you so much.

922
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:21,148
I'm sorry,
I promise to pay you back next month.

923
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,274
It happens.

924
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:27,279
But there is another way to make it up.

925
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:30,115
[Munchun] At first, it'll only be
a few hundred thousand won.

926
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:33,785
They'll think, "I'll work part-time
and quickly pay it off."

927
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:35,829
But the next month

928
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,624
and the month after that,
another variable occurs.

929
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:42,336
In the meantime, the interest doubles.

930
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:45,672
By the time they come to their senses,
the interest itself is several times

931
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,257
more than the amount of money
they borrowed.

933

more money to pay it back,

00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,430
the few hundred thousand won

935
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:56,099
turns into an unmanageable amount.

01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:38,017
[♪ closing theme music]

1227
01:05:56,994 --> 01:06:00,081
[Haesang]
Who was the owner of this hair accessory?

1228
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:01,624
I'll find them.

1229
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:04,001
Then I'll be able to find out your name.

1230
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:05,336
[Sanyeong] Why am I here?

1231
01:06:05,419 --> 01:06:06,921
The numbers just popped up in my mind.

1232
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:09,924
[Sanyeong sobs, shouts]
I told you to take this!

1233
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:12,009
The evil spirit
could have leaked the numbers on purpose.

1234
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:14,887
I know, but it started the fight first.

1235
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,097
[Haesang] I can't back down now.

1236
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:18,140
Weren't there bruises like these
on the wrists?

1237
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:19,308
How did you know?

1238
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:22,269
[Sanyeong] Dad, the one who knew the most
about evil spirits.

1239
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:25,356
[Haesang] There will be someone
who remembers Professor Gu Gangmo.

1240
01:06:25,439 --> 01:06:27,191
[Sanyeong] What was that just now?

1241
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:29,318
[Haesang]
There are wandering ghosts in the village.

1242
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:31,070
[ghostly voices murmuring]

01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,960
