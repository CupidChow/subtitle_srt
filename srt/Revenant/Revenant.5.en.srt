Did you find the straw dolls?

21
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,248
There were no straw dolls.
Ms. Park lit them on fire.

to see her daughter again.

Jangseungs didn't just act
as guardian deities of a town.

35
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,749
They played another

186
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,568
So don't contact Sanyeong ever again.

187
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,281
Sanyeong. San...

188
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,491
That's enough. Mom.

189
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,953
What happened to you?
How did you end up like this?

190
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,747
I would like to be discharged.

191
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,125
What's with you?
Are you getting angry with me?

192
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,419
Do you know how worried I was
when I heard you were...

193
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,546
What else have you lied about?

194
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,218
You said Dad was dead
when he was alive and well.

195
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,677
And you kept your hometown a secret too?

196
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,223
-Stop it.
-What happened here?

197
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,141
Why did you tell me to leave this place?

198
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:30,935
[Gyeongmun] I said. stop it.

199
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,442
ESTIMATED DUE DATE

200
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,570
February 25th.

201
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,740
in the year I was five years old.

202
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,909
[Sanyeong] What did that day signify?

203
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,078
It said "estimated due date."

204
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:50,996
What was that day?

205
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,084
[Gyeongmun breathes heavily]

206
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,343
It was your younger sibling's due date.

207
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,179
The one that died here.

208
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,561

[Gyeongmun] We're expecting
our second child in just two months.

213
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,243
Do you think we'll have a boy or a girl?

214
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:32,162
I hope it's a girl just like Sanyeong.

215
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:33,998
But I think

216
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:38,210
it could be a boy
because its movements are different

217
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,130
from when I was carrying Sanyeong.

218
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,383

Come to me. It's okay.

227
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,454
Everything is okay.

-[Gyeongmun] Mom.

Gosh. what are you doing here?

234
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,014
-Did you come alone?
-Yes.

235
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,349

237
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,145

239
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,733
I feel comfortable with you around.

240
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,068
What about Sanyeong?

241
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:50,282
I wanted to bring her.
but my mother-in-law strongly opposed it.

242
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,285
I'll go and get her
once I recover after giving birth.

243
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:56,956
You said you didn't like the countryside
and got married to a man from Seoul.

244
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,500
Then you stopped visiting
after you had Sanyeong.

245
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,962
Why are you suddenly acting like this?

246
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,299
Did Gangmo agree to this?

247
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,428
What is it?

248
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,181
What is it?

What's wrong?

254
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,738
-I don't know. I'm just so scared. Mom.
-My child. it's okay.

00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,449
You probably heard wrong.

256
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,035
-Do you think so?
-Of course.

257
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:38,455
How could a father say that
about his child?

258
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,292
You said he adores Sanyeong.

259
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,753
That's true.

260
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,007
Get some rest today.

261
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:51,427

Aren't you going to think about Sanyeong?

Come on. just one bite.

00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,727
You were right.

it was him?

Yes.

290

I was so busy worrying about you
and calling 911.

00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,588
but by the time I came to my senses.
he was gone.

after you were brought to the hospital.

what happened to you.

00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,747
was possessed by the same evil spirit
that possesses me.

366
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,042
[Haesang] Why and how
did he become possessed by an evil spirit?

367
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,420
Just what happened to Professor Gu Gangmo?

368

SHARED PUBLIC SECURITY. SAFE GWANGCHEON

369
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:24,319
I don't know what he's been searching for
in the storage over the past few days.

370
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,154
What's in the storage?

371
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:30,117
All the garbage that has accumulated
since Gwangcheon Station's establishment.

372
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,994
A lot was thrown away
when we computerized the data.

373
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:36,039
but it just houses a random collection
of investigative records.

374
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,165
[officer] It's over there.

375
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,796

376
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:45,674
All right. thank you.

00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:07,904

Sir. what are you doing here?

383
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,013
[Munchun]
I'm just searching for something.

384
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,515
I'm making sure I haven't missed anything.

385
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,850
Missed anything?

386
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,311
I thought I had found

387
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,271
all the bruised suicide victim cases

388
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,024
that have happened.

389
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,067
but apparently. I hadn't.

390
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:50,071
I think I need to start from the beginning
with Jangjin-ri.

391

Sir.

395
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,749
This... My gosh.

396
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,960
I told you this is all a waste of time.

397
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:07,047
Would those ancient records
remain in a place like this?

398
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,966
We should still try our best.

399
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,219
[Munchun] Don't worry about me
and go do your work.

2000 GANGNAM
RAW FISH RESTAURANT SUICIDE CASE

406
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:31,780
What is this?

407
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,323
There's something strange.

408
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,407
What?

409
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:38,537
[Hongsae] I connected the lead
we recently found to these cases.

410
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:40,914
A new lead?

411
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:42,916
Professor Gu Gangmo.

412
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:46,586
The name of the deceased.

413
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,090
who committed suicide in a Gangnam
raw fish restaurant's bathroom in 2000.

414
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,758
was Seo Sanghun.

415
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,761
He was a pretty prestigious
Korean literature professor.

416
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,846
but he wrote this in the expert column

417
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,349
he contributed to.

418
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:05,230
I looked into it and found out
that he disliked Professor Gu quite a bit.

419
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:09,067
He called him a cultist and a fraud.

420
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,403
Let's see...

421
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,656
And here.

422
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:19,244
the deceased in this case
and Professor Gu were also connected.

423
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:22,330
-[Munchun] Lee Okja?
-Yes. her name was Lee Okja.

424
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,374
She was the mother

425
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:26,876
of Professor Gu's ex-wife.

426
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,589
In other words. she was his mother-in-law.

427
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,217
They divorced. so it wouldn't have
popped up on a background check.

428
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,053
That's probably why
you didn't make the connection.

429
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,221
You're right.

430
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,849
-That's not all.
-What is it?

431
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,769
[Hongsae] The deceased. Hwang Chahui.

432
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,522
was a civil servant from the Ministry
of Culture. Sports. and Tourism.

433
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,483
He majored in economics
at Dongwoon University.

434
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:51,860
where Professor Gu taught.

435
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,862
but he also double majored in folklore.

436
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,656
He was Professor Gu's student.

437
00:26:58,575 --> 00:26:59,618
[Hongsae grunts]

438
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,703
What about this one?

439
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,663
Did you look into this one too?

440
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,041
No.

441
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,919
However. I think if we keep going.

442
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,921
we'll find other connections too.

444
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,763
You're incredible.

445
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,098
As expected of
the Police University’s top student.

446
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:24,225
[Munchun] Hey.

447
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:29,564
I haven't been able
to go through these yet.

448
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,359
Can you investigate these again.

449
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,152
focusing on the bruised
suicide victim cases?

450
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,236
Me?

451
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:38,865
I knew the top student of
the Police University would be different.

452
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:40,825
Thumbs up.

453
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,410
Wait.

454

[children shouting in distance]

455
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,513
[Sanyeong]
You didn't take your medicine again.

456
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,641
I told you that you have
to take it regularly.

457
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,227
I'll take it on my own. so get out.

458
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,740
[Sanyeong] Do you remember this book?

459
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,492
-It's the book Dad wrote.
-[gasps]

460
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,747

but I'm his daughter too.

464
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:41,010
Everything I thought I knew was a lie.

465
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,848
I need to know now.

466
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,225
about my family...

467
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:50,979

So please. tell me.

00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,109

a very good listener.

What brings you here?

00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:24,137
I'd like to get some advice
from the village head.

479
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,139
[Gyeongmun]
When I was working at the town office.

480
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:30,310
your dad came to ask for help
in conducting a local survey.

481
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:31,561
He's a folklore professor

482
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,104
-from Seoul.
-Hello.

483
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,064
[Gyeongmun] He was a strange person.

484
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:38,985
He listened to old wives' tales
that no one cared about.

485
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:41,738
stories of the past
that were considered boring.

486
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:46,075
and all of the stories that I knew.

487
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,995
I thought he did that because he liked me.

488
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,001
but later. I found out

489
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,462
that's just what folklorists do.

490
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,675
And?

491
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,055
Let's stop talking about the past.

492
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,264
Why?

493
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:10,725
Can you tell me a little more
while you're at it?

494
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,353
I can't do it. I'm too scared.

495
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:16,606
What's wrong?

496
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,483

but what he said never sat well with me.

"The second child must die."

501
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,372
just like in the story about that village.

What are you talking about?

503
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,254
He said that the second child always died
in a village called Jangjin-ri.

504
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,505

These are cases similar to your mother's.

They're about those who committed suicide
with red bruises on their wrists.

In 2000. Professor Gu Gangmo's colleague.

died one after another.

And this deceased individual
was a librarian.

According to her colleagues.

523
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,914
she met Professor Gu
the day before she died.

524
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:01,169
And last but not least.
Professor Gu Gangmo himself

and his mother.

526

also died in a similar way?

530
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,900
[Haesang] Is this Professor Gu's will?

[Munchun] Yes. that's right.
It was found at the scene.

532
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,489
I wondered why
he passed on the hair accessory.

I thought it was strange from the start.

What are you talking about?

535
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:44,420
Folklorists dislike breaking taboos.

and writing names in red

537
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,133
is a superstition
even ordinary people avoid doing.

538
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:53,638
So why did Professor Gu use a red pen
to write both of these notes?

[Gangmo] In the village of Jangjin-ri.

582
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,838
whenever there was a big disaster.
they evoked a juvenile ghost.

583
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,674
It was worshipped
as the village's guardian deity

584
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,759
which prevented evil
and brought prosperity.

585
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,470
The child sacrificed
to evoke a juvenile ghost

586
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,639
had to be the second child.

587
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,725
because Confucian customs called for

Even in death. you can't rid yourself

There's a saying that goes. "dog-eat-dog."

because it's a limited edition.
