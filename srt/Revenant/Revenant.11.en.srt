Sanyeong contacted you

560
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,469
after looking through the guest book
from her father's funeral?

561
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:02,845
Yes, that's right.

562
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:06,057
She said she would come by to say hello,

563
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,477
but she never called or came by,
so I was wondering if something happened.

564
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,355
She hasn't been answering her cell phone,
so I called her house.

565
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,731
She is okay, right?

566
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:16,734
I'm sorry to interrupt,

567
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,195

It's about something really important.

573
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:56,565
I can't give you
Ms. Yeo's personal number.

I saw the message
and tried contacting him,

580
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:15,334
but he had already passed away.

581
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,461
[Ms. Yeo] I felt bad about what happened,

582
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,756
so I went to the funeral
to at least pay my respects.

583
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,592
Do you know Lee Mokdan?

608
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:52,348
You should be helping with housework

Yes, after Hyangi went missing,

809

she filed a missing person's report
with Hyangi's homeroom teacher

but her body was never found.

If they killed someone

905
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:52,753
Come here.

906
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,049
[breathing heavily]

907
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:03,055
[Hyangi growling]

908
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:05,808
[screams]

909
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:07,476
I'm not going to die.

910
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:09,520
I'm going to live.

911
01:09:10,896 --> 01:09:12,648
[screams]

912
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:13,983
[breathes heavily]

913
01:09:14,066 --> 01:09:15,484
[Choi Manwol shrieks]

914
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:18,112
[coughing]

915
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:20,865

[♪ ominous music]

921
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:00,738
...his will and letter.

922
01:10:00,821 --> 01:10:02,573
Why did the evil spirit
drag you into this?

923
01:10:02,656 --> 01:10:04,200
[Haesang] You used me

924
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:06,410
to get your hands on the five objects.

925
01:10:06,493 --> 01:10:08,287
What'll happen once you find them all?

926
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:10,497
Hurry up and find it.

927
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:12,416
[breathing heavily]

928
01:10:12,499 --> 01:10:13,584
The last object.

929
01:10:13,667 --> 01:10:15,127
[Sanyeong] Then you'll know.

930
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:17,755
The last object that was
in my family home.

931
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:23,928
She used me to find this.

932
01:10:25,095 --> 01:10:26,430
But why?

933
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,602
[♪ ominous music]

934
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:53,374
[♪ music intensifies]

935
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:21,443
It's over.

936
01:11:23,028 --> 01:11:26,907
REVENANT

937
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:31,954
SPECIAL THANKS TO JIN SUNKYU, MOON SOOK,
AHN SEHO, AND LEE JINHEE

[♪ closing theme music]

939
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:49,054
[Hongsae]
She took the hairpin with her right hand.

940
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:50,347
[Sanyeong] It's all over now, right?

941
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:53,225
[Haesang] I need to get rid of
those five objects once and for all.

942
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:55,602
[Sanyeong] Mom, you must have had
a really difficult time.

943
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:57,229
[Haesang] I think we found something
we shouldn't have.

944
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,148
There must be a secret we missed.

945
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:01,233
[Hongsae] What will happen to Sanyeong
if we fail to find it?

946
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:02,776
[Haesang] Ms. Sanyeong will be in danger.

947
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:03,944
We're running out of time.
