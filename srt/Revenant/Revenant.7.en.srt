00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:45,962
REVENANT

2
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:47,881
The characters, places, organizations,
and events in this drama are fictitious

3
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:48,965
Child actors were filmed
in safe situations

4
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,175
Scenes involving animals were staged

5
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,968
And filmed in compliance
with animal welfare guidelines

6
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,261
EPISODE 7

7
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,638
The name of the person
who made the evil spirit?

8
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,016
Who is it?

9
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,186
If I tell you, will you let Haesang go?

10
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,106
Are you talking about the professor?

11
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,901
Who are you, really?

12
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,446
Keep it a secret from Haesang.

13
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,576
Look for a woman named Choi Manwol.

14
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:19,788
Choi Manwol?

15
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:22,665
Who is...

16
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,173
Where are you?

17
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,383
Come out.

18
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,225
I said, come out!

19
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,028
Where are you?

20
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,239
Come out.

21
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,339
Pear seed hair accessory,
blue pottery piece

22
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,261
This person came here
with Professor Gu Gangmo?

23
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,722
How did they know each other?

24
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,057
They said they met coincidentally

25
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,810
while conducting a local survey.

26
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,353
Anything else?

27
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,564
That is all I know about them.

28
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,192
Please tell me anything you remember

29
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,320
even if it's something trivial.

30
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:18,740
This person

31
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,618
is my mother who passed away.

32
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,043
They asked me

33
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,669
for a favor

34
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,672
before they left.

35
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,551
They wanted me

36
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,263
to chant a sutra for the deceased child.

37
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,858
Year 1995

38
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,293
Yeom Haejin
Date of death: March 17, 1995

39
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,215
It was this name.

40
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,385
"Yeom Haejin?"

41
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,887
She said it was the child

42
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,682
who died in her womb.

43
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,892
She said if something happened to her,

44
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:31,562
there would be no one else who could
hold a memorial service for the child.

45
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,107
"Estimated due date?"

46
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,442
The second child must die.

47
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,903
The child sacrificed
to evoke a juvenile ghost

48
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,613
had to be the second child.

49
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,619
This isn't it either.

50
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:09,309
The kidnapping and murder case
committed by Choi Manwol in 1958.

51
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,067
Yes, Professor Yeom?

52
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,069
Where are you now?
I'll go to you.

53
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,156
I have something
I need to tell you in person.

54
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,574
I do too.

55
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,493
I'm at Gwangcheon Police Station
right now, so come...

56
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,871
Never mind, I'll meet you
at the hangover soup restaurant.

57
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,205
Okay.

58
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,756
Gu Sanyeong

59
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:40,965
Hello?

60
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,135
Hello?

61
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,722
I called because
I had something to ask you.

62
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,936
Are you hiding something from me,
Professor Yeom?

63
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,647
Why are you asking something like that?

64
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,108
If there happens
to be something you're hiding...

65
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,444
No, there's nothing like that.

66
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,160
All right.

67
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,038
I understand.

68
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,986
High

69
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:47,281
I can't trust Professor Yeom or that kid.

70
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,952
I need to know who he is,
what kind of kid he was,

71
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,079
and why he died.

72
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,164
If I figure those things out,

73
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,126
I'll know why
the evil spirit guided me to him,

74
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,294
and I'll be able to figure out

75
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,797
who Choi Manwol is.

76
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,343
Images related to
Jangil High School uniform

77
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:10,346
Year 1999

78
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:29,615
Thank you for letting me
and my inadequate son live here.

79
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,619
I won't forget your kindness
until I die, ma'am.

80
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,746
What about your wife's funeral?

81
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,249
It was held without issue thanks to you.

82
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,045
Are you just going to sit there?
Bring it over.

83
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,521
Clean the floor
and keep your kid under control.

84
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,899
I'll keep that in mind.

85
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,050
You startled me.

86
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,426
What are you doing?

87
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,221
You go to a nice school.

88
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,307
I guess rich kids
do have things different.

89
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,143
Why are you coming out of there?
That's my grandmother's bedroom.

90
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,979
I know.
There was nothing interesting in there.

91
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,898
Are there any fun places?

92
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,191
Do you want to get kicked out?

93
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,654
There's no one here.

94
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,823
The housekeeper lady
went to the grocery store.

95
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,159
Madam Sea Salt is out with my dad.

96
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,494
"Sea Salt?"

97
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,164
Are you talking about my grandmother?

98
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,375
Your grandmother is incredible.

99
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,669
How could she brine someone she just met?

100
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:07,838
Wait...

101
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,928
Hey!

102
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,394
Are you nuts?
That belonged to my late father.

103
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,564
You can't mess with anything in here.

104
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,691
Nothing has been moved
even when my grandfather was around.

105
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,693
Things are made for people to use.

106
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,070
What's the point of just looking at them?

107
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,573
You weren't listening, were you?

108
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,077
Hey, wait--

109
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,537
- Hurry up and put it back!
- Hold on.

110
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,747
- Put it back!
- Did this belong to your dad?

111
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,333
- There seems to be film inside.
- Figure out who sent this letter.

112
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,670
- Yes, ma'am.
- Don't just answer, find out right now!

113
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,008
Madam Sea Salt is furious.

114
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,639
I think she's coming over here.

115
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,225
- Hey, what about me?
- I don't know.

116
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,686
Let's go out this way.

117
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,611
Come on.

118
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,489
Hey, what's that place over there?

119
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:16,782
Be quiet!

120
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,826
What is that place?

121
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,455
- It's a shed.
- What's in it?

122
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,042
What else would be in a shed
besides junk that gets thrown away?

123
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,049
You have a lot,
but you don't know what you have.

124
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,682
What is it?

125
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,226
What? Is there something on my face?

126
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,604
It's nothing.

127
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,398
Don't ever do this again.

128
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,070
Hey, what happened?

129
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,813
You should just give it to me
if you're not going to use it.

130
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,654
Choi Manwol
Place of birth: 3-5 Jangjin-ri...

131
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,573
Shaman
Born in 1914

132
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,509
Are you Detective Lee Hongsae?

133
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,888
Who are you?

134
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,891
Vice-president Kim Chiwon
Junghyeon Capital

135
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,643
I'll get straight to the point.

136
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,271
We would like you to...

137
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,815
tell us what your partner
Detective Seo Munchun is up to.

138
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,859
Why should I help you?

139
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:22,491
I heard that you barely graduated
from the Police University

140
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,661
after disregarding teamwork
and acting arbitrarily.

141
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,914
Your colleagues spoke ill of you

142
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,625
but I heard you have
excellent investigative skills.

143
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:33,961
Did you run a background check on me?

144
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,548
You should run a background check
on us as well.

145
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,217
We're a moneylending company.

146
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,345
We have a lot of influential customers.

147
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,555
That is why...

148
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,184
we know a lot of corporate secrets.

149
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,480
High-level information
that could aid in your promotion.

150
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,160
I'll pretend I didn't hear
anything you said today.

151
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,413
This isn't a bribe.
This is information for the common good.

152
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,581
We just...

153
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:15,294
need to know
what Detective Seo Munchun is up to.

154
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,715
Why are you doing this?

155
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,596
I need to know what you want
to look into it properly.

156
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,891
Tell us everything related
to Professor Yeom Haesang.

157
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,852
You just need to find out what
Professor Yeom and Detective Seo Munchun

158
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,939
talk about when they meet,
what they're curious about,

159
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,941
and what information they exchange,

160
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,360
even the most trivial things.

161
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,244
Hey.

162
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,121
- Did you eat?
- I'll pass.

163
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,583
I'll pass on the alcohol too.

164
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,963
That's unusual.
It's practically water to you.

165
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,298
Well, that's fine by me.

166
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,932
I had a younger sibling.

167
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,268
What are you talking about?

168
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,478
I had an unborn younger sibling.

169
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,482
"The second child must die."

170
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,821
My younger sibling was the second child,
so they were killed by the evil spirit.

171
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:28,409
In Jangjin-ri, a juvenile ghost
was created with the second child.

172
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,036
The vengeful spirit was retaliating.

173
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:32,496
Juvenile ghost?

174
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:35,249
I always wondered why my mother

175
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,085
tried to get rid of the evil spirit

176
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,254
and why the evil spirit killed her.

177
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,715
I think there was an evil spirit
in our house.

178
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,594
Before he died,

179
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,138
Professor Gu asked
a sutra-reciting shaman he knew

180
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,723
to make a Line of Prohibition for him.

181
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,182
Wait a minute.

182
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:56,604
Your mother knew
the deceased Professor Gu Gangmo?

183
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,397
Yes.

184
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,611
I think I need to learn more
about Professor Gu Gangmo.

185
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,738
I think I need...

186
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:10,576
to look into the files
on the suicide cases

187
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,288
that occurred around Professor Gu Gangmo.

188
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:17,875
No, I already looked into those cases.

189
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,586
Actually, besides those...

190
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,423
Here, take a look.

191
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:25,883
What is this?

192
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,510
No, you have to handle them
with care.

193
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,638
They're originals.
I had a hard time acquiring them.

194
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,601
Even before your mother's case,

195
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,313
there were people who committed suicide
that had red bruises on their wrists.

196
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,316
"Lee Mokdan."

197
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,318
Young girl missing for two weeks

198
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,571
You knew about this case too?

199
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:50,449
Hey, what do you take me for?
I'm a detective.

200
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,035
I guess I don't need to explain

201
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,745
since you already know about the case.

202
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,580
See this article?

203
00:15:56,997 --> 00:16:00,334
This article was in the notebook
you asked me to restore a while back.

204
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,212
Are you talking about
Professor Gu Gangmo's notebook?

205
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,380
Yes, that's right.

206
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,591
But the reporter who wrote this article

207
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,178
committed suicide after the case
and had red bruises on his wrists.

208
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,305
I think

209
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,265
there's one other person though.

210
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:22,439
This is the report of the suspect
in the girl's kidnapping and murder case.

211
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,651
It's old, so it's a little hard
to make out in some places,

212
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,861
but I was able to figure out the content.

213
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,447
The person the police identified
as the suspect

214
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:36,203
was Choi Manwol, who was rumored to be
the most talented shaman in the area.

215
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:40,040
Year 1958

216
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,670
Is anyone home?

217
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:17,995
Darn it.

218
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,206
Did you find something?

219
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,000
No.

220
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,545
Look at all this.

221
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,722
You disgraceful people!

222
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,349
How dare you come here! How dare you!

223
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:42,686
They found the missing girl's
clothes and severed finger

224
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,855
in the shaman's house.

225
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,565
She was definitely the culprit.

226
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,983
Let go of me!

227
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,960
No, don't open it.

228
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,715
Don't open it! No, don't!

229
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,842
I said don't open it!

230
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,401
What are you doing?

231
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,906
No, don't!

232
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,574
What are you doing?

233
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,079
Due to the prime suspect
Choi Manwol's suicide,

234
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,790
the case was closed
during the internal investigation.

235
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,086
The prime suspect in this case

236
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,380
and the reporter who wrote about the case

237
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,299
had red bruises on their wrists
when they committed suicide.

238
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,011
I think if we start here,

239
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,390
we'll be able to solve
your mother's case too.

240
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,101
My gosh.

241
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,271
"The deceased had
peculiar red lines on their wrists..."

242
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:11,150
I also asked for information
on the detectives in charge of the case.

243
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,818
"Detectives in charge:
Hwang Taehyun, Lee Seokgeum"

244
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,154
We might find something
if we look into that too.

245
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:17,865
You should eat.

246
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,449
Choi Manwol

247
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:20,993
"Choi Manwol."

248
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,624
Could you find information
on the shaman's family as well?

249
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,295
- What?
- There's something I want to ask.

250
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:32,963
Well...

251
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,925
Darn it, the soup's cold.

252
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:40,012
Excuse me, could you heat this for me?

253
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:45,350
Red hair accessory,
pottery piece, black rubber band

254
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,812
Jade hairpin, glass bottle

255
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,856
Five objects...

256
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,405
You must like playing games

257
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,032
if you were staying up this late
at an internet café.

258
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,993
Why did you suddenly ask
to meet me at this time?

259
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,830
Let's get some coffee.

260
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,707
I'll pay since I asked you to meet me.

261
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,667
I'll pay.

262
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,086
I have a favor to ask you.

263
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,940
Did you accept
your grandmother's inheritance?

264
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,317
You look pretty well-off today

265
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,611
as you did the last time we met.

266
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,074
Yes, I accepted it.

267
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:43,742
Can't I?

268
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,078
You're a suspect in that case.

269
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,829
Don't forget that.

270
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,124
Is that why you asked to meet,
to have coffee with a suspect?

271
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,461
What kind of person...

272
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:56,964
is Professor Yeom Haesang?

273
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,550
You're a detective.

274
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:04,263
Why are you asking me something
you can figure out yourself?

275
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:09,184
I can easily find that he's a professor
of folklore at Jeyoung University.

276
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,936
That's what pops up when you look him up.

277
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,564
But you can't look up what he's thinking.

278
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,444
Why do you care about what he's thinking?

279
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,405
Just like during Yoonjung's case,

280
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:25,033
I think, in many ways,

281
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,119
he's a strange person.

282
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:30,956
You can just ask
the detective you work with.

283
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,083
They seem pretty close.

284
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,754
Do you not want to tell me
about Professor Yeom?

285
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,759
If you grant me a favor first,

286
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,554
I'll tell you.

287
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,640
- What is it?
- I want to find someone.

288
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,766
Who is it?

289
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,226
I don't know his name.

290
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,437
You don't know his name?

291
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,188
How do you expect to find him then?

292
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,858
He's a student
from Jangil High School in Seoul.

293
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,694
When did he graduate
from Jangil High School?

294
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,655
He didn't graduate.

295
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:08,201
A friend of mine couldn't stop
coveting what others had.

296
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:11,747
He couldn't take it anymore
and committed suicide.

297
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,457
Professor Yeom Haesang

298
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,377
Jeyoung University
Date of birth: January 9, 1983

299
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:20,630
He's one of the students
who started attending the school in 1999.

300
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,257
That's not enough information.

301
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:25,469
There are probably over a hundred students
who started attending that year.

302
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,679
He committed suicide.

303
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,724
Please find a student
who committed suicide

304
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,060
among the students
who started attending that year.

305
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,108
You seem like a different person.

306
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,613
What kind of person was I before?

307
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,328
Right, I suppose I was wrong about you.

308
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,540
Yongwoondang

309
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,959
Yeom Haesang
Four Pillars of Destiny

310
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:03,423
January 9th, 1983,
between the hours of 1 and 3 p.m.

311
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,428
You have a lot of water
and metal in your four pillars,

312
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,430
so you're destined
to live a life without worries.

313
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,140
Money won't be an issue,

314
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:15,519
and for a profession, you should go
into a field that focuses on one thing

315
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,562
like the professions
with a "sa" in their titles.

316
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:21,191
Professional jobs such as doctor, lawyer,
professor, and cook are good choices.

317
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,692
What is your current job?

318
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:23,860
I'm a professor.

319
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,530
It's fate. You've found your calling.

320
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,913
Your fortune in your early years is good,

321
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,498
as well as in your later years,

322
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,625
but you are currently facing
a critical moment.

323
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,001
Do you drive?

324
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,212
Yes.

325
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:46,007
Beware of accidents,
especially on rainy nights.

326
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:47,968
Rainy nights are...

327
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,304
usually dangerous.

328
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,557
You don't believe me.

329
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,392
Everyone is like that at first,

330
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:58,437
but they come back
after they get into a big accident.

331
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,571
Your middle years are very bad.

332
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,656
You could get divorced and--

333
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:10,824
I'm single.

334
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:12,826
That's a relief.

335
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,126
I don't see it.

336
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,881
- What did you say?
- I don't see it.

337
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,886
A ghost to tell you the future

338
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,096
is nowhere in sight.

339
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,810
Did you lose all of the spiritual powers
your great-aunt

340
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,062
passed down to you?

341
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,441
Who are you?

342
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:46,610
Do you know my great-aunt?

343
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,405
Choi Manwol,
Jangjin-ri's most talented shaman.

344
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,325
You're her great-nephew, right?

345
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,014
Do you see anything?

346
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,475
Is my great-aunt's ghost here?

347
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,395
No, I don't see her.

348
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,231
I don't see anything.

349
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:34,658
When I was younger,

350
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,911
ghosts wouldn't leave me alone,
even when I begged them to.

351
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,122
But now, no matter where I look,
I can't see them.

352
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,417
It's driving me crazy since this is
the only thing I know how to do.

353
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,754
Have you been holding
memorial services this whole time?

354
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:53,176
Even if she did perform a terrible deed,

355
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,596
she was a very talented shaman.

356
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,891
I was hoping
she would visit to help me out,

357
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,977
so I've been honoring her
with utmost sincerity.

358
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,896
She didn't have any children either.

359
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,399
If you've been honoring her for this long,

360
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:10,193
you must know a lot about your great-aunt.

361
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:14,698
Yes, I do. I also have her belongings.

362
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,285
Then perhaps...

363
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,456
have you heard anything
about these objects?

364
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:32,215
Is this about a juvenile ghost?

365
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:36,344
A juvenile ghost?

366
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:40,473
I heard that you use this hair accessory
when you evoke a juvenile ghost.

367
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:43,435
Year 1958, Jangjin-ri

368
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,605
How did it go?

369
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,648
I told them to gather
the secondborn children.

370
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,151
Please come this way.

371
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,699
Mom, I'm sleepy.

372
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:58,950
It's only for a moment.

373
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,505
This red accessory

374
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,925
was a mark given to the child
who would become the juvenile ghost?

375
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,178
I guess it was to show, "don't scold
this child and treat them well,"

376
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:04,474
since they were to be sacrificed
for the village.

377
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,436
It was a very difficult time back then.

378
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:11,773
I guess that year was especially harsh.

379
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,650
There was a drought and a typhoon.

380
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,443
That's probably why

381
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:18,780
they did something they shouldn't.

382
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,741
You know about it in a lot of detail.

383
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:25,995
Yes, there was a record of that time
among my great-aunt's belongings.

384
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,249
May I see that record?

385
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,761
By the way,

386
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:44,305
why are you so interested
in my great-aunt?

387
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,892
Well, you said you see ghosts.

388
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:51,354
Are you planning on starting a business?
Are you interested in a partnership?

389
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,523
No, I'm not looking for a partner.

390
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:58,862
You can contact me
if you change your mind.

391
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:10,540
Here it is.

392
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:32,729
Jangjin-ri juvenile ghost

393
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:36,107
One billion hwan in exchange

394
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,943
She received such a big sum of money
in return?

395
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:43,031
I suppose that was the going rate
for killing a child.

396
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,368
If you converted this amount
to current-day value,

397
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:51,164
you could buy a building
in the middle of Gangnam.

398
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,332
What did you say?

399
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,918
It was that much?

400
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:58,046
This isn't an amount
Jangjin-ri's poor villagers could pay.

401
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:00,590
Who could do...

402
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,676
"Junghyeon Corporation."

403
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:05,762
Junghyeon Corporation

404
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,188
May I borrow this?

405
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,941
No, you see--

406
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,193
I'll make sure to return it to you.

407
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:27,075
I checked if any deceased Jangil
High School students committed suicide

408
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,578
among those who started attending in 1999.

409
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,081
Did you find any?

410
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:36,543
No, there weren't any.

411
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,337
Are you sure?

412
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,047
None of the students committed suicide.

413
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,131
However...

414
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,269
Summary of events
Oh Hwanki (18 years old, male)...

415
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,604
A series of strange deaths

416
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,898
occurred at the school around that time.

417
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,527
Hong Jihoon found with bloodshot eyes.
Suspected to have died of a heart attack.

418
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,153
Oh Hwanki found with bloodshot eyes.
Concluded to have died of a heart attack.

419
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:06,239
It's just like Yoonjung's case.

420
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,659
The kid I'm looking for was possessed
by a hungry ghost just like Yoonjung.

421
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,787
I'm sure he's a student from this school.

422
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,832
They all died because of him.

423
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,667
Again with the ghosts?

424
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,929
You said you were curious
about Professor Yeom Haesang, right?

425
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,265
Professor Yeom...

426
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,976
says he can see ghosts.

427
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,020
What?

428
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:38,813
I can see them too.

429
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:43,359
Professor Yeom and I
are after the same evil spirit.

430
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,403
We're trying to get rid of it.

431
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,740
You may not believe it,

432
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,576
but there are ghosts in this world.

433
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,505
Is the reason you're looking
for that high schooler

434
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,884
because of that evil spirit or whatever

435
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,637
that you and Professor Yeom are after?

436
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:12,639
Yes.

437
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,064
It's fine if you can't believe it.

438
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:23,524
Where are you going to go?

439
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,736
The school. I want to go check for myself.

440
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,988
What are you going to do there?

441
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:35,495
I'm sure there are still teachers from
that time since it's a private school.

442
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:36,955
I'm going to ask them.

443
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,082
What are you going to ask them?

444
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:43,461
Are you going to ask them to find a ghost
whose name you don't know?

445
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,931
Let's go.

446
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,307
You're coming with me?

447
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,392
Yes.

448
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,561
Sometimes, having a police badge helps.

449
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,357
Thank you.

450
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:11,781
What brings you to our school, Detective?

451
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:15,952
I'd like to ask you a few questions

452
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:19,330
about the students who died
at this school in 1999.

453
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,916
I'll keep it completely confidential,

454
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:24,002
so I ask for your cooperation.

455
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,504
Okay, please go ahead.

456
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,589
In 1999,

457
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:32,760
students died sudden deaths one by one.

458
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,262
Do you recall this?

459
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,097
Of course, I do.

460
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,016
They were all very nice kids.

461
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,601
It was very unfortunate, but...

462
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,688
Why are you asking about that time?

463
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:48,109
Did the dead kids happen
to have anything in common?

464
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:53,322
Were they in the same club
or lived in similar locations?

465
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,409
No, they were in different grades

466
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:57,910
and didn't know each other at all.

467
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:01,706
Didn't the dead kids'
belongings disappear?

468
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,625
Where did you hear that?

469
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:07,086
Did you find the kid
who took their belongings?

470
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,505
His face was on the darker side,

471
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:12,467
about 5 ft. 8 inches tall,

472
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,427
and he had double eyelids.

473
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:17,221
Do you know Ujin?

474
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,389
Year 1999

475
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,641
All of this was found in your locker.

476
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,812
Did you take all of this?

477
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:28,566
These belonged to your dead classmate
and senior.

478
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,943
How could you do such a thing?

479
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,111
Why not?

480
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,322
What did you say?

481
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:41,245
Many people eat well and live a good life
despite doing worse things,

482
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,372
so why can't I?

483
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,125
It's strictly prohibited

484
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:50,379
to show student records to outsiders,

485
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,800
so please refrain from sharing
this information with others.

486
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,134
Of course.

487
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:59,263
Don't worry. I promise it won't get out.

488
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,598
Ujin...

489
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,142
was not like that from the start.

490
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,354
He used to have a bright personality,

491
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,689
but after his mother passed away,

492
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:12,026
he became quiet and somber.

493
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,779
What happened after that?

494
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,990
Thankfully, the parents
of the dead kids forgave him,

495
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:20,493
so it ended with disciplinary action.

496
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,411
But he suddenly got into a car accident

497
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:25,289
and unfortunately passed away.

498
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,020
Hello?

499
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,526
Hello?

500
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,403
Who is this?

501
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:01,284
What are you calling about?

502
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,661
Well, you see...

503
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,205
Does Ujin--

504
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,499
Just get straight to the point.

505
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,422
I'm looking for someone named Choi Manwol.

506
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:31,731
Hello?

507
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:41,365
Eastern Registry Office

508
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,577
Application for issuance
of the certificate of registered matters

509
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,751
Yeom Haesang

510
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,898
CEO Yeom Seungok

511
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,614
I think we should go to Kim Ujin's house.

512
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,407
I believe it's the same address
listed on the student record.

513
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,617
Wait.

514
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:29,247
Did you really not know
whose house that was?

515
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,414
What are you talking about?

516
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,917
It was the house
of the deceased Yeom Seungok,

517
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,168
Junghyeon Capital's first president.

518
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:37,004
Now his wife and current president
of Junghyeon Capital,

519
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,506
Na Byeonghui, lives there.

520
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,591
Who are those people?

521
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,553
They're Professor Yeom's grandparents.

522
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,682
That's Professor Yeom's house.

523
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:56,899
Hello, it's me.

524
00:37:56,899 --> 00:38:00,319
I looked into the detectives
who were in charge of the case.

525
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:04,699
Right after the case was closed,
they were both dismissed.

526
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,785
- What was the reason?
-It doesn't say the reason,

527
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,955
but something is fishy.

528
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,206
What do you mean?

529
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,666
Bribery.

530
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,043
Even if the suspect died,

531
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:19,588
it's not a case
to close internally, right?

532
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,134
Neither the people of Jangjin-ri

533
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,469
nor the people
around the area were investigated.

534
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,643
The reporter who was digging
into the case died,

535
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,061
the suspect died,

536
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,064
and the detectives in charge took bribes

537
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:39,400
to hurriedly close the case.

538
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,028
Someone...

539
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:45,072
is covering up the truth of the case.

540
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,241
I'll call you back.

541
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:16,645
Junghyeon Corporation

542
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,068
The Junghyeon Corporation listed there

543
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,403
is the company
that started Junghyeon Capital.

544
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,369
Did you investigate in advance
because of Professor Yeom?

545
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:35,081
Well, I found out
while investigating another case as well.

546
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,961
What kind of company was it?
Was there anything unique about it?

547
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:45,049
Junghyeon Corporation was a company
that sold and mediated regional products

548
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,593
such as cotton and rice
during the Japanese colonial era.

549
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,346
They were successful
in every business they touched,

550
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:53,349
but they suffered financial difficulties
due to excessive business expansion

551
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,851
that coincided with the Korean War.

552
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,021
Junghyeon Corporation was passed down

553
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:01,399
to Yeom Seungok,
the grandfather of Professor Yeom.

554
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,484
He was lucky.

555
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,861
He was able to save a company
that was collapsing.

556
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,738
Junghyeon Capital Yeom family tree

557
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:10,074
After escaping the financial crisis,

558
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,536
he established Junghyeon Mutual Finance,
a moneylending company.

559
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,621
Since then, he was able to climb the ranks

560
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:17,706
and become an emerging conglomerate.

561
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,502
That company became
the current Junghyeon Capital.

562
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,587
However,

563
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,007
do you know what people
called that company?

564
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,259
What did they call it?

565
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,302
The river Styx.

566
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,637
The river Styx?

567
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:35,266
The river that flows between this world
and the underworld?

568
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:36,934
Yes.

569
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,853
Why did they call it that?

570
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,980
The people who could become
obstacles to the company

571
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,065
all died.

572
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:45,067
The prosecutor investigating the company

573
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:47,695
and even the head of a rival company.

574
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,632
I'm looking for someone
named Choi Manwol.

575
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:12,178
- Hello?

576
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:16,015
That person knew the name "Choi Manwol."

577
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,894
There's definitely a connection.

578
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,941
History of Junghyeon Capital
1933-1993

579
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,279
Founded in 1933...

580
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,492
The year 1958...

581
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:38,037
1958 October
Yeom Seungok appointed president

582
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:51,008
A cold-hearted shaman who created yeommae

583
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:53,177
The year 1958?

584
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,386
What's wrong?

585
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,726
Junghyeon Corporation

586
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:11,487
Junghyeon Corporation

587
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,345
She instructed us
not to let anyone in today.

588
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:37,680
Please move.

589
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,642
Young Master Yeom, you can't!

590
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:42,851
Young Master Yeom!

591
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:46,313
Don't come in until I call for you.

592
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,323
What do you think you're doing?

593
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:59,034
Just this once, please tell me the truth.

594
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,504
You know what this is, don't you?

595
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,136
Get out.

596
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,806
I won't allow such a thing in my house.

597
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,143
Take it away and leave at once.

598
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,395
So you do know what this object is.

599
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,650
You know this child too, right?

600
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,612
Young girl missing for two weeks

601
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:45,664
Are you okay?

602
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:55,549
What?

603
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:05,643
What's wrong?

604
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,354
- My eyes...
-  What?

605
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:18,447
Do you see that child?

606
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,118
What child?

607
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,834
Gu Sanyeong! Where are you going?

608
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:57,945
We're almost there. Come on.

609
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:07,454
We have to hurry. Let's go.

610
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:11,458
Will there really be
a lot of delicious food if I go there?

611
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:13,794
Of course.

612
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,338
There's a lot of delicious food.

613
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:18,716
Let's go quickly.

614
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,470
No, don't.

615
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,223
Don't go there.

616
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,253
You know this child too, right?

617
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,005
Young girl missing for two weeks

618
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,716
Shall I explain it to you?

619
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,053
The name of this child is Lee Mokdan.

620
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:09,725
She was killed at a very young age

621
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,894
to evoke a juvenile ghost.

622
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:16,398
A shaman named
Choi Manwol killed this child

623
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:17,941
at someone's request.

624
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:22,571
It was a huge amount of money
that no ordinary person could pay.

625
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:56,939
Hey, come on. This way.

626
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:03,445
A brick wall.

627
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,825
Blue gate, blue...

628
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:11,829
The shaman wasn't the only one
who received the money.

629
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,373
The detectives in charge of the case,

630
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,626
the villagers
who sold off their neighbors,

631
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,879
and even her own family.

632
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:23,799
Make sure you debone it well.
Don't get any bone mixed in it.

633
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,555
Here, put this in the fire.

634
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:14,766
I saw the promissory note
received by the dead shaman.

635
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,437
The issuer...

636
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:22,774
was Junghyeon Corporation.

637
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:25,611
The company that Grandfather...

638
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,406
The same name as the company
that our family founded.

639
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:30,657
I denied it.

640
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,912
I thought it was a different company
with the same name,

641
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:37,998
so I checked with the registry office.

642
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,334
The CEO's name...

643
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:44,755
was Yeom Seungok,

644
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,508
my grandfather.

645
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:55,182
This child...

646
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:03,690
Did Grandfather really...

647
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:08,320
Did our family kill this child?

648
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:27,005
An evil spirit will be
passed on to the heads

649
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:29,299
of this family for generations to come.

650
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:34,262
The evil spirit will fulfill
its desires alongside you,

651
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,391
but it will come at a cost.

652
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:42,729
It doesn't matter.
As long as we get what we want.

653
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:45,691
Don't you agree?

654
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:37,367
Let's go then.

655
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,000
No, don't do this!

656
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:47,919
Please tell me.

657
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:51,256
Tell me it's not true.

658
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,218
It's true.

659
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,141
We killed that child.

660
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:50,667
How could you do such a thing?

661
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:53,628
Don't act all high and mighty.

662
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,299
The company at the time
was at a crossroads.

663
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:58,758
If it weren't for us,

664
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:01,803
do you think
you could have enjoyed such luxury?

665
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,306
I've never been happy...

666
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,059
because I had a lot of money.

667
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:11,313
You don't understand
the struggle of not having money.

668
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:14,357
What about my mother?

669
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:16,359
That foolish brat.

670
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:23,283
After your father died,
the evil spirit should have possessed you.

671
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:27,662
She tried to prevent that
and got possessed instead.

672
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:29,998
We would have been richer

673
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:33,752
if it weren't for her.

674
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:11,873
Gu Sanyeong

675
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:14,417
Where did she go?

676
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:46,825
Did you enjoy it?

677
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,619
Living in such a nice house?

678
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:54,416
Did you really...

679
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:59,045
not know what you people did?

680
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:07,679
Did you enjoy...

681
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:12,267
living in a nice house

682
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,561
and spending your money like water...

683
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:22,652
after horribly killing that young child

684
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,863
to create a juvenile ghost?

685
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:06,863
Report me if you want to.

686
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:10,575
I'll solve this with money too.

687
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,348
Did you figure it out?

688
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:18,268
So you finally figured it out.

689
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:23,189
Choi Manwol
Place of birth: 3-5 Jangjin-ri...

690
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:25,567
Year 1999

691
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:01,144
So what do you want?

692
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,605
The evil spirit.

693
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:11,362
I went to Jangjin-ri for a local survey
and met your daughter-in-law.

694
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:15,366
I heard you starved a little girl to death
and created an evil spirit

695
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:17,535
to bring success to your family.

696
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:22,081
Your daughter-in-law wanted to prevent
the evil spirit from possessing her son.

697
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:26,544
So you're here to threaten me
with what that foolish brat told you?

698
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:29,631
I didn't believe your daughter-in-law.

699
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,424
Just out of academic curiosity,

700
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:33,092
I investigated
the malicious customs of Jangjin-ri.

701
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:34,177
Then...

702
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:40,350
I found an elder who was the village head
of Jangjin-ri at the time.

703
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:43,895
That person had it.

704
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:46,356
The evidence to prove it was true.

705
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:48,733
I'll ask you again.

706
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:51,861
What do you want?

707
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:57,659
Your daughter-in-law told me
how to get rid of the evil spirit.

708
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:01,371
However, she didn't tell me
how I could acquire one.

709
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:06,417
How can I acquire an evil spirit?

710
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:11,005
Do I have to find the shaman Choi Manwol
who made the evil spirit?

711
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:14,634
Or do I have to find the objects
sealed by the five Lines of Prohibition

712
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:17,637
which your daughter-in-law took?

713
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:20,557
Are you confident you can handle it?

714
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,063
I'll buy you a house,
so take that money and get lost.

715
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:30,817
Don't go around spreading nonsense
and never contact me again.

716
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:32,443
If you do,

717
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:35,446
I'll kill you.

718
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,206
That's when I found out.

719
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:48,835
That nice house and the objects within it.

720
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:51,796
All of that came from
killing a little girl.

721
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:56,134
Why...

722
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:59,637
Why didn't you tell me?

723
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:04,767
I thought you'd never be able
to find the evil spirit

724
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,729
since it didn't appear for a long time.

725
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,231
I thought it would be best for you

726
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:12,358
not to find it.

727
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,569
Because if you did find it,

728
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:17,196
I knew it'd come to this.

729
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:18,740
Did you enjoy it?

730
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:23,244
Did you enjoy watching me run around,
cluelessly searching for the evil spirit

731
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:25,371
like an idiot?

732
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,988
I was nothing.

733
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:00,990
Nothing belonged to me.

734
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:03,743
Without my grandmother's inheritance,

735
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:06,329
I was nothing.

736
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:08,915
I am...

737
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:14,837
I am just like my grandmother.

738
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:20,218
Haesang, stop it.

739
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:23,930
How am I supposed to live now?

740
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:30,103
The present me,

741
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:33,064
the future me...

742
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:35,358
Don't you see that over there?
I said stop it.

743
01:01:58,214 --> 01:01:59,298
I'll...

744
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:02,552
- go.
- No.

745
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:04,470
No, Ujin.

746
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,180
No!

747
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:09,517
Ujin...

748
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:10,810
No, Ujin.

749
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:13,271
Ujin.

750
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:16,482
Ujin, no.

751
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:23,573
Ujin!

752
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:27,118
Don't die the way I did,
like an idiot.

753
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:32,957
Don't go...

754
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,628
Don't leave me behind.

755
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:45,762
How...

756
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:48,097
am I really

757
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:51,434
supposed to live now?

758
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:31,474
What you went through

759
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:34,393
was really terrible.

760
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:39,982
It must have been really painful...

761
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,032
and really scary.

762
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:51,285
However,

763
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:05,383
I won't live like they did.

764
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:19,480
I won't live my life happily
with that money,

765
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:24,819
knowing that the people around me

766
01:04:25,486 --> 01:04:27,071
will die.

767
01:04:32,326 --> 01:04:34,871
I found out everything,

768
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:37,081
your identity, and your story.

769
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:44,005
I'll send you where you should be.

770
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:11,240
You all wanted me first.

771
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:15,036
You'll want me too, just like your father.

772
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:42,396
REVENANT

773
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:50,071
Special thanks to Cho Hyunchul

774
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,963
I'm going to get rid
of the evil spirit

775
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:09,131
that my grandfather and father created.

776
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:11,634
So you're saying I have
the same illness as my father?

777
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:13,010
You're all that I...

778
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:14,261
You're right.

779
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:16,514
I want you.

780
01:06:17,014 --> 01:06:19,225
It all began in 1958.

781
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:20,309
LEE MOKDAN CASE

782
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:21,394
There's a pattern.

783
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:23,854
- Wake up, Professor Yeom!
-  It's the spirit of darkness.

784
01:06:23,854 --> 01:06:26,524
Eventually, you'll be
engulfed by the darkness.

785
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:28,025
Are you saying he'll die?

786
01:06:28,025 --> 01:06:29,694
Wake up, Professor Yeom!

787
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:31,779
Professor Gu Gangmo said

788
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:34,907
we had to find the five objects
and identify the evil spirit.

789
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:37,326
It's happening again.

790
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:38,953
There will be another victim.

791
01:06:59,932 --> 01:07:01,934
