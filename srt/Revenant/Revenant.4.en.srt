[Hongsae] They were scumbags
who targeted poor college students.

I'm sure blackmailing
and threatening were their forte.

He probably fabricated everything

Yes, sir. We still have many questions

Are you sure it was him?

was forbidden.

using hay or parts of a tree.

524
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,276
Or it could also mean
the act of starving and killing a child

So that's the straw doll ritual.

I'm surprised that someone

[Sanyeong chuckles]

651
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,545
It's a way of warding off
wandering ghosts.

Mm...

653
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,548
Wandering ghosts can latch onto you.

A ghost that died away from home

655
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:53,969
could latch onto a human

656
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,722
and make them ill or bring misfortune.

657
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,600
This ritual casts them away, right?

658
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,101
You've done your research.

00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,279
Right, Professor Yeom?

663
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:14,823
Yes.

Both that ritual
and this village will be gone

Do you know Professor Gu Gangmo?

[Haesang] He also studied folklore.

682
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:06,917
He must've come to do research
on the straw doll ritual.

but it's already been over 60 years.

Yes. My father wrote this article.

[Munchun] Do you remember hearing anything
about that incident from him?

For example, about the culprit's identity
or the victim's family.

695
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,174
He couldn't tell me anything.

696
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,302
Because he passed away

697
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,596

Weren't there bruises
like these on the wrists?

Yes, he did.

[Hongsae] Gu Sanyeong.
Professor Gu Gangmo.

I'm still lost,
but they all seem to be connected.

730
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,157
Professor Gu Gangmo.

731
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:49,121
Let's dig deeper into him.

732
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:52,249
He's at the center of this case.

733
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:00,132
[elder 1] How's the food?

734
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:02,926
It's delicious.

736
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:07,181
[Sanyeong] It's so scrumptious. Thank you.

-[elder 2] Professor Yeom.

739
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,980
Do you still see ghosts?

740
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,571
[Sanyeong] Yes, he does.

741
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:25,949
I thought he was strange
when I first met him.

742
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,410
[elders laugh]

743
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:33,040

You must suffer a lot because of him.

745
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:37,002
Are you folks really okay?

746
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:39,797
Yes, we are. Why do you keep asking?

747
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,966
Right. Who was it again?

748
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:46,512
-Gu what?
-Professor Gu Gangmo.

749
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:49,389
Do any of you recognize that name?

750
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:50,474
[elder 4] Who is that?

751
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:52,684
Professor Yeom is here because of him.

752
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,062
He also studied folklore.

753
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,855
-I'll show you his photo.
-[elder 1] Sure.

754
00:46:56,939 --> 00:47:00,317
Gu who studied folklore? Isn't it him?

755
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,612
He married the daughter of the family
living in the bamboo tree house.

756
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:06,323
-Pardon?
-I lived across from them.

757
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:10,661
I remember him because something bad
happened to the elderly lady.

759
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:16,750
Her daughter worked at the town office.

760
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:21,171
I believe her name was Gyeongmun.

[Sanyeong] Why isn't she picking up?

Mom.

768
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:46,113
-Mom, was Baekchagol your hometown?
-[Gyeongmun] What?

769
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,657
Is this where you met Dad and married him?

770
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:52,578
You said Seoul was your hometown.
Did you lie about that too?

771
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:54,872
[Gyeongmun] How did you know?

772
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:58,083
Don't tell me you're there right now.

773
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,085
Are you in Baekchagol?

774
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:02,004
Answer me first.

775
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:04,339
Get out! Leave that place immediately!

Wandering ghosts.

787
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:47,716
Is that why he passed away?

788
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:53,597
It's highly likely,
if his condition suddenly worsened.

789
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:56,975

[Sanyeong gasps]

795
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,206
There are four more.

796
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:22,918
I need to look around the village,
but I'm sure there are many more.

Doesn't this mean...

that all of them are in danger?

800
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,186
Goodness, we've been losing
one villager after another these days.

801
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:45,857
Maybe we should postpone the ritual.
This is bad luck.

802
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:47,192
We should...

803
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:50,153
just get rid of it entirely.

804
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,905
[Ms. Park] Take that old man for example.

805
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,783
He was forced to prepare for the ritual
despite being unwell

806
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:55,993
and look where that got him.

807
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,078
Stop this before another one of us dies.

808
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,496
That's enough!

809
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:03,750

What do you mean?

813
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,305
We still have so much to do
before the ritual.

814
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:19,307
But there's something you must do.

815
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:22,811
You must never look behind you
on your way home.

816
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:25,188
Keep your head down.

817
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,732
And lock the doors

818
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,109

[Haesang] Sir.

823
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,999
There are wandering ghosts in the village.

824
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:45,876
Wandering ghosts?
You're saying we have ghosts?

825
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:49,296
Are you serious?

826
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:51,673
-Yes.
-[elder 1] But why?

827
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:55,552
We've been painstakingly carrying out
the ritual every single year.

829
00:50:58,346 --> 00:50:59,598
So tell me.

830
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:02,726
[elder 1] What should we do?

831
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:05,020
Where are the straw dolls?

832
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,439
[elder 1] What are you going
to do with them?

833
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,358
The straw doll ritual
will ward off wandering ghosts.

834
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:12,861
We must cast them away.

835
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:14,613

836
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:15,906

What? Where did they go?

838
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:21,953
Are you sure you put them here?

839
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:24,456
Of course.
I brought new sorghum rice cakes

840
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,958
and liquor here every morning and prayed.

841
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:30,128
It was here this morning
when we cleaned the room.

842
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:32,798
Then maybe one of the villagers took it
after cleaning the room.

843
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,049
Why would they?

844
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:36,760
We should ask those who cleaned
the room just in case.

845
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:38,386
[elder 1] But...

846
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:40,764

Ms. Park, Ms. No, and Mr. Kim

00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:51,746
Yes, I do.

901
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,582
I can see what you see.

902
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:56,710
Then why aren't you avoiding her?

903
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,004
Why should I?

904
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:02,757
This is my first time
seeing my daughter in decades.

905
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:08,805
[Ms. Park] She felt suffocated
in the countryside

906
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:11,349
and ran off to the city.

907
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,811
I don't know what troubled her so much,

908
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:16,938
but she committed suicide.

909
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:19,899
[♪ somber music]

910
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:27,073
[Ms. Park] Not a single day goes by
that I don't think of her.

911
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:30,618
So why would I avoid her?

912
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:32,620
[♪ music stops]

913
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,666
[wind gusting]

914
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:43,673
[♪ ominous music builds]

915
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:50,347
[line ringing]

916
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,186
[phone beeps]

917
00:55:58,355 --> 00:55:59,481
[Sanyeong gasps]

918
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:04,527
[evil spirits murmuring]

919
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,332
[♪ ominous music]

920
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:27,008
[♪ music rises]

921
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,723
[♪ tense music]

922
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:39,979
[♪ music stops]

923
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:42,482
Her wandering ghost can latch onto me.

924
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:45,860
I've lived a long life anyway.

925
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:49,489
I'd rather die and be with her.

926
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,285
Did you get rid of the straw dolls?

927
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,789
Because the ritual
would make your daughter disappear?

928
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,750
[♪ suspenseful music]

929
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,085
Yes, it was me.

930
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:06,548
I burned them.

931
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:11,219
[♪ tense music]

932
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:13,304
[clatters]

933
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:25,608
[♪ tense music]

934
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:30,905
It's okay.

935
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:33,158
Now that the dolls are gone,

936
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:36,828
nothing can harm you.

937
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:39,038
[♪ tense music]

938
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:44,752
[groaning]

939
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,838
[banging on door]

940
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,222
[♪ music intensifies]

941
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,932
[Sanyeong whimpers]

942
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,728
[sobbing]

943
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:06,608
[♪ ominous music]

944
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,282
[breathes heavily]

945
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:30,298
STORE

946
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:35,845
[grunts]

947
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:42,644
[♪ music intensifies]

948
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:48,191
[gasps]

949
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,656
[♪ tense music]

950
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:02,747
[♪ music stops]

951
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:03,873
Dad.

952
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:07,835
REVENANT

953
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,921
[♪ closing theme music]

954
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,900
I won't let anyone harm my daughter.

955
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:33,278
[Haesang]
Do you want all the villagers to die?

956
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:36,322
[Hongsae] I connected the lead
we recently found to these cases.

957
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:38,575
-A new lead?
-Professor Gu Gangmo.

958
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,368
[Haesang] I thought
it was strange from the start.

959
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:42,036
I'm sure that child is the evil spirit.

960
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,664
[Sanyeong]
All the villagers took part in her death.

961
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:46,165
[Haesang] Do you desire Sanyeong's youth?

962
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:48,710
No matter how much you take,
you'll never be satiated.

963
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,254
[Sanyeong screams]
Be quiet!

964
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:54,424
[sobbing]
