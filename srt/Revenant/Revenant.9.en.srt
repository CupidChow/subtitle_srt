188
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:29,350

like this and threw him out the window,

Plus, you weren't captured
on CCTV footage.

192
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:47,201
Even if I specify you as the culprit
and you confess with your own mouth,

193
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,120
there's no physical evidence.

194
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,289
You'll be released eventually.

195
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,837
However, when Detective Seo died,

196
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,631
I definitely saw you.

197
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,092
Don't show up in front of me for a while,

198
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,803
because I might end up killing you.

I gifted a pure gold ring
at your baby's first birthday party.

209
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,426
You should say your farewell now.

How can I catch it?

288
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,479
My understanding is that we need to find
five objects related to the ghost

289
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:39,274
and figure out the ghost's name
to get rid of it.

No, it's not Ms. Sanyeong.

killed those people.

Gu Sanyeong has nothing to do with this?

[Haesang] She doesn't. Ms. Sanyeong

It's okay.

548
00:40:58,581 --> 00:40:59,623
But…

549
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:03,210
why do you want to know
about Ms. Chae Seorin?

550
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,546
Do you perhaps…

551
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,048
[phone clicking]

552
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,426
…recognize this person?

553
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,263
No, I don't know this person.

554
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,390
He was a folklore professor,

555
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,184
and according to a detective I know,

556
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:23,147
Ms. Chae Seorin met with him
before she passed away.

557
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:28,527
I did give a detective

558
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:32,448
a list of books that Ms. Chae searched for
before she died.

559
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:34,783
However, that's all I know.

560
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:38,454
Could you show me that list too?

561
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,916
Why are you doing this?

562
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:44,460
[sighs]

563
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:51,133
This may sound strange,
but I'm chasing a ghost.

564
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,386
Many people have died
because of that ghost.

565
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,804
But I think Ms. Chae Seorin…

566
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:59,391
knew something about the ghost.

567
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,686
Are you…

568
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:05,648
referring to that?

569
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,984
The red bruises on the wrists?

570
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,279
Ms. Chae and I

571
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,824
were in charge of preserving
old materials.

572
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:18,077
But before Ms. Chae died,

573
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,787
-something strange happened there.

She was ripping a book?

578
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:41,267
Ms. Chae cried
because she didn't know why she did it.

579
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:44,770
Although it was old, it wasn't a rare book

580
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,730
and it wasn't worth preserving.

581
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,401
I thought she would receive
light punishment,

582
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:53,112
but she died not too long after.

583
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:55,823
What kind of book was it?

585
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,663
This is the title of the book
and the author.

586

Only a handful were published
at the author's own expense,

587
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,459

at other libraries.

You recognize it.

611
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:53,232
Professor Gu made it for us.

612
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:54,400
I asked if Lines of Prohibition

613
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,193
were supposed to be put up
outside the door,

614
00:44:57,111 --> 00:45:00,197

bad luck from within a door too.

ever mentioned that place to you.

618
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:17,256
No, he didn't. In truth,
I wasn't that close to Professor Gu.

619
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:20,843
He came by every now and then as a guest.

00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,893
Then how did you come to his funeral?

Before this lodge,

623
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:34,106
it was a bed and breakfast
that was falling apart.

624
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:37,401
But there was a big fire decades ago

625
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:39,570
and the owner didn't show up afterward,

626
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,196
