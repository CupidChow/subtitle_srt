REVENANT

00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:49,257
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,967
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
IN SAFE SITUATIONS

4
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,974
EPISODE 8

5
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:59,100
I...

6
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,186
I'm sorry, sir.

7
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,567
- Did you eat?
- Sorry?

8
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,237
Follow me.

9
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,873
Sir, I have something to tell you.

10
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:24,417
Eat first. We can talk afterward.

11
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,339
Somebody wanted me to tail you.

12
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,343
Aren't you curious
about what I said to them?

13
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,429
Why would I be? You're not someone
who would betray your superiors.

14
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:49,484
I don't know who it was,
but they must have nothing better to do.

15
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,277
Why would they be curious about

16
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,363
this soon-to-retire
Rookie Shaman of Violent Crimes?

17
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,575
You know Junghyeon Capital, right?

18
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,577
Professor Yeom Haesang's family owns it.

19
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:03,790
And they wanted you to tail me?

20
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,417
I haven't found out why yet.

21
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,711
But I stumbled across something odd

22
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,797
while looking into them.

23
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,633
Rumor had it that those who'd put
Junghyeon Capital at a disadvantage

24
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,554
committed suicide, so I looked into it.

25
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,516
And the rumor turned out to be true.

26
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,770
Four people committed suicide.

27
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,192
And they all had red bruises
on their wrists.

28
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,157
BOTH OF THE VICTIM'S WRISTS WERE BRUISED

29
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,451
I don't think the case you're digging into
was just a simple suicide case.

30
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,873
Capital.

31
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,878
Yeom Haesang.

32
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:58,303
I initially thought these cases
first started in 1995.

33
00:02:58,887 --> 00:02:59,929
But I was wrong.

34
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,473
It all began in 1958.

35
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,896
LEE MOKDAN CASE

36
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,231
Do you remember the juvenile ghost case?

37
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,733
- I do.
- It all began

38
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,694
with this shaman who made that ghost.

39
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,242
SHAMAN CHOI MANWOL

40
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,411
She died in her cell
with red bruises on her wrists

41
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,705
while being questioned by the police.

42
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,250
Then Reporter Go Gyeongho
who wrote about that incident.

43
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,627
You heard about him too, right?

44
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,961
Yes, I remember him.

45
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,006
"REPORTER GO GYEONGHO"

46
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,758
He died in the same way.

47
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,176
But that is not all.

48
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:45,475
Detective Hwang Taehyun, who was
in charge of the juvenile ghost case,

49
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,893
also committed suicide.

50
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,687
And... Shin Seungju.

51
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:53,316
A villager of Jangjin-ri
who taught at a nearby school

52
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,027
also committed suicide around that time

53
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,905
and had bruises on the wrists.

54
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,282
When did you find that out?

55
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,451
I was also quite busy these past two days.

56
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,746
I found the report on Lee Mokdan's case.

57
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,957
You found the report?

58
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,708
Where?

59
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,377
In that storage you gave up on.

60
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,172
You also found out

61
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,592
about the strange deaths
related to Junghyeon Capital.

62
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,219
Right.

63
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,471
I'll take over from here.

64
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,897
Yeom Seungok
founded Junghyeon Mutual Finance.

65
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,441
His son, Yeom Jaewoo,
took over after his father's death

66
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:39,320
and changed the name to Junghyeon Capital.

67
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,865
Yeom Jaewoo faced a big crisis
right after he took over.

68
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,576
He was questioned by the prosecution
on suspicions of illegal loans.

69
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:48,830
Lee Taekhee, the chief prosecutor
of the central investigation department

70
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,457
of the Supreme Prosecutors' Office,
who was in charge of the case,

71
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,751
was found dead in his house,

72
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:57,088
and the case was dropped
due to insufficient evidence.

73
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,675
Next was Choi Wonchul,
the CEO of Taejang Construction,

74
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,803
a business rival of Junghyeon Capital.

75
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,932
After that were
the on-site manager and the broker

76
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,643
who were in charge
of Junghyeon's construction project.

77
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,688
They were all found dead
with red bruises on their wrists.

78
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:17,233
After that, those around
Professor Gu Gangmo were found dead.

79
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,693
In 2000.

80
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,662
2002, PROFESSOR GU GANGMO'S MOTHER-IN-LAW

LIBRARIAN CHAE SEORIN

83
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,250
Go on. There are more.

84
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,626
Correct.

85
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,879
All right.

86
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:41,299
In 2022.

87
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,259
Professor Gu Gangmo.

88
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,388
In 2023.

89
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,974
Voice phishing.

90
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,517
"VOICE PHISHING OFFENDER, LEE OKKYU"

91
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,312
Kim Seokran.

92
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,731
PROFESSOR GU GANGMO'S MOTHER

93
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:07,533
From 1958 to 2023.

94
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,703
Do you think
there really is a serial killer...

95
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,664
who murdered them all?

96
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:15,917
There's a pattern.

97
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,594
These were related to Lee Mokdan.

98
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,642
These were related to Junghyeon Capital.

99
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,773
Professor Gu Gangmo.

100
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,650
And...

101
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,071
Gu Sanyeong.

102
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,199
Gu Sanyeong.

103
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:54,789
I saw Sanyeong and Professor Yeom
having a big argument.

104
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:00,086
Apparently, his family made
a big fortune by murdering a child

105
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,631
and turning her into a juvenile ghost.

106
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,882
What?

107
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,260
What do you mean?

108
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,929
I've yet to find out the details.

109
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,515
But what if...

110
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:17,311
that juvenile ghost
was related to Lee Mokdan's case?

111
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,021
Then Junghyeon Capital

112
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,234
and the strange deaths
related to Professor Yeom's family...

113
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,236
Don't you think

114
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,864
they are connected like this?

115
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:38,624
- I'll dig into Lee Mokdan's case.
- Okay.

116
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,085
You look into Junghyeon Capital's case.

117
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,087
- Yes, sir.

118
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,714
Also,

119
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,675
you can choose our next case.

120
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:50,761
Right.

121
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,473
Don't skip any meals.

122
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,158
MR. GU GANGMO

OPHTHALMOLOGY IS THE BRANCH OF MEDICINE
FOCUSED ON EYE-RELATED DISEASES...

124
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,043
YEONEUI UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

125
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,045
OPHTHALMOLOGIST BAE HEECHUL

126
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:31,052
Professor Gu suffered
from a rare case of optic atrophy.

127
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:37,975
He visited our hospital in 1999
when the symptoms first emerged.

128
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:42,146
He showed signs of amaurosis fugax,
or temporary loss of vision.

129
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,232
His symptoms...

130
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,442
were just like yours.

131
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,737
You'll see a cross.

132
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,739
Please look at it.

133
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,332
Please relax and look at the screen.

134
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,755
So...

135
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,219
you're saying I have
the same illness as my father?

136
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:14,971
Correct.

137
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,645
What's the cure?

138
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,106
I'm afraid that we haven't found

139
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,608
the cause of this illness.

140
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,528
As of now...

141
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,615
there is no cure.

142
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:38,578
Then...

143
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,041
does this mean
I'll eventually lose my vision?

144
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,296
That's what I told your father.

145
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,757
I told him we had to monitor
the progression of his illness.

146
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,261
But it was highly likely that he would
become blind in a year or two at minimum

147
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,680
or five to six years at maximum.

148
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,353
But...

149
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,023
perhaps I was wrong.

150
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,444
I ran into him on the street

151
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,030
last year.

152
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,114
ONE YEAR AGO

153
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,201
Professor Gu Gangmo?

154
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,164
Hello.

155
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,082
Have you been well?

156
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:28,586
I hadn't seen you for a while,
so I was concerned.

157
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,755
It's been over a decade, right?

158
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,639
By the way, are your eyes okay now?

159
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,767
Yes.

160
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,239
This illness has a big
hereditary, genetic component.

161
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,284
I hope your condition will improve

162
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,329
just as it did for your father.

163
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:29,480
I'm sorry. I had no choice.

164
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,483
You chose the evil spirit

165
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,945
because that was the only way
to recover your vision?

166
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,614
Must I...

167
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,075
do the same thing

168
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,369
as you did, Dad?

169
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:47,540
FOR LEASE

170
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,917
You found a decent place.
It's the right size.

171
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,212
Where have you been?

172
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,423
It's not a bad spot either.

173
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,050
It's near the subway station,
so there will be enough foot traffic.

174
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,927
But there's a shopping mall
ten minutes from here,

175
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,138
so opening a clothing store
may not be the best option.

176
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,931
I said where have you been?

177
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,850
What about a café instead?

178
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,562
- What?
- Most of the cafés nearby

179
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,981
are franchises.

180
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,899
So their coffee is a bit expensive.

181
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:17,445
What if we sell cheaper coffee to-go?

182
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:19,947
Coffee to-go?

183
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,285
You wanted to study
and get barista certification.

184
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,457
This is the closest barista
academy from here.

185
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,918
I already signed up under your name.

186
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,546
Jeez. When did you do all this?

187
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,009
Can you please tell me
where you've been all this time?

188
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,470
Hwawonjae.

189
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,722
What? Your dad's place?

190
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,850
Have you gone insane?

191
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,602
I never wanted you to live there.

192
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,854
I only accepted the inheritance
so I could sell it!

193
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,273
I already put it on the market.

194
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:58,068
But I want to stay there for a while
before it gets sold.

195
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:01,280
I already told you
about what happened there.

196
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,699
I know how much pain
that house has caused you.

197
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,328
But I grew up

198
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,456
in that house.

199
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,251
My memory is vague,

200
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:17,505
but I want to remember my childhood.

201
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,006
Even still--

202
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,300
There's so much to fix around the house.

203
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,428
Wouldn't it be better to fix it up
and sell it at a higher price?

204
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,225
I don't care about selling it
at a higher price.

205
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,520
I'm just worried about you.
You're all I...

206
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,983
Mom, don't worry.

207
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,736
I'll return home soon.

208
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,580
Why do you keep calling me?
You're such a bother.

209
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,165
Bbaekse.

210
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,792
What's wrong with you?

211
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,752
You said I was annoying.

212
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,296
That was...

213
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,092
I'll explain everything later.

214
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,304
Get in first. We need to go somewhere.

215
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,352
What's this? Did you rent a car?

216
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,938
Are you insane?
It must've been so expensive.

217
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,773
I bought it secondhand.

218
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,359
Have you really gone insane?

219
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,944
Maybe.

220
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,572
I've always wanted

221
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,740
to drive my own car.

222
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:29,618
Get in.

223
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,302
Is this really yours?

224
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,013
This is your house?

225
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,723
Yes.

226
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,225
Sanyeong, I'm so happy for you!

227
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,944
This still doesn't mean I forgive you.

228
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,112
Okay.

229
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,119
Say hello.

230
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,539
That's my dad and my grandmother.

231
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,880
I would've dressed up more
had you told me beforehand.

232
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,215
Hello.

233
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,217
I'm Ggu's... I mean...

234
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,221
I'm Sanyeong's friend, Baek Semi.

235
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,265
It's nice to meet you.

236
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,143
Now let's go.

237
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:37,937
Go where?

238
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,733
We should celebrate you passing
the civil service exam.

239
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,277
Hey!

240
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,696
What's all this?

241
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,578
You really hit the jackpot.

242
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,998
What a great house.

243
00:15:58,874 --> 00:15:59,875
Let's clink our glasses.

244
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,922
Sure. We must drink
to commemorate the occasion.

245
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,173
Baek Semi.

246
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,509
I sincerely congratulate you

247
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,220
on passing the civil service exam.

248
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,306
Thanks.

249
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,602
But this doesn't mean
I've completely forgiven you.

250
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,771
Okay.

251
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:26,694
So tell me.

252
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,989
What got into you that day?

253
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:34,868
I'm sorry.

254
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,706
To be honest...

255
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,517
I've...

256
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,062
been possessed by a ghost.

257
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,940
It's a heinous evil spirit.

258
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,526
And it has killed two people already.

259
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:12,406
But I need this evil spirit.

260
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,328
What should I do?

261
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,208
Look at you.

262
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:27,713
That was very original.
It was all because of an evil spirit?

263
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,968
Even I couldn't believe it at first.
I wouldn't expect you to either.

264
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,386
So tell me.

265
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,014
Did that evil spirit tell you
to seduce Hongsae?

266
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,101
What?

267
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:46,065
I gave you the chance to come clean,
but you still won't do it.

268
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:51,737
You sat next to him and smiled like this.

269
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,114
Then you leaned on his shoulder
and whispered into his ear.

270
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,576
That was the most unforgivable thing
you did that day.

271
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,536
- That?
- Yes.

272
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,164
Why was that the most unforgivable thing?

273
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,541
Because he was my first love.

274
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,420
Don't tell me
you really have feelings for him.

275
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,090
What's going on between you two?

276
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:13,967
Are you guys dating?

277
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,761
Should we?

278
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,473
I've never been
in a decent relationship before.

279
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,600
Do you really want to die?

280
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,228
No, I guess I shouldn't date him
if I want to live.

281
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,271
Stop teasing me!

282
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,023
Look me in the eye and tell me the truth.

283
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,526
You cut the nonsense!

284
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,777
Just drink.

285
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,237
You confessed your feelings to him.

286
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,738
Just drink already.

287
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,281
Does he like you too?

288
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,867
Is that why he took the jacket
and went after you?

289
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,202
Just drink.

290
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,121
Did you guys go elsewhere
afterward?

291
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,082
You did. Didn't you?

292
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,543
You did. Right?

293
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,586
Darn it.

294
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,496
You're right.

295
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,629
I...

296
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,719
want you.

297
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,699
What do you need me to do?

298
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,633
What do you want?

299
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:57,858
BLACK GENERAL OF THE NORTH

300
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:23,675
SOUTH

301
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,808
He needed to find five objects

302
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,312
and identify the evil spirit.

303
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:38,023
That's all he told me.

304
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,913
GENERAL

305
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,917
I need to meet with Professor Gu.

306
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,130
I'm going to get rid of...

307
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,842
the evil spirit...

308
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,262
that my grandfather and father created.

309
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,099
JUNG HEONKI DOCUMENT APPRAISAL CENTER

310
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,691
Burning incense again?

311
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,527
Is it someone's death anniversary?

312
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,362
Jeez, you reek of cooked meat.

313
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,115
Can you smell it?

314
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:31,034
- What meat?
- You had thin pork belly.

315
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:33,995
Look at you. You still got it.

316
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:37,582
Long time no see.

317
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,918
We last met at Gyechul's funeral.

318
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:43,713
He always loved alcohol and women.

319
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,966
And always investigating
the Odaeyang case...

320
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,717
Detectives have such vain lives.

321
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,720
Enough chit-chat.
Let me see what you brought.

322
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,431
Right. Here.

323
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,435
A massage chair?

324
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,815
- Does this work?

325
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:05,527
It does.

326
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,407
Is this from 1958?

327
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,368
This won't be easy.

328
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,871
Come on. You're a pro.

329
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,290
We didn't always have it easy.

330
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,209
Put your heart into it
like the good old days.

331
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,177
Here he comes.

332
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,263
Here comes the ace of the Cold Case team.

333
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,854
We're not open yet.

334
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,731
Mr. Choi Jinho?

335
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,275
Hello, sir.

336
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,069
I'm a detective of Violent Crimes
at Seoul Metropolitan Police.

337
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,615
In 1983,

338
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:54,451
your father,
the owner of Taejang Construction,

339
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:57,454
was found dead in his own house.

340
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:02,042
You were the sole witness.

341
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:06,963
Could you explain what happened?

342
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:12,010
You didn't listen to me back then
when I pleaded with you guys.

343
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,846
And now you want to talk
after decades have passed?

344
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:17,474
What do you mean?

345
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:20,060
My father didn't commit suicide.

346
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,855
He died because of Yeom Jaewoo,
the CEO of Junghyeon Capital.

347
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:27,025
We have Yeom Jaewoo cornered.

348
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,569
It's only a matter of time
until he surrenders.

349
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,280
Don't worry.

350
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,038
Can you get that, Jinho?

351
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,049
Who are you?

352
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:52,801
Mr. Yeom Jaewoo?

353
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,901
What's wrong?

354
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,821
It's not me.

355
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,908
- Dad.
- No!

356
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:18,910
Dad.

357
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,870
Dad!

358
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,456
Dad!

359
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,667
Dad, no!

360
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,753
No one believed me.

361
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,632
Because there were no traces
of Yeom Jaewoo anywhere.

362
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,302
Not even on the CCTV footage.

363
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,262
Let me get this straight.

364
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,264
Are you saying

365
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:44,436
that your father died against his own will
due to an unknown entity?

366
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,520
Correct.

367
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:49,024
I know it sounds absurd,
but it's the truth.

368
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:52,444
I witnessed it with my own eyes.

369
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,832
I see. Thank you.

370
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,226
Excuse me.

371
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:28,438
Is this your only painting
of the realm of hungry ghosts?

372
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,065
Yes, that's correct.

373
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,370
- Hello?
-  Do you remember me?

374
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,748
I'm the village head of Baekchagol.

375
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,042
Hello, sir. How have you been?

376
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:51,294
I've been doing well.

377
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,505
But can you come down here?

378
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:56,841
Hey.

379
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,887
-  Oh, dear.
-  Hey.

380
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,057
Professor Yeom! Professor Yeom!

381
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,559
Wake up, Professor Yeom!
Professor Yeom!

382
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:09,354
I didn't know whom to call.

383
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,481
Then I thought of you.

384
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,901
Why don't you call his family?

385
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,236
I already did.

386
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,279
A strange, old lady picked up.

387
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:21,616
She said she couldn't care less
if he died.

388
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,747
Why don't you eat some of this?

389
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,463
Here. Please?

390
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,513
Goodness, he's out of it.

391
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:46,057
He needs to eat.

392
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,393
Goodness, what do we do?

393
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,110
No!

394
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,866
You opened the door.

395
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,632
You're the one who killed me.

396
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,346
The porridge has gone cold.

397
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,557
I'll reheat it.

398
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,435
Goodness.

399
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,366
What took you so long?

400
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,743
Have you been well?

401
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,453
Follow me.

402
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:59,297
The doctor said nothing was wrong,
but he's been like that ever since.

403
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,219
What's wrong with the wallpaper?

404
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,470
What do you mean?

405
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:07,680
There's nothing wrong with it.

406
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:12,560
I think...

407
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,688
it's spreading.

408
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:19,484
Can you not see that?

409
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:23,613
Don't bother. He can't see it.

410
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,282
I should get going.

411
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,494
Well...

412
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,498
It looks like it won't be long now.

413
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,834
What are you talking about?

414
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,136
Excuse me for a minute.

415
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,060
Ma'am.

416
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,729
What did you mean?

417
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,023
What did you mean by "it won't be long"?

418
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,568
You saw that thing back there.

419
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,362
I did. What is that?

420
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,655
A ghost.

421
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,158
A ghost?

422
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:11,911
That's a ghost? That can't be.

423
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:15,039
I didn't even see it with a mirror.

424
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,125
Believe it or not, it's a ghost.

425
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,334
It's the spirit of darkness.

426
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,295
The spirit of darkness?

427
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,338
Stare into the darkness for too long,

428
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:23,965
and it'll grow bigger.

429
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,510
Eventually, you'll be engulfed
by the darkness.

430
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,390
What do you mean?

431
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,726
Are you saying he'll die?

432
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,728
He let my daughter die.

433
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:40,315
And now, he'll meet the same fate.

434
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,613
How can I stop it?

435
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:50,033
How could you do nothing
when you know he'll die?

436
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,163
I don't know how to stop it.

437
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,248
Even if I did,
I wouldn't want to save him.

438
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,254
The night is approaching.

439
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,352
Professor Yeom.

440
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,395
Professor Yeom.

441
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:22,690
Professor Yeom.

442
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:25,693
Professor Yeom.

443
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:28,821
Please take care of him.
I'll get you something to drink.

444
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,617
Let's go.

445
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:37,080
Professor Yeom, wake up.

446
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,665
Can you not hear me?

447
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,055
If historiography mainly focuses on

448
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:57,475
the history of palaces
and the ruling class,

449
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:01,646
folklore focuses on the lives and culture

450
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:05,608
of our actual ancestors
and the people outside of the palace.

451
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,485
We study what kinds of food we ate...

452
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,904
-  I think he's crazy.
- ...what games we enjoyed...

453
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:12,991
- Are you nuts? He's going to hear you.
- ...what we believed in...

454
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,159
-  He can see ghosts.
- ...and what we feared.

455
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,620
You all killed me.

456
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:52,822
Darkness.

457
00:33:58,619 --> 00:33:59,871
Darkness.

458
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,165
Darkness.

459
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,168
The opposite of darkness.

460
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,466
The opposite of darkness.

461
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,386
Sir!

462
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:16,637
Yes?

463
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,098
Look.

464
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,768
I need to move him.

465
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,519
Can you help?

466
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:36,949
Professor Yeom.

467
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,648
You all killed me.

468
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,427
Professor Yeom.

469
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:40,638
Professor Yeom.

470
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,683
Wake up, Professor Yeom!

471
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,445
My mom was heading east.

472
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,698
East. Where the sun rises.

473
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,658
A place ghosts avoid.

474
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,371
No.

475
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,042
No...

476
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,462
Not you!

477
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,631
Not...

478
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,384
you!

479
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,825
I despise you.

480
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:15,162
I understand...

481
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,627
that it wasn't your fault.

482
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,298
But I just can't forgive you.

483
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,222
But you see,

484
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,891
I saw them...

485
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,937
on my way here from Baekchagol.

486
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,419
I was petrified.

487
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,630
I was afraid.

488
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,216
And I was sad.

489
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,471
"So this is what he sees every day."

490
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,682
Perhaps,

491
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,185
this is how

492
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,189
you've been atoning

493
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,525
for your family's evil deed.

494
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,238
I thought I deserved to die.

495
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:36,368
But while I was tormented
by that illusion,

496
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:39,955
all I wanted to do was live.

497
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,461
And that's when you took my hand.

498
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,342
Thank you.

499
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,440
Did you buy a car?

500
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:11,612
Yes.

501
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:28,754
Professor Yeom.

502
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,217
The evil spirit

503
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,636
keeps directing me to this photo.

504
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:38,597
At first, I thought it was pointing
to the hungry ghost, but it wasn't.

505
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,559
I think it was pointing to this temple.

506
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:45,271
He was your friend, right?

507
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,900
Do you recognize the temple?

508
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:52,778
Why do you have this?

509
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,490
This photo should've been
at my grandparents' house.

510
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,537
I'm not sure.

511
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,372
I found it in one of the drawers

512
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:06,166
of my grandmother's vanity in Hwawonjae.

513
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:11,297
"CEO."

514
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,590
HEMAEM
CEO CHEON ILMAN

515
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,426
Goodness, what's all this?

516
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:23,475
What's this?

517
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:25,644
What?

518
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,453
Gosh.

519
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,039
- Goodness.
- Did you find it?

520
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,041
You bet.

521
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,459
Don't you know who I am?

522
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,961
I'm the Violent Crimes team leader
of Geumcheon Police Station,

523
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,546
Cheon Ilman.

524
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:56,175
Jeez, that's rich
coming from someone who got sacked.

525
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,426
Come on.

526
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:00,095
How many times must I tell you
that's not what went down?

527
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:02,765
I just took the blame
for what my subordinates...

528
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,475
Forget it. I'm done.

529
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:11,523
I worked like a dog all day
to find someone who died decades ago.

530
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:13,859
"Jangjin-ri?"

531
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,653
I can't find that place anywhere!

532
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:18,489
I thought it was
some place in North Korea.

533
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:22,242
I thought I had to defect
to North Korea because of you.

534
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,245
Looks like you are taking
great care of your body

535
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:27,039
despite your business not doing well.

536
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:29,375
Fine. Thank you for your work,
team leader...

537
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,584
I mean, Mr. CEO.

538
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:33,087
- Forget it. Whatever.
-  Give that to me.

539
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,380
Don't be impudent.

540
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,007
You used to wash my socks
during night duty back in the day.

541
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:40,094
Give that to me. One, two...

542
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:41,804
Here.

543
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:47,768
From the way I see it, that belonged
to the village head of Jangjin-ri

544
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:51,522
who lived there in 1958.

545
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:55,609
He had dementia and was hospitalized
at a convalescent hospital in Seoul

546
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,821
and passed away in 1999.

547
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:02,157
Hold on.
The guardian's name was Gu Gangmo?

548
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:04,159
He didn't have
any immediate family members.

549
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:06,912
I believe that was an acquaintance of his.

550
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:08,831
"RECIPIENT GU GANGMO
JEONGUN CONVALESCENT HOSPITAL"

551
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:11,917
These were his belongings.

552
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:16,463
There were also valuables that he asked us
to store when he came here.

553
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:18,549
Thank you for everything.

554
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,092
You can sign there.

555
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:27,599
What?

556
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:29,810
You look pretty confused. What's wrong?

557
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,145
Is something the matter?

558
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,151
APPRAISER JUNG HEONKI

559
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,736
The restoration is complete.

560
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,280
I couldn't restore everything though.
Please come and check.

561
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,158
Good work.

562
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,870
I'll wire you the money.

563
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,371
Okay. Thanks.

564
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,498
Munchun, hold on.

565
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,459
You don't know my bank account number.

566
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:58,464
I'll write it down here.

567
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:02,676
I like this. Let me take a few.

568
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:04,928
-  Thanks.
- Wait.

569
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,972
Munchun, wait up!

570
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:16,732
Mr. Jin Joyoung?

571
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:21,445
Hello. I'm Lee Hongsae, your junior.

572
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:31,580
The unnatural death case

573
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:34,082
of Prosecutor Lee Taekhee in 1979.

574
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:36,543
I remember it.

575
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:39,713
It's been decades.
Do you still remember it?

576
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:41,757
It was such a strange case.

577
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:45,260
You know what happened
before coming here, right?

578
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,722
Yes, he jumped from his apartment building
where he had been living alone.

579
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,433
What was so strange about the case?

580
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:54,311
Did you detect anything suspicious?

581
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,647
Prosecutor Lee

582
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,817
was a very tidy man.

583
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,320
There wasn't a single speck
of dust when we got there.

584
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,404
"FINGERPRINT IDENTIFICATION RESULT"

585
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:05,739
But we found

586
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:09,076
a bunch of strange fingerprints
at the scene.

587
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:10,953
Did they belong

588
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:14,081
to Yeom Jaewoo,
the CEO of Junghyeon Capital?

589
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,084
How did you know that?

590
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:22,589
But CEO Yeom had attended
an event outside the city that day.

591
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,217
There were more than 100 witnesses.

592
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,802
And he never once visited

593
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:30,722
Prosecutor Lee's house.

594
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:34,059
In the end,

595
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,145
we concluded that there was an error
during the investigation

596
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:38,230
and closed the case.

597
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,900
Hello, sir.

598
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,571
I looked into the cases related
to Junghyeon Capital as you suggested.

599
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,073
I found many similarities

600
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:50,117
to the voice phishing
and aquarium store cases.

601
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,119
All right.

602
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,162
Let's talk at the office.

603
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:55,873
Okay, I'll head there right now.

604
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:01,169
-  Heonki, thanks a lot.
- Yes?

605
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:03,422
I'm sure it wasn't easy.

606
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:07,718
I'll wire you the money.

607
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,599
He's worse than Gyechul ever was.

608
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:16,727
Jeez, at least ask for my bank account.

609
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,523
Hey, I snatched these
from Ilman's office. They're good.

610
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,822
He was my only friend.

611
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:32,910
I knew he was possessed by a hungry ghost,
but I couldn't tell him right away.

612
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,829
I was afraid of losing another friend

613
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:38,206
who thought I was crazy.

614
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:42,127
YEAR 1999

615
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:57,225
Wait. That belonged to the late Mr. Yeom.

616
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:07,194
Kim Ujin!

617
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,992
- Are you okay?
-  Yes.

618
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:17,287
Ujin has

619
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,164
your late father's belonging.

620
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:24,628
I told him to get it for me.

621
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:26,630
Sorry?

622
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:31,385
What are you doing?
Let's go since you got the camera.

623
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,235
This is a strange drawing.

624
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,862
But is this really
why you brought me here?

625
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:53,115
I heard two students died...

626
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:56,702
at your school.

627
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:00,622
It wasn't your fault.
You're just possessed by a ghost.

628
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:05,377
What are you talking about? A ghost?

629
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,380
And I have nothing to do
with their deaths.

630
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,551
I've been reading some books and studying.

631
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:14,678
The hungry ghost in the painting.

632
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:17,556
That's the ghost that has possessed you.

633
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:18,807
That's enough.

634
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,308
Get this film developed.

635
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:22,185
Your eyes will look red in the photo.

636
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:24,730
I told you to stop.

637
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,606
I think there is a way to help you.

638
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:30,235
This temple will be holding a ceremony
to appease the hungry ghosts...

639
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,905
I told you that's enough. Okay?

640
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,994
Not too long after,

641
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:42,080
Ujin attempted suicide
by running into a moving vehicle.

642
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:46,793
And he passed away in the ICU.

643
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,924
I clearly remember

644
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:55,260
putting that camera back
in my father's study.

645
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:58,847
So why did Professor Gu
have it in his house?

646
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:05,353
And why did the evil spirit...

647
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,900
lead us here?

648
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:16,656
Maybe it's related to my dad.

649
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:19,659
Just like Jangjin-ri and Baekchagol.

650
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:26,041
What is this?

651
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:28,376
These are cases similar to your mother's.

652
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:32,756
They're about those who committed suicide
with red bruises on their wrists.

653
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,342
In 2000, Professor Gu Gangmo's colleague,

654
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,969
his mother-in-law, and even his student

655
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:41,306
died one after another.

656
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:44,768
The North Gyeonggi reservoir suicide case.

657
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,898
25TH LIBERATION CEREMONY AT SEOKIMSA

658
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:51,983
SEOKIM RESERVOIR
BEHIND DAEUNGJEON

659
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:54,236
An acquaintance of Professor Gu

660
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:56,696
passed away somewhere nearby.

661
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,573
What do you mean?

662
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:01,576
"Only the energy of a person
who was killed may suppress

663
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:03,537
the object containing
a loose-haired evil spirit's energy."

664
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:04,621
Do you remember?

665
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,290
My dad wrote that in his thesis.

666
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:11,503
"The energy of a person who was killed."

667
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:14,464
It's the location where someone died
because of an evil spirit.

668
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,467
We can suppress the evil spirit's energy

669
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,971
if we seal an object related to it there.

670
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:24,307
An object related to the evil spirit

671
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:26,518
could be buried nearby.

672
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,360
It's him.

673
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:39,990
He visited last year
and donated a flowering tree.

674
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:43,201
Where did you plant the tree?

675
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:46,163
Our temple owns a reservoir nearby

676
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,415
where we hold liberation ceremonies.

677
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:50,917
He planted it there himself.

678
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:55,380
Which tree is it?
How can we find it?

679
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,341
Professor Yeom.

680
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:11,897
Let me get a shovel.

681
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,592
Professor Yeom, hold on.

682
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:07,285
A red hair accessory,
a blue pottery piece, a black rubber band,

683
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,996
a jade hairpin, and a glass bottle.

684
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:12,791
A jade hairpin and a glass bottle?

685
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:15,627
Professor Gu Gangmo said that...

686
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:18,964
five objects must be found,
and the evil spirit must be identified.

687
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:34,521
LEE MOKDAN

688
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:52,038
Both my mother and Professor Gu

689
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:54,958
wanted to get rid of the evil spirit
by sealing the items.

690
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,420
But the evil spirit got to them first.

691
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:04,134
Are you saying

692
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:07,220
my dad passed away while trying
to get rid of the evil spirit?

693
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,346
Correct.

694
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:12,559
We need to look for other locations
that are connected to him.

695
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:16,438
We need to find a jade hairpin
and a glass bottle.

696
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:18,023
But why did he fail?

697
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:24,237
Your mother

698
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:26,614
and my dad

699
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,367
both failed to get rid of the evil spirit.

700
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:32,412
They knew the five items
and even the evil spirit's name.

701
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:34,205
So why did they fail?

702
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:36,624
They must've left something out.

703
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,544
Let's look for the other two items first.

704
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:41,629
Then we'll be able to find out
why they failed.

705
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,801
Detective Seo, I'm--

706
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:50,138
What took you so long?
I called several times.

707
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:52,891
Where are you?
I have several questions for you.

708
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:55,810
I've restored the report

709
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:58,980
on Lee Mokdan's case,
so let's meet up and talk.

710
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:01,441
Okay, I'll come over right now.

711
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:12,535
Ms. Sanyeong?

712
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,872
FAMILY REGISTER

713
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:18,416
She wasn't the secondborn.

714
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:20,543
Where should I pull over?

715
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:23,421
Are we already here?

716
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,840
- You can pull up right here.
-  Okay.

717
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:42,857
Are you okay?

718
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:45,360
What's the matter?

719
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,155
It...

720
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,741
It's happening again.

721
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,538
There will be another victim.

722
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,256
Seoul.

723
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,051
Police station.

724
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:11,386
There was...

725
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,722
"Violent Crimes Investigation Division"
written on the building.

726
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,810
Why didn't they turn off
the light before leaving?

727
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:00,810
Professor Yeom.

728
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,270
Detective Seo, where are you?

729
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:03,605
At the police station.

730
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:05,064
I'm waiting for you.

731
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,526
Don't open the door.

732
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,988
You must never open it.

733
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:14,240
What? What do you mean?

734
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,701
Don't open the door
even if someone knocks.

735
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:19,454
You must

736
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:21,206
never open the door...

737
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:24,375
until I get there.

738
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:26,711
What is he on about?

739
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:30,507
I don't know what you're talking about.

740
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:34,135
But I just need
to keep the door shut, right?

741
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:36,054
- Correct. I'll be there soon.
- What?

742
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,138
- Hello?

743
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:40,183
He hung up first again.

744
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,197
Who is it?

745
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:03,665
Who is it?

746
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:09,629
Who...

747
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:12,632
Who is it?

748
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,931
You almost gave me a heart attack.

749
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:21,182
Why are you so startled?

750
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:24,018
Why would you fling open the door?

751
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:25,311
What?

752
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,146
Never mind. Just shut the door behind you.

753
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:30,984
No.

754
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,194
Better yet, lock it.

755
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:34,779
Lock the door?

756
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:37,282
Yes, do it right now.

757
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:43,371
I didn't see who the victim was.

758
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:44,831
It may not be him.

759
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:53,256
Hold on.

760
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,092
I think someone's outside.

761
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,436
Shouldn't we open the door?

762
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,396
Just give me a minute.

763
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:31,628
It's me, Yeom Haesang.

764
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,176
Jeez.

765
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,929
Seeing how superstitious I've become,
it's about time I retired.

766
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:44,140
Should I open it?

767
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,892
Yes, we agreed to meet here.

768
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:00,073
You opened...

769
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:03,910
the door.

770
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:11,459
REVENANT

771
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:34,482
When did I come here?

772
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:35,566
Do you not remember?

773
01:01:35,566 --> 01:01:38,403
I'm starting to remember less and less.

774
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:40,279
- What did you see this time?

775
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:41,864
I couldn't see anything.

776
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:43,408
She was ripping a book?

777
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:46,202
A weakness that the evil spirit
doesn't want anyone to know about.

778
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:48,287
That book contains a secret.

779
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:50,498
What did I do this time?

780
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:53,710
I'm going to get rid
of that evil spirit inside you

781
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:54,919
at all costs.
