REVENANT

00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:49,215
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,967
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
IN SAFE SITUATIONS

00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:54,679
EPISODE 6

5
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,378
Are you all right?

6
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,886
Is this the only place
you could think of coming to?

7
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,554
It's freezing.

8
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,101
What is this?

9
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,396
Is this jacket mine?

10
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,899
It's not mine, is it?

11
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,489
Did you turn yourself in earlier?

12
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,119
What did I say?

13
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,289
I...

14
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,625
killed...

15
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,586
all of those people.

16
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,838
I said that?

17
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,340
Yes.

18
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:36,925
That was...

19
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,344
I mean...

20
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,348
I didn't mean that.

21
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,558
That's what I think too.

22
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,478
You're the type to cuss out the scammer

23
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:52,273
even if you lose all your money
to voice phishing.

24
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,568
You don't seem to be
the type to murder someone over it.

25
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,820
But you see...

26
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,907
If you really did such a thing,

27
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,326
come to me.

28
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,455
- Sorry?
-  We're not strangers.

29
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:10,041
I'll write up a nice report,
so just come to me.

30
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,217
What if I told you...

31
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,265
that it was a ghost who did it?

32
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,185
Would you believe me?

33
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:30,979
What?

34
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,566
I know you won't believe me.

35
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:38,820
But it's true.

36
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,323
I should go.

37
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,243
Thank you for bringing me this jacket.

00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:13,187
What is this?

41
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,982
PROFESSOR JANG WONSEOK CALLING...

42
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,114
Professor Jang,
sorry for calling so late at night.

43
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,575
I found a Line of Prohibition
with a small blade inside.

44
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,993
By a small blade,

45
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,620
do you mean a Line of Prohibition
from the South Gyeongsang region?

46
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,582
They're incredibly rare.
How did you come across one?

47
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,251
I can't explain everything over the phone.

48
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,422
But I'm looking
for the person who made it.

49
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,467
Someone who'd make a Line of Prohibition...

50
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,761
They must be involved in shamanism.

51
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,929
Perhaps a shaman or one
that specializes in reciting scriptures.

52
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,474
I'll look into it and call you back.

53
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,059
Thank you.

54
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,038
Young Master Yeom is here.

55
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:38,356
YEAR 1995

56
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,791
I didn't know you were coming.

57
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,627
Is Grandmother still awake?

58
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:00,837
She's in the study.

59
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,338
Are you here to see her?

60
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,715
- Yes.
- How are you doing?

61
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:05,800
Good.

62
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,427
How do you find your house?

63
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,679
Should I look for a bigger place?

64
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,558
I can manage on my own.
There's no need to be concerned.

65
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,477
How can I not be
when you're the sole heir?

66
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,813
She worries a lot about you too.

67
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,606
She worries...

68
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,527
about me?

69
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,780
She may still look healthy on the outside,
but she has aged.

70
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,992
Why don't you just come back
to the company?

71
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:35,121
You know this already.
I'm not interested in our family business.

72
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,277
Just get to the point.

73
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,113
Don't just glance at me
like a sick dog would.

74
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,041
My mom was burying strange objects

75
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,628
before she passed away.

76
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,175
Is this about
the red hair accessory again?

77
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,552
I already told you.

78
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:35,348
They didn't find such things
where she died.

79
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:39,769
Why did she take me to that place?

80
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:44,565
Why did my mom pass away?

81
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,660
Why are you asking me?

82
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,455
You were the one who was with her.

83
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,669
I've been seeing weird things ever since.

84
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,881
I could only see them
in the mirror at first.

85
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,509
But now I can see them without it.

86
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,053
I'm terrified.

87
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,513
Shut up.

88
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,894
Do you want to be admitted
to a psychiatric hospital?

89
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,523
Don't you dare utter such things
ever again.

90
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,175
-  Come in.

91
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,431
Young Master Yeom is here.

92
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,573
Have you been well?

93
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:23,331
I'm sure you didn't crawl back here
just to ask me that.

94
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,918
Tell me. Why are you here?

95
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,632
This.

96
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,010
It's something my mother had.

97
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,805
I was too young back then

98
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,892
to remember exactly where she buried it.

99
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,811
But she buried
this piece of pottery before she died.

100
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,605
And this.

101
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:51,400
She had this hair accessory with her
until the moment she died.

102
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,736
Are you sure you don't know...

103
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,030
anything about them?

104
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,450
Get out.

105
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,041
I said get out of my house this instant.

106
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,463
The guest is leaving!

107
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,344
Don't just stand there.
Take him out of here.

108
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:26,477
What did you say to her
to make her so enraged?

109
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:29,855
Why does she become so upset
whenever I bring up my mother?

110
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,442
This won't do.

111
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,945
I need to ask her again.

112
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,405
It's best...

113
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,326
that you just leave today.
You know her temper.

114
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,292
Are you coming
on Ujin's death anniversary?

115
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,088
You can meet her then and ask.

116
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,719
Okay.

117
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,887
It's chilly. You should go inside.

118
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,296
COMMERCIAL LEASE AGREEMENT

119
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,715
20 MILLION WON
2 MILLION WON...

120
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:24,220
- Goodness, when did you come home?

121
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,263
Look at you.

122
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,641
-  Is that makeup? This hair...
- What is this?

123
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,643
Where did you get these clothes?

124
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,061
What is this?

125
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,938
Well...

126
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,107
I leased a small clothing store
near the subway station.

127
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,901
What? Where did you get the money?

128
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,654
I took your grandmother's inheritance.

129
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,782
I also didn't want to accept
anything from her family.

130
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:48,619
But it'd be weird not to take it
when she offered.

131
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,748
Plus, your dad never paid child support
the entire time I raised you.

132
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,167
We're entitled to this money.

133
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,669
KIM SEOKRAN
298,230,100 WON

134
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,090
Sanyeong? What brings you here?

135
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,355
Look.

136
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,066
Her house
and the money in this bank account

137
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,818
amount to 1.3 billion won.

138
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,613
We don't need to suffer anymore
with this amount of money.

139
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,949
Like you said, we can--

140
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,326
Can you please stop?

141
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,094
Do you want me to kill her?

142
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,852
Gosh, hey--

143
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,022
Sanyeong. Hey.

144
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,775
Sanyeong, is this something
to be that upset about?

145
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,862
- What's wrong?

146
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,240
- I did this for us.

147
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,992
- Sanyeong.

148
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:13,287
- Gu Sanyeong.

149
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,831
Sanyeong, open the door. Let's talk.

150
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,459
What are you doing?

151
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:22,504
I did this so you wouldn't suffer.
That's why I accepted it.

152
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,092
Sanyeong, let's talk.

153
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,429
Sanyeong.

154
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,974
-  Sanyeong.

155
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,352
- Gu Sanyeong.

156
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,625
BRIGHT COLORS FOR SWEATERS!
CREATIVE PRINTS!

157
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,965
DONGSEONG BANK
SAVINGS ACCOUNT

158
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,347
It was my mother who had
these objects in her possession first.

159
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,890
She buried them somewhere

160
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,352
before she passed away
at the bed and breakfast in 1995.

161
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,523
She wanted to get rid of the evil spirit.

162
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,691
That was it.

163
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,863
This was how she could get rid of it.

164
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:17,865
Okay.

165
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,535
The pear seed hair accessory
and the pottery piece

166
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,829
had something to do with a young girl.

167
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:27,416
They probably belonged to Lee Mokdan
who became a juvenile ghost.

168
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,834
I need to seal them...

169
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,797
with a Line of Prohibition in a place
where the evil spirit killed someone.

170
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,757
That's just your assumption.

171
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,426
And didn't you say Professor Gu Gangmo...

172
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,511
was possessed?

173
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,388
Do you seriously believe what he wrote?

174
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,725
He was the one
who knew the most about evil spirits.

175
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,896
I'm more curious

176
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,981
about his will and letter.

177
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,858
Why did the evil spirit
drag you into this?

178
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,485
Getting rid of the evil spirit
is more important than that.

179
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,072
Haesang, you should stop here.

180
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,908
Or you could also meet your mother's fate.

181
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,996
I have finally uncovered a lead.

182
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,916
I can't stop now.

183
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,484
Professor Yeom.

184
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,081
Is this mine?

185
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,458
I'm so sorry.

186
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,751
When did you take it?

187
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,467
SUNGUN DEPARTMENT STORE
MIRIEL SALON

188
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,636
You spent this much money?

189
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,191
This is the five million you lent me

190
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,235
and the money I spent yesterday.

191
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,659
I added the interest too.

192
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,536
Where did you get this money?

193
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,663
What happened yesterday?

194
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,250
Actually...

195
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,548
Nothing. Nothing happened.

196
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,807
She's definitely hiding something.

197
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,560
Where are you going?

198
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,021
I need to know
what happened to her yesterday.

199
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,815
But you don't even know where she was.

200
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,276
I'll trace her steps
with the credit card details.

201
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,069
Did you see my dad yesterday

202
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:02,779
when you visited the house?

203
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,575
How is he?

204
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,035
If you're so worried,

205
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,537
you should visit him yourself.

206
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,833
I told you I didn't want to go there.

207
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,962
Did you call for me, ma'am?

208
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,798
Look into Haesang.

209
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:26,136
- Ma'am?
- I want to know what he's up to

210
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:29,097
and whom he's meeting these days.

211
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:52,329
I told them to look
into Young Master Yeom's whereabouts.

212
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,709
What about that detective?

213
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,879
Are they still meeting?

214
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,757
Not often, but they're still
maintaining a relationship.

215
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,510
Have someone tail that detective.

216
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,095
Yes, sir.

217
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,646
JUNGHYEON CAPITAL
VICE-PRESIDENT KIM CHIWON

218
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,772
Hello.

219
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,190
- Good morning.

220
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,402
VIOLENT CRIMES INVESTIGATION UNIT 4 TEAM 3

221
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,822
Sir, do you know what happened last night?

222
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:33,620
Tell me what happened. Tell me.

223
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:37,582
What was so important
that you put aside what I asked you to do?

224
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,335
- You see--
- Didn't I tell you

225
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,254
to search the storage for a lead?

226
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,922
I did look.

227
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,300
But there was nothing helpful and--

228
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,471
You also left the storage door unlocked
when it wasn't even our precinct.

229
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:56,059
I'm sorry, sir. But it wasn't intentional.

230
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:59,396
I had to rush to a prior engagement.
It was my mistake.

231
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,606
Prior engagement, my foot.

232
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,317
Detectives should always
devote themselves to the job.

233
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,612
Look.

234
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:11,741
I've been doing everything
you wanted me to do.

235
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,953
I've been sleeping here
and working like a dog.

236
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,539
You're being quite heartless
when I was away for just a bit.

237
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,667
What if the culprit had appeared
while you were away?

238
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,170
Is there even a culprit
in this case you're digging into?

239
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,506
Everyone says that it was suicide,
but you're insisting that it was homicide.

240
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,968
Are you talking back to your senior?

241
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,636
No, I'm not.

242
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:34,014
I'm just saying this for your sake.

243
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,308
Do you know what your colleagues call you?

244
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,019
The Rookie Shaman of Violent Crimes.

245
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,562
Hey, watch what you say!

246
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,147
So what if you have
a talented detective like me by your side?

247
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,857
You don't even make proper use of me.

248
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,067
You want me to find a lead in the storage?

249
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,653
- What can I find in that... Let me go.
-  Hey.

250
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,572
What could I possibly find
in that garbage?

251
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,201
Talented detective, my foot.

252
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:57,746
I heard you joined
the Police University as the top student

253
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,456
but graduated at the bottom.

254
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,043
Who said that?

255
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,003
Hey, you loser.

256
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,880
Listen carefully to me.

257
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,425
You couldn't find a lead
because you weren't looking for it.

258
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,803
You should've been as desperate as you are
about getting a promotion.

259
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:16,223
Why are you suddenly
bringing up the promotion?

260
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,557
Just shut up and listen!

261
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:21,728
You're a detective.

262
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:26,066
It's your duty to relieve
dead victims' grudges in their stead.

263
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,653
You need to have that sense of duty.

264
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,154
And I do.

265
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:33,823
Why are you talking about grudges
in this global day and age?

266
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:36,368
It's our job to catch culprits

267
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:40,080
based on objective causal relationships
and let the law punish them.

268
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,793
Good for you, Mr. Global.

269
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,378
Forget it.

270
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:51,007
I'll look for the lead myself.

271
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,179
Good luck with your global cases.

272
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,850
- Sir, don't be so upset.

273
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,562
Take back
all the meal tickets we gave him.

274
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,077
That's...

275
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:20,954
Never mind.

276
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:25,667
Was it you?

277
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,211
What do you mean?

278
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:31,548
Did you tell him that I graduated last
and was desperate for a promotion?

279
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:35,051
Everyone knows about that.

280
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,177
What?

281
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,808
Anyway, it wasn't me.

282
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,811
It really wasn't me.

283
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,571
What's this? A murder case?

284
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,072
Mind your own business.

285
00:26:58,658 --> 00:26:59,743
I was here yesterday.

286
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:02,746
What? Seriously?

287
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,999
Why would I lie to you?
I was at this wine bar yesterday.

288
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,668
She was found last night
in the women's bathroom

289
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,754
on the same floor as the wine bar.

290
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,301
- Cause of death?
- We're waiting for the autopsy result.

291
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,095
But the examiner thinks
it was a sudden death

292
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,597
due to cardiac arrest.

293
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,474
- A sudden death?
- Yes.

294
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,727
- So it wasn't a homicide?
- But there's one strange thing.

295
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,271
- What is it?
-  Look.

296
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:33,777
Someone seems to have dragged her
into the stall.

297
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,570
They tried to hide her?

298
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:37,989
Then it's a homicide.

299
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,574
There's something else.

300
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:42,786
Among the victim's belongings,
an expensive luxury bag disappeared.

301
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,039
Look.

302
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:49,542
This was a limited-edition luxury bag.

303
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:53,213
The bag had the victim's initials, LJR.

304
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,092
Hey.

305
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,927
- Hey.
- What?

306
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,011
So?

307
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:02,347
What do you mean?

308
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,475
You said you were there
at the wine bar yesterday.

309
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,102
Did you spot anything strange?

310
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,064
No, I didn't.

311
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,191
Really?

312
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,609
Really.

313
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:15,735
Darn it.

314
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,115
What could it be?

315
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,618
Here. Good luck.

316
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:25,704
Hey.

317
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,627
I'm the only one
who has uncovered this lead.

318
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,338
I will solve this case.

319
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,898
I want to be alone
for the time being, so don't contact me.

320
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,450
Grandma.

321
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,294
I know I don't deserve this money.

00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,608
felt this way before.

It's urgent. How long will it take?

343
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,512
It won't take long to scan them.

hungry ghosts always covet."

"The realm was created by human desires."

Hungry ghosts?

351
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,204
How pitiful.

361
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:47,843
Copy that.

362
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,552
Excuse me.

363
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,431
This place is off-limits. Please leave.

364
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,391
Haven't we met before?

365
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,227
In Gwangcheon.

366
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,271
Weren't you with Detective Seo Munchun?

367
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,065
Why are you here?

368
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,567
Someone died here, right?

369
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,820
The blood vessels in the deceased's eyes
had probably burst.

370
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,447
Who told you that?

371
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,739
It was a hungry ghost.

372
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,783
- What?
- A ghost.

373
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,413
He's not involved in this case.

374
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,831
You shouldn't have let him in.

375
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,207
- Please escort him out.
- Yes, sir.

376
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:04,128
The possessed individual will continue
to kill until their desires are satiated.

377
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,254
Please leave.

378
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:08,090
This case won't be the last.

379
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,095
He's just as crazy as her.

380
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,390
Sanyeong said the same thing.

381
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:25,941
You don't have any CCTV footage?

382
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:28,110
No, and it's not just our bar.

383
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,904
They took all the footage

384
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,573
from this floor, the hotel entrance,
and the back door.

385
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:35,701
I see. Thank you.

386
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,624
The other detectives don't know yet

387
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:44,627
that the killer was at the wine bar.

388
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:47,004
I still have time.

389
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,355
The crime took place
in the women's restroom.

390
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,608
The estimated time of the crime
is between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m.

391
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:13,614
Usually, men avoid committing crimes
in the women's restroom in that timeframe,

392
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,867
given the high number of people
who come and go.

393
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,412
The killer is likely female.

394
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,804
Gu Sanyeong couldn't have done it.

395
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:41,433
She left early
and wasn't carrying the handbag.

396
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,603
One of them is the killer.

397
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:48,524
This bar was full of random people.

398
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:54,071
An acquaintance wouldn't have picked
such a revealing place.

399
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:58,492
She committed the crime
out of the blue to get the handbag.

400
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,913
She could be naturally impulsive.

401
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:08,544
Or she could have been
under stress recently.

404
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,902
Given the nature of this case,

405
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:36,238
it's highly likely
that she has committed theft before.

406
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,033
I can narrow down the suspects

407
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,327
by looking into previous similar cases.

408
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,662
Sir, are you still here?

409
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:45,539
What about that kid?

410
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:47,791
Come on. He's not a kid.

411
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,210
He's a competent detective.

412
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:53,130
Don't worry about me and just go.

413
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,383
Is that for me?

414
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:00,638
I'll be off then.

415
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,097
- Okay, thanks.
- Bye.

416
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,103
- He's not a kid.

417
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,689
He was a top student
at the Police University.

431
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,860
Even the detectives
couldn't spot the similarities

432
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,279
since these cases occurred
in different precincts.

433
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:43,240
So how did he know?

434
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:48,579
What's this about?

435
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,039
There's something I need to tell you.

436
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:52,666
Is it urgent?

437
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,085
I'm with a guest.

438
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:57,379
- Uh...
- Is that Gu Sanyeong?

439
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,840
What brings you here, Hongsae?

440
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,385
- Do you know each other?
- Yes, we went to the same high school.

441
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,640
I don't mind if she stays.

442
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:12,770
I had something to ask you too.
I was about to call you.

443
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,230
-  This is actually better.
- Let's go upstairs.

444
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:17,399
Okay.

445
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,409
Have a seat.

446
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:41,840
Please continue talking about

447
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,551
those angry or hungry ghosts,
or whatever they're called.

448
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:47,846
Hungry ghosts are just that.
They're hungry.

449
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:49,807
They were also called scrounging ghosts

450
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,892
or begging ghosts.

451
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:56,230
They were so common to people
that mid-Joseon scholar Yu Mongin

452
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,607
wrote about them in his book, Eou Yadam.

453
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,651
Are you telling me

454
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,277
that this ghost from the Joseon dynasty...

455
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,531
is killing people?

456
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:07,449
Simply put, yes.

457
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:10,118
"Killing people"? Has someone died?

458
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:13,455
Yes, it happened
during Yoonjung's after-party.

459
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,458
A woman was found
in the restroom on the same floor.

460
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,669
And he's telling me that a ghost did it.

461
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,548
By the hungry ghost
that you just mentioned?

462
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:25,801
Yes.

463
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:29,221
You two get along well.

464
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,597
And you?

465
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:33,475
Did you see anything strange that day?

466
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:37,479
I think
one of our acquaintances is the killer.

467
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:39,731
- What?
- Do you have a suspect?

468
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:42,484
Do you perhaps...

469
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,404
have any photos?

470
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:47,489
What if I do?

471
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:51,076
- Then can you tell me who the killer is?
- Yes.

472
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:54,705
If a person is possessed by a ghost,
I can recognize them from a photo.

473
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,754
Do you have any photos
from the after-party?

474
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:08,093
Right. Yoonjung's social media account.

475
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:10,262
One minute.

476
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,514
Here.

477
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:18,687
Is the suspect one of them?

478
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,773
It's highly likely
that it was one of the women.

479
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:38,165
Continue swiping and check the next photo.

480
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:44,922
I don't see it here.

481
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:48,800
I'm sure you don't.

482
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,928
Thank you for your time.

483
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:54,932
Do call me if you remember
anything strange from that day, Sanyeong.

484
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:58,435
Are you sure...

485
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,354
that the killer was our acquaintance?

486
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:03,065
- Why do you ask?
- Two people are missing.

487
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:05,275
What do you mean?

488
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,611
I don't see Yoonjung...

489
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:13,408
and Semi in these photos.

490
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:24,211
Do you have any photos of them?

491
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:27,631
Yes. I'm not sure about Yoonjung's,
but I have Semi's.

492
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,132
It has to be a recent photo.

493
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:32,803
We've been too busy
to take any photos lately.

494
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,013
But it can't be Semi.

495
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,434
She's not someone who'd do that.

496
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:46,566
Where are you going?

497
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:49,569
To see Semi.

498
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:51,530
I'll come with you.

499
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:53,323
What about you?

500
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:55,826
No, thanks.

501
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,495
I'll carry out
a more rational investigation.

502
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:02,249
Why are you asking
about the lawyer who died in the restroom?

503
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:05,127
We have already concluded the case
as a sudden death.

504
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:08,588
So he just suddenly died?

505
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,383
Were any of his belongings missing?

506
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:14,553
Who told you that?

507
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:17,806
- Sorry?
- His luxury watch was missing.

508
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:20,642
That's why we wanted
to investigate this case as theft.

509
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:22,060
But the deceased's family claimed

510
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,896
that he had a habit
of taking off his watch when drunk.

511
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,399
He was heavily intoxicated that day.

512
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:30,819
Plus, his wallet full of cash
was left untouched.

513
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,779
So we just reported the watch as missing.

514
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,365
I see. Thank you, sir.

515
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:36,950
Goodbye.

516
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:40,579
Semi.

517
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:43,623
I don't think she's home.

518
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:51,548
Let's check
where she used to work part-time.

519
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,051
There you are.

520
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:59,264
Hey, that's a gorgeous blouse.

521
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,229
They say she hasn't come here in a while.

522
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,983
- Is she still not picking up?

523
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:13,070
Your call cannot be completed.
You will be redirected to voicemail...

524
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,947
We can get rid of the hungry ghost, right?

525
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,951
Just like
how you can get rid of my evil spirit,

526
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,704
can you do the same for hers?

527
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:23,914
Normally,

528
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:28,001
an evil spirit is a ghost
that harbors a grudge against someone.

529
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:30,212
I can cast it away
if I relieve its grudge.

530
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:32,714
However, a hungry ghost is different.

531
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:37,719
Hungry ghosts are created
by the individual's inner desires.

532
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,222
There's nothing we can do.

533
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:44,810
In that case...

534
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:47,562
...what happens to someone
possessed by a hungry spirit?

535
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:52,818
A friend of mine couldn't stop coveting
what others had.

536
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:56,029
He couldn't take it anymore...

537
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,241
and committed suicide.

538
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:01,993
We have to hurry up and find her.

539
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,546
The evil spirit showed me...

540
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,632
the hungry ghost realm.

541
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:18,927
I went to your place to tell you that.

542
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:24,099
Why would it do that?

543
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,892
I have no idea.

544
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:28,728
That's why I'm worried.

545
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:32,566
Let's focus on finding your friend first.

546
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:39,573
I have no idea where she could be.

547
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:45,036
Try to think of all the places
she normally frequented.

548
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:52,210
Our phones.

549
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,045
Pardon?

550
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:58,008
We downloaded
a location-sharing app in the past.

551
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:02,053
I may not know her exact location,

552
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:04,139
but I'll know where she is
if her phone is on.

553
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:10,437
BAEK SEMI
SONGPA-GU

554
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:16,359
Do you think you could lend me
your formal attire?

555
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:19,446
What? Lend you my formal attire?

556
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:22,824
I'll be careful and take it
to the dry cleaner before returning it.

557
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:27,329
I have an interview in two days
but I don't have time to shop for one.

558
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,789
Could you please help?

559
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,750
Let's get our facts straight.

560
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,501
It's not that you have no time.

561
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,087
You have no money to afford one.

562
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,265
That case was heartbreaking.

563
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:49,601
She was still so young.

564
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:52,604
Her wedding was just around the corner.
What a shame.

565
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:55,815
Did any of her belongings go missing?

566
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:57,609
I don't think so.

567
00:53:58,193 --> 00:53:59,361
Not even one?

568
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,446
No, none.

569
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:05,075
High heels, a handbag, and a watch.

570
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,868
High heels, a handbag, and a watch.

571
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:12,040
There was an item missing
in each of these cases.

572
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,668
So why not this one?

573
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:28,014
She was engaged.

574
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,896
Professor Yeom, she's somewhere nearby.

575
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:37,232
I'll look over there. You can go that way.

576
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:10,932
I visited your wedding venue

577
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:13,393
to investigate a case.

578
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,730
That place is quite popular.

579
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,149
I heard they were fully booked
until next year.

580
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:22,527
But one of the brides-to-be
scheduled to get married there

581
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,280
suddenly passed away.

582
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:29,576
I heard that was how you were able
to have your wedding there.

583
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,202
We were lucky.

584
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:34,372
Or maybe we weren't.

585
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:37,667
As you can see,
we didn't have the money for that place.

586
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:40,337
Yoonjung's father's business went under,

587
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:41,921
so we're selling this place too.

588
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:44,883
The wedding invitation gathering

589
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:46,885
and the after-party too.

590
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:50,263
I told her we should book a cheaper place.

591
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:51,473
But Yoonjung insisted,

592
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:54,559
saying she didn't want her friends
to think less of her.

593
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,854
Was that your wedding gift?

594
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,481
Yoonjung insisted that I take it.

595
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:04,194
What if you keep it for yourself?

596
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,112
Take my handbag for example.

597
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,365
I bought it for the honeymoon.

598
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,283
So how could you just take it?

599
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:13,495
You would've kept it had I not called you.

600
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:14,954
I already told you.

601
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:18,666
I only took it so I could find its owner.

602
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:22,754
I'm serious.

603
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:26,758
Hey, where are you going? Yoonjung!

604
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,348
I didn't know it was this difficult
to borrow some clothes.

605
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:40,188
What's with this annoying bug?

606
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,318
Semi, are you okay?

607
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:48,696
What? How did you know I was here?

608
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:51,699
Where's Yoonjung? Where is she?

609
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:54,244
In there.

610
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:22,981
Hey.

611
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:24,899
Snap out of it.

612
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,443
Seo Yoonjung!

613
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:30,947
What do I do?

614
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,282
Hey, snap...

615
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,081
What are you doing?

616
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:50,008
No. No, no.

617
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:52,302
No!

618
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:03,271
Hey, where are you going?

619
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:04,772
I'll call for help.

620
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:37,597
Have you identified her?

621
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,726
I did identify her
through the reservation list.

622
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:43,520
She's currently hospitalized.

623
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,938
Apparently, she attempted suicide.

624
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:47,649
Talk to her doctor
and see how she's doing.

625
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:50,068
- Yes, sir.
- Next.

626
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:55,365
Who is that guy?

627
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,909
That's Lee Hongsae. Right?

628
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:02,247
Did he purposely keep his mouth shut
when he knew about this?

629
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,501
Hello.

630
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:09,546
Let's go.

631
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:11,965
We should report to our chief.

632
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,884
Let's go, you punks.

633
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:22,684
You shouldn't have done that, you punk.

634
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,011
You've heard
of ancestral rite tables, right?

635
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:01,931
Our ancestors...

636
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:05,518
pitied all the hungry ghosts,
despite not knowing who they were.

637
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:09,022
They prepared feasts to console them.

638
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:12,692
They did not have much,

639
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,361
but they still knew how to share.

640
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:18,531
But current society
has become more heartless.

641
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:21,034
And the hungry ghosts
have become more rapacious.

642
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:26,080
They look for people
who are just as desperate as they are

643
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:28,416
and possess them.

644
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:30,918
Yoonjung committed

645
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:33,463
an unforgivable crime.

646
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,051
However,

647
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,596
don't we all have desires?

648
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:46,184
We all desire to be more comfortable

649
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:49,270
and happier.

650
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:55,526
There's something I haven't told you.

651
01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:01,282
I used your credit card
to buy pretty clothes.

652
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:08,456
I didn't have a care in the world
and had fun that night.

653
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:13,002
The evil spirit told me
that I was satisfying my own desires.

654
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,922
Back then, I could confidently say

655
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:19,717
that I had no such desires.

656
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:23,846
But I received...

657
01:01:26,974 --> 01:01:28,476
my grandmother's inheritance.

658
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:31,312
The amount...

659
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:34,857
was far beyond what I could comprehend.

660
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,735
That's when I finally realized...

661
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:40,655
that this...

662
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:45,410
was what I had desired.

663
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:52,083
I didn't know at first.

664
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:57,880
But perhaps...

665
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:05,555
this is the real me.

666
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:10,268
I told you.

667
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:16,399
That the evil spirit would use
your weakness to its advantage.

668
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:19,068
You should stay out of this.

669
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:20,820
From now on,

670
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:24,282
I'll catch the evil spirit on my own.

671
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:37,712
PROFESSOR JANG WONSEOK

672
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:40,381
- Hello, sir.
-  Hey, Professor Yeom.

673
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,050
I found the person
who made that Line of Prohibition

674
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:45,470
with the small blade.

675
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:53,603
This is Minju Photo Studio.

676
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:56,063
Your photos have been printed.

677
01:02:57,607 --> 01:03:00,651
Some parts of the scanned files
turned out dark.

678
01:03:00,651 --> 01:03:02,236
There was an issue with the machine.

679
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:04,739
We redeveloped them too. They're in there.

680
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:07,784
I see. Thank you.

681
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:33,476
Have a seat.

682
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:57,333
Hello, ma'am.

683
01:04:02,046 --> 01:04:03,464
My name is Yeom Haesang.

684
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:06,676
Yes.

685
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,928
I made this Line of Prohibition.

686
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:11,806
When and whom did you make it for?

687
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:15,810
It was about a year ago.
It was for a close acquaintance of mine.

688
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:19,021
Professor Gu Gangmo.

689
01:04:19,438 --> 01:04:23,150
But was this the only one you found?

690
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,988
I made five of these.

691
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:29,156
Five?

692
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:33,452
Why do you think he needed them?

693
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,913
I'm afraid I don't know.

694
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:41,002
He needed to find five objects

695
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:44,422
and identify the evil spirit.

696
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:47,216
That's all he told me.

697
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:38,851
Professor Yeom?

698
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:41,646
These lines are used
to keep out bad luck.

699
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:45,775
Maybe he was trying to prevent
bad energy from entering.

700
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:48,611
Have you ever made these...

701
01:05:50,237 --> 01:05:52,615
for someone else as well?

702
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:56,160
What about...

703
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:02,208
Yes, I did.

704
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:04,293
I made five of these

705
01:06:05,002 --> 01:06:07,254
for this woman as well.

706
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:21,727
You. Who are you?

707
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:25,523
Can you see me?

708
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:28,275
Did you come here for me?

709
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:34,031
I thought the evil spirit showed me
the hungry ghost realm because of Semi,

710
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:35,157
but I was wrong.

711
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:39,537
It was actually pointing to you.

712
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:43,624
Who are you?

713
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:50,047
What do you know?

714
01:06:51,924 --> 01:06:53,092
I don't know anything.

715
01:06:53,634 --> 01:06:54,635
It's the truth.

716
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:56,887
I only saw the name.

717
01:06:57,471 --> 01:06:58,472
The name?

718
01:06:59,932 --> 01:07:00,975
Whose name?

719
01:07:04,478 --> 01:07:07,523
The one
who turned you into an evil spirit.

720
01:07:08,232 --> 01:07:09,608
Their name.

721
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:11,652
She visited me

722
01:07:12,653 --> 01:07:15,948
a long time ago
after an introduction from Professor Gu.

723
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:29,086
REVENANT

724
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:32,965
SPECIAL THANKS TO PYO YEJIN

725
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:52,902
Are you Detective Lee Hongsae?

726
01:07:53,819 --> 01:07:56,781
We just need to know
what Detective Seo Munchun is up to.

727
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:58,199
Why should I help you?

728
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:00,451
High-level information
that could aid in your promotion.

729
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:03,079
I need to know
who they are and why they died.

730
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:05,623
Do you know Ujin?

731
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:07,208
They all died because of him.

732
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:10,836
They wanted me
to chant a sutra for the deceased child.

733
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:13,089
I think
there was an evil spirit in our house.

734
01:08:16,717 --> 01:08:18,886
Did you really not know
whose house that was?

735
01:08:18,886 --> 01:08:21,847
Are you hiding something from me,
Professor Yeom?

736
01:08:22,473 --> 01:08:23,808
Is this about

737
01:08:23,808 --> 01:08:25,184
a juvenile ghost?

738
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:42,034
