1
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:46,046
REVENANT

2
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,132
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,842
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
IN SAFE SITUATIONS

4
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,139
PREMIUM TAXI

5
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,902
HWAWONJAE

6
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,701
THE INEVITABLE

7
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,373
Is that you, Gangmo?

8
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,212
HAIR ACCESSORY

9
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:12,799
What happened?

10
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,759
What went wrong?

11
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,261
THE EVIL SPIRIT IS A JUVENILE GHOST

12
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,637
It can't be...

13
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,947
Gangmo, open the door!

14
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,699
It's outside.

15
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,951
It keeps following me.
I'm scared to death.

16
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,327
Hurry up and open the door!

17
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:45,957
Are you there?

18
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,575
You...

19
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,870
- opened the door.

20
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,720
Are you all right, Gangmo?

21
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,687
Yes, sir.

22
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,523
Should I just quit and run a business?

23
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,150
What time is this week's
meeting with the buyer again?

24
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,069
I splurged on one over the weekend.

25
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,779
Again? Stop spending so much.

26
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,702
The weather's so nice, I want to resign.

27
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,248
Hello?

28
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,668
Oh, yes. This is the customer
heading to Sihyun-dong, right?

29
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,170
Yes, I'm almost there.

30
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,561
Come on, let's have another drink.

31
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,689
Let's eat something delicious.

32
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,192
I really want to quit my job.

33
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,820
I'm getting a bonus this month.

34
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,614
What do you want to eat?

35
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,494
I want to take a break for three days.

36
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,163
I'll see you later.

37
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,081
THE WORST CASE
OF VOICE PHISHING HAS OCCURRED

38
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,328
There's an invisible hand
behind suicide cases.

39
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:56,249
There's a regulation
for "death by intimidation" in Article 322

40
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,835
of the early Joseon Dynasty legal book Daemyeongryuljikhae.

41
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,878
Enough with the ancient history lessons.

42
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,548
Are you showing off
that you're a folklore professor?

43
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,174
It's an expensive lecture, so listen up.

44
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,385
"Death by intimidation"

45
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,763
was a law made for those
who were threatened and persecuted

46
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:15,101
and took their lives when the feeling
of injustice became too much to bear.

47
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:20,106
It took revenge
on those who caused their death.

48
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,733
They thought there was an invisible hand,

49
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,153
a real culprit behind suicide cases.

50
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:29,073
So a lot of people killed themselves
over injustices now and in the past.

51
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,408
I get that.

52
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,953
So can you stop coming here?

53
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,714
Nothing changes even if you sit here
like a madman all the time.

54
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,716
You know that.

55
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,691
It's starting again.

56
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,870
Hey! Are you out of your mind?

57
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,212
Are you crazy?

58
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,714
What do you think you're doing?

59
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,385
What are you doing?

60
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,388
There's a weird guy here.

61
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,182
Hey, mister. Mister!

62
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,519
My gosh. What are you doing?

63
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,618
No, no!

64
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,705
No, don't!

65
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:41,789
No!

66
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,793
-  Oh, my.
-  What do we do?

67
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:48,212
-  What do we do?
-  Someone call 911!

68
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:52,091
I think someone just jumped.
I'll call you back.

69
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,551
Hello, 911?

70
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,511
I'm on Seogang Bridge

71
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,388
and someone just jumped off.

72
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,098
Yes, please hurry.

73
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,556
Sanyeong,

74
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,100
they caught the voice phishing offenders
who stole our money!

75
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,398
Over here, Sanyeong!

76
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:55,112
What's wrong with everyone?
You said they caught the culprits.

77
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:56,822
We can't get it back.

78
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,450
What do you mean?

79
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,243
Our money.

80
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,872
They already used up all of our money.

81
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,211
What are we going to do, Sanyeong?

82
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,506
What do we do?

83
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:31,482
-  You terrible people!
-  How could you do this?

84
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,442
That money was all that I had!

85
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,070
Hey, you thief!

86
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,823
Give me back my money, you thief!

87
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,658
Do you have anything to say
to the victims?

88
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,369
Please, return
the money to me. I beg you!

89
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,579
You thief! My money...

90
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,872
- Oh, my.
- Are you alright?

91
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:47,998
Sanyeong!

92
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,502
Do you have any idea
what I did to earn all that money?

93
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,381
Hey!

94
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,969
Hey, you punk!

95
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,093
GU GANGMO

96
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:48,642
If I die,
please help my daughter.

97
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,686
Her name is Gu Sanyeong.

98
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,820
Gosh, that little...

99
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,623
How could you send

100
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,625
all the money we saved
without checking first?

101
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,961
What are you going to do
about the increased deposit?

102
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,341
How could I not send it
when they said you were kidnapped?

103
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,843
You're all I have.

104
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:25,387
You didn't answer my calls, so--

105
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,181
I told you, I was working!

106
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,769
My gosh, don't yell. My heart is racing.

107
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,359
Did you...

108
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,569
take your medicine?

109
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,033
Let's go inside.

110
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,018
Eat up.

111
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,938
I don't deserve to eat.

112
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,064
Just eat.

113
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,233
You need to eat something
so you can take your medicine.

114
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,459
Should I...

115
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,171
start working part-time jobs again?

116
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,304
Just stay home and rest
instead of stressing out about working.

117
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,764
I'll take care of the money
one way or another.

118
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,602
You're looking down on me
for not being a good worker, aren't you?

119
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,186
Who says I'm looking down on you?

120
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,939
I see it in your eyes right now.
You're looking down on me.

121
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,941
I'm not looking down on you, it's just...

122
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,737
Mom, don't you remember
paying hundreds of thousands of won

123
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,531
for the refrigerator you broke
while working at that convenience store?

124
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:10,367
That was just one time.

125
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:11,994
It wasn't one time.

126
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,954
Two years ago,
while working at a BBQ restaurant,

127
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,832
you spilled kimchi stew onto
a customer's ten-million-won designer bag.

128
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,544
It was soybean paste stew.

129
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,225
Mom.

130
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,603
Mom.

131
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,190
Although we didn't live a stable life,

132
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,609
we've lived and are living a good life.

133
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,736
Let's continue living a good life.

134
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,780
I'll work really hard,

135
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,282
so you just need to stay by my side

136
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,159
without doing anything.

137
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,163
Still, you're working this hard.
As your mother, how could I--

138
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,623
Stop it!

139
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,707
I love you.

140
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,709
Mom, I really love you,

141
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:03,128
so please just take care of your health.

142
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,798
Your health matters the most to me.

143
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,758
I'm healthy and I love--

144
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,635
- My gosh, that scared me.

145
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,346
- Is that the landlady?

146
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,477
No, it's not.

147
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,987
Yes, go ahead.

148
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,541
Okay, I understand.

149
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,170
Who was it?

150
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:51,010
You need to go somewhere with me today.

151
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,137
Today? Right now?

152
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,680
I have to go chauffeur.

153
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,349
It's somewhere we need to be. Hurry up.

154
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,436
Right now?

155
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,578
Are you really not going
to tell me where we're going?

156
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,958
Do you remember your dad?

157
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,668
Dad?

158
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:31,050
"The stepmother
and her son paid for their sins,

159
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,012
and the ghost of the two sisters,
Janghwa and Hongryeon,

160
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:39,349
let go of their resentment
and left for heaven."

161
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:42,227
Is that all? That was the end?

162
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,272
Do you want to know something?

163
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,356
Yes!

164
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,902
The events in The Story of Janghwa
and Hongryeon happened in real life.

165
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,363
During the reign of King Hyojong
in the Joseon Dynasty,

166
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,115
a man named Jeon Dongheul
wrote about what he experienced

167
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,700
while he was an officer in Cheolsan.

168
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,038
So as I've said before,

169
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:05,751
ghosts are actually real.

170
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:11,590
I don't remember him well.
He passed away when I was young.

171
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,345
But why are you suddenly bringing up Dad?

172
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,639
You never liked talking about him.

173
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:22,059
Your dad didn't die then.

174
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,771
- What?
-  He didn't die.

175
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,441
We divorced when you were five years old.

176
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,195
-  We're here.

177
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,912
Mom, are you okay?

178
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,457
Are you not feeling well?

179
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,709
Is it because of the voice phishing case?

180
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,507
Dad...

181
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,636
passed away in a hit-and-run accident
on his way to work early in the morning.

182
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,513
Right?

183
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,474
Can you please say something?

184
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,271
I made that up...

185
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:09,857
because you kept asking.

186
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:14,194
What about the memorial services
we held for him all this time?

187
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,906
You kept asking to hold one for him,
so we just had one on some random day.

188
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:25,247
What about the sea
we scattered his ashes at?

189
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,251
The place with the good ganjang gejang.
Was that a lie too?

190
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,672
Yes.

191
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,725
Stop for a second.

192
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:48,812
So you told me Dad was dead
even though he was alive and well

193
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,522
this whole time?

194
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,899
Why?

195
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,443
Why did you tell me such a lie?

196
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,528
Because I never planned to see him again.

197
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,573
Then why are you
telling me all of this now?

198
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,284
Your dad is now actually dead.

199
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:06,997
You're his daughter, so you should
at least say goodbye one last time.

200
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:39,404
HWAWONJAE

201
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,997
She's your grandmother. Say hello.

202
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,837
Hello.

203
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:43,176
We'll be on our way now.

204
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,430
I have something to say to Sanyeong.

205
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,806
What is it about?

206
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,144
Can I talk to you alone for a moment?

207
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,980
No, we have nothing more to discuss.

208
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,982
- It was Gangmo's last wish.
- Still, no.

209
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:00,610
He killed himself
without seeing his daughter's face again.

210
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,780
Are you really going to be like this
until the very end?

211
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,139
Have you been well?

212
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,142
Are you healthy?

213
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:33,810
Yes.

214
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:36,938
I'm glad.

215
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:43,445
What did my dad do for a living?

216
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,239
Your mom didn't even tell you that?

217
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,660
She said he was an office worker, but...

218
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,329
I see...

219
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,585
He was a folklore professor.

220
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,133
But...

221
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,387
what happened to him to make him do that?

222
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,325
Here.

223
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:32,994
What is this?

224
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,496
It belonged to your dad.

225
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,667
He left a will saying
he wanted you to have it.

226
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,006
Take it.

227
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,199
She took it.

228
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:32,762
What is that?

229
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:35,098
It's something Dad wanted me to have.

230
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,435
What's wrong with you?

231
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,105
Don't touch anything from this house.

232
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,648
It belonged to Dad--

233
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,484
Since when did you care
about having a dad?

234
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,361
Mom, what's wrong with you?

235
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:51,323
It's absurd that you deceived me
with your ridiculous lies.

236
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:55,160
I can't even take a keepsake
from a dead dad I never got to see?

237
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,623
Stop it, Sanyeong.

238
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,374
Stop what?

239
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,920
I don't know if you completely forgot
about Dad,

240
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,255
but he remembered us.

241
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,799
- He remembered me.
- What do you know?

242
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,178
I didn't talk about any of it
because I despised all of it.

243
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,680
I hate even the thought
of your dad and this house.

244
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,724
I should have come here by myself.

245
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,434
I shouldn't have told you any of this.

246
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,520
I didn't tell you
because I knew you'd be like this.

247
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,438
- Mom.
- It's my fault. I shouldn't have told you.

248
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,606
- It's my fault.
- Mom.

249
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,693
I understand, so stop it. I won't take it.

250
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,488
I don't have to take it.

251
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:38,453
Let's go now.

252
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,582
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

253
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,128
Me?

254
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,255
Do you know me?

255
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,302
Gu Sanyeong,
the last bus is about to arrive.

256
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,762
Okay!

257
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,225
Is your name Gu Sanyeong?

258
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,102
Sorry?

259
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:47,355
Are you Professor Gu Gangmo's daughter?

260
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,317
Well...

261
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,529
Yes, I am but...

262
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,031
What about it?

263
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,912
We're going to miss the bus!

264
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:09,794
I don't know who you are,
but I really have to go now.

265
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,338
I'm sorry.

266
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,839
Wait, I...

267
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,373
Thank you for coming.

268
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,541
It's nice to meet you.

269
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:53,338
My name is Yeom Haesang,
and I study folklore like Professor Gu.

270
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,257
If it's all right with you,
may I ask you a few questions?

271
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,552
Professor Gu Gangmo...

272
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,431
suddenly retired 15 years ago.

273
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:06,184
What had he been up to since then?

274
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,269
What happened?

275
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:11,022
I have so much more to ask.

276
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,399
Why did Professor Gu...

277
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,986
How did he pass away?

278
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,366
What was your relationship with Gangmo?

279
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,619
- Sorry?
- Why did you come here?

280
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:28,206
I don't think you're here
to mourn Gangmo's death.

281
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,541
Please leave.

282
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,874

PROFESSOR GU GANGMO'S
THESIS QUALITY IS OUTRAGEOUS

289
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,015
HIS THESIS IS FULL OF GHOST STORIES
WITH UNCLEAR ORIGINS...

290
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:40,612
IF I DIE, PLEASE HELP MY DAUGHTER.
HER NAME IS GU SANYEONG...

291
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:47,786
Mom,

292
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,497
why did you get divorced?

293
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,959
Can you at least tell me

294
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,337
what happened between you two?

295
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,215
I told you to stop talking about your dad.

296
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,510
He stopped existing a long time ago.

297
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,094
Let's keep it that way from now on.

298
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:07,472
Gyeongmun, it's me!

299
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,599
Gyeongmun?

300
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,267
Gyeongmun?

301
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,686
Gyeongmun?

302
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:15,980
Gyeongmun?

303
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,614
- What is it?
- Your phone.

304
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,574
What about it?

305
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,117
LANDLADY

306
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,588
She left. Come quickly.

307
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,307
Come on.

308
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,812
There's a prerequisite.

309
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,689
There's a prerequisite
for reopening a lawsuit.

310
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:01,025
After that period, you can't reopen
a lawsuit even if you want to.

311
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,446
Also, if you're filing a lawsuit,

312
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:08,199
it means it's something
you can't talk out. You file a lawsuit.

313
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,870
In certain cases,
an administrative trial is necessary...

314
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:15,331
I'm Yeom Haesang,
a professor at Jeyoung University.

315
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,208
Please contact me.

316
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,878
...talking about administrative trials

317
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,170
and administrative appeals.

318
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:24,507
A courthouse determines
the outcome of a lawsuit.

319
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:27,760
However, an administrative trial...

320
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:52,327
Hey, it's that despicable jerk.

321
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,912
Hello?

322
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,830
Hey, I got released today.

323
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,125
Of course.

324
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,461
With or without sufficient evidence,

325
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,254
all you need is money
to make things happen.

326
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,131
The cops didn't follow you, right?

327
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,926
I made sure to check before making a move.

328
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:11,512
All right, collect the rest of the money
and come to my studio.

329
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,222
- Okay.
-When you get here...

330
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,433
Hello?

331
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,315
Hey, can you hear me?

332
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,859
-  The door.
- What?

333
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,903
Open the door.

334
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:29,072
Did you come here?

335
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,324
I thought you said
you were at your studio.

336
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,868
-Open the door.
- Well, you know the passcode.

337
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,496
Open the door!

338
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,000
Who the heck are you?

339
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,963
Is that really you?

340
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,714
I said, open the door!

341
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:48,967
What's going on?

342
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,430
What?

343
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,975
Darn it.

344
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:05,692
Who are you?

345
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,319
You opened the door.

346
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,255
My gosh, I must be out of my mind.

347
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:32,635
I'm late.

348
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:35,805
What is this?

349
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,643
- Darn, that scared me.

00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:20,099
Why do I keep getting this?
Is it a new type of voice phishing?

361
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:27,774
It's just a few stones.
How can this be a cultural asset?

362
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,358
Is it really from the Joseon Dynasty?

363
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:33,154
There's no other artifact around here,
so it's highly unlikely.

364
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:36,115
But an expert should be here soon.
Please wait a little longer.

365
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,117
Oh, that must be him.

366
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:42,330
-  Food delivery!
- It's the food delivery.

367
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,749
-  Over here!
- Yes, on my way!

368
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,887
You're that guy from before, right?

369
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:00,473
- Why haven't you contacted me?
- What?

370
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:03,267
I sent you several texts.
Why have you still not contacted me?

371
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,938
You're Professor Yeom Haesang
from Jeyoung University?

372
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,398
How did you get my number?

373
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:11,275
Professor, over here.

374
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,238
I guess we were destined to meet again

375
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,614
even though it may be ill-fated.

376
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,032
What is he saying?

377
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,910
I asked you how you got my number.

378
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,704
Wait one moment, please.
There's something we need to talk about.

379
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,250
He leaves after saying his piece without
answering other people's questions.

380
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,002
Aren't you going
to give me my lunch?

381
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,504
I'm coming right now!

382
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,172
This is Yeom Haesang,
an expert on cultural assets

383
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:35,758
and a professor from Jeyoung University's
Department of Folklore.

384
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:37,885
Thank you for coming.
Please take a look at that.

385
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:43,224
Gosh, we don't have time for this.

386
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,477
How could that rock be a cultural asset?

387
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,396
It's not a rock but a cornerstone.

388
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,731
It differs in size from one that belongs
to a palace or a luxurious hanok.

389
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,526
It was made from mountain stone,

390
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,987
so it looks to be from a thatched house
belonging to the lower class.

391
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,655
Is it from the Joseon Dynasty?

392
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,739
Yes.

393
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:02,535
So what? Should we stop construction
just because of this?

394
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:05,454
No, you can continue
after we get a photo of it.

395
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:09,208
The cornerstone is crude
and the base was built carelessly.

396
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,002
It has no value as a cultural asset.

397
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,045
That's good.

398
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:18,217
However, it would be best to hold
a rite before anything.

399
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,386
- A rite?
- Here he goes again.

400
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,931
Professor, if that's all,
you should go now.

401
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,560
The foul-smelling black soil over there
used to be an outhouse.

402
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,813
The Kitchen Goddess, who is in charge
of the furnace, is good-natured,

403
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:31,939
but the Outhouse Goddess is different.

404
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:34,483
She is a scary ghost
with a violent personality.

405
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:36,277
That can't be the reason

406
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,905
why you're telling us
to hold a rite, right?

407
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,535
If you don't want to hold a rite,

408
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:47,038
at least act in a pious manner.

409
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,166
They've watched over this land
for hundreds of years.

410
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,756
-  What is he talking about?
-  Well...

411
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:57,840
Let's talk.

412
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,759
We have to hold a rite
before resuming construction?

413
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,053
-  He's a very unique person--
-  Why would he say that?

414
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,763
Fine, let's talk.

415
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,641
SAFETY FIRST

416
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:09,435
You're a folklore professor?

417
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,521
- Yes.
- Do all folklore professors

418
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,815
do this kind of thing?

419
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:18,486
We do this, give lectures,
and work on research as well.

420
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,075
You knew my father, right?

421
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:25,868
No.

422
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:29,872
Then why did you come to the funeral?

423
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,674
It's gotten bigger.

424
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,886
Bigger? What got bigger?

425
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:45,513
People around you will die.

426
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:49,934
What did you say?

427
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,603
People you don't like
or you wish would disappear will die.

428
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,649
Evil spirits are said to grow
by fulfilling a person's desires.

429
00:37:57,233 --> 00:38:01,028
Excuse me, but I have no idea
what you're talking about.

430
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:02,280
An evil spirit...

431
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,533
has latched onto you.

432
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,080
An evil spirit?

433
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,377
- Are you talking about a ghost?
- Yes.

434
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:20,172
What is this? Is this a new type of fraud?

435
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,757
It's not a new type of fraud.

436
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,009
Whatever.

437
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:27,346
I don't have any money for an exorcism
so find someone else.

438
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,558
And I don't know how you got my number,

439
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:33,352
but don't contact me again
if you're going to say stuff like this.

440
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,521
Unless if it's to call a chauffeur.

441
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:40,109
Let's do that,
chauffeur service to any location.

442
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,944
A long-distance drive
would be better, right?

443
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,698
Why on earth are you doing this?

444
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,366
Yangpyeong or Paju, which is better?

445
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:51,704
I pick Paju.

446
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,832
I'll start driving.

447
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,718
It's the Deureonggaengi rhythm, used in
the Village Ritual of the East Coast.

448
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,595
A what?

449
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:11,515
Besides this rhythm,
there is Deongdeogungi, Dongsalpuli,

450
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,933
Gosam, and Jasam as well.

451
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:16,187
This rhythm is mainly played
by an instrumental ensemble.

452
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:19,148
Do you have any other music
you listen to when you're feeling normal?

453
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,192
I do.

454
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,324
This is used during
the Purification Ritual of Jindo,

455
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,785
which is also known
as a "Soul Saving Ritual."

456
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,454
May you be purified!

457
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,663
I'll start driving.

458
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:47,176
But really, why are you doing this?

459
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:50,513
Do you have so much money
that you just want to splurge?

460
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:55,893
I see them.

461
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:57,686
See what?

462
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:01,941
Ghosts.

463
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,031
Paju or not, this is too much.

464
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,583
I'm stopping the car.

465
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,336
I'll be on my way now.

466
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,632
Of course, not all of them are bad ghosts.

467
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,801
We have the ghosts of ancestors
who protect us

468
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:31,887
and pitiful ghosts
who have lost their way.

469
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:34,598
They appear
because they have something left to say.

470
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:37,143
However,
the one latched onto you is different.

471
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,103
It's a very dangerous ghost.

472
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:46,610
Just consider
the two-kilometer drive here a freebie.

473
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,695
No,

474
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,741
I need to know why
and when it possessed you.

475
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:56,203
Have you recently gone
to a place with bad energy

476
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:58,372
or touched an ominous object?

477
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:00,708
- It can be an old object.
- Excuse me,

478
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,377
I don't believe in ghosts

479
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,504
nor do I have the time to.

480
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,054
Take a good look in the mirror.

481
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,433
You'll see something different than usual.

482
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,405
Ms. Gu Sanyeong?

483
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:34,241
Who are you?

484
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,956
We've...

485
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,459
met before, right?

486
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,295
I feel like we've met before.

487
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,968
We're from the Seoul Metropolitan
Violent Crimes Investigation Unit.

488
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,096
LEE HONGSAE
SEO MUNCHUN

489
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,559
Why did the police come looking for us?

490
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,896
How should I know?

491
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,574
Do you recognize this person?

492
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:17,993
This person...

493
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:21,455
Mom, this is the voice phishing
offender, right?

494
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,709
That's right, he's that jerk...

495
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,587
I mean... What about him?

496
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,713
Did he commit fraud again?

497
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,134
He's dead.

498
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:39,014
He's dead?

499
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,392
Ms. Gu Sanyeong,

500
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,269
where were you

501
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:46,564
on January 2nd, between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m.?

502
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,570
What? January 2nd?

503
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:56,073
What was I doing then?
I don't recall what I did.

504
00:42:57,283 --> 00:43:00,119
It's the morning after we came back
from your dad's funeral.

505
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,621
She stayed up late that night studying

506
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,915
and fell asleep in her room, at home.

507
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:08,294
Yes, that's right.
I was home that morning.

508
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:10,879
What's this about?

509
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,090
Did something happen?

510
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,639
It's nothing.
Thank you for your cooperation.

511
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,017
All right then.

512
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,021
Wait. What?

513
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:31,942
People around you will die.

514
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,778
People you don't like
or you wish would disappear will die.

515
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:38,407
Evil spirits are said to grow
by fulfilling a person's desires.

516
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:40,117
Take a good look in the mirror.

517
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,870
You'll see something different than usual.

518
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,474
My dark circles have gotten worse.

519
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,101
Darn.

520
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,689
Let's go back to studying.

521
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,203
VIOLENT CRIMES INVESTIGATION UNIT 4 OFFICE

522
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,539
I got all the CCTV footage
around Ms. Gu Sanyeong's house,

523
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:29,124
and her statement holds.

524
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:31,877
There's footage of her
leaving her house around 9 a.m.

525
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:45,099
See? He just committed suicide.

526
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,892
It doesn't make any sense.

527
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:51,480
How could a single woman stage the suicide
of a sturdy man in his thirties?

528
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,191
The CCTV footage shows him
walking around by himself too.

529
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:38,360
Never again...

530
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:59,423
A money-hungry voice phishing offender

531
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,050
withdrew tens of millions of won
from his bank account

532
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:05,596
as well as a cash advance from an ATM

533
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,848
and threw it all off a rooftop
before committing suicide.

534
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,728
Doesn't that seem weird to you?

535
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,730
We're not here
to investigate weird things.

536
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:16,732
We investigate with physical evidence.

537
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:19,318
What about the fingerprints then?

538
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:20,986
Gu Sanyeong's fingerprints

539
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:23,071
are all over the deceased's
credit card, bag,

540
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:25,991
and the railing of the rooftop
where he committed suicide.

541
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,160
And look.

542
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,162
Here.

543
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:32,581
Why are there bruises
on both of his wrists?

544
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:37,669
It's as if someone
was holding them real tight.

545
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,381
- Sir, that hurts.
- Sorry.

546
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:48,013
By the way, why are you
so interested in cases like this?

547
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:51,725
I heard that there are
a lot of mysterious cold case files

548
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:53,560
in your desk drawer.

549
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,067
You...

550
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:06,782
...don't know what my first case was,
do you?

551
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,327
No, what was it?

552
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:18,460
Let's investigate this a little more.

553
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:21,755
Something about it bothers me.

554
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,265
Looks like everyone went home.

555
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,516
You should go too.

556
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:38,146
My gosh.

557
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,776
This is really driving me crazy.

558
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:46,071
I mean... Why?

559
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:49,157
Why did I have to be partners with him?

560
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,580
My performance evaluation is doomed.

561
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:02,462
YEOSU RESTAURANT

562
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,635
Gosh.

563
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:12,639
Thank you.

564
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:17,144
My gosh, did alcohol do something to you?

565
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,605
Why do you keep drinking it
when you don't get drunk?

566
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,940
Why did a busy person like you
ask to meet me?

567
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:25,986
You should go home and rest
whenever you have the chance.

568
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,947
See, I knew you would do this.

569
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:30,741
You forgot this year too.

570
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:31,867
Gosh.

571
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:39,833
You should at least
remember your own birthday.

572
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:44,296
- Socks again?
- Your feet need to be comfortable

573
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:47,591
in order to live a comfortable life.

574
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,010
You have plenty of everything else.

575
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,023
- About Professor Gu Gangmo--

576
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:05,484
That's enough,
you've already mentioned him enough.

577
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,198
I met his daughter.

578
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:14,409
I saw that the same evil spirit
was with her.

579
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,123
The same one that killed my mother.

580
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:25,337
I finally found the evil spirit

581
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,634
that I spent decades looking for.

582
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,183
Professor Yeom,

583
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:41,895
just pretend you didn't see anything.

584
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:44,481
Live a normal life,
pretending not to see them.

585
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,650
You have a lot of money, right?

586
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:51,238
Spend that money
and settle down with a woman you love.

587
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,783
You still don't believe me, do you?

588
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:56,368
I believe you.

589
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:04,418
Current forensic techniques
have improved tremendously.

590
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:07,421
There are CCTVs and dashcams everywhere,

591
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:11,091
so the arrest rate is almost 100%.

592
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,259
However,

593
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,927
there are still cases

594
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:16,555
that are hard to solve
even with scientific evidence.

595
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:19,307
For example, a murder behind closed doors
that is impossible to prove,

596
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:22,060
a passenger who disappeared
in the middle of the highway,

597
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,814
and the sudden disappearance
of loved ones.

598
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:28,108
I start to believe you

599
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,235
when I see cases like this.

600
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:33,488
I start to wonder
if ghosts actually exist.

601
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,366
However,

602
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:42,039
I'm supposed to catch people,

603
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:45,876
not ghosts.

604
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:02,517
It's the same for your mother's case.

605
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:05,645
I'll make sure I find out
who killed your mother

606
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:08,690
and why before I die.

607
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:11,526
I'll do it myself,

608
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:16,073
so live a normal life, Professor Yeom.

609
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,039
Have you eaten, sir?

610
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,290
Yes.

611
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:27,709
I apologize
for disturbing you late at night.

612
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:30,170
The young lady is looking for a house,

613
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,672
but she works
a part-time job during the day.

614
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:35,759
You must be working very hard.

615
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:38,178
- Yes.
-  Take a good look around.

616
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:42,265
This house may be old,
but it's very sturdy.

617
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,809
It's spacious too.

618
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:47,604
There's a storage unit outside
for miscellaneous items as well.

619
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:50,732
What do you think?

620
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:53,985
How much did you say it was?

621
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:56,530
A security deposit of four million won
and 350,000 won monthly.

622
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,281
You won't find

623
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,742
a house this cheap anywhere else in Seoul.

624
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:04,287
Can we do 300,000 won monthly?
It looks really worn out.

625
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:07,707
All right.

626
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:11,503
I'll put in a good word
since you look like you work very hard.

627
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,046
- Thank you.

628
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,132
What is that?

629
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:17,634
Did you hear that?

630
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:20,178
What sound?

631
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:22,639
- I didn't hear anything.
- But just now...

632
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,309
Goodness, it's already time
for me to close the store.

633
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,686
Let's hurry up and go.

634
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:29,688
Okay.

635
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:34,025
It's cold when the sun goes down, right?

636
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:47,998
Yes, I'm going up the alley now.

637
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:51,042
Didn't you say
it was across from Myunghoon's?

638
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,294
Right in front...

639
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:54,296
- Ggu!
- Bbaekse!

640
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:56,047
I found you!

641
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:59,467
I moved here ages ago.
What took you so long?

642
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:02,053
I've had to take care
of many complicated things.

643
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:03,263
Here, a present.

644
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:05,682
You shouldn't have.

645
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,684
It's an expensive brand of tissue.

646
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:10,061
- Where is it?
-  Hey, in here.

647
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:12,397
Come on in.

648
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:15,025
But what do you mean, there's a ghost?

649
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,446
- A ghost of a little girl?
-  Yes.

650
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:22,449
The corner store lady asked if I was okay.

651
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:26,203
She used to hear a little girl crying
in this house whenever it was nighttime.

652
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:28,663
A little girl must have lived here.

653
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:31,750
The previous tenants
only had a son in middle school.

654
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:36,087
Is it ghost season? Everyone is talking
about ghosts wherever I go.

655
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:39,007
Hey, it's not a joke. I'm being serious.

656
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,176
I hear people whispering
and mumbling every night

657
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:42,844
and footsteps too.

658
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:44,596
It's sad enough that I don't have money,

659
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:46,556
but do I really have to live
in a haunted house?

660
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:51,770
See?

661
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:54,231
The light does that every time
the door closes upstairs.

662
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,107
The lightbulb is broken.
Hurry up and change it.

663
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:58,652
- Hey, you...
- I'll change it for you. 20,000 won.

664
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,028
- Hey!

665
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:03,073
Make sure you frequently check
the location-sharing app.

666
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,783
If I haven't moved from my house,

667
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:07,118
it means a ghost took me,
so make sure to come to save me.

668
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:09,579
All right, don't worry.

669
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,164
Let's eat.

670
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:13,166
Let's eat.

671
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:15,085
- Try it.
- Thank you for the meal.

672
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,340
No way.

673
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,468
So the dad you thought was dead was alive

674
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:24,761
but then he died?

675
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:30,600
Hey, you should go and get that keepsake.

676
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:33,561
You don't know what it's worth.
You said he had a nice house.

677
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:40,610
So does that mean you get the house

678
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,195
when your grandmother passes away?

679
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,783
Hey! Don't say such a ridiculous thing.

680
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,244
Is it?

681
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,915
I still don't understand.

682
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:56,251
Why did your mother get divorced?

683
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:58,503
He was from a rich family
and was a university professor.

684
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,588
What was the problem?

685
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:02,549
I don't know.

686
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:05,969
I'm tired. Let's sleep.

687
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:07,679
Okay.

688
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,600
Hey, call the police!

689
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:37,811
Okay!

690
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,521
-  Report it!
-  Where are you going?

691
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:42,065
-  We have to catch them!
-  Are you crazy?

692
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,734
Hey, get over here, you punks!

693
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:26,276
Darn it!

694
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:33,908
She stopped chasing us.

695
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:36,202
What's going on? It's the wrong house!

696
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:38,288
They said it was that house!

697
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,664
Darn it.

698
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:42,041
This must be where he used to live.

699
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:45,170
Hey, you said you asked people
from his previous school.

700
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:48,381
Darn it! We're going to be mistaken
for hidden camera offenders.

701
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,341
They said it was that house.

702
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,761
Let's go back for now.

703
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:58,475
Also, you can't tell anyone
about what happened today.

704
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,187
Hurry up and go.

705
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,606
- Let's go.
- Hurry up.

706
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:11,821
JUNG HYUNWOO

707
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:19,120
Hello?

708
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:23,166
Why do you keep prank-calling me?

709
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:37,889
It's true.

710
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:39,766
We were sleeping

711
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:43,436
and four hands came through the window.

712
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:44,729
It's true.

713
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:47,607
Do you have a physical description?
Did you see their faces?

714
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:50,443
I didn't see their faces,
but they looked like middle schoolers.

715
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:52,904
One of them was wearing a blue hat.

716
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:54,405
And...

717
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:57,492
Is there anything besides that?

718
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:01,162
I don't remember that well.

719
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:03,873
I was only thinking about catching them.

720
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:05,792
Is there really no way to catch them?

721
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,547
A ghost, my foot.

722
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:14,175
Forget ghosts. You'll have to move
because of these hidden camera offenders.

723
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:19,472
- But I don't have the money to move.

724
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:22,892
Hey, Sanyeong.

725
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:25,812
What is that?

726
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:34,737
Are you okay?

727
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:39,158
What?

728
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,662
Is he dead?

729
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:47,625
I think he's actually dead!

730
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:51,421
My gosh.

731
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:56,050
Sanyeong, what do we do?

732
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:01,598
POLICE LINE

733
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:04,559
You were on your way back
from reporting it to the police?

734
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:05,893
What time was that exactly?

735
01:00:11,649 --> 01:00:13,526
EMERGENCY MEDICAL TEAM

736
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:18,072
An evil spirit has latched onto you.

737
01:00:18,072 --> 01:00:20,950
People you don't like
or you wish would disappear will die.

738
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:24,495
Evil spirits are said to grow
by fulfilling a person's desires.

739
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:25,788
He's dead.

740
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:28,833
The one latched onto you is different.
It's a very dangerous ghost.

741
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:29,959
Ghosts...

742
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:33,087
are actually real.

743
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,177
If historiography mainly focuses

744
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:42,263
on the history of palaces
and the ruling class,

745
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:45,391
folklore focuses on the lives and culture

746
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:48,478
of our actual ancestors
and the people outside of the palace.

747
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,355
We study what kinds of food we ate,

748
01:00:50,938 --> 01:00:52,357
what games we enjoyed,

749
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:55,526
what we believed in,

750
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,070
and what we feared.

751
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:09,374
Some people call them old stories
told by grandmothers and ignore them

752
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:12,001
while others say
it's already a dead academic field.

753
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:15,880
However, in a few hundred years,

754
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,924
someone will study our generation.

755
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:19,133
I have a question, Professor!

756
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:21,010
- Yes?
- Can you...

757
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:22,970
really see ghosts?

758
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,517
"Ghosts don't exist, and it's all a lie."

759
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,102
Is that what you want to hear?

760
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:30,603
But there are ghosts.

761
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:32,563
I can see ghosts...

762
01:01:33,898 --> 01:01:35,483
in this lecture room as well.

763
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:39,946
Over there.

764
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:42,031
-  What is that?
-  Oh, my heart...

765
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:43,408
-  Why is she there?
-  She scared me.

766
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:54,168
-  Ghosts.
-  Ghosts.

767
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:55,545
Stop it.

768
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:57,547
-  That professor is weird.
-  Stop.

769
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,424
He sees ghosts, it's really unsettling.

770
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:02,385
I guess I'm not the only one
who thinks you're crazy.

771
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:04,721
Come on, get up. Let's go.

772
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,264
Excuse me.

773
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:08,683
-  Yes?
- I'm not crazy.

774
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:11,936
Yes, of course.

775
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:13,479
He really must be crazy.

776
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:15,565
I told you to be quiet.
Hurry up and go.

777
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:20,403
- Neither you nor they believe what I say.

778
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:51,350
What's going on?

779
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:56,647
Did someone get on?

780
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,400
It's better if you don't know.

781
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:21,047
You don't have to make things creepy
just because I came to find you.

782
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:34,101
She's human.

783
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:47,073
Have a seat.

784
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:01,921
Did something happen?

785
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:12,014
About what you said before.

786
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:14,725
You said people could die...

787
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:18,604
because of me.

788
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,107
Can you tell me more about it?

789
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:23,568
You said you didn't believe in ghosts.

790
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:25,444
I don't.

791
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:27,488
I don't believe in them, but...

792
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,329
Never mind.

793
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:36,664
Tell me.

794
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:42,169
Tell me what happened.

795
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:50,720
Two people...

796
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:53,556
around me died.

797
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:56,684
The voice phishing offender
who took all of our money

798
01:04:57,101 --> 01:04:59,061
and a young kid.

799
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:11,324
But it's the same size as before.

800
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:13,075
What?

801
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:15,870
It's the same size.

802
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:19,665
You said two people died?

803
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:22,209
Can I see photos of them?

804
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:24,295
Why do you want their photos?

805
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:27,465
His name was Kim Jinwook.

806
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,508
He attended a nearby middle school.

807
01:05:31,969 --> 01:05:32,970
It's this way.

808
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:36,766
One moment, please.

809
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:50,529
Let's go.

810
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:05,127
That's him.

811
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,799
You said he fell down a flight of stairs?

812
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:12,426
He didn't simply die from falling.
A ghost did this.

813
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:18,766
So are you saying this is because of me?

814
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:22,812
No, it's a different ghost.

815
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:24,855
There's another ghost like this?

816
01:06:24,855 --> 01:06:28,359
Many different things exist
in this world alongside us.

817
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:31,320
As numerous as the beliefs or fears

818
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,573
that each person has.

819
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:51,841
Hey, you guys!

820
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:58,639
FUNERAL HOME ENTRANCE

821
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:00,558
Hey!

822
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:04,020
What's wrong with you?

823
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,605
You guys are
the hidden camera offenders, right?

824
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:10,109
What are you talking about?

825
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:17,116
Jung Heetae and Gil Sunghyun
from Boksun Middle School.

826
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:21,287
I'll report you guys
to the police if you keep lying.

827
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:32,548
You guys were with him
the night he died, right?

828
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:33,966
No, we weren't.

829
01:07:33,966 --> 01:07:37,344
What do you mean, "no"?
I saw you guys with my own two eyes.

830
01:07:37,344 --> 01:07:39,847
We went our separate ways
after you chased us.

831
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:42,850
We really don't know how Jinwook died.

832
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:45,102
But it was you guys.

833
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:47,730
What about the other kid? Where is he?

834
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,231
Other kid?

835
01:07:49,815 --> 01:07:52,276
Who are you talking about?

836
01:07:52,276 --> 01:07:54,487
There were four of you.

837
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,113
What was it,

838
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:59,742
the hand with "4237" on it?

839
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:02,870
The one with the numbers on his hand.
Where is he?

840
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:09,752
"4237."

841
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:12,713
How do you know that?

842
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:16,884
I know because I saw it

843
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:20,387
when you guys
took photos with your cell phones.

844
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:24,934
We really don't know anything.

845
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:27,520
Hey, come back!

846
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,396
We have to catch them!

847
01:08:30,022 --> 01:08:31,273
Hey!

848
01:08:33,025 --> 01:08:35,069
A ghost has latched onto them too.

849
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:43,410
Does that mean they might die too?

850
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:48,082
It doesn't make sense to go back now.

851
01:08:48,582 --> 01:08:50,084
You said they might die.

852
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:52,837
I'll take care of things from now on.
You should go home.

853
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:54,547
How are you going to take care of things?

854
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:57,133
I'm not sure yet.

855
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:58,717
Every ghost is different.

856
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:02,096
After I figure out
what kind of ghost it is,

857
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:05,474
I'll have to think of something.

858
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:08,394
Do you mean what you said?

859
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:12,189
That kid dying...

860
01:09:13,732 --> 01:09:15,609
has nothing to do with me, right?

861
01:09:16,735 --> 01:09:17,820
No, it doesn't.

862
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:21,407
Okay.

863
01:09:35,963 --> 01:09:37,256
Excuse me.

864
01:09:41,802 --> 01:09:45,973
You said it was a ghost, right?

865
01:09:45,973 --> 01:09:50,019
What do you do if it really turns out

866
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:51,896
to be an actual ghost?

867
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:55,316
Do I throw salt or green onions at it?

868
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:59,403
You listen to them and learn their names
and the reason why they're still here.

869
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:02,114
How can I listen to what they say
if I can't see them?

870
01:10:03,073 --> 01:10:05,618
- Also, be careful around doors.
- Doors?

871
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:08,287
The worlds inside
and outside a door are different.

872
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:10,623
Doors are the passageways
that connect those worlds.

873
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:13,042
If someone knocks
on the outside of a door,

874
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:15,878
make sure you know who they are
before you open it.

875
01:10:20,674 --> 01:10:21,675
Doors?

876
01:10:33,812 --> 01:10:34,980
Hey, excuse me.

877
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:37,983
- Can I ask you something?
-  Sure.

878
01:10:37,983 --> 01:10:41,695
Do you happen to know Gil Sunghyun
or Jung Heetae from your school?

879
01:10:49,453 --> 01:10:51,497
Why did you ask to meet
on the coldest day?

880
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:57,211
These are the documents about Kim Jinwook,
the student who died on the stairs.

881
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:00,256
CASE REPORT

882
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:04,301
Don't come to the station like last time
and get called a crazy person, okay?

883
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:07,763
If you're looking
into things like this, just tell me.

884
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:10,057
Was the deceased kid
a perpetrator of school violence?

885
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:11,809
- Hurry up.
- It's so cold.

886
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:14,937
Apparently, he took a transfer
student to the rooftop and bullied him.

887
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:16,438
In the end, the victim

888
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:18,732
fell from the rooftop ledge and died.

889
01:11:18,732 --> 01:11:21,568
-  Oh, my gosh.
-  Hey, what's going on?

890
01:11:21,568 --> 01:11:23,862
-  What happened?
-  Hey, move.

891
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:26,282
-  What's going on?
-  Oh, gosh.

892
01:11:29,159 --> 01:11:30,619
Let's go someplace warm, there's a--

893
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:31,787
Thank you.

894
01:11:32,496 --> 01:11:33,622
Where are you going now?

895
01:11:34,206 --> 01:11:35,833
I need to meet the family

896
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:37,543
of the deceased kid, Jung Hyunwoo.

897
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,421
He must have become a vengeful ghost.

898
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:44,800
Please don't talk about ghosts
while you're there, okay?

899
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:58,522
JUNG HYUNWOO

900
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:05,279
House 1-4?

901
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:08,532
House 1-4?

902
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:13,704
Please save me. I'm sorry.

903
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:14,913
It was my fault.

904
01:12:14,913 --> 01:12:16,123
What are you doing?

905
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:18,625
I'm sorry for taking a picture
of your guys' room.

906
01:12:19,209 --> 01:12:21,003
I'll tell the police too.

907
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:22,880
I'm really sorry,

908
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,507
so please save me.

909
01:12:26,717 --> 01:12:28,260
Hey, get up.

910
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:33,182
What are you saying?
Did someone say they would kill you?

911
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:34,892
You said you saw Hyunwoo,

912
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:36,477
who died.

913
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:39,521
You said you saw his hand
with "4237" on it.

914
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:42,524
He's dead?

915
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:44,693
That kid?

916
01:13:09,593 --> 01:13:10,803
Is anyone there?

917
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:18,685
Is anyone there?

918
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:40,040
Where is the cell phone?

919
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:43,669
Over there, on the bed.

920
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:51,260
I keep getting calls

921
01:13:52,344 --> 01:13:54,638
from Hyunwoo, who is dead.

922
01:13:54,638 --> 01:13:57,349
Are you sure Hyunwoo is dead?

923
01:13:57,349 --> 01:13:58,559
Definitely.

924
01:13:58,559 --> 01:13:59,935
What does he say...

925
01:14:01,353 --> 01:14:02,646
when he calls?

926
01:14:03,814 --> 01:14:05,399
A little girl cries...

927
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:08,902
without saying anything.

928
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:24,084
Excuse me. May I speak with you?

929
01:14:24,668 --> 01:14:26,378
The people living in Unit 101...

930
01:14:36,263 --> 01:14:37,848
"4237."

931
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:54,031
The door.

932
01:14:58,202 --> 01:15:00,746
The worlds inside
and outside a door are different.

933
01:15:01,788 --> 01:15:04,166
Doors are the passageways
that connect those worlds.

934
01:15:58,595 --> 01:16:02,474
REVENANT

935
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:05,519
SPECIAL THANKS TO KIM SUNGKYU

936
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:26,456
The dead kid used to talk about
a younger sibling.

937
01:16:26,456 --> 01:16:28,041
Not for you.

938
01:16:28,041 --> 01:16:29,835
The evil spirit is still possessing you.

939
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:32,045
No. There's no such thing as ghosts.

940
01:16:32,045 --> 01:16:33,964
You think Gu Sanyeong
is the culprit?

941
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:35,841
It's the same for these cases.

942
01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:38,969
There were red bruises
on the victim's wrists.

943
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:42,055
There have been
similar cases for a long time now.

944
01:16:42,055 --> 01:16:44,975
Has Ms. Sanyeong
touched anything ominous recently?

945
01:16:44,975 --> 01:16:47,644
Are you perhaps
referring to the red hair accessory?

946
01:16:47,644 --> 01:16:48,812
A red hair accessory?

947
01:16:49,896 --> 01:16:51,523
"The shadow with flowing hair

948
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:54,109
indulges humans in their desires

949
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:56,987
and grows in size."

950
01:17:10,542 --> 01:17:12,544
