00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:46,046
REVENANT

00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:49,257
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,009
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
IN SAFE SITUATIONS

00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,818
EPISODE 2

5
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,627
Who are you?
What are you doing in front of our house?

6
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,378
I'm sorry, ma'am.

7
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,100
Are you Hyunwoo's parents?

8
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,392
Are you here for him?

9
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,394
Don't you know he's dead?

10
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,524
You need to leave!

11
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,734
- We're done talking.
-  But...

12
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:52,112
If you don't, we'll call the police.

13
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,532
What are you doing? Let's head inside.

14
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,849
What's going on?

15
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,106
- A mirror.
- What?

16
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,442
Do you have one?

17
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,446
- What do you mean?
- Where can I find a mirror?

18
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,825
There's one down there.

19
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,386
You listen to them

20
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,847
and learn their names
and the reason why they're still here.

21
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,516
Why did he die?

22
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:48,645
- Sorry?
- Why did Hyunwoo die?

23
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,812
Did you guys kill him?

24
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,231
No, we didn't.

25
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,482
We're innocent.

26
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,818
We didn't even hit him. Someone else did.

27
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,029
Gosh, it's freezing.

28
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:01,115
Jeez, why does that idiot
keep following us?

29
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,953
Maybe he thinks we're friends
since we saved him from the bullies once.

30
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:06,621
I wish he'd stop following us.

31
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,623
People are starting to think
we bullied him

32
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,500
since he keeps following us around.

33
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:12,835
Help me.

34
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,587
Hey, just ignore him.

35
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,257
-  What's that?
-  I finally got one myself.

36
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,716
Isn't that the new one?

37
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,260
How did you get it?

38
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,344
Let me try.

39
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,346
Did you steal this from that old fogey?

40
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,639
No, I didn't.

41
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,974
Hey.

42
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,184
What's wrong with him?

43
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,812
Hey, what are you doing?

44
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,147
Please go to my house.

45
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,984
Let me know...

46
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,321
what happens to my family...

47
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,449
after I die.

48
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,201
What is he saying?

49
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,328
-  Hey!

50
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,664
Hey!

51
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,666
-  Hey.
-  What happened?

52
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,210
It's Hyunwoo!

53
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,461
It was suicide?

54
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,796
That's what I'm telling you.

55
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,509
But I kept getting calls from him.

56
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,262
I was scared, so I filmed your house.

57
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,682
I thought it was his place.

58
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,647
That's all?

59
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,026
Well...

60
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,611
Why do you want to know
information about Jung Hyunwoo?

61
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,864
Did he have any siblings?

62
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,574
No, he was an only child.

63
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,827
- Are you sure?
-Be my guest and find out for yourself.

64
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,371
I checked his resident register

65
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,832
and family certificate.

66
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:36,044
-Why do you ask?
- Never mind. I'll call you later.

67
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,300
Hello?

68
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,094
The dead kid used to talk
about a younger sibling.

69
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,264
He said he pitied his sibling.

70
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,474
That's what the boys said.

71
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,895
Okay, I'll call you back later.

72
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,170
It was a lie.

73
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,672
I even asked his former schoolmates.

74
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,216
He never had a sibling.

75
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,219
I think he was just crazy.

76
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,790
You should go home.

77
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,750
What's the matter?

78
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,546
Hey! Where are you going?

79
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:06,884
Darn it!

80
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:00,980
Are you okay?

81
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,399
Hang on.

82
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,944
I'll help you.

83
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:27,548
Hello, sir.

84
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,969
Remember that boy who recently tripped
and fell to his death?

85
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,931
- What about him?
- Someone who had parked nearby

86
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,183
found something odd
on their dashcam and reported it.

87
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,605
That's the alley where we found his body.

88
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,773
Right.

89
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:48,903
But...

90
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:21,018
When did she take Hyunwoo's phone?

91
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:27,441
Did you check all the numbers she called?

92
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,777
I found one kid.

93
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,113
But he tripped and fell to his death

94
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,864
while running away.

95
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,267
Word will get out

96
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,769
in this neighborhood too.

97
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,230
We didn't even register her birth.

98
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,566
Let me help you.

99
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,484
We can kill her so no one finds out.

100
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,696
That was what we agreed on.

101
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,256
What will we do about that man?

102
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,263
What are you doing?

103
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,267
Hey! What are you doing in there?

104
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,229
-  Damn it!

105
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,606
Don't do it!

106
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,316
Let me help you.

107
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,734
Let's go outside.

108
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,194
Hyunwoo told me to help you.

109
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,076
You know Hyunwoo, right?

110
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,912
Hyunwoo.

111
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,211
- How dare you report it?

112
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,546
How dare you?

113
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,715
Hyunwoo told me to help you.

114
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,133
Why don't we go outside?

115
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,644
Let's go outside.

116
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,187
Can you do that?

117
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:32,942
Be careful.

118
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,610
That's it.

119
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,863
That's it!

120
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,201
- What do you think you're doing?

121
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,496
What are you doing? Go outside!

122
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,593
Climb up. You can do it.

123
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,183
You're almost there.

124
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:10,688
Who the hell are you?

125
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,408
-  What are you trying to do?
- Let me go!

126
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,701
Stop it!

127
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,746
-  Let me go!
-  Don't do this!

128
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,382
Are you feeling all right?

129
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,224
Do you still see it? The red spot.

130
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,060
-  Did you find them?
-  Yes.

131
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,856
I'm Gil Sunghyun,
an eighth grader at Oksun Middle School.

132
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,901
How did you find them?

133
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,279
I was following that woman.

134
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,949
A girl was confined in their basement.

135
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,485
Our parents are asleep,
so you can eat slowly.

136
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,282
I thought of a name for you.

137
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,244
How does "Hyunji" sound?

138
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,329
Jung Hyunji.

139
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,922
Eat slowly, Hyunji.

140
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:13,936
This is called an ocean.

141
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:16,939
Isn't it pretty?

142
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,483
Let's visit one together.

143
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,611
I promise I'll take you there.

144
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,831
I don't see him anymore. He disappeared.

145
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,250
Is everything over now?

146
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,132
Not for you.

147
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,509
The evil spirit is still latched onto you.

148
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,594
No.

149
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,722
There's no such thing as ghosts.

150
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,142
Humans are more terrifying than ghosts.

151
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,187
Hyunwoo and Jinwook died
because of evil people

152
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,440
like them.

153
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,526
Not because of ghosts.

154
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,831
BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY

155
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,666
Ms. Gu Sanyeong.

156
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,502
Please hand it in if you're done.

157
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,761
One minute, please.

158
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,766
Your stress level is extremely high.

159
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,477
You're not sleeping much either.

160
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:40,564
It's highly likely
that you may hallucinate or hear things.

161
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:45,527
My mother has been suffering
from anxiety disorder for a long time.

162
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:46,946
Could that have affected me?

163
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,657
If a close family member
has a long-standing medical condition,

164
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,284
it could be one of the factors
causing your stress.

165
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,871
But the hereditary aspect of it
hasn't been scientifically proven yet.

166
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,791
I'll prescribe you some medication.

167
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,876
Let's see if it improves your condition.

168
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,462
Do you believe in ghosts, Doctor?

169
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:08,968
I mean...

170
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,513
Do you think ghosts exist?

171
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:15,641
You could have hallucinated
in your susceptible condition,

172
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,934
but they are not real.

173
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,103
Ghosts do not exist.

174
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,076
That house was worse than a haunted one.

175
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,705
How could they do such a heinous deed?

176
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,924
I really want to move out.

177
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,176
I feel bad for the kids,

178
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,096
but I don't think

179
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,099
I can live there anymore.

180
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:08,736
People who live in
those apartments must have problems too.

181
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,196
But I'd like...

182
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,866
to suffer there instead.

183
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:18,746
At least I'd be miserable but still happy.

184
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:36,889
- Do you need me to pray for his soul?

185
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,766
Yes, please.

186
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:48,108
JUNG HYUNWOO

187
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,422
Why do you drink every day?

188
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:14,760
But I get it.

189
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,763
You'll need something
to help you get through it.

190
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:21,725
You tell people about the things you see,
but they think you're insane.

191
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,354
You've finally found
the evil spirit you've been looking for,

192
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,272
but you can't even catch it.

193
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,400
About that man, Professor Gu Gangmo.

194
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,321
Why do you think he did it?

195
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,867
He wrote a letter to you, a stranger,
asking you to protect his daughter.

196
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,662
Despite never meeting you
when you asked him to.

197
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,917
Plus, he knew that an evil spirit
would latch onto his daughter.

198
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,213
How did he know that?

199
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,424
We'll find out once we figure out
why that evil spirit...

200
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,344
chose to latch onto her.

201
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,805
Your mother has already passed away.

202
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:03,892
Why are you trying to catch it
when doing so won't change anything?

203
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,731
You could get hurt.

204
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,443
It could get more painful.

205
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,574
It can't be more painful
than what I endured so far.

206
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,623
-  Where are we going?
-  Just follow me.

207
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,209
Wait.

208
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,213
At least tell me where we're going.

209
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,424
You won't come if I do.

210
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,301
Jeez, I promise I'll go.

211
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,511
You have my word, so tell me.

212
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,513
Remember Seo Yoonjung?
Our high school colleague.

213
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,225
- That obnoxious brat?
- Yes, her.

214
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,020
She's getting married.
She'll hand out her invitations today.

215
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,313
Why should we go there?

216
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,565
You despised her too.

217
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,733
I know.

218
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:57,738
But she's getting married to this guy
who's two years our senior.

219
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,574
Do you still not get it?

220
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,242
No, tell me.

221
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,745
His best friend was my first love.

222
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,663
And he'll be there today.

223
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,332
So let's go.

224
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:12,461
You mean that guy who's called
"Honey" or "Homestay," right?

225
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,005
How could you? He's my first love!

226
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,673
"First love," my foot.

227
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,593
You always fell in love with someone new
since elementary school.

228
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,095
You could say he's your 18th first love.

229
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,724
Whatever. I'm not going.

230
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,435
Hey. Come on!

231
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,519
We have to go!

232
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,066
Darn it.

233
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,196
Hey, you're here.

234
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,157
- He's my fiancé. You know him, right?
-  Hello.

235
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,408
Hello.

236
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,161
Hongsae.

237
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,789
How have you been?

238
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:52,918
I'm all right. It's been a long time.
How about you?

239
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,336
I'm good too.

240
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,589
She's Gu Sanyeong,
my friend from Taeheung High School.

241
00:20:58,548 --> 00:20:59,758
I know her.

242
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,385
You do?

243
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,097
Yes. It's a long story.

244
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,601
You should be more polite.

245
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,813
Come on. He's two years our senior.

246
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:16,775
Hey.

247
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,320
-  Long time no see.
-  It's nice to see you again.

248
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,873
What do you think? Handsome, right?

249
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,584
Isn't this your first time
seeing him properly?

250
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,714
Pass.

251
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,007
Okay, take it.

252
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,842
Shoot. Goal!

253
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:45,429
Again, shoot!

254
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,266
-  Spread out.
- Sanyeong.

255
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,101
That's the Honey guy
I told you about. Look.

256
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:54,521
Whatever. Stop waking me up.

257
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:55,731
Jeez.

258
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,053
Nice.

259
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:35,062
They must've run around very passionately.

260
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,950
My dad told me to go to Hawaii
for our honeymoon.

261
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,244
But I've been there too many times,
so I'm sick of it.

262
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:54,414
Any quiet but exotic places you know of?

263
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,541
- The cost doesn't matter.
- I've never been to Hawaii.

264
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,338
I talked too much about myself, didn't I?

265
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,549
How have you all been?

266
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,677
Dahye, I heard you got a new job.

267
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:10,055
- How is it?
- I need to go to the bathroom.

268
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,184
Go ahead.

269
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,609
Hongsae, isn't it tough to be a detective?

270
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,077
There's no such thing as an easy job.

271
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:33,787
That's why we get paid.

272
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,124
You should give it a try

273
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,042
and stop using your dad's money.

274
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,054
Sanyeong.

275
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,974
You still look good in casual clothes.

276
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:58,186
But don't you think
you're a little underdressed?

277
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,856
You should be dressed up for the occasion.

278
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,499
- Are you okay?
-  Yes, I'm fine.

279
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,803
I should get going first.

280
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,889
- Why? Have some more.
-  I'm full.

281
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,391
I have a part-time job tomorrow
that pays handsomely.

282
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,268
Tell Semi that I left first.

283
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,817
Bye. Congratulations on your wedding.

284
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:46,902
Bye.

285
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,782
- She must be busy.
- I see.

286
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,550
Hey, where are you going?

287
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,220
You're really...

288
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,890
You haven't changed one bit.
You're so full of yourself.

289
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,851
Was he talking to me?

290
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,164
Please be careful with that.

291
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:42,749
Please be gentle.

292
00:25:54,803 --> 00:26:00,058
Find my Salzburg!

293
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,814
Here. Is this it?

294
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,025
-  That's not it, you idiot.

295
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,244
PROFESSOR YEOM HAESANG

296
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,288
Stop crying, will you?

297
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:25,166
-  My Salzburg is gone!
- Hello.

298
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:29,004
Have you seen a doll in a plaid dress?

299
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,298
We got it in Austria.

300
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,300
It's her favorite doll.

301
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,556
Why are you being such a baby today?

302
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:41,808
I'm sorry.

303
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,476
That's okay.

304
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:46,479
Excuse me.
Where should I put this drawing?

305
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:47,814
One minute, please.

306
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,567
I'll leave you to it.

307
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,319
Sorry?

308
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:54,070
- Wait.
-  Salzburg!

309
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,781
But she's still crying.

310
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,825
Salzburg!

311
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:09,169
- Fine. Let's look for it.
-  Find it!

312
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,254
All right.

313
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,344
LANDLADY

314
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,306
Goodness.

315
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,439
Hello.

316
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:31,733
Hello.

317
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:38,698
Excuse me. Whom are you looking for?

318
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:51,878
Why do you want to see Sanyeong?

319
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,673
Are you the employer
for her part-time job?

320
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,384
Did she perhaps do something wrong?

321
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,137
I apologize for the late introduction.

322
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,391
I'm Yeom Haesang, a folklore professor
at Jeyoung University.

323
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:06,976
YEOM HAESANG

324
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,187
A folklore professor?

325
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,607
- You should go.
- This is important.

326
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,859
- Please just leave.
- Ms. Sanyeong is...

327
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:18,988
Has Ms. Sanyeong...

328
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,950
been someplace

329
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,869
or touched anything ominous recently?

330
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:26,663
What do you mean?

331
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,332
Is Sanyeong in danger?

332
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,334
An old object, perhaps.

333
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,670
Or something that was thrown away.

334
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:39,884
Are you perhaps referring
to the red hair accessory?

335
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,431
A red hair accessory?

336
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:47,559
Her father had left it for her.

337
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,270
May I see it?

338
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,398
We don't have it. We left it at his place.

339
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,233
Why? What about it?

340
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:59,070
Please excuse me. I'll be in touch.

341
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,781
What? Wait.

342
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:21,593
HAIR ACCESSORY

343
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:29,601
PINE FOREST, JAEGOGAE
SACRED TREE

344
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,733
Professor Yeom Haesang
came to our house.

345
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,943
He asked about the red hair accessory.

346
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,321
-Do you know him?

347
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:45,950
-  Sanyeong.
-  Yes?

348
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,076
You must be exhausted.

349
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,913
That girl just wouldn't stop crying.

350
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,289
- I'm okay.

351
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,999
Just sign here and you're free to go.

352
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,209
- Okay.
-  Sir!

353
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,127
Yes?

354
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,909
That damned brat shouldn't
whine if she was lucky enough

355
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,953
to have wealthy parents.

356
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:16,499
They always dote on her
and buy her everything she wants.

357
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:18,585
No wonder that brat has no manners.

358
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,221
How did this...

359
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,281
Guess my name.

360
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,473
Grandmother's house.

361
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:04,227
Why...

362
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,064
did I see that place?

363
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:23,621
CHOI MANWOL, SHAMAN
BORN IN 1914

364
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,514
RED HAIR ACCESSORY, JADE HAIRPIN,
BLACK RUBBER BAND...

365
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:42,723
THE EVIL SPIRIT IS A JUVENILE GHOST

366
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,825
Hello.

367
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,119
Do you remember me?

368
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,788
I attended Professor Gu's funeral.

369
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:06,873
What brings you here?

370
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,916
I heard Professor Gu left

371
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:12,753
a red hair accessory for his daughter.

372
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:16,090
I'm sorry, but could I see it?

373
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:32,273
Why did you want to see it?

374
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,781
Professor Gu had this?

375
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:46,412
Since when did he possess this?

376
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,540
Why?

377
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:53,294
Was he doing research
regarding this hair accessory?

378
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,589
Then he must have left
some research notes.

379
00:36:56,589 --> 00:37:00,343
If it's all right with you,
may I see them?

380
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,644
Excuse me.

381
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,620
Sanyeong?

382
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,038
What brings you here?

383
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:43,511
No.

384
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,054
No.

385
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,244
Ma'am!

386
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,962
No!

387
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,339
No!

388
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,178
HAIR ACCESSORY

389
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,105
No!

390
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:44,780
Call 911.

391
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,158
Hurry up and call them!

392
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,915
Hurry up!

393
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,172
Is this 911?

394
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,757
Someone is hurt!

395
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,551
There's a fire too!

396
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,556
The location is Hwawonjae! Please hurry!

397
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:34,747
Here you go.

398
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,459
Why were you here?

399
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:41,879
I wanted to ask her
about Professor Gu's research.

400
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,758
But how did that old lady

401
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:48,177
even hang herself so high up?

402
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,680
Would you believe me
if I said a ghost did it?

403
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,890
Sorry?

404
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,146
Munchun.

405
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,649
-  Gosh.
-  What brings you here?

406
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,943
Long time no see. Have you been well?

407
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,277
Yes, I have.

408
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:06,779
What brings you here?

409
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:13,994
May I have a word with Professor Yeom?

410
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,497
Sure, go ahead.

411
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:28,592
There must be a notebook
that was burned in the fire.

412
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,429
I must know what was written in it.

413
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,764
Could you please restore it?

414
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,059
Is that why you called me?

415
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:39,937
Do you remember Professor Gu Gangmo,
the person I always mentioned?

416
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,481
This is his house.

417
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:46,485
And it was his mother
who passed away tonight.

418
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:48,737
I'm certain that I can find...

419
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:53,409
a lead here regarding the evil spirit
that murdered my mother.

420
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,286
Professor Yeom.

421
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,663
How many times must I repeat myself?

422
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:01,000
I'm looking for a suspect, not a ghost.

423
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,252
- Detective--
- And why is she here?

424
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,298
Do you know Ms. Gu Sanyeong?

425
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,008
How?

426
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:11,844
You don't need to know that.

427
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:15,806
Was she present when the victim died?

428
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,017
Are you suspecting her?

429
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:22,021
Listen. People are more frightening
than ghosts.

430
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:25,065
Even more so
if a hefty sum of money is involved.

431
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:28,903
She's the sole inheritor of that woman.

432
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,405
Isn't that the perfect motive?

433
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,491
She didn't do it.

434
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,451
The police will find out if she did it

435
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:38,204
or if it was simply suicide.

436
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:41,707
So stop getting involved
in these cases and just go home.

437
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:23,267
Die. Then you'll realize
how desperate you were to live.

438
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,108
Are you nuts?

439
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,620
What are you doing?

440
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,780
Were you trying to kill yourself?

441
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,911
I've wanted to run away all my life.

442
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,205
But still,

443
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:28,624
I tried my best to hang on.

444
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:30,501
Because...

445
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:39,176
I truly wanted a life for my mom and me.

446
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,012
I wanted us to be happy.

447
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:46,975
I don't know why this happened.

448
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,354
But I...

449
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,483
don't want to die.

450
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,237
I can't.

451
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,365
You're right.

452
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,993
You shouldn't die. I agree.

453
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,217
This is just the beginning.

454
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,137
Let's go. We need to talk.

455
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:26,014
Something bad will happen...

456
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,477
if you stay by my side.

457
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:33,856
So why are you doing this?

458
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,566
It doesn't matter.

459
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,609
I don't care what happens.

460
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,196
So come with me.

461
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,190
WITNESS STATEMENT

462
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,357
PHOTOS OF CRIME SCENE

463
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:19,860
Did you say the woman with bruised wrists
who committed suicide

464
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,904
was Gu Sanyeong's paternal grandmother?

465
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,325
The same goes for that case.

466
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,409
Who was he?

467
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:29,578
Professor Gu Gangmo, her father.

468
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,288
He committed suicide recently,

469
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,207
and his wrists were also bruised.

470
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,251
DARK BRUISES ON WRISTS

471
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:39,588
You think Gu Sanyeong is the culprit
of these cases as well?

472
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:49,598
Based on the circumstances,
suicide is highly likely in both cases.

473
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:53,852
Let's look for more ordinary
and decent cases

474
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:55,437
instead of cases like these.

475
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:01,610
Do you want to solve a decent case
and receive a promotion?

476
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:04,822
What? What do you mean?

477
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,533
Rumor has it that you're desperate
for a promotion.

478
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,159
Who told you that?

479
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:13,163
It's normal to want a promotion.

480
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,248
Pardon?

481
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:17,125
Who doesn't like a good promotion?

482
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:20,087
I was desperate for one too.

483
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,965
I just wasn't competent enough.

484
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,300
So...

485
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,804
Let's give this case a try.

486
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:30,973
I don't understand.

487
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:38,814
1995 BED AND BREAKFAST SUICIDE CASE

488
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,774
- It's the same for these cases.
- Sorry?

489
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:44,194
All of the victims committed suicide
and had bruised wrists.

490
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,196
2000 RAW FISH RESTAURANT SUICIDE CASE

491
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:47,906
2002 BAEKCHAGOL SUICIDE CASE

492
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:50,409
Have you been collecting these?

493
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:52,369
- Yes.
- What for?

494
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:57,124
We got a call about a fire
at a small bed and breakfast in 1995.

495
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,960
The caller was the owner of that place.

496
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:06,842
We found a deceased woman
in that building.

497
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,594
She had hung herself on a ridgepole.

498
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:13,056
There were red bruises
on the victim's wrists.

499
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,767
Did she come here alone?

500
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:18,854
No, she was with her young son.

501
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,397
Her son?

502
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:26,778
-  I found him!
-The boy was found in a nearby mountain.

503
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:30,616
He claimed that there was
someone else with themat that time.

504
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:34,202
-  Carry him.
- He also said that it wasn't suicide.

505
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:39,875
He was very young.
Maybe he remembered it differently.

506
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,628
That's what I thought as well.

507
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:47,466
The suspect disappeared
from the crime scene.

508
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:51,053
In the end, we never found them.

509
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:55,015
After all, there weren't many
surveillance cameras back then.

510
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:59,311
Then was this your first case?

511
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:01,647
Correct.

512
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,483
I was inexperienced

513
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,818
and didn't know any better.

514
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,696
That case weighed heavily on my heart.

515
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:13,784
But these cases continued to occur.

516
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:17,871
There have been similar cases
for a long time now.

517
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:20,832
So why don't we try...

518
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:25,420
solving these cases?

519
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:29,925
Look. In any case,

520
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:32,094
you failed to solve them to this day.

521
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:34,680
So how will we possibly solve them now?

522
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:37,683
I'm sure there were cases
that we overlooked.

523
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:41,186
Let's scan through all the suicide cases
and find a similarity in them.

524
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:45,440
Sir. Korea has the highest suicide rate
among all OECD member countries.

525
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,485
Are you saying we should look
through all those cases?

526
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,530
We have the highest rate?

527
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,326
See?

528
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:59,871
A special promotion is guaranteed
if we solve this.

529
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:03,333
Sir, you keep mentioning
getting a promotion.

530
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,794
It's not that I want
to get a promotion or anything.

531
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:19,850
I'm not doing this to get a promotion.

532
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,518
I'm only helping you

533
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,437
since it was your first case.

534
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,398
All right.

535
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:28,567
- I'll be choosing our next case.

536
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:29,818
Sure.

537
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:32,154
- That's a promise.
- Deal.

538
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:34,990
Have a seat.

539
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,410
What did you want to tell me?

540
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,166
Do you now see it too?

541
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:56,344
That's the evil spirit possessing you.

542
00:50:57,179 --> 00:51:00,098
It grew in size
since the first time we met.

543
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:02,768
The shadow became larger...

544
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:07,022
as it murdered more people.

545
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:16,865
It latched onto you

546
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,868
when you received this.

547
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,039
That's ridiculous.

548
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:26,333
That was from my late father.

549
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,504
He sent me this letter
before he passed away.

550
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:39,179
GU GANGMO

551
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:43,600
I thought you didn't know him.

552
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,103
So why did he send you this letter?

553
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,354
I don't know.

554
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:55,946
IF I DIE, PLEASE HELP MY DAUGHTER

555
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,864
HER NAME IS GU SANYEONG
HER NUMBER IS...

556
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:58,949
What?

557
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,286
Why did he want you to help me?

558
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:04,538
I believe

559
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:08,083
he knew that the evil spirit
would possess you

560
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,877
because of this hair accessory.

561
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,046
So he gave that possessed object to me...

562
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:16,716
on purpose?

563
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:20,887
I know we separated when I was little,
but I'm still his daughter.

564
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:22,055
So why?

565
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,932
That's what I'm curious about too.

566
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:26,601
Why?

567
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:29,729
Why did he give this cursed object to you?

568
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,821
Did you recognize what kind of object
this hair accessory was

569
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,157
from the get-go?

570
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,741
Yes.

571
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,912
I had looked for it for a long time.

572
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:49,166
I'd rush over whenever I heard

573
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:51,626
about this object.

574
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:53,587
When my mother passed away,

575
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:57,257
she was holding this.

576
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:07,058
YEAR 1995

577
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,643
Strike.

578
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:31,374
Dad.

579
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,670
Dad...

580
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:46,473
It happened when I was very young.

581
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,517
It was not long
after my father passed away.

582
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:53,605
I was sick.

583
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:56,024
-And my mother took me somewhere.

584
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:48,535
HAEDOJI BED AND BREAKFAST

585
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:23,528
Mom?

586
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:44,507
No!

587
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:56,978
You opened the door.

588
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:03,401
SANAE HOSPITAL
YEOM HAESANG

589
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:05,487
Why do you think
she committed suicide in that place

590
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,822
after bringing her young son with her?

591
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:09,783
I'm not sure.

592
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:13,536
I couldn't reach her for days
after she had taken her sick son with her.

593
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,331
So I was getting worried too.

594
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:17,499
I see.

595
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:21,628
Where's my mom?

596
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:26,841
Grandma, where's my mom?

597
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,181
She's dead.

598
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:35,475
Your mom

599
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,769
took her own life.

600
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,648
It wasn't suicide.

601
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,359
My mom was heading east.

602
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:48,947
East. Where the sun rises.

603
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:51,032
A place ghosts avoid.

604
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,869
It was the same evil spirit
that latched onto you.

605
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:59,040
She was killed

606
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,668
while trying to run away from it.

607
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:08,216
Mom.

608
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,510
Mom.

609
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:18,518
What's wrong?

610
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:26,651
Mom.

611
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:28,862
Mom.

612
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:32,323
- Mom!

613
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,464
No, Haesang.

614
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:48,590
No.

615
00:57:58,057 --> 00:58:00,059
Mom!

616
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:09,903
Mom!

617
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,954
After she passed away,

618
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:21,998
the red hair accessory disappeared.

619
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,793
While searching for the object,

620
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:29,797
I came across your father's works.

621
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:31,549
He wrote...

622
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:34,093
all of these?

623
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:35,845
Correct.

624
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:44,395
WHEN THE SYMPTOMS GET WORSE,
THEY ROAM THE MOUNTAINS

625
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:45,897
But no one believed him.

626
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,776
Even the academic world ostracized him

627
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:53,196
for writing such groundless nonsense.

628
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:55,406
But he continued to publish works

629
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:58,284
regarding evil spirits until he retired.

630
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,747
"A shadow that lets its hair loose."

631
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,252
That's right.

632
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,504
It's the embodiment of the evil spirit.

633
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:13,091
Professor Gu knew about this evil spirit.

634
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:19,722
"A shadow that lets its hair loose

635
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:24,352
indulges humans in their desires
and gradually grows bigger."

636
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:27,188
I visited him as soon as I saw his works,

637
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:29,065
but he had already retired by then.

638
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,109
I tried numerous times to meet with him.

639
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:32,569
2007
RETIRED AND WENT INTO HIDING

640
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:33,695
I don't know why,

641
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:36,030
but he refused to see me.

642
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:41,286
I had no choice but to do my own research
based on his works.

643
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:44,706
But I couldn't find the sources.

644
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:47,458
It was impossible to find anything
based on his works alone.

645
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:49,252
Then does that mean

646
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:52,589
you haven't found out anything
about the evil spirit?

647
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:54,215
As of now, yes.

648
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:02,015
Once we find out how your father
got hold of this,

649
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:04,183
we'll be able to learn more
about the evil spirit.

650
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:13,109
I saw a strange notebook.

651
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,028
What do you mean?

652
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:18,948
I saw it.

653
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:26,539
I witnessed my grandmother's death.

654
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:32,420
HAIR ACCESSORY

655
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,547
JAEGOGAE

656
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:41,554
Don't blame yourself.

657
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:45,600
It was the evil spirit
who murdered her, not you.

658
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,814
Do you remember...

659
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:55,526
what was written in the notebook?

660
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:00,323
I do.

661
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,706
JAEGOGAE

662
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:13,169
SACRED TREE
JANGJIN-RI, RED HAIR ACCESSORY

663
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:15,171
JANGJIN-RI, RED HAIR ACCESSORY

664
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,132
I'm not certain,

665
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:20,593
but it looked like this.

666
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:25,348
JANGJIN-RI, RED HAIR ACCESSORY
PINE FOREST, JAEGOGAE, SACRED TREE

667
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:30,812
ADMINISTRATIVE MAP OF KOREA

668
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:34,315
There's no such place called "Jangjin-ri."

669
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:36,776
It's not on the map either.

670
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:39,654
That name is probably long gone.

671
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:46,744
GENERAL SURVEY OF PLACE NAMES IN KOREA

672
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:51,791
You realize that several place names
are no longer used when studying folklore.

673
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:53,793
That's when these books come in handy.

674
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:55,878
Like we did with Hyunwoo,

675
01:01:56,546 --> 01:02:00,425
can we get rid of the evil spirit
once we find out its name and story?

676
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:02,969
I told you. Every ghost is different.

677
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:06,347
We'll know what to do

678
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,183
once we identify it.

679
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:40,131
JANGJIN-RI

680
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:46,679
I must find out...

681
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:50,641
why that evil spirit killed my mother.

682
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:57,273
I want those around me to be safe.

683
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:00,401
I don't want someone else to be killed

684
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:04,572
just because they know me.

685
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:06,866
Is this it?

686
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:09,827
There are three Jangjin-ris
mentioned in the books.

687
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:12,830
And the only place that also has
Jaegogae and a pine forest...

688
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:16,292
is here.

689
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:19,545
"A shadow that lets its hair loose."

690
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:23,049
This is where that evil spirit lies.

691
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:27,261
JANGJIN-RI

692
01:03:27,261 --> 01:03:30,515
YEAR 1958, JANGJIN-RI

693
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:33,119
Come here.

694
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:02,315
REVENANT

695
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:11,365
HAIR ACCESSORY

696
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:25,546
I looked through some recent suicide cases

697
01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:26,797
and I found something strange.

698
01:05:26,797 --> 01:05:29,759
The same noise was heard
on the day each victim died.

699
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:31,844
- What was it?
- The sound of high heels.

700
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:34,597
This used to be Jangjin-ri?

701
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:37,099
Yes, this region used to be Jangjin-ri.

702
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:38,935
Do you recognize this area?

703
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:40,770
The Dukdali Tree
used to be there.

704
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:42,855
We must hurry
and find that tree.

705
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:44,231
There will be one more victim.

706
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:47,026
Why does something bad happen
to everyone who knows you?

707
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:48,736
They either die or disappear.

708
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:51,113
It'll only torment you more
if you refuse to save someone

709
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:52,573
who you know is going to die.

710
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,993
It's more important to me
that I get rid of this evil spirit.
