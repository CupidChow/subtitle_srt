Nothing has changed.
It's just as it was before.

193
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,445
[Gyeongmun] Sanyeong, I'm scared.

No, Mom.

Don't be scared and look around, will you?

197
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,709
Dad missed us.

198
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,713
That's why he kept this place as is.

00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,264
For optic atrophy.

212
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:50,227
There's no cure,
and you end up going blind.

213
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:53,856
[Sanyeong]
I went to that hospital and confirmed it.

00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,068
[Gyeongmun] That can't be.

I don't believe it.

216
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,825
He couldn't tell you the truth
because it'd bring you pain.

How do you know that?

218
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,955
You said Dad said the same thing as I did.

219
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,666
That it was dangerous at night.

But he must've felt the same way I felt.

224
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:29,058
I only said that
because I was so worried about you.

I'm sure he did what he could.

By the way, did Sanyeong eat anything
before going to bed?

238
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:24,405
She tossed and turned all night
and couldn't sleep much.

00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,286
is the apartment which the librarian,
Chae Seorin, jumped from.

under reconstruction, so we can't enter.

[Haesang] Is she the evil spirit
or Ms. Sanyeong herself?

386
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,968
Is everything she has told me so far true
or nothing but lies?

387
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,223

That's right.

Why?

00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,824
What brings you to our hospital,

439
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:43,995
I understand that you've been working here

I don't understand.

This hospital has a close tie
to Junghyeon Capital.

You've been receiving
development funds from them

since the days of its predecessor company,
Junghyeon Mutual Finance.

447

The total sum
amounts to over five billion won.

448
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:12,023
Why did they invest
so much money into this hospital?

449
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,985
The funds were for development purposes,
as the name implies.

When people built a new building
or moved into a new house,

478
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,321
they held a rite of enshrinement.

479

They hung an item under the ridgepole
as a way of inviting the household deity.

Whenever they had nightmares
or misfortunes around them,

they hung a dried pollack

482
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,874
so that the deity
would block out the bad luck.

"Block out the bad luck"?

Yes.

That can't be.
My father didn't commit suicide.

to be transferred to our hospital.

It was the suicide case in Hwawonjae.
Does it sound familiar?

Yes, I'm aware of it.

782

He asked me to let him know

for granting its host wealth,

914
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:35,506
the juvenile ghost
wants the person you love most.

915
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:38,384
I want

916
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:40,678
to get rid of the evil spirit.

918
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,559
Since when did you have trouble seeing?

919
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:49,771
And what was with the moon drawings?

920
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:52,523
Moon drawings? What is he talking about?

921
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:57,654
You haven't told us everything, have you?

922
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:01,741
Tell us.

923
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,284
[Haesang] What's the matter?

924
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:05,286
Did the evil spirit

925
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:08,289
threaten to harm us if you disclosed it?

926
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:12,669
I don't care,
and I'll put up a good fight.

927
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:15,588
So tell me.

928
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:19,634
[Hongsae] The same goes for me.

929
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:21,719
Tell us.

930
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:39,237
Before Detective Seo passed away,

931
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,571
he grabbed a document

932
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:43,366
signed by my dad,
which confirmed the receipt of belongings.

933
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,034
That's probably not it.

934
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:48,079
I checked that form too.

935
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:53,835
There was another sheet of paper
behind it.

936
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:57,380
There were three Chinese characters
written on it.

937
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:01,509
[♪ pensive music]

938
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:07,640
[Sanyeong] This was the first character.

939
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:10,476
But the other two were too complicated.

940
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,145
Isn't this "ho" for "house"?

941
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:15,857
You're right. A three-character word
that starts with "ho."

942
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,488
Did you say it was written vertically?

943
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:24,323
Yes.

944
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:32,707
Is this it?

945
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:39,422
FAMILY REGISTER

946
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:41,257
Yes.

947
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:43,468
I think this is right.

948
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:46,012
The family register.

949
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:49,390
Detective Seo said that he had restored
the report on Lee Mokdan's case.

950
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,434
[Hongsae] Her family.

951
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:56,647
One of them is the evil spirit.

952
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:59,066
A female student
from Jangjin Middle School.

953
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:01,861
It's highly likely
that she was Mokdan's sister.

954
01:03:04,071 --> 01:03:05,072
But...

955
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:10,077
we don't know her name.

956
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:14,373
Can't we just get another copy
of her family register?

957
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:15,666
No.

958
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:19,712
We need to know the domicile of origin
and the head of the household.

959
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,798
But that information
was omitted in the case file.

960
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:24,008
[Hongsae]
It was such an old case file after all.

961
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:29,514
What did you see
when you touched the glass bottle?

962
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:37,396
[gasps]

963
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,233
[Sanyeong] I saw glass bottles
with colorful powder in them.

964
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:42,735
They fell and shattered on the ground.

965
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:46,989
And someone holding
a glass bottle with red powder in it...

966
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:50,535
was standing in front of your house.

967
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:53,621
If that's the evil spirit's memory,

968
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:57,625
then something must've happened
at that house.

969
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:59,627
And my grandmother
must know what happened.

970
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:02,755
What about Vice-president Kim Chiwon?

971
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:05,508
Did he say anything?

972
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,427
He just has a fragmented memory
of the evil spirit.

973
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:12,849
He said the instructions
on how to cast it away were in a safe,

974
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:14,016
but I'm sure it's fake.

975
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:19,564
[Haesang] My father was killed
while following those instructions.

976
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:23,734
And my mother probably did the same thing.

977
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:27,697
So did Professor Gu Gangmo.

978
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:29,907
[Hongsae] And Jangjin Middle School?

979
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:32,618
That school closed down in 2000.

980
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:36,956
Still, their information must've been sent
to the relevant office of education.

981
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,833
There may not be any staff records,

982
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:40,793
but the student records
are probably still there.

983
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:42,628
We haven't identified the evil spirit.

984
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:46,507
We need to know
whose student record to look for.

993

It's a day when you're safe,
even when the household deity's jar falls

994
