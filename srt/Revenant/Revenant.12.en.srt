You should stay at the hospital

We found it next to the body.

84
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,240
No.

I don't see anything.

86
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,582
That was the last of the five objects.

87
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,503
But we didn't seal the objects yet.

88
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,173
Why did your shadow return?

89
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,346
[Sanyeong] I'm not sure.

that the evil spirit was left-handed.

105
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,548
She took the hairpin with her right hand.

She must be around here somewhere.

Someone as cruel and cold-hearted as her
couldn't have possibly left this easily.

She had been tied to the bed
before leaping to her death.

151
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,919

01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:21,370
[chuckles]
Can you believe that?

913
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:23,497
-He truly is insane.
-I'm telling you.

914
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:25,374
-Why would he?
-Beats me.

915
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:26,459
Excuse me.

916
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:29,545
I'm not crazy.

917
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,089
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry, sir.

918
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,635
We'll gather at the site once you're done.

919
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,137
[students] Okay.

920
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:42,224
[elder] Professor Yeom.

921
01:07:43,642 --> 01:07:45,603
You should write one too.

922
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:48,272
You can see ghosts.

923
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:49,732
You came by every year

924
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:52,943
and prayed that they'd end up
in a good place.

925
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:56,030
GU SANYEONG

926
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:57,448
[line ringing]

927
01:07:58,115 --> 01:07:59,825
[Haesang] I'm in front of the station.

[♪ calm music]

930
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:19,637
Are you here for the local survey?

931
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:22,807
Yes. We're going to be late so hop in.

932
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:33,818
[♪ folk music playing over car stereo]

933
01:08:35,694 --> 01:08:37,071
[Sanyeong inhales deeply]

934
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:39,824
Well, this is something new.

935
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:46,372
They sing this folk song
during the fireworks festival

936
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:49,083
when they set boats afloat
on the river and write poems.

937
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:52,503
It's a folk game

938
01:08:52,586 --> 01:08:54,713
played throughout the country
since the Joseon Dynasty.

939
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:58,008
It's the quintessence
of a dignified game played by nobles.

940
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:02,096
Right. "Nobles."

941
01:09:02,179 --> 01:09:03,556
"Quintessence." I get it.

942
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:06,809
[♪ folk music continues playing]

943
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:10,604
You can still see ghosts, can't you?

944
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:15,526
Yes.

945
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,529

946
01:09:18,612 --> 01:09:19,905

-[cheers and applause]
-[camera shutters clicking]

950
01:09:34,086 --> 01:09:35,671
[Haesang] This is the fireworks festival.

951
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:38,465
It's a way to ward off harmful spirits,

952
01:09:38,549 --> 01:09:41,260
cast away illnesses and misfortunes,
and bring in good news.

953
01:09:43,929 --> 01:09:45,848
It also escorts

954
01:09:46,473 --> 01:09:49,101
all the lost and wandering ghosts
to a good place.

955
01:09:51,645 --> 01:09:53,898
The festival is filled
with white paper and fire.

956
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:57,401
It's a grand purification ceremony…

957
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:00,487
brought on by everyone's wishes.

958
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:03,949
[Haesang] Do you see them?

959
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:06,327
The ghosts?

960
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,041
Yes.

961
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:14,627
[Haesang] I came here yearly…

962
01:10:16,295 --> 01:10:18,172
when it was painful to see the ghosts.

963
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:22,885
Because all the ghosts here looked happy.

964
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,596
You're right.

965
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:29,099
Everyone…

966
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:31,769
looks happy.

967

[♪ soft music continues]

968
01:10:36,815 --> 01:10:39,276
I hope you find happiness too.

969
01:10:45,699 --> 01:10:48,994
[Haesang] I pray
that everyone's wishes will come true.

970
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,418
I hope everyone here…

971
01:10:59,546 --> 01:11:00,965
will find happiness.
