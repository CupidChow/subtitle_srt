00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,980
Well, she said she just knew.

166
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,590
She's my mom, so she was able to tell.

167
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,120
And what did she say?

168
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,980
She said, "Oh-aew is pretty cute.

169
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,140
Ma approved!"

170
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,300
Come on, be serious. Don't lie.

171
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,240
Ma wanted to give this to you.

172
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:30,240
She said to put it under your pillow, and it'll bring you good luck.

173
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,080
And also...

174
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,519
What is it?

175
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,520
Wear them first.

176
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,339
Oh-aew, I'll leave Teh to you, all right?

177
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:05,820
Both of you, focus on your studies.

178
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,819
You can call me for anything, at any time.

179
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:12,100
And when you return to Phuket, let's have a meal together. All right?

180
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,600
I'll treat you to a big meal!

181
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,820
I'm done. How do I stop it?

182
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,480
Why didn't your mom just call?

183
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:39,459
Ma said... she wanted me to see your face when you listened to it.

184
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:42,090
And to tell her about it later.

185
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,900
Your mom is romantic, isn't she?

186
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,019
The next time we go back to Phuket, let's go see my mom.

187
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:53,419
But this time, we won't be best friends.

188
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,070
We're a couple now.

189
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,800
Well, well...

190
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,200
You like that, don't you?

191
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,380
Oh! There's a shark!

192
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,720
What was that?

193
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,150
There are lots of people.

194
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,433
Why?

195
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,873
So what?

196
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,719
So, how are things? You've been here three days before me.

197
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:47,430
Are you used to it yet?

198
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,240
Actually, I've been here before.

199
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,140
At my dad's place.

200
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,040
But when I woke up,

201
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,159
once I didn't see any beaches,

202
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,420
it just felt a bit weird.

203
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,300
If I were home, I would still have Mom and Dad.

204
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,880
But I have to be here alone.

205
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,540
It feels empty.

206
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,920
I miss my home, too.

207
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:29,080
Well, here I am with you now.

208
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,620
I'll help make you feel better.

209
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,713
Can you?

210
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,100
Why wouldn't I?

211
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,500
Having such a handsome boyfriend like me can't fill up your heart?

212
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,300
So handsome, huh?

213
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,133
What?

214
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,053
Here.

215
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,819
How am I not handsome?

216
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:53,059
Let's clearly compare me with P'Top Naruedech.

217
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:55,499
He's a senior at my faculty, you know?
[Ekkamai Soi 10]

218
00:18:55,499 --> 00:18:56,900
So bold.

219
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,539
Of course!

220
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:00,079
Just wait and see.

221
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:04,059
One day, I'm gonna be on a poster just like this.

222
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,859
And you're going to have to be on it with me, too.

223
00:19:05,859 --> 00:19:07,399
You'll be by my side.

224
00:19:07,399 --> 00:19:10,379
Just like how P'Top always has N'Meen.

225
00:19:10,379 --> 00:19:12,580
To be an imaginary couple?

226
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,599
To be a real couple, of course.

227
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,499
And once we get really famous,

228
00:19:23,499 --> 00:19:25,059
we have to play in drama series.

229
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:27,119
And then movies in China.

230
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:30,959
Being able to speak Chinese like this, I guarantee you Chinese people will love us.

231
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:34,179
I don't know if I can still recall my Chinese by that time.

232
00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:37,339
Hey! Don't forget it just yet.

233
00:19:37,339 --> 00:19:41,460
In case we get to play lead characters, like Yongjian.

234
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,800
So you're gonna play Yongjian?

235
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:50,380
"Reap what you sow!"

236
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,300
And after that, we'll be awarded the Oscars.

237
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,760
The Oscars?

238
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,093
Of course, the Oscars!

239
00:20:00,093 --> 00:20:02,359
I would like to say thank you.

240
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:03,899
"Khob Khun Krup."

241
00:20:03,899 --> 00:20:05,259
"Xie Xie."

242
00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:09,440
Thank you for all the support that allowed the both of us to be able to stand right here.

243
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,400
"The both of us?"

244
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,553
Of course, the both of us.

245
00:20:14,953 --> 00:20:17,790
Clearly, you and I will have to reach that point together.

246
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,413
All right.

247
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,770
I'll be there with you.

248
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,220
Let's go. It's time to go home.

249
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,853
Let's go.

250
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,330
Tomorrow is the first day of the semester. I'm so excited.

251
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,179
And... what time does your class start?

252
00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:01,580
Well, right in the morning, 8 a.m.

253
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,860
Then you should hurry back and sleep.

254
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,710
It's your first day. And you'll have to go find your classroom too.

255
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,140
I think it's better to spend the night with you.

256
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,090
What? Don't you have a morning class?

257
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:26,779
It's all right.

258
00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:29,280
I'll just have to wake up early then.

259
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,779
Because there's someone who's been sleeping alone for three nights already.

260
00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:35,730
I'm afraid he'll die of loneliness.

261
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,733
Let's go!

262
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,030
- Wrong side!
- Oh, right.

263
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,300
Let's go.

264
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,133
I'm going now.

265
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,080
What are you looking at?

266
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,860
There's eye gunk all over.

267
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,900
What time is it?

268
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,319
It's seven o'clock.

269
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,700
In the morning?

270
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,533
Oh shit!

271
00:23:06,533 --> 00:23:09,840
Shit, shit! Damn it! Damn.

272
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,920
Where are you rushing off to?

273
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:16,510
Let me borrow your clothes for now, all right? I probably won't be able to change at my dorm in time.

274
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,720
Shit. Fifteen kilometers?

by David K. Berlo.
[First Year]

277
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,140
"S" is for "sender" or "source."

278
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:56,420
Which means the person sending...

279
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:00,720
It's your first day and you are late.

280
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,759
I couldn't find the class, ma'am.

281
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:05,980
Now you know where the class is.

282
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:09,499
Next time, if you're more than 15 minutes late, I'll mark you as absent. All right?

283
00:25:09,499 --> 00:25:12,300
- Have a seat.
- Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

284
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,430
The first one you see is "S."

285
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,470
Here it says "Source"

286
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,819
but it can also mean "Sender," that is you.

287
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,180
Next is "M."

288
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:25,859
"M" is "Message," or the contents.

289
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:28,960
As for "C," it's "Channel" or the carriers.

290
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,980
Then it's followed by "R" or "Receiver."

291
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,339
Or the person receiving.
[Milk to help you fill up your stomach]

292
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:38,580
Actually, if we wanted to add another thing, it would be "F" for "Feedback."

You...

296
00:26:11,939 --> 00:26:16,259
I thought I'd definitely get this role, but I didn't.

297
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:18,659
I've gone to hundreds of castings already.

298
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:20,019
I've only ever gotten small roles.

299

I'm so down... so down... so down...

300

- Hey! Calm down!
- And this stuff makes it even worse.

301
00:26:26,939 --> 00:26:29,080
You'll break it.

302
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,579
Take it easy, all right?

303
00:26:30,579 --> 00:26:31,900
You're already good.

304
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,200

There's a fan sneaking a peek at you.

00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,890
The thing is, I wanted to sign up for the club.

309
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:56,800
Then what was it that I saw just now?

310
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,873
Well...

311
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,830
I've never seen P'Top in person before.

312

Aw... how adorable.

Ee'Jai! Don't tease him.

314
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:17,639
There are already very few people signing up for the club. You'll scare him off.

315
00:27:17,639 --> 00:27:19,820
Please, come in.

316
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,393
All right.

317
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,960

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,839
I'm Teh.

And this is

P'Top. You may have known him already, he's also a junior.

323
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:40,179
As for that one... the one who was picking on you just now,

324
00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:42,500
his name is Jai. He's a sophomore. Make sure to remember him.

325
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,860
When you talk to me, you talk like a giant or demon...

326
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:49,320
Oh, that's right. I'm no longer a freshie like in my first year.

327
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,140
Wow, acting so dramatic. Geez.

328
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,520
Oh! It's nothing.

329
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,419
So why do you wan to sign up for this club?

330
00:27:58,419 --> 00:28:02,553
Well, I want to be an actor.

331
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,199
And there's no acting class yet for the first year class.

332
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:09,099
By the time I choose my major, it'll be sophomore year already.

333
00:28:09,099 --> 00:28:12,280
And I happened to see that there's a drama club, so I wanted to check it out.

334
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,530
The drama club is doing a play now, right?

335
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,099
That's right.

336
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:21,780
It's a play for charity.

337
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:26,839
But right now... we already have a full cast.

338
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,600
Right.

339
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,220
Or... how about this?

340
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,240
If you want to be on stage,

341
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,740
don't you need to know what happens backstage first?

342
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,580
I just happen to be looking for more hands for the backstage right now.

343
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:55,880
It could also be seen as another way to learn about making plays, right?

344
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,800
Backstage?

345
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,359
The ones who arrange the stage during scene changes?

346
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:04,900
Something like that?

347
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,200
Looking kinda cool with walkie-talkies?

348
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:10,220
Not just arranging the stage.

349
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,580
They have to be able to manage everything on the stage as well.

350
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,240
What do you think? Are you interested?

351
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,119
Hey! You're taking a long time to think.

352
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:25,800
I don't accept a lot of people for the backstage, you know.

353
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,580
So what do you want? Are you going to do it or not?

354
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,593
Yes, I'll do it.

355
00:29:32,593 --> 00:29:33,879
I'll do it.

356
00:29:33,879 --> 00:29:35,513
I will.

357
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,399
You want to hold a walkie-talkie, right?

358
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,139
You'll be holding it for a long time, for sure.

359
00:29:41,139 --> 00:29:43,320
How adorable...

360
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,940
Take that and fill out the application first.

361
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,620
You can go and sit over there.

362
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,360
Yes.

363
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,700
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

364
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,093
Excuse me.

365
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,439
- P'James, hello!
- Hello there.

366
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,479
Are you leaving, Jai?

367
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,113
I'm off.

368
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,699
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, P'James.

369
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,240
- You...
- Hmm...

370
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,279
How far have they gone already?

371
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,113
P'James and Ai'Jai...

372
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,919
I don't know.

373
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,079
What? Why didn't you ask?

374
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,279
Well, he didn't tell me, so how would I know?

375
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,199
Ask him. I wanna know.

376
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,959
- If you want to know, ask him yourself.
- He won't tell me.

377
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:46,679
This morning I was damn late, like really late. I got lost.

378
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,919
It's actually only 8 kilometers to the university, right?

379
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,679
But when I checked the meter on my motorcycle,

380
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,439
it said 15 kilometers.

381
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,159
I was even so confident that I memorized the directions.

382
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,519
If I had known, I should've just used the map along the way.

383
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,860
Yeah, well... if you're not used to the directions yet,

384
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,039
you really shouldn't ride a motorcycle by yourself then.

385
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,780
It's dangerous.

386
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,100
I think so too.

387
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,500
I'm thinking of taking a taxi tomorrow instead.

388
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,513
That's good.

389
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,853
And so... did you bring all of your clothes with you?

390
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,540
You're not going back to sleep at the dorm anymore?

391
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,640
Why are you smiling?

392
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,040
Why are you smiling?

393
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,819
Today, I met with the drama club at the faculty too.

394
00:31:45,819 --> 00:31:48,359
P'Top is in the drama club too!

395
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,159
The person in the flesh! It's so damn cool!

396
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,660
So, who's more handsome, you or him?

397
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,280
It's probably me then! Geez!

398
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,519
What I meant was that I didn't think he'd be in the drama club as well.

399
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,239
He's like... a professional already, you know?

400
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,759
And he's still doing this kind of activity. He's... damn great.

401
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,199
Your faculty is pretty good, huh?

402
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,799
You got a club as well.

403
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,220
My faculty only has the faculty's play.

404
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,959
And by the time we get to do it, it'd be the second semester.

405
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,380
Actually...

406
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,420
the drama club has an upcoming play too.

407
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,080
It runs next month.

408
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,540
The seniors invited me to be on the backstage, too.

409
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,380
But there are rehearsals every evening.

410
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,879
So I might come home late these days.

411
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,079
If you're sleepy, you can go ahead and sleep first.

412
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,913
You don't need to wait up, all right?

413
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,900
And how about you?

414
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,239
How was it? Your first day.

415
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,790
Was it fun?

416
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,040
Today?

417
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,590
The most fun was being with you.

418
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,273
Why's that?

419
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,599
Well, I'm tired.

420
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,820
I have to get to know this and that person.

421
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,800
I'm jealous of these Bangkok kids, you know?

422
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,359
They came from the same schools.

423
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,199
So they formed groups easily.

424
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,400
They don't really have to get to know new people.

425
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,800
Come on.

426
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,319
If the Bangkok kids went to our school,

427
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,199
they'd probably be just like you.

428
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,733
Right?

429
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,173
That's true.

430
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,753
Cheer up.

431
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,113
Cheer up!

432
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,573
Here, it's done.

433
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,000
You can tie it yourself now.

434
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,573
Nope.

435
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,010
I got you. So why would I tie it myself?

436
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,500
It's 6 a.m.?

437
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,399
The traffic today is going to be bad.

438
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,350
You go ahead and keep sleeping.

439
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,420
I'll warm the milk up for you.

440
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,593
We're here, kid.

441
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,840
You didn't make it in time yesterday?

442
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,079
Taxis are expensive...

443
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,630
I think it's better if I take the skytrain instead today.

444
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:40,160
[Teh: Today I have to plan the blocking. I should be back around 11 p.m.]

445
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,860
[oh.aew: Why so late?]

446
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,940
[Faculty of Communication Arts]

447
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,740
Everyone, take a look at this table.

448
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,870
Lights off, please.

449
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,959
Can anyone see anything right now?

450
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,600
- No.
- No.

451
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,060
Lights on, please.

452
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,479
What you've just seen

453
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,300
is what the audience will see on stage when the lights are out.

454
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:43,100
If you noticed, you would see P'Jai was standing there with his eyes closed off at the side.

455
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,399
The role of the backstage crew is closing your eyes before the lights are out.

456
00:36:48,399 --> 00:36:51,599
In order to adjust your eyes to the dark.

457
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,779
The audience, they don't close their eyes like we do, right?

458
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:58,939
Therefore, their eyes won't be able to adjust to the darkness. Once the lights turn off,

459
00:36:58,939 --> 00:37:00,540
they won't be able to see anything at all.

460
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,939
As for us, who've already adjusted our eyes to the dark, we'll be able to see.

461
00:37:03,939 --> 00:37:06,199
And we'll be able to come out and arrange things on the stage.

462
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,319
Right.

463
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,639
Once we order for the lights to turn on again,

464
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,159
it will be like magic. The scene will have already changed.

465
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,639
All right, guys. I'll have you close your eyes first.

466
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,199
And when I give you the signal,

467
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,999
we'll each run out to take a flower from this vase, all right?

468
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,240
- All right.
- Okay,

469
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,880
Close your eyes, please.

470
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,159
Ready?

471
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,319
One.

472
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,479
Two.

473
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,639
Three.

474
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,799
Four.

475
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,999
Five.

476
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,079
Six.

477
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,239
Seven.

478
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,439
Eight.

479
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,480
Nine...

480
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,413
Lights off!

481
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,799
Guys, you can go ahead and grab some snacks, all right?

482
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,980
Does being a director involve practicing with the stage crew?

483
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:18,439
Well, I used to be part of the stage crew during my first year.

484
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,890
I was free today, so I came down to help, too.

485
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,630
So why didn't you choose to act?

486
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:38,260
I just overheard that you've been to lots of castings,

487
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:41,060
so I assumed you wanted to be an actress.

488
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,570
All right, let's be real.

489
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:51,120
Honestly, I want to act so badly.

490
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,579
But... I already chose to be the club president.

491
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,119
So I thought I would give the opportunity to some else instead.

492
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,960
Most of the members in the club want to be performers.

493
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,959
And in choosing to be the director,

494
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,479
I consider that I'm practicing my acting as well.

495
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,319
Because every time that I coach other people,

496
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,270
I also revise for myself.

497
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,293
Understood?

498
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,533
Are you sleepy?

499
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,273
No.

500
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,639
But you yawned.

501
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,039
Yawning means you're sleepy.

502
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,740
Go home and sleep.

503
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,019
I'm leaving. I'll see you tomorrow.

504
00:39:36,019 --> 00:39:37,759
- See you tomorrow. Goodbye.
- Goodbye. Go to sleep, all right?

505
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,500
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

506
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,859
[oh.aew: Is your club finished? I'm waiting for you downstairs of your faculty.]

507
00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:56,210
I was going downstairs to see you already. Why did you come see me?

508
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:59,100
You must have missed me, huh?

509
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,990
What? I just thought of bringing you some milk.

510
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,713
Here.

511
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,260
Why are you bringing it to me now?

512
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:18,110
I think it's better if you sleep at your dorm instead.

513
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,373
Why?

514
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,550
I feel bad for you.

515
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,159
By the time you finish rehearsing

516
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,739
get back to the room

517
00:40:29,739 --> 00:40:32,240
and can get some sleep, it will be so late already...

518
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,780
And then you have to wake up early in the morning to avoid traffic just to get to class on time.

519
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,020
Isn't that too tiring?

520
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,980
It's not tiring.

521
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:45,300
What do you mean it's not tiring?

522
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,419
Just sleep at your dorm.

523
00:40:47,419 --> 00:40:50,470
You'd get to sleep an extra 2-3 hours, you know.

524
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,979
I'm just a bit tired. It's really not a big deal.

525
00:40:57,979 --> 00:41:00,630
If it makes you not lonely...

526
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:05,799
and you can smile... then my tiredness will go away.

527
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,400
Hey, I'm a grown-up now.

528
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,353
I'll live.

529
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:21,019
Do we have to stick together every day or something?

530
00:41:21,019 --> 00:41:23,770
We wouldn't be able to make a living or anything.

531
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,450
When the play is over,

532
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:30,100
we'll get to be together for a long time.

533
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,139
You really want that?

534
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:46,630
It's not that far. The taxi fee is only a few hundred baht.

535
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,230
If I can't handle it,

536
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,420
I'll come see you.

537
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,393
Do you love me?

538
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,853
Why do you ask?

539
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,479
Do you love me? Do you love me? Do you love me?

540
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,680
Do you love me? Do you, do you, do you?

541
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,413
I love you.

542
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,693
I love you very much.

543
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,400
That's all that matters.

544
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:48,719
I think I'm gonna choose Films as my major. How about you, Oh-aew?

545
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:50,959
Well... I think I'm gonna choose Performing Arts.

546
00:42:50,959 --> 00:42:53,379
Oh, that's nice. If I start filming, I'll have you as my actor.

547
00:42:53,379 --> 00:42:54,860
Sure.

548
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:57,859
And are you going somewhere now?

549
00:42:57,859 --> 00:42:59,810
Want to get lunch together?

550
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,353
Fon!

551
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:08,319
The thing is... I already made plans with some friends from my old school.

552
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:09,639
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

553
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,440
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

554
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:10,620
[Oh-aew: Mod, you wanna eat dinner together this evening?]

555
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:15,380
[Mod: I can't. There's a thing at my faculty.]

556
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,139
[Mom]

557
00:44:23,139 --> 00:44:27,379
Oh, dear, it's been busy. Lots of storms coming.

558
00:44:27,379 --> 00:44:31,499
Last night, a water pump broke. It was hectic until this morning.

559
00:44:31,499 --> 00:44:33,339
In Bangkok, there's no rain at all, Mom.

560
00:44:33,339 --> 00:44:38,679
Oh, it's good that it's not raining. That way, it won't be difficult to get to school.

561
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:40,619
Also, do you want anything else to eat?

562
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:42,239
I'll send it to you.

563
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:46,060
Geez! The food here in Bangkok is so much better.

564
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:48,620
Well, well... All right, Oh-aew!

565
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:51,190
I'll call you again tomorrow, okay?

566
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:52,859
I have to go to bed early tonight.

567
00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:55,859
Your dad and I will go to Khao Lak tomorrow.

568
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:59,859
Well, well... Your son isn't there and the two of you are sneaking off on a trip, huh?

569
00:44:59,859 --> 00:45:01,973
That's right!

570
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,039
Oh-aew, you too.

571
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:07,240
Go to sleep already. Otherwise you'll wake up late tomorrow.

572
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,990
All right. I'll talk to you later.

573
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,039
♫ Tonight, the night is so long ♫

574
00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:40,140
♫ But I guess it's all right ♫

575
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:45,700
♫ Because tonight, all my heart still belongs to you ♫

576
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:51,739
♫ I still feel lonely sometimes ♫

577
00:45:51,739 --> 00:45:54,819
♫ But tonight I'm still waiting to see you ♫

578
00:45:54,819 --> 00:46:01,560
♫ Just for you to say "Sweet dreams" ♫

579
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:50,180
Are you... a freshman?

580
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:52,939
Can I sit here with you?

581
00:46:52,939 --> 00:46:54,973
Sure, go ahead.

582
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,059
What time are we supposed to meet up today?

583
00:47:03,059 --> 00:47:04,460
11 a.m.! And what time did you come?

584
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:06,599
Noon! We could've eaten out.

585
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:08,839
Look! Now we have to eat here at the canteen! Damn it!

586
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:10,979
Mangpong, can you not complain so much. Next time, just don't wait for me.

587
00:47:10,979 --> 00:47:12,379
If I don't wait, you'll throw a fuss again.

588
00:47:12,379 --> 00:47:15,539
- Q, your water.
- Oh, yeah, thank you.

589
00:47:15,539 --> 00:47:17,770
- Let me try some.
- Go for it.

590
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,273
Want to eat some?

591
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,239
Here.

592
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,673
Go ahead and eat it.

593
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:28,659
I want to eat some, too.

594
00:47:28,659 --> 00:47:29,860
No, you can't have it.

595
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,493
Damn...

596
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:37,299
Oh right, I'm Q.

597
00:47:37,299 --> 00:47:38,780
And this is Plug.

598
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:41,460
Mangpong. And finally, Auu.

599
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:46,199
You don't have to be polite with us.

600
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:48,139
Except for this pug-like dog, Plug.

601
00:47:48,139 --> 00:47:50,940
He doesn't curse. Can you believe that?

602
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,839
All right, so I won't use impolite words with Plug.

603
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:57,239
No, no, no. He doesn't curse with us.

604
00:47:57,239 --> 00:48:00,339
But we can curse at him. Use all the curse words you want.

605
00:48:00,339 --> 00:48:02,273
Ai'Shithead Plug. See?

606
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:07,479
So, we don't have to be so polite to each other, right?

607
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,600
What's your name?

608
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,239
Oh-aew.

609
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:15,979
Oh-ae?

610
00:48:15,979 --> 00:48:16,939
Oh-aew.

611
00:48:16,939 --> 00:48:18,319
Oh-aew.

612
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:20,819
- Oh-aew.
- Oh-aew.

613
00:48:20,819 --> 00:48:22,759
Can we just call you Aew?

614
00:48:22,759 --> 00:48:24,700
Aew-aew. Aew-aew. Something like this?

615
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:28,050
Aew-aew, your ass. Are you a seal or what?

616
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,879
So what does Oh-aew mean?

617
00:48:30,879 --> 00:48:33,599
It's a name of a dessert in Phuket.

618
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,270
What kind of dessert?

619
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:43,239
Well, Oh Aew is a kind of jelly.

620
00:48:43,239 --> 00:48:46,060
Made of Oh Aew seeds.

621
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:49,380
It's kind of like shaved ice.

622
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,440
You put red syrup on it.

623
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:57,160
And grass jelly...

624
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,320
and red beans...

625
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,813
It's yummy.

626
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:22,080
It's really yummy...

627
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:26,400
Hey. What's wrong?

628
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:37,519
Sorry. Sorry, man. I'm all right.

629
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:45,680
Well then, are you going somewhere?

630
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,440
Do you want to come with us?

631
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:54,900
Let's go together.

632
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,633
Yeah, let's go.

633
00:49:58,960 --> 00:49:59,959
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

634
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:02,759
- You'll go, right?
- Let's go together.

635
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,900
Bombs away!

636
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,300
Geez, Asshole.

637
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:19,699
My house only has a bingsu maker...

638
00:50:19,699 --> 00:50:22,550
Don't know if it's gonna be as good as Oh Aew.

639
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:30,790
Still, I guess it's all right.

640
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:33,320
You "guess"? That means it's not, right?

641
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,073
It's great.

642
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:51,359
Getting homesick is normal. You'll get over it.

643
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,720
I've been there.

644
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,799
You've been homesick before?

645
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,880
When I was an exchange student in India.

646
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:08,079
And you... did you come here from Phuket by yourself?

647
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:10,260
Did any friends come with you?

648
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:16,099
I have friends who came too, but they're in different faculties.

649
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:21,470
And there's my partner that came, too. He's in Communication Arts at Prachayanan.

650
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:26,799
And... your boyfriend isn't staying with you?

651
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:32,459
Well, it's the period when we're adjusting to our new faculties.

652
00:51:32,459 --> 00:51:34,960
Everyone's been busy.

653
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,659
I don't want to bother anyone.

654
00:51:38,659 --> 00:51:42,410
I think... I'll just miss my home for a bit. I'll be over it soon.

655
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,279
Well, how about this?

656
00:51:49,279 --> 00:51:52,299
Even though my home might not have a beach like yours,

657
00:51:52,299 --> 00:51:54,179
there's a swimming pool.

658
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:55,759
If you want to play in the water,

659
00:51:55,759 --> 00:51:57,979
or if you get lonely again,

660
00:51:57,979 --> 00:52:00,880
just think of this place as your home, too.

661
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,790
You can always come by, no worries.

662
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:07,179
Hey, what are you eating?

663
00:52:07,179 --> 00:52:08,119
- Is that bingsu?
- Bingsu?

664
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,319
I want to eat it, too!

665
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,639
- I wanna eat it, too.
- I wanna eat it, too.

666
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,959
Give me some.

667
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,079
- I want to eat some, too.
- You don't need to eat it!

668
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,140
I just want to eat some.

669
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,780
[One Month Later]

670
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,760
[Q: What time are you coming to my place today?]

671
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,180
[Oh-aew: I'll watch the play first. I'll go soon.]

672
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:53,140
Hello, I'm here.

673
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:55,759
Sorry, Oh. The backstage work has been really hectic.

674
00:52:55,759 --> 00:52:57,679
I probably won't be able to go greet you.

675
00:52:57,679 --> 00:53:01,440
Oh, come on. I want to see your face.

676
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,139
Then, can you like get on the stage for a bit?

677
00:53:05,139 --> 00:53:07,940
If I do that, they'll scold me to death.

678
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:11,739
If you want to see my face...

679
00:53:11,739 --> 00:53:12,979
When P'Top says,

680
00:53:12,979 --> 00:53:14,840
"Fix your eyes on the pendulum,"

681
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,990
you close your eyes for ten seconds and then open them.

682
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:20,979
What will P'Top say again?

683
00:53:20,979 --> 00:53:24,340
"Fix your eyes on the pendulum."

684
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,619
And why do I have to close my eyes?

685
00:53:27,619 --> 00:53:29,959
Well, just do it, okay?

686
00:53:29,959 --> 00:53:32,800
I gotta go now. I'll see you soon.

687
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:38,739
It's been three months, three whole months.

688
00:53:38,739 --> 00:53:40,899
I've tried sleeping pills, relaxing massage,

689
00:53:40,899 --> 00:53:42,339
playing sports in the late morning,

690
00:53:42,339 --> 00:53:44,539
keeping a sleep schedule, listening to ASMR,

691
00:53:44,539 --> 00:53:46,219
moving to sleep on the sofa,

692
00:53:46,219 --> 00:53:47,919
on the ceiling, and on the roof.

693
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,900
But no matter what I do, I can't fall asleep.

694
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:53,139
What should I do in order to be able to sleep?

695
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,979
You've tried sleeping pills, relaxing massage,

696
00:53:56,979 --> 00:53:58,340
playing sports in the late morning,

697
00:53:58,340 --> 00:53:59,719
keeping a sleep schedule,

698
00:53:59,719 --> 00:54:01,219
listening to ASMR,

699
00:54:01,219 --> 00:54:02,580
moving to sleep on the sofa,

700
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:05,680
on the ceiling, and on a roof.

701
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,400
but... you still can't sleep?

702
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:15,699
Have you tried closing your eyes yet?

703
00:54:15,699 --> 00:54:19,459
I've tried it already. But even when I do, I can't sleep.

704
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:23,240
Then can you close your eyes for me?

705
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,719
See? I've closed them,

706
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:29,380
but I still feel like I haven't.

707
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:35,300
Then let me try.

708
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:39,220
Look at this pendulum.

709
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:41,720
Don't fix your gaze anywhere else.

710
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:54,140
Try fixing your eyes on the pendulum.

711
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,420
"Fix your eyes on the pendulum."

712
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,660
"Fix your eyes on the pendulum."

713
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,539
One.

714
00:55:14,539 --> 00:55:15,819
Two.

715
00:55:15,819 --> 00:55:17,179
Three.

716
00:55:17,179 --> 00:55:21,139
- Four. Five. Six.
- I think I'm getting sleepy.

717
00:55:21,139 --> 00:55:22,419
Seven.

718
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:25,870
- Eight. Nine...
- I'll go to sleep now.

719
00:55:25,870 --> 00:55:27,553
Ten.

720
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:02,330
Ai Teh, what the hell did you do? Don't think that I didn't see that.

721
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,693
Boo!

722
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,659
I thought you wanted me to see something.

723
00:56:48,659 --> 00:56:52,019
You just had me see a guy running in the dark.

724
00:56:52,019 --> 00:56:55,359
Well, I wanted you to see me on stage.

725
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:58,193
Here.

726
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:01,800
For your first play.

727
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:07,659
Hey, I'm only a backstage hand.

728
00:57:07,659 --> 00:57:09,779
Do I get flowers as well?

729
00:57:09,779 --> 00:57:11,413
Yeah.

730
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:22,273
Thank you.

731
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:27,819
The play's finally over, so now I...

732
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:30,920
can go back to spending every night with you, right?

733
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,620
Getting shy?

734
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,499
Excuse me.

735
00:57:44,499 --> 00:57:45,999
Who's this?

736
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,580
Could you please introduce your friend to us?

737
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:51,639
Oh, this is Oh-aew.

738
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:57,199
Oh, the one that's not a friend, but a...

739
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,700
a boyfriend, maybe?

740
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:04,100
You're studying Communication Arts at Anantasart, right?

741
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:05,879
That's right.

742
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:09,560
Oh-aew, that's not a very common name, is it?

743
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,300
That's true.

744
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:14,479
This is P'Khim, the director.

745
00:58:14,479 --> 00:58:17,179
- And this is P'Jai, the stage manager.
- Hello.

746
00:58:17,179 --> 00:58:19,260
- Hello.
- Hello.

747
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:21,959
Oh, yeah! I almost forgot. I have something to tell you.

748
00:58:21,959 --> 00:58:22,839
Yes.

749
00:58:22,839 --> 00:58:25,279
This play has been nominated for the contest.

750
00:58:25,279 --> 00:58:26,859
But we only got one month.

751
00:58:26,859 --> 00:58:29,219
So I think I'll fix it as good as it can get.

752
00:58:29,219 --> 00:58:30,579
Let's have a meeting.

753
00:58:30,579 --> 00:58:32,980
Here, right after clearing the set, we'll go out for a meal.

754
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:36,560
That way we can have a long meeting and talk about it. Okay?

755
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:41,020
Oh-aew, you can join us.

756
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:43,330
Because there's only us and just a few of the crew.

757
00:58:43,339 --> 00:58:45,599
All right? Okay, so that's it!

758
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:47,319
When you're done, go help your friends with the props.

759
00:58:47,319 --> 00:58:49,219
Because the security will come close the building.

760
00:58:49,219 --> 00:58:51,799
- All right? That's it!
- Okay.

761
00:58:51,799 --> 00:58:52,999
- See you there.
- See you.

762
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,779
- Let's go.
- Everyone, hurry up!

763
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:25,380
It's all right.

764
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,933
I won't do it.

765
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:37,940
You should just do it.

766
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:40,400
I know you want to.

767
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,870
It's a play nominated for the contest.

768
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:49,180
But I've given so much of our time to other people already.

769
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,993
Teh.

770
00:59:59,993 --> 01:00:02,380
Since I've known you,

771
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,520
your dream is making plays.

772
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,460
And if you're not okay, how could I be okay?

773
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:14,970
Then who are you going to be with?

774
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:18,479
I'll just hang out with my friends, of course.

775
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,799
When you're not around,

776
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,319
I'll go have a blast with my friends.

777
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:26,440
After this, I'll be partying at my friend's place.

778
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,479
For real?

779
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,039
For real.

780
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,799
At first, I was going to ask you to come with me.

781
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,319
But it's fine, really.

782
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,239
You should go with the seniors.

783
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:55,040
Once we're done, I'll go.

784
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:02,999
Okay. Then text me once you arrive at your condo.

785
01:01:02,999 --> 01:01:05,519
I'll text you when I get to my dorm.

786
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,220
Okay, see ya.

787
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:21,900
Here. Let me take that for you.

788
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:24,080
But aren't you going to a party after this?

789
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,880
Well, you seem busy. I'll keep it for you.

790
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,590
All right, then I'll see you later.

791
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:11,853
One.

792
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,613
Two.

793
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,733
Three...

794
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:53,440
Why are you sitting here? Let's go dancing.

795
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,519
It's okay. I don't want to.

796
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,880
Hey. Come on, now.

797
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:37,959
♫ I don't know how you are over there ♫

798
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:41,719
♫ But all I know is that I'm over here. I can barely make it ♫

799
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:47,639
♫ I don't need anything more than this ♫

800
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:50,759
♫ I just want you to tuck me in ♫

801
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,999
♫ Because it's late at night and I feel cold♫

802
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,039
♫ The loneliness is growing every minute ♫

803
01:03:56,040 --> 01:04:02,679
♫ It'd be nice if I had you.
I wouldn't have to be lonely, but I understand ♫

804
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:07,999
♫ I just need to see your face a bit on this lonely night ♫

805
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,039
♫ Just where are you? ♫

806
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:16,800
♫ I'm still waiting for you to come and say "Sweet dreams" ♫
