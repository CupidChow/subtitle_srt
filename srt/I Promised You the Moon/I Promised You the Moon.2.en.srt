[I Promised You the Moon]

18
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,719
To be a good actor, we must first understand
[Faculty of Communication Arts]

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,539
and we must know more about ourselves.

20
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,280
The thing is, if we can understand ourselves,

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,739
we'll be able to understand other people,

22
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:08,140
including the character of the play that we're going to portray.

23
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,700
Today, I have a teacher assistant with me.

24
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,300
P'Jai, I invite you to the center of the circle, please.

25
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,299
That's right, right over here.

26
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:19,319
In a moment, I'll turn on the music.

27
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:22,859
And the person in the center of the circle will listen to the music

28
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:27,580
and move freely as they feel, using the song as a stimulus.

29
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,999
I'll have Jai be the one to start it off first.

30
00:01:29,999 --> 00:01:31,859
As for those who are around the circle,

31
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:37,579
we'll observe the type of posture, the movement of the body, or even what he's feeling.

32
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:42,780
And then we'll take that and put it into our own movements.

33
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,330
Understand? Let's give it a try.

34
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,659
That's right.

35
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,520
Slowly open your heart.

36
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,060
Welcome Jai to your movement.

37
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,099
Studying Performing Arts is just like learning a language.

38
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:28,359
It's about communication and interpretation.

39
00:02:28,359 --> 00:02:32,779
And this is why we're studying script analysis.

40
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:34,979
It's very important.

41
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:38,179
For example, actors, directors...

42
00:02:38,179 --> 00:02:43,919
The lighting on stage is not just for aesthetic purposes.

43
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,060
There.

44
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:51,620
But it also helps you acknowledge what's going on stage as well.

45
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,259
Once the lights change,

46
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:56,910
the meaning and emotion of the scene changes, too.

47
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,299
How are you feeling about your major?

48
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:01,920
Do you like it?
[Second year]

49
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,410
Of course, I like it.

50
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:05,700
Did you know, back when I was in high school,

51
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,880
I kept asking Ma, "If I want to be an actor,

52
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,739
why the hell do I have to sit here and learn these maths and sciences?"

53
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:14,339
"Why can't I learn what I want to learn?"

54
00:03:14,339 --> 00:03:17,919
Ma said to wait until I got into university first.

55
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:20,500
I only just got what Ma was saying.

56
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,419
When I was in those classes, I felt... so damn fulfilled.

57
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:27,699
It's like I've been waiting to study about this for a long time.

58
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:31,600
It felt so fulfilling that... my eyes were brimming with tears.

59
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,180
You're such a damn nerd.

60
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,979
Well, well... and what about you being a TA?

61
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:40,839
That's not nerdy at all?

62
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:42,339
You said you didn't like acting.

63
00:03:42,339 --> 00:03:43,699
So why did you become a TA for Ms. May, then?

64
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:46,759
Well, I just wanted to learn about everything.

65
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:50,399
Things from stage management, acting, script writing...

66
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:53,130
Isn't it good to know it all?

67
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,960
- Damn nerd.
- You're the nerd!

68
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,599
- Damn nerd.
- Damn nerd.

69
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,180
Let me ask you for real. You really didn't know?

70
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,679
My little sister came home from school every day with bruises like this,

71
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,730
and you really didn't know?

72
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,500
Do you think I'm crazy?

73
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,250
No, I'm asking you if you think I'm crazy.

74
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,580
My little sister had marks every day! I had marks every day! How could you not notice, Dad?

75
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,819
- How many times have I told you?
- Hey, P'Khim is really good.

76
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:29,119
- Just watching her for a bit, and I'm immersed in it.
- You're shaking your head? What for?

77
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:31,360
Yeah, I also want to see her alongside P'Top on the TV screen, too.

78
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,640
Do you think I'm crazy?

79
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,620
- But damn...
-You think I'm crazy, don't you?

80
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,970
She never passes the casting.

81
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,640
Bravo!

82
00:04:48,739 --> 00:04:54,020

Oh, Jai, are you free?

85
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,979
Do you need to go anywhere after this?

86
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:04,819
I'm not going anywhere. Why?

87
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:06,839
Ee'Top has gone to the drama set again.

88

Once we get to rehearsing, he has to suddenly run to the set every time.

89

I've had to stand here running my mouth alone. Other people must think I'm insane or something.

92
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,770
You want to act, don't you?

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,100
Please come down and rehearse with me.

94
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,933
Hurry. Please.

00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,660

00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:50,639
Here. Today we only got sweet ones. Want some?

Yeah, just a bit.

Ah. Okay. You said sweet?

00:07:05,281 --> 00:07:07,280
It's so freaking bitter!

- Oh, right...

- Where are you sleeping tonight?
- Do you want to add anything?

125
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,140
- I'll probably go to sleep back at the dorm.
- There you go.

126
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,119
Oh, right... Teh and Oh-aew, have you been to castings yet?

127
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,500
We still haven't had a chance to do so.

128
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,619
I think you guys should do it fast.

129
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:28,939
We really want to see our friends appear on the TV screen already.

That's right! For real.

- Isn't that right?
- That's right.

132
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,659
Well, once we graduate, we'll work in agencies.

133
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:36,360
Teh and Oh-aew will become actors, and then we can depend on each other.

134

What the hell are you off on? You can depend on them, but they can't depend on you.

How damn rich!

139
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,859
So convenient. Right?

140
00:07:52,859 --> 00:07:55,419
They make money so easily. Like, very easily.

141
00:07:55,419 --> 00:07:57,220
Isn't that nice?

142
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,839
What about you, Ee'Plug?

143
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:03,719
But I think that by the time they're able to prove themselves to have people love them that much...

144
00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:06,520
they must have worked really hard, though.

145
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,620
I don't think it's convenient.

146
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,540
Yeah.

147
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,020
Okay.

148

- What?

151
00:08:30,253 --> 00:08:33,040
Here. Take a look at this.

00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,639
How's this?

153
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,439
- Here! How is it?
- Hey!

154
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,639
- Hey.
- What the hell is that?

00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,740
How is it?

156
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,079
Hey, what's so funny, guys?

157
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,460
Shit!

158
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,719
- He's been whining for so long about getting a tattoo.
- Yeah.

159

So you finally got one, huh?

160
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:48,459
Did it hurt?

161
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:50,259
Right here it doesn't really hurt, man.

162
00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:52,819
But... I'm going to also get tattooed here, too.

163
00:08:52,819 --> 00:08:55,719
Here. They said that it hurts a lot.

164
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:57,139
How is it? Beautiful, right?

165
00:08:57,139 --> 00:08:59,139
- Beautiful...
- Beautiful, so beautiful... Yes, yes...

166
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,679
You guys are faking it!

167
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,160
- Beautiful...
- It's beautiful...

168
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,900
- Plug, you're a liar.
- Well, it's beautiful.

169
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,459
- You're fake!
- Enough. I'm not gonna talk to you anymore.

170
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:08,820
Teh. How about it?

171
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,070
- Beautiful, right?
- Yeah.

172
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,220
It's beautiful.

173
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,700
Yeah, he's not fake.

174
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,900
I also have something to show.

175
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,833
What is it?

176
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,459
Here it is.

177
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:32,839
- What is that?
- Hey, you got one, too?

178
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:33,780
Isn't it cute?

179
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,359
It's cute.

180
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,460
What is it?

181
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,560
It's a cup of tea.

182
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,299
Hey, but... why this kind of image?

183
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:46,040
- Yeah.
- Well,

184
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,459
because Teh means "tea".

185
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:48,820
- Ugh!
- Oh!

186
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,400
How cheesy! I'm going to throw up!

187
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,010
Why didn't you tell me what you were going to do first?

188
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,520
Well, the tattoo artist was free then.

189
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,620
If I waited, I would have had to wait until next month.

190
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,540
And he even let me cut in.

191
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,473
Why?

192
00:10:08,473 --> 00:10:10,400
You don't like it?

193
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,330
It's not that I don't like it.

194
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,573
But...

195
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,320
Won't your mom and dad be upset about it?

196
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,559
But the tattoo is just a small, tiny one.

197
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,840
Just wearing a watch covers it already.

198
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,740
How come, when it came to Auu's tattoo, you said it was beautiful?

199
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,810
When it comes to mine, why is it like this?

200
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,630
I thought that you would be happy that I got this tattoo.

201
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,860
This tattoo is pretty.

202
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,413
Thank you.

203
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,873
There, there.

204
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,979
Aew. Teh. They're about to open the presents already.

205
00:11:32,979 --> 00:11:35,053
Hurry up.

206
00:11:35,053 --> 00:11:36,719
- Let's hurry up.
- Yeah.

207
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,420
You go ahead. I'm going to the restroom first.

208
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,053
Yeah.

209
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,499
- I'm home now (in Chinese).
- Hold on.

210
00:12:02,499 --> 00:12:05,100
Take your shoes off first.

211
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,440
Easy, easy.

212
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,799
Slowly there.

213
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,300
Take it easy.

214
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,480
Can I go to sleep now?

215
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,060
I want to sleep.

216
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,899
When you're drunk, you speak Chinese so fluently, huh?

217
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:40,690
You'll sleep here tonight, all right? That way, you won't throw up and make a mess on the bed.

218
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:46,030
If you're going to throw up, throw up in here, all right?

219
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,380
Don't make a mess while throwing up.

220
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,760
Lift your head up a bit.

221
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,560
A little bit more.

222
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,000
Are you going home now?

223
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,340
Don't go to class tomorrow.

224
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,380
Spend a night here.

225
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,370
Could you?

226
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,280
Could you?

227
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,400
Could you?

228
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,440
Yes, I can.

229
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,820
You're this drunk. How could I leave you and go back to my dorm?

230
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,053
Take it off.

[Faculty of Communication Arts]

235
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,700
Should we rehearse for a bit?

236
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,333
Yeah, sure.

237
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,079
You're acting so sensitive.

238
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,060
- You act as if...
- "As if" what?

239
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,493
Say it.

240
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,350
You know what I'm going to say.

241
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,100
As if I were a woman, right?

242
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,419
Why?

243
00:16:31,419 --> 00:16:35,620
Being born a man... can I not be sensitive?

244
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:42,440
But being sensitive goes against a man's honor.

245
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:47,219
Pasakorn, the acting that you used to express a gay character was very good.

246
00:16:47,219 --> 00:16:48,620
It doesn't seem stereotypical.

247
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,579
And most importantly, you were into that character 100%.

248
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:52,839
There was no Pasakorn left in you.

249
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:54,859
This time I'll give you an A, all right?

250
00:16:54,859 --> 00:16:56,759
Thank you very much.

251
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:00,279
Panwa, the thing is that the character was talking about something difficult.

252
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:03,300
But you were able to express it in a way that the audience could understand very easily.

253
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,200
This was good.

254
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,699
But it seems that you're still stuck with the same issues, right?

255
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:13,139
That is, your personality and tone still don't seem like the character.

256
00:17:13,139 --> 00:17:18,179
Try to think that this character is a man in that era...

257
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:22,339
who still doesn't understand what it means to be gay and still can't accept it.

258
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:28,319
Last time, I gave you homework to study about the gestures of standing, walking, and sitting of the man in that era...

259
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,039
Did you do it, Panwa?

260
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,453
Yes, I did.

261
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:38,419
That means you still can't leave your own personality behind.

262
00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:44,579
That is... I understand that the character you play and your true personality are very different.

263
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:47,139
But if you choose to be an actor,

264
00:17:47,139 --> 00:17:51,079
your job is to adjust and tune yourself to become that character.

265
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:55,980
So that you can portray what the script intended to the best of your ability.

266
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,800
This time, I'll give you a C.

267
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,020
And try to go back and work on it.

268
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,319
But next time, if you still need to work on the same issues,

269
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:08,520
I'll have to ask you to change the story you're going to play.

270
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,353
Thank you.

271
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,760
Next pair, please.

272
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,340
You're the one who invited me along, and then you were the one who came late.

273
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,699
The sky train was out of service.

274
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:56,550
I would've asked you to take your motorbike to pick me up.

275
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,600
I have some good news to tell you.

276
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,619
There's an internet film ad that's been announcing a casting call.

277
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:15,220
That P'Khim's about to go try it out.

278
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:19,939
And there happens to be a role that P'Khim thinks is perfect for the both of us.

279
00:19:19,939 --> 00:19:23,620
So she tried showing our Instagrams to the casting team,

280
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:28,099
and they're interested. They want us to go try it out.

281
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,140
Both of us are about to go try out our first casting.

282
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,820
Okay, let's continue talking later.

283
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,819
Everyone must already know that my name is Chun.

284
00:19:55,819 --> 00:20:00,700
The first thing I must say, is that I've been living with my girlfriend for a while now.

285
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,219
This is the case of Gwinnett's brand.
[Department of Advertising]

286
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:05,740
It's a brand that sells shaving products.

287
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:09,119
Normally, it's aimed at men.

288
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:11,659
But in the end, Gwinnett's decided

289
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:13,739
- Hey.
- to target the market for women as well.

290
00:20:13,739 --> 00:20:16,699
Didn't you say you had a play rehearsal with Ai'Korn at 11 a.m.?

291
00:20:16,699 --> 00:20:18,499
Therefore, they released the

292
00:20:18,499 --> 00:20:19,940
- Yes.
- shaving products for women.

293
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,940
And are you not going?

294
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,510
I don't want to. I'm bored.

295
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:29,239
Because although women don't have to shave off a beard,

296
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:31,639
they still need to shave other parts, right?

297
00:20:31,639 --> 00:20:38,040
My question is... why do they have to launch particular products for women,

298
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,739
since women can also use men's razors, too?

299
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:44,240
Can anyone answer it?

300
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,019
Yes?

301
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:49,820
Is it to make the packaging look friendlier to women?

302
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,579
Yes, part of that is true. What about everyone else? What do you think?

303
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,353
Anyone?

304
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,353
So anyone?

305
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,579
Yes?

306
00:21:03,579 --> 00:21:04,579
What do you think?

307
00:21:04,579 --> 00:21:08,800
Because... of the shape of the handle?

308
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,780
Yes, could you tell me more about it?

309
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:17,479
- Well, if it's a man… wouldn't he hold the razor like this?
- Yeah.

310
00:21:17,479 --> 00:21:19,039
But women, they also

311
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,379
shave other parts, such as armpits or their private parts.

312
00:21:23,379 --> 00:21:28,160
- So they would have to design a new handle to suit women...

313
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,859
Very good. That's correct.

314
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:34,499
It's a good example of bringing the consumer's insight

315
00:21:34,499 --> 00:21:37,579
in order to create a product that is aimed at a new market target.

316
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:40,699
- And it also touches on the consumer's needs
- Oh-aew, how did you know?

317
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:43,060
for a certain group amongst a group of diverse customers.

318
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,060
So let's move on to the next case.

319
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,479
Two iced Americanos. It'll be a total of 200 Baht, please.

320
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,659
You're drinking two glasses all by yourself...

321
00:21:55,659 --> 00:21:57,860
Are you studying hard these days?

322
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,659
Well, just a bit.
(T/N: he is using the feminine form of saying this sentence)

323
00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:02,420
I wanted a drink that could last me for a long time while studying.

324
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,699
I don't think one glass would be enough.

325
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,439
Would you like to try a coffee shot with orange juice?

326
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,239
Because it's pretty refreshing,

327
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,839
it should be suitable for when you're studying.

328
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,140
That way, your brain won't feel overwhelmed.

329
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,380
I think you got it.

330
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,599
I only just realized that so many people would come for the casting.

331
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,660
And they want just two people?

332
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,693
That's insane.

333
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,100
Take it easy.

334
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,900
Just doing your best is enough.

335
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,150
Whether you get it or not, don't mind it.

336
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,893
I'm nervous.

337
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,493
What's wrong?

338
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,210
You can't play the role?

339
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,659
Someone like me not being able to play the role?

340
00:23:07,659 --> 00:23:10,340
- Do you want to try asking that again?
- Um...

341
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,099
No, no... the thing is...

342
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:15,759
They just said that... I looked too old to be a high school student.

343
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:18,939
And with my face... that I didn't really look smart.

344
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,659
and not trustworthy enough...

345
00:23:20,659 --> 00:23:23,379
and that their brand would suffer losses.

346
00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:25,519
So I was like... fuck it.

347
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:27,353
Hey.

348
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,379
They really said all that?

349
00:23:30,379 --> 00:23:31,959
Wasn't that too harsh?

350
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:34,139
No, not at all. It's very common.

351
00:23:34,139 --> 00:23:36,939
Truthfully, both you and Oh-aew will go through it, too.

352
00:23:36,939 --> 00:23:39,840
Don't think about it too much. Keep reading the script.

353
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,350
You have tears rolling down...

354
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:46,299
- Read the script.
- Nong Oh-ay?

355
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,859
Please go ahead.

356
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,893
Yes, Sir.

357
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,560
Two iced Americanos. It'll be a total of 200 Baht, please.

358
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,179
You're drinking two glasses all by yourself... Are you studying hard these days?

359
00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:12,600
Cut!

360
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,820
Well, how should I put this?

361
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,419
When you didn't speak, you looked great.

362
00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:20,699
But once you started acting, you seemed... like girly.

363
00:24:20,699 --> 00:24:23,419
Could you act more manly?

364
00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:26,870
I want you to be like a man hitting on a girl.

365
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,720
Of course, I'll try correcting it for you.

366
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,760
Well, if you're ready, go ahead and start.

367
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,900
Two iced Americanos. It'll be a total of 200 Baht, please.

368
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:55,050
You're drinking two glasses all by yourself... Are you studying hard these days?

369
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:03,079
You know, I've never turned down any role.

370
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:06,299
Because I know an actress must be able to play every role.

371
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:10,900
Whether it's supporting roles, extras, or whatever the fuck... I'll take them all.

372
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,899
Because I keep telling myself that whatever role I get,

373
00:25:14,899 --> 00:25:17,020
I have to do my best.

374
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,220
And I did my best.

375
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:27,540
But it's just like... It's my little hope.

376
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:30,680
I want to get a main role too, you know.

377
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,580
So people will recognize me

378
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:36,260
and hire me again.

379
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,350
I really want to make it my career...

380
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,840
that I can support myself,

381
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,560
support my parents, my family.

382
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,280
You know, Top got to be a presenter

383
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,819
for just one cell phone product,

384
00:25:57,819 --> 00:26:01,139
and he's able to get a down payment for a new house at Rama Nine.

385
00:26:01,139 --> 00:26:03,090
And look at me...

386
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:06,379
I kept going to castings. Going to so many castings that I don't even know anymore.

387
00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:07,939
I kept playing small roles.

388
00:26:07,939 --> 00:26:10,790
I can only afford a fucking roof of a house.

389
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,073
I'm all right.

390
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,720
It's not that serious. I'm okay.

391
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,840
But I really believe it...

392
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:38,420
I think that one day, that opportunity is going to be mine.

393
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,200
It's all right.

394
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,340
You can cry, you know.

395
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,540
It's really all right.

396
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:08,680
Crying, it... it doesn't mean that you're giving up.

397
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,820
I understand.

398
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,650
I'll be right by your side.

399
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,240
We'll fight through this together.

400
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,233
Okay.

401
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:33,620
We will get through this together. We will.

402
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:47,139
When I was acting, they said that I was a natural.

403
00:27:47,139 --> 00:27:50,590
But I didn't get the part in the end.

404
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:53,860
Well, it was your first time, wasn't it?

405
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:57,873
Yeah, it's fine.

406
00:27:57,873 --> 00:27:59,979
At least, they liked it.

407
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:03,280
They also told me to come to the casting next time, too.

408
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,319
If that's what they say, then that means that you'll get it next time!

409
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,860
If you don't get it, make a scene!

410
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,630
And what about you? How'd it go?

411
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,400
They...

412
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,460
they said that I had to act more manly.

413
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,640
They said I was too girly.

414
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,740
And are you okay?

415
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,700
Well, I understand them, you know?

416
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:44,010
They just want an actor who's right for the role.

417
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:53,090
Well, I couldn't change my personality to be what they wanted.

418
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,413
Oh...

419
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,640
I like that you're like this.

420
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,379
And I also believe that there will be a lot more people who like you like this, too.

421
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,860
As for acting...

422
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,259
I think that we still have plenty of time.

423
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,339
And one day, when we get better...

424
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:26,040
no matter what role it is, we'll be able to do it all.

425
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,480
I'm going to fight through this with you.

426
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,653
Are you all right?

427
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:08,880
I think... I want to transfer.

428
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,560
I'm not fit to be an actor.

429
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,770
I want to learn more about advertising.

430
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,920
Hey... wait...

431
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,399
And what about the times when you and I were tutoring?

432
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,400
That you wanted to get into Communication Arts,

433
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,230
wasn't that because you wanted to become an actor?

434
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:57,519
You've only just chosen your major for three months, you know. Do you want to transfer already?

435
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,270
Well, I didn't know that actually studying it would be this difficult.

436
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:05,039
At first, I thought it was kind of fun.

437
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,830
But the more I learned about it, the more difficult it became.

438
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,490
Whatever you study, it's all going to be difficult.

439
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:17,399
But if it's difficult and I want to study it, why wouldn't I keep going?

440
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:19,659
But now, I keep asking myself,

441
00:31:19,659 --> 00:31:21,660
about having to play other people...

442
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:25,360
and I'm so frustrated every time I have to act...

443
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,620
You still haven't given it your all, though.

444
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,360
I've already fought through it.

445
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,539
I really did try.

446
00:31:35,539 --> 00:31:38,090
Well, the reason that I went to the casting today,

447
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,920
was because I wanted to fight with my all.

448
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,679
No, not at all. You still haven't fought with your all.

449
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,579
Look at P'Khim.

450
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:50,019
Shit! She's gone to hundreds of castings.

451
00:31:50,019 --> 00:31:51,700
And she's still going to castings.

452
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,320
You've only gone to one casting.

453
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:59,759
But just once has made it clear... that I really don't like it.

454
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,030
And one more thing...

455
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:11,720
I've already sat in the advertising class.

456
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,660
I think I like it.

457
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,510
"You sat in it?"

458
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,239
Well, I was free then,

459
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,740
so I just sat around for fun with Q and the rest.

460
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,853
Right.

461
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,340
"Q and the rest?"

462
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:53,873
Teh. Studying arts, if you're not talented,

463
00:32:53,873 --> 00:32:56,340
you won't be able to go far, no?

464
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,779
I already tried thinking about it...

465
00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:00,770
what I'm good at

466
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:04,050
or at least, I think that it's more me...

467
00:33:04,059 --> 00:33:08,500
It's marketing, doing business, sales of products...

468
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:13,000
If I continue studying and graduate, even if I don't know what to do,

469
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,139
I could still go back to work at the resort back home.

470
00:33:16,139 --> 00:33:18,940
You've never wanted to work at the resort back home.

471
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:25,080
But sometimes... the things that I didn't like before...

472
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,920
I might grow to like them someday.

473
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,160
It's just that I've only just found myself.

474
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,760
Are you mad at me?

475
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,940
You've already really thought this through?

476
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,780
I've been thinking about it for a while now.

477
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,030
Then why have you never told me about it?

478
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,360
Well, I wasn't sure.

479
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:23,240
But now I'm certain.

480
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:31,260
If I really choose to study Advertising,

481
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,210
would you be okay with that?

482
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,253
I'm sorry.

483
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,060
It's all right.

484
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,933
It's okay.

485
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,200
If you think it's right for you, then... you can give it a try for yourself.

486
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,950
And if it's still not right for you, you can always come back and study Performing Arts.

487
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,300
You can stop crying already.

488
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,960
Don't cry. It's all right.

489
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,200
[Eight months later]

490
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,793
Of course, the both of us.

491
00:36:15,793 --> 00:36:18,730
You and I will have to reach that point together.

492
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:23,413
All right. I'll be there with you.

493
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:34,939
Normally, doesn't this brand only hire kids to be their presenters?

494
00:36:34,939 --> 00:36:37,759
Or maybe, like they always get celebrity kids.

495
00:36:37,759 --> 00:36:40,420
Our main target group is working-age consumers.

496
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:43,439
So celeb kids... probably... probably wouldn't work.

497
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,239
Then would it have to be TV celebrities.

498
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,240
For working-age people to recognize them?

499
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:53,299
But I think teenage celebrities would be better.

500
00:36:53,299 --> 00:36:56,179
You see, though our target is working-age,

501
00:36:56,179 --> 00:36:59,019
the product is a soft drink.

502
00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:02,839
So... just a teenage celebrity that's really popular

503
00:37:02,839 --> 00:37:05,519
who has played in movies, TV shows, or something like that.

504
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:07,199
Like, P'Top?

505
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:09,320
- Yeah! That's it.
- Good.
- Yeah.

506
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,919
This would fit with our working-age consumers,

507
00:37:11,919 --> 00:37:15,419
and you'll also get teenage consumers as well. So you'll be able to hit both markets.

508
00:37:15,419 --> 00:37:17,079
Okay, then it's settled.

509
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:19,299
- Okay!
- Okay.

510
00:37:19,299 --> 00:37:21,433
Cut!

511
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,620
I think that's it.

512
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,653
Thank you very much.

513
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,813

00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,919
Any time now, yeah.

520
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,953
Yes!

521

- No.
- Let's take a photo together!

522

- No, you get out!
- Let me in!

Get out!

527
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,579
Hello! How was it? Are you done with class?

528
00:38:58,579 --> 00:39:00,899
Why would you video call me?

529
00:39:00,899 --> 00:39:04,079
Well, I wanted to see your face, of course!

530
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,320
And why does your face look so joyless?

531
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,899
It seems like the casting team doesn't really like me.

532
00:39:09,899 --> 00:39:12,300
I think I won't get it for sure...

533
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,979
How about this? Why don't you come eat with us?

534
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:16,379
I'll comfort you myself!

535
00:39:16,379 --> 00:39:19,099
I already made plans with Ai'Jai and Ai'Top. Hurry up and come over.

536
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:21,819
How did you know that I wouldn't get the part?

537
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:24,420
That's not it. I just made plans first, that is all.

538
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,599
Because if you got it, then we'd celebrate it right away!

539
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:30,500
But if you didn't get it, then bam! I'd comfort you. That's all.

540
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,433
Okay?

541
00:39:32,433 --> 00:39:34,799
Okay, then. I'll send you the location.

542
00:39:34,799 --> 00:39:36,440
- See you.
- Yeah.

543
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,740
All right

544
00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:00,760
[Oh-aew : Oh no, giving you hugs! Of course! Where are we eating?]

[Teh: It's all right. P'Khim's already invited me to eat out.]

546
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,400
[Oh-aew: Where? Once I'm done with work, I'll quickly head over]

547
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,659
This field has a lot of competition, man.

548
00:40:32,659 --> 00:40:35,639
Not to mention that there's no clear rule in how they do their selection either.

549
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:37,939
Sometimes just being good isn't enough.

550
00:40:37,939 --> 00:40:40,459
I think luck is also a big factor too.

551
00:40:40,459 --> 00:40:42,730
I've always thought that

552
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:45,570
the first time that I got to play a main role,

553
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:48,659
I was just lucky... that the casting team

554
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:52,900
couldn't find anyone else more suitable for the role than me.

555
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,319
Why is it that doing something that we love

556
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,480
just so difficult?

557
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,259
Come on now.

558
00:41:03,259 --> 00:41:05,939
If you keep getting rejected on castings, you'll get used to it eventually.

559
00:41:05,939 --> 00:41:07,539
Like, P'Khim...

560
00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:09,059
What?

561
00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:11,939
- I was just minding my own business...
- Just kidding!

562
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:16,120
But I've got my own motto, you know.

563
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,979
No matter how many times you may be denied, it's all right.

564
00:41:18,979 --> 00:41:20,979
You just keep on improving yourself.

565
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,499
And finally, the day when the opportunity comes to you,

566
00:41:23,499 --> 00:41:25,039
then you'll do your best.

567
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:28,499
And, on that day, you'll be on fire. I'm telling you.

568
00:41:28,499 --> 00:41:31,299
- That's right.
- So stop being depressed already!

569
00:41:31,299 --> 00:41:33,800
Eat up! Eat!

570
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,660
Thanks so much.

571
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:42,219
All right... I'm going to use this tea to make a toast to the future main actor.

572
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,300
Amen.

573
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,660
I hope that happens.

574
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,519
Wait, bro. Could you spit the tea over my head?
(T/N: Like how shamans and monks might spit holy water for luck)

575
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:53,879
- For good luck.
- You got it.

576
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,499
- Come here.
- Wait just a minute!

577
00:41:55,499 --> 00:41:56,420
- I was kidding.
- You don't want me to?

578
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,520
- No, I don't.
- It's nice and cold, though.

579
00:41:59,020 --> 00:41:59,940
Just drink it already.

580
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,090
I was just playing.

I'm sorry that I came late.

Right, Oh-aew, how's Performing Arts at Anantasart?

602
00:43:30,499 --> 00:43:32,293
Is it nice?

603
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,500
Yes, it is. There are a lot of great professors.

604
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,559
And some of them actually work in the industry, too.

605
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,939
I wanted to study in that faculty too, you know.

606
00:43:42,939 --> 00:43:45,219
Their Performing Arts is really good.

607
00:43:45,219 --> 00:43:47,420
But I didn't pass the exam, though.

608
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,620
It's all right.

609
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,839
So... Oh-aew, what kind of play genres do you like?

610
00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:00,100
- Well...
- You don't need to ask him that.

611
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:03,220
In the end, he ended up transferring to Advertising already.

612
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,900
Sorry, I didn't know.

613
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:12,999
So... why did you transfer? You didn't like it?

614
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,480
It was difficult.

615
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,559
So I chose to study what I was better at.

616
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:22,700
He's been like this since he was really little.

617
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:25,900
Never serious and so indecisive... He's always changing his likes.

618
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:29,800
He only went to one casting, and he already gave up liking acting.

619
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:34,220
It was just once, you know?

620
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,859
The reason I quit after going to only one casting...

621
00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:51,350
was because... just the one time made it clear...

622
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:53,580
that I'm not suited for acting.

623
00:44:56,300 --> 00:45:00,799
Right. That was the right thing. Knowing it sooner... is better.

624
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:03,139
Right. That way, you can study what you like.

625
00:45:03,139 --> 00:45:04,439
- That's true.
- That's true.

626
00:45:04,439 --> 00:45:07,099
I'm afraid he doesn't know what he's into for real, though.

627
00:45:07,099 --> 00:45:10,220
If he transfers again, he won't be able to graduate in time with his friends.

628
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:13,559
- They'll graduate first!
- So just how many times must I get denied, then?

629
00:45:13,559 --> 00:45:16,219
So that I don't seem like someone who's indecisive and not serious in your eyes?

630
00:45:16,219 --> 00:45:18,380
Do I have to go to hundreds of castings like Khim

631
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,580
in order for you to be satisfied?

632
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:46,300
I'm sorry, P'Khim. I didn't mean to.

Even if it's difficult...

796
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:55,440
having you with me

797
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:58,430
makes me feel like...

798
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:01,760
I'm not fighting alone.

799
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:14,420
But right now, I feel like I'm fighting all by myself.

800
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:21,070
Even Khim is going to be a flight attendant.

801
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:28,320
Why do people have to change like this?

802
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:31,880
I don't like it.

803
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:35,213
Teh.

804
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:40,400
Everyone has their own paths in life.

805
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:47,800
I understand everything.

806
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:53,360
But it still hurts.

807
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:59,920
Truthfully, when you said you wanted to transfer,

808
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:04,600
your reasons really... everything made so much damn sense.

809
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:11,440
But I didn't want to believe that.

810
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:18,700
I just wanted to believe that you're doing it more just to follow your friends.

811
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:20,353
Because...

812
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:31,010
because if I accepted that you really wanted to transfer by yourself,

813
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:38,450
it'd make me feel like you were about to leave me.

814
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:45,540
I'm still right here, though.

815
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:48,840
Have I ever left you, Teh?

816
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:54,700
Even now, when you think of however much I've changed,

817
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:58,500
remember this,

818
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,473
I promise you...

819
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,560
that I will still love you all the same.

820
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:13,010
That's never going to change.

821
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:25,050
So, can you stop thinking that I'll leave you again?

822
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,680
And I'll love you too, and that's never going to change.

823
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:58,093
I promise.
