[I Promised You the Moon]

17
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,480
I've seen some of Akin's plays before.

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,899
I think they're sophisticated and cool.

19
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:04,200
It's like watching a mixture of Murakami and Sophocles as a stage play.

20
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,393
What?

21
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,413
Cute?

22
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,193
I don't know.

23
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,879
Anyway, have you tasted my plum wine?

24
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,990
I can only give one to each of you.

25

[Third Year]

26
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,279
12:10 a.m. P'Fang's after party.

27
00:01:33,279 --> 00:01:35,660
My director is still rockin'.

28
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,660
P'Fang opened a precious bottle of plum wine that has been aged for three years

29
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,380
to share and have everyone taste it together.

30
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,140
The plum wine that I had tried before...

31
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,360
it had a taste that was very bitter, drying my throat,

32
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,580
and spicy by the combination of ingredients unknown to me.

33
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:06,980
But P'Fang's plum wine turned out to have a taste that was fragrant, sweet, and enchanting.

34
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,320
At that time, I never thought that

35
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,219
P'Fang's plum wine

36
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:19,560
would be the thing that would lead to the start of our love

37
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,800
and also the thing that made our love... end.

38
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,820
Thanks so much for coming to help me.

39
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,520
If I didn't have you, my work wouldn't have been awarded like this.

40
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,680
Being able to see you reach success makes me grateful.

41
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,050
I don't know how I can repay you.

42
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,490
All right. That's it for now.

43
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,980
I gave you the homework to explore your experience.

44
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,013
Did you do it?

45
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,313
I did.

46
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,919
Then why did what I just saw make me feel like

47
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:20,470
you're only following the cues written in the script?

48
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,210
This is the first sex scene between Akin and P'Fang.

49
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,720
Well, it's all right. Tomorrow we can...

50
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,639
work on it, I guess. That's enough for today.

51
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,820
That's enough for today, everyone.

52
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,719
Nan, have you passed out the logbooks yet?

53
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:09,320
That's right, P'Jai! I forgot. Just a moment.

54
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,853
Here.

55
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,880
- Everyone.
- Come on.

57
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,680
Teh. Guy.

58
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,899
These are logbooks for the actors.
[Teh]

59
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:24,599
I want you all to write down everything that we've done in all these workshops every day.

60
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:27,080
How you feel, what you were able to learn...

61
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,159
And hand them to me every day.

62
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,510
Anyway, it seems I've given you homework on your first day already.

63
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,259
It means that the first day is...

64
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:40,280
how you feel toward the characters that you play.

65
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:46,520
As an actor, what similarities or differences do we have with the characters we portray?

66
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:52,299
And everything that you write down in the logbooks will remain a secret.

67
00:04:52,299 --> 00:04:54,699
Because I will be the only person reading it.

68
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:58,480
Therefore, be as honest with yourself as you can.

69
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,459
Okay?

70
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:00,779
- Sure.
- Okay.

71
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:02,159
Are you guys almost finished here?

72
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:04,039
- I'm about to close the space.
- Hello, Ms. May.
- Yeah.

73
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:05,340
- Hello there.
- Oh! Ms. May!

74
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,859
I wanted to ask you about the scene in Act Two.

75
00:05:07,859 --> 00:05:10,140
All right, ask away.

76
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:17,119
Hey. Later today, I have plans with P'Khim and P'Top.

77
00:05:17,119 --> 00:05:20,680
I want them to help make comments on my script.

78
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,500
Do you want to come along?

79
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,500
I have to go see a play.

80
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:38,039
Actually, P'Khim... she isn't holding anything against you at all.

81
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,940
Well... didn't she already talk to you to clear things up?

82
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,130
Why are you still avoiding her?

83
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,510
I still feel like it's not the right time to meet her.

84
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,380
Actually, I'm glad to see that she's doing okay with her life.

85
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,899
I saw her post photos of herself going to places here and there.

86
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:07,150
I'm kind of jealous too.

87
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,900
Right now, I'm also not that different from her back then.

88
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,500
I still never get any roles from castings.

89
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,579
Whatever. You guys should go back to talking to each other already.

90
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:26,140
I want to make plans to eat together already.

91
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,473
Right...

92
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,339
Actually, your script,

93
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:36,599
it's already really good.

94
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:38,919
Stop having this and that person comment on it already.

95
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:41,420
You'll shilly-shally.

96
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,180
Is it really good?

97
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,019
Of course it's good!

98
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:53,280
I think all four years of your experience have accumulated, and it'll get you results for sure.

99
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,100
I believe that this play is going to turn out well.

100
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,510
You're saying such things to make me blush.

101
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,493
Thank you.

102
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:17,339
Oh, about the play you said that you're going to see...

103
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:19,440
are you going with Oh-aew?

104

[I Promised You the Moon]

105
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,419
When I first read Jai's script,

106
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:46,279
and found out that it narrates the beginning of a love until its end,

107
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:48,920
I was so into it.

108
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,519
The role of Akin that I portray is nothing like me,

109
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:56,620
and because of his incredible wit and complexity,

110
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,120
he almost becomes incomprehensible to me.

111
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,579
But when it comes to the feelings between him and Fang,

112
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:04,830
that are slowly changing,

113
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,099
there are some parts of Akin

114
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:09,359
that I totally understand.

115
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:12,000
Because I also ask myself...

116
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,640
if love is really never going to change.

117
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,399
I once made a promise to Oh, that no matter how much he changes,

118
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:27,410
I'll love him all the same.

119
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:31,820
But truthfully, whenever I go see a play alone...

120
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,380
in my heart, I'm always thinking about Oh.

121
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:41,440
And lately, I've started focusing more on the small things that Oh does.

122
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,879
Like when Oh asked his parents to buy a car to drive to school.

123
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:47,600
Or even stuff like the fashion

124
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,080
that he's developed in another way.

125
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:57,499
Actually, there are no reasons for me to be agitated,

126
00:08:57,499 --> 00:08:59,819
because Oh didn't do anything wrong.

127
00:08:59,819 --> 00:09:04,479
When I see others around me do it, I don't feel anything.

128
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:09,060
But when it comes to Oh-aew doing it, I feel weird.

129
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:13,519
It's like... he's becoming another person

130
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,800
that I've never known before.

131
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,440
Although I love Oh so much,

132
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,300
I must admit that some of my feelings...

133
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,640
have changed too.

134
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,840
Oh! You're back?

135
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,280
What are you smiling about?

136
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,640
I got an A on my Ad Printing project.

137
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,319

It's pretty.

140
00:10:01,619 --> 00:10:03,199
Be honest!

141
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:05,440
It really is pretty!

142
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,453
That's all of your praise?

What? Well, it's pretty, though.

144
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,370
What else do you want me to praise?

145
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,019
What's that?

146
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:19,299
It's a logbook.

147
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:21,340
It's to write down notes for the workshop.

148
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:24,400
Oh, P'Jai's thesis.

149
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,060
The logbook... they don't want anyone reading it.

150

- Did you go see a play?
- Yeah.

153
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,180
It's a small theater play. You wouldn't like it.

154
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,810
How do you know I wouldn't like it?

155
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,500
Even if I invited you to come, you wouldn't go anyway.

156
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,290
Am I right?

157
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,139
You say it as if he had invited you, you would've gone.

158
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:19,859
Didn't you say it yourself? That every time you went with Teh, you always met difficulties.

159
00:11:19,859 --> 00:11:22,540
Every time you go, you always fall asleep.

160
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:26,599
Yeah, but I still want him to invite me to go with him, too.

00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,319
I don't know. It's like after I quit studying acting,

162
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:35,380
I feel like I have nothing to talk to him about.

163
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,219
I feel like me and him... we're starting to grow further and further apart.

164
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,550
Or is it all just in my head?

165
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,619
Or is it actually normal for a couple of three years?

166
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,670
I still want him to invite me.

167
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,413
Excuse me.

168
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,840
My name is Ham. My faculty is right next to yours.

169
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,070
Could I have your Instagram ID?

170
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,200
Oh... I'm not really comfortable with that.

171
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,579
I'm really sorry.

172
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:17,340
- That's all right, then.
- Yeah.

173
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,610
Did you just wave at him?

174
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,570
Why didn't you give it to him?

175
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,020
I have a boyfriend already!

176
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,060
There! I knew it!

177
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,979
- I followed him.
- Who isn't on your Instagram, huh?

178
00:12:33,979 --> 00:12:35,739
Isn't it awesome?

179
00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:37,199
Plug.

180
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,233
He's your type, too.

181
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,699
Hey, what's wrong?

182
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:46,540
Normally, if there's a guy with these kinds of looks, you would've already asked to see his pictures.

183
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,660
That's true.

184
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,460
What's wrong with you today?

185
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,870
Well, I'm not single anymore.

186
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,939
Shit...

187
00:12:58,939 --> 00:13:01,739
You're seemingly quiet, and suddenly you're not single, huh?

188
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,779
Why didn't you tell any of your friends?

189
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:06,099
That's right. Go ahead, tell us.

190
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:08,219
Just go ahead and say it.

191
00:13:08,219 --> 00:13:10,399
Well, can I ask my partner first?

192
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,100
- In case he doesn't want me to tell.
- Seriously!

193
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,860
Why would you ask him?

194
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,020
Aren't we your friends?

195
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,660
Mang.

196
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,779
Scold him a bit. He's started keeping secrets from his friends.

197
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:22,659
Don't push him.

198
00:13:22,659 --> 00:13:25,710
What's wrong with him asking his partner first?

199
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,019
Usually, even when Ee'Plug doesn't do anything wrong, you always start scolding him.

200
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,370
Why aren't you scolding him this time?

201
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,240
What do you know? Spill it.

202
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,739
What the hell?

203
00:13:44,739 --> 00:13:47,080
Both of you are being really awkward.

204
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,680
Are you guys a thing or something?

205
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,199
What the fuck?

206
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,920
- You!
- Keep it down.

207
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,740
Oh my god!

208
00:14:06,619 --> 00:14:08,660
You're a thing?

209
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,773
You and him?

210
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,759
Yeah. Mangpong and I are a couple now.

211
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,000
How did it happen?

212
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,539
Well... that day when it was raining heavily,

213
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:28,979
the alley by Ai'Plug's house was flooded.

214
00:14:28,979 --> 00:14:32,280
So his car... he couldn't drive to his house.

215
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,260
That' why he came to stay over at my house.

216
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,779
How could you two become a couple?

217
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:37,479
I see you guys arguing every day!

218
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:39,099
Well, I've just realized that...

219
00:14:39,099 --> 00:14:41,920
the reason I like teasing him, that I like scolding him, is because...

220
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,540
I... just find him adorable.

221
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,533
Guys...

222
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,659
I knew you guys would be like this.

223
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:58,310
That's why I didn't wanna tell.

224
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:01,480
To be honest, until we were able to be open and honest,

225
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,939
it was really hard, you know.

226
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:06,419
Like, we were just close gay friends,

227
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:09,519
and one day, there was suddenly a spark...

228
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,880
What could I do? I already felt it.

229
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,420
Hey, guys...

230
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,893
I'm sorry.

231
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,539
Actually, I also think it's a good thing that you guys like each other.

232
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:40,379
That way, we can feel relieved that you guys have a good partner. Right?

233
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:42,113
That's true.

234
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,840
We're okay. Just shocked.

235
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,810
But really, I'm okay.

236
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,933
Really?

237
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,140
It's good for you.

238
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,939
[Teh: Are you free this evening?]

239
00:16:32,939 --> 00:16:34,773
Right?

240
00:16:34,773 --> 00:16:37,200
You got a boyfriend before we did.
[Teh: P'Jai wants to move some stuff but we don't have a car.]

241
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,500
[oh.aew: Yeah, yeah. I'll go help.]

242
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,550
Take it seriously.

243
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,459
Thanks for driving out to help us move stuff.

244
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:56,879
You're welcome.

245
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:59,030
I wanted to help.

246
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,939
Oh! Wait. I'll get it for you.

247
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,890
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

248
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,439
Oh, right. P'Jai, I've been meaning to ask you about it for a while...

249
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,999
What's this?

250
00:17:16,999 --> 00:17:18,459
Plum wine.

251
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:20,419
It's something from the play.

252
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:22,719
So I put it on the poster.

253
00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:25,620
But it's still not pretty yet.

254
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,879
Does the advertising student have any advice to give?

255
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:30,479
What should it be to make people want to watch it?

256
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:37,099
I think the gimmick about the plum wine... we can expand on the design.

257
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:39,780
But the main thing you need

258
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,279
is the chemistry between the characters.

259
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:46,179
Although it might sound a bit cliché, it's a romance story

260
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:49,499
The audience probably would want to know whose story they're about to see.

261
00:17:49,499 --> 00:17:51,639
So if we use the photos of the main cast

262
00:17:51,639 --> 00:17:54,779
to tell them about their characters, and clearly outline the relationships,

263
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:57,859
I think it would explain the story better.

264
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,440
Hearing that makes sense.

265
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,259
I'll... probably need to find someone to redo it for me.

266
00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:09,610
Would you like me to do it?

267
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:18,339
Yeah! Oh makes really pretty artwork.

268
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,980
Really? Would I be inconveniencing you?

269
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,860
When is the play?

270
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,520
In another two months.

271
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,399
Oh! No worries. That's plenty.

272
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:34,600
Then... thank you so much. I'll leave it to you then.

273
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,380
I'll go and open up the room first.

274
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,020
- I'll be back down to help.
- Sure.

275
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,079
Isn't your study load heavy these days? Will you have time to do it?

276
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:59,020
It's the play you're going to finally play in, so I want to help.

277
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,873
Thank you.

278
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:07,799
If you have any questions about the play, you can just ask me.

279
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,273
All right.

280
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,519
Come on. It's all set. Let's go.

281
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,160
Guys, today, we won't rehearse our roles.

282
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,810
We'll try to do an exercise first.

283
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,160
For this exercise,

284
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,139
before you do anything,

285
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:37,340
you have to let your partner give you permission first.

286
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,420
And for the one who allows,

287
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,860
open your heart

288
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,120
to whatever that will happen.

289
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,800
Both them... and you.

290
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,660
Dream, you can start.

291
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,500
May I touch your shoulder?

292
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,819
You can.

293
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:09,039
You really have to be okay with it first.

294
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,290
And then give her permission.

295
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,833
You can.

296
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,420
May I touch your arm?

297
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,593
You can.

298
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,140
May I touch your neck?

299
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,019
- You can.
- Don't rush answering.

300
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:47,740
Are you really okay with it?

301
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,680
If you're really okay with it, then allow her to.

302
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,673
You can.

303
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,420
That's great, Dream.

304
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,320
What you're feeling now is good.

305
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,740
May I...

306
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,510
touch your waist?

307
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:47,400
Put meaning into every action of yours.

308
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,850
When you're touching her waist,

309
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,493
think about why?

310
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,540
What do you want?

311
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,820
And what do you feel?

312
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,360
The both of you have been in relationships before, right?

313
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,399
Try thinking back

314
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,700
to your previous experiences.

315
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:22,300
When you had sex with your partner for the first time, how did you feel?

316
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,200
When you're ready, start.

317
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,280
Can I hold you from behind?

318
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,439
Sorry.

319
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,273
I'm sorry, P'Jai.

320
00:23:26,273 --> 00:23:29,580
Let's... Let's do it again.

321
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,740
It's all right. Let's take a break first.

322
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,773
Relax a bit.

323
00:23:36,773 --> 00:23:38,140
How was it?

324
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:42,973
I feel like... we don't quite have the chemistry yet.

325
00:23:42,973 --> 00:23:45,320
But I don't know why.

326
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,579
I don't know if I'll screw up your work.

327
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:50,460
We've been rehearsing for a month. And I can't still get into my character.

328
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,680
Hey! Relax.

329
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,699
We rehearse to get better.

330
00:23:56,699 --> 00:24:00,820
Don't overthink it. You'll get it eventually.

331
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:08,840
But I might not portray it to your standard at all.

332
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,133
The thing is...

333
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,840
I can't remember the first time Oh-aew and I had sex anymore.

334
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,220
It's been a long time already.

335
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,640
And he and I right now...

336
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,400
we aren't the same as when we first got together.

337
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,993
I understand.

338
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,080
I've read everything in your logbook already.

339
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,139
Hey! You've got me!

340
00:24:48,139 --> 00:24:51,120
Why would you be so down? Huh?

341
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,959
Because I'm afraid you'll be down because of me.

342
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,940
Geez! I won't be down.

343
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,660
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

344
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:06,279
Okay. Then I'll be heading out now. See you.

345
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:08,600
- Goodbye, P'Jai.
- Goodbye.

346
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,279
Goodbye, Ms. May.

347
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,220
Goodbye.

348
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,860
Someone might see us.

349
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,600
Shit.

350
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,550
Are you still stressed out about the play?

351
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,613
Yeah.

352
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:55,570
I still can't think of a way to fix it.

353
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,580
Do you want to try my way?

354
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,653
Okay.

355
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,220
Relax.

356
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,760
You still got time.

357
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,500
I was wondering where you went.

358
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,400
I... saw that your bag was here.

359
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,760
I was going to get my logbook.

360
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:14,680
Right. I was going to ask you to come to get it, too.

361
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,433
So, here.

362
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,000
Are you seeing Ms. May?

363
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,393
No...

364
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,613
I think that we're... just talking, that's all.

365
00:28:46,613 --> 00:28:48,300
And it's not in exchange for your grades, right?

366
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:52,733
You asshole! What the fuck are you thinking?

367
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,853
That's a relief.

368
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,919
But, yeah... don't tell anyone about it, okay?

369
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:09,370
It'll be bad for her.

370
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,600
My cab is here. I'll get going first.

371
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,100
Get home safe. I'm not going back yet.

372
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,519
I'm going to go see the Babymime play after this.

373
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,399
Shit! Babymime...

374
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:33,979
I also wanted to see it so bad.

375
00:29:33,979 --> 00:29:36,339
But I couldn't buy the ticket in time. It was sold out already.

376
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:38,180
Once you see it, tell me how it went.

377
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:42,000
Do you really want to see it? I have a way.

378
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,419
They're so good.

379
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,779
How did they practice to become that good?

380
00:31:29,779 --> 00:31:33,179
Well... They're good at bringing back memories,

381
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:35,380
so they were able to do it.

382
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,779
Those are memories buried within the muscles.

383
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:43,460
For example, if they're going to touch a glass wall.

384
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,199
They have to recall

385
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,960
how their hand muscles work.

386
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:56,239
And this kind of method can be applied to the scenes involving feelings.

387
00:31:56,239 --> 00:32:00,759
The thing is... the more we can make detailed use of our memories we recall,

388
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:02,819
the more you'll be able to act more realistically.

389
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:04,339
And better, of course.

390
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:08,059
Wow. You brought me for your own good.

391
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:11,919
Of course. If not, what the hell would I drag you here for?

392
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,760
Therefore, after this, you'll have to start observing yourself

393
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,059
in your daily life. What thoughts and feelings you have,

394
00:32:20,059 --> 00:32:22,559
and how your body works.

395
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,039
That way, when you bring out your memory to work with,

396
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,580
you'll be able to use it thoroughly.

397
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,920
And more easily.

398
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,299
So you won't forget...

399
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:32,700
Like the first time you had sex.

400
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,219
Asshole...

401
00:32:36,219 --> 00:32:39,919
All right, all right. Even right now, when you're eating...

402
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,180
what are you feeling?

403
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,280
Have you noticed anything?

404
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,140
Well, the food is pretty delicious.

405
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,860
But these two aren't that salty.

406
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,960
I'd like them to be saltier.

407
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,780
Try being more detailed.

408
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,860
Do you have any other thoughts or feelings?

409
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:11,473
For example, from where I'm sitting right here,

410
00:33:11,473 --> 00:33:14,299
the AC in this restaurant is too damn cold.

411
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:16,259
That's why my sitting posture is so stiff.

412
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:18,059
I've had goosebumps the whole time.

413
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:22,339
As for the lights from the street... they're rather pretty.

414
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,880
Whenever I come to this restaurant, I have to always sit right here.

415
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,099
I like looking at the lights.

416
00:33:29,099 --> 00:33:31,200
They ease my mind.

417
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:37,453
As for this... it's my favorite dish.

418
00:33:37,453 --> 00:33:39,740
I saw you go for it pretty often.

419
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:43,490
I'm pretty glad that there's someone who has the same likes as me.

420
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:52,050
Everything that happens in our daily lives,

421
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:54,460
all has meaning, you know?

422
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:03,160
Now. You try to tell me.

423
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,480
What have you noticed?

424
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,250
This dish of yours,

425
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,450
I've never had it before.

426
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:27,779
But it's really tasty. I like it.

427
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:32,460
And I'm also... a bit surprised.

428
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:35,300
That you prefer to eat salty food like me.

429
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,750
So I was laughing inside.

430
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:49,420
I'm sorry for being so stressed out with you about the play.

431
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:54,540
To be honest, your acting isn't bad at all.

432
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:58,580
But I just want to make it the best that I can.

433
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,739
Because I'm working on my portfolio,

434
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:03,760
to attach it to my application for a performing arts school in New York.

435
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,100
A performing arts school in New York?

436
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,960
Yes.

437
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,719
See, the place that I've been looking at, they just happened to open up a directing course.

438
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,239
They have Broadway directors teaching, too.

439
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:22,279
And now, when they pick interns,

440
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,579
they'll pick from the students in the course.

441
00:35:24,579 --> 00:35:28,059
And if I get chosen, that means...

442
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:32,260
I'll be able to intern in a production that's like... world-class.

443
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:35,239
So I have to be really serious with my portfolio,

444
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:38,000
in order to make them notice me.

445
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,080
But it's damn difficult, man.

446
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,900
There are so damn many people competing for it.

447
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,060
You're this great.

448
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,950
They'll definitely notice you.

449
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,593
Fight for it!

450
00:35:56,593 --> 00:35:58,219
Yeah!

451
00:35:58,219 --> 00:36:00,280
Fight for it!

452
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,860
That's enough.

453
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,410
Eat up. You like it, don't you?

454
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:16,280
[oh.aew: Your rehearsal for today is taking so long.]

455
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:30,080
[Teh: I finished the rehearsal already. I went to eat with Jai.]

456
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,840
[Teh: I finished the rehearsal already. I went to eat with my friends.]

457
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,199
[oh.aew: Where are you sleeping tonight?]

458
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,380
[Teh: I'll probably sleep at the dorm.]

459
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:57,140
[Teh: You can go sleep first. I'll text you when I get back.]

460
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,040
[oh.aew: All right.]

461
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:12,500
Here, take a look. You like it yet?
[Mangpong: sent file. Poster BG.png]

462
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,693
Is it okay?

463
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,760
Yes, yes, yes! I think this works.

464
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,459
You're really trying to make it hard for yourself.

465
00:37:21,459 --> 00:37:23,079
We're dying from so many damn ad works already,

466
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:25,319
and you're still asking for more work. I don't understand.

467
00:37:25,319 --> 00:37:27,439
I want to help Teh, though.

468
00:37:27,439 --> 00:37:28,840
You guys are nice.

469
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:32,919
Plug and I, we can't work together at all. Like, not at all.

470
00:37:32,919 --> 00:37:34,660
Once we talk about work, we'll fight to death.

471
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,660
Bye! The house is wrecked.

472
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,659
- Why is that?
- Well, it's Plug.

473
00:37:37,659 --> 00:37:39,499
Once he can't win an argument against me,

474
00:37:39,499 --> 00:37:40,940
man, he really likes to play the upset card.

475
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:44,139
Yeah, using his power as my boyfriend and his right like...

476
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:47,480
"I don't want it! I'm upset!" Like that...

477
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,300
What do you think of my acting skills?

478
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,340
Why the hell do you ask?

479
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,513
Well...

480
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,579
I've been focusing only on your play for several months now.

481
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:07,319
But I still can't act like how you want me to act.

482
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:11,440
Hey, you! Take it one step at a time.

483
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,380
No need to be stressed.

484
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:15,179
The more you're stressed, the more you won't be able to play it.

485
00:38:15,179 --> 00:38:18,539
Just think that you're doing your best.

486
00:38:18,539 --> 00:38:20,900
It is what it is.

487
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,439
But I wanna be better than I am now.

488
00:38:24,439 --> 00:38:27,539
I really want to be able to play it just like you want.

489
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:30,779
Especially since you said you want to use this play for your portfolio.

490
00:38:30,779 --> 00:38:33,339
I want to be able to play it even more.

491
00:38:33,339 --> 00:38:35,940
I want to make your dream come true.

492
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,293
What?

493
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:51,520
Jai! Hurry up and come back!

494
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,253
Where are you going?

495
00:38:53,253 --> 00:38:54,893
What?

496
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,013
Hurry up!

497
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,013
Jai!

498
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:29,000
Do you remember P'James?

499
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:35,993
Of course, I remember. He's your ex.

500
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,940
The first day that I met him...

501
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:46,360
it was exactly like this.

502
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,260
We went to see a play together.

503
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,470
We ate a meal together.

504
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:58,320
He's the one who taught me to sneak in and climb over the guardrail.

505
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:11,240
James is... a small-theatre play director.

506
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,240
Like the one that we went to see today.

507
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,020
I was his fan.

508
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,320
He's damn good.

509
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,960
Being his partner...

510
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,450
was like a dream come true.

511
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:35,413
Do you get it?

512
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,419
And then one day...

513
00:40:42,419 --> 00:40:47,600
he, well... invited me to make plum wine.

514
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:53,040
And you know the plum wine takes time to ferment, right?

515
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:58,160
And then he asked me...

516
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,040
in the next ten years,

517
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,060
what I think it would taste like.

518
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,073
I was...

519
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,520
I was completely mindblown.

520
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:20,840
Because I had never thought about it before,

521
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:25,900
that I'd have to be with this person, and for just how long?

522
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,973
And so I...

523
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,950
decided to tell him that I'd break up with him.

524
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:54,120
Your thesis script...

525
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,600
is really based on a true story.

526
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:06,090
And why are you telling me this story?

527
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,420
I had asked P'Top and P'Khim before and

528
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,670
nobody knew about your story.

529
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:16,819
Well... you said you want to be able to play it

530
00:42:16,819 --> 00:42:19,420
exactly the way that I really want you to, didn't you?

531
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,660
So I... told you about it,

532
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:26,110
in case you might better understand the character's inner feelings.

533
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,830
It's about work again...

534
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,479
Actually, I should have told you about this story a long time ago.

535
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,160
But I just...

536
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:57,260
don't really share anything about my personal life with anyone.

537
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:02,040
But the reason that I told you about it today...

538
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,420
is because I wanted to tell you that...

539
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:09,100
you already did good.

540
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,600
Really good. Good enough.

541
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:16,820
To the point that it made me want to share my story with you.

542
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:23,053
Therefore...

543
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:26,420
you should be confident in yourself already.

544
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,693
Yes.

545
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:51,273
Oh... and what I told you about exploring your personal experience,

546
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:55,980
if you can't remember it, there's still another way.

547
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,380
Ms. May told me.

548
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,893
What way?

549
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,910
Just create a new one over it.

550
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:13,540
Today, you should just go back to Oh-aew.

551
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:18,453
And... recreate what your first time was.

552
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,919
Remember every detail too.

553
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,880
I've taught you everything already.

554
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,433
All right.

555
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,940
Shit.

556
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:56,199
- What should we do?
- Come this way.

557
00:44:56,199 --> 00:44:59,299
This way? This way?

558
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,653
He's gone.

559
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,573
Yeah.

560
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,613
Shall we go?

561
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:11,973
Yeah.

562
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,740
That way.

563
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,773
This way?

564
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:59,660
You didn't go back to sleep at the dorm?

565
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:03,373
No.

566
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,390
I wanted to sleep with you more.

567
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,680
Why are you all wet?

568
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:18,240
I just went swimming.

569
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,590
Were you sleeping and unaware of everything?

570
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:22,980
I'm sleepy...

571
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,420
We haven't done this in a while, huh?

572
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:44,099
Well, laying down and cuddling like this.

573
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:46,540
Like we're not in a hurry to go anywhere.

574
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:53,660
I thought you meant last night.

575
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:56,033
Silly.

576
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:03,980
Well... the thing from last night too.

577
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,039
We've been apart for so long.

578
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,910
It made it seem like we had gone back to when we had our first time.

579
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,130
What are you talking about?

580
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:32,080
Your play's poster it's finished.

581
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,350
Here, isn't it pretty?

582
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:50,253
Wow, it's beautiful.

583
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,413
Very beautiful.

584
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:59,660
Then today, give it to P'Jai,

585
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:04,119
and when you're done with your rehearsal, should we go eat together?

586
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,620
Certainly.

587
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,319
[Faculty of Communication Arts]

588
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,380
So what is it gonna be?

589
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:24,379
Plug, what do you think?

590
00:52:24,379 --> 00:52:25,599
Here.

591
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,159
- Hey!
- I bought some snacks for you.

592
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,539
- Yay!
- Yay!

593
00:52:28,539 --> 00:52:31,359
- Thanks.
- Hurry up and open them!

594
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,470
- Give me some.
- Yeah.

595
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:40,199
What did you do? You seem to be in such a good mood.

596
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:44,819
Well, this evening, I'm bringing the poster to P'Jai.

597
00:52:44,819 --> 00:52:46,799
So I just went ahead and bought the snacks for everyone in the production.

598
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,319
Oh... how annoying!

599
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,420
Let me tell you some bad news first.

600
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:54,939
I just got an email from Professor Nipa. She said...

601
00:52:54,939 --> 00:52:58,460
next week she suddenly has some business abroad that she has to take care of.

602
00:52:58,460 --> 00:52:59,540
What?

603
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:01,739
So she wanted to move up our presentation.

604
00:53:01,739 --> 00:53:03,400
- What?
- It's tomorrow.

605
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,779
- What?
- Well, shit.

606
00:53:04,779 --> 00:53:06,479
Tomorrow?

607
00:53:06,479 --> 00:53:07,539
Can she do that?

608
00:53:07,539 --> 00:53:09,659
Yeah. That's what I want to say, too.

609
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:11,659
I wanna walk up to her and say,

610
00:53:11,659 --> 00:53:14,599
"Can you do that, professor?" Like Gik Suwatjanee.
(T/N: A famous villainess actress)

611
00:53:14,599 --> 00:53:16,020
Easy there.

612
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:19,770
But she also said that she had already given us a month.

613
00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:21,859
That means we'll have to power through it tonight, right?

614
00:53:21,859 --> 00:53:23,540
Yeah... There's still so much left too.

615
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:25,800
I'm totally going to die.

616
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,539
Hello, P'Jai.

617
00:53:39,539 --> 00:53:42,960
- Hey.
- Hello.

618
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,240
Hey there, P'Jai.

619
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,273
Hey there.

620
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:55,420
Everyone, today we'll go through scenes one, two, and three. Like a long run without any breaks.

621
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:56,839
- Did you guys finish warming up?
- All set.

622
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:57,999
- Yes.
- Okay.

623
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,159
- All of it?
- Come on, come on. No complaining!

624
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,310
Work on the focus exercise.

625
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,699
While you're walking, listen to me as well.

626
00:54:12,699 --> 00:54:15,359
If I clap once, you stop.

627
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:17,939
If I clap twice, you continue walking.

628
00:54:17,939 --> 00:54:20,020
Focus.

629
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,359
Stop.

630
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,500
Focus a bit more!

631
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:33,820
When you're walking, make sure to focus.

632
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,700
Stop means to stop immediately.

633
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,580
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

634
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:44,359
- Bye-bye, P'Jai.
- Do a lot of your homework, all right?

635
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,460
- We will.
- What should I eat today?

636
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,330
Is Ms. May not closing up the room today?

637
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:03,139
I already borrowed her key.

638
00:55:03,139 --> 00:55:05,699
And now it's getting close to the actual day of the play too.

639
00:55:05,699 --> 00:55:08,100
So I need to prepare a lot of things like this and that.

640
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,500
So I asked her for extended use of the room.

641
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:17,273
What's that?

642
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,793
Plum wine.

643
00:55:22,793 --> 00:55:25,700
At first, I thought I'd bring it for you to try.

644
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:28,720
But I forgot that you don't drink.

645
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:35,100
Here.

646
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,879
Sip it slowly, all right?

647
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,839
It's sweet but still pretty strong.

648
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:57,113
How is it?

649
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:06,660
It's kinda like candy.

650
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:09,499
It's not bad.

651
00:56:09,499 --> 00:56:11,240
This batch is six months old already.

652
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:14,690
And within the next six months, the taste will continue to change even more.

653
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:23,413
It's such a pity...

654
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:26,660
I probably won't get to taste it.

655
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:31,220
By then, you'll probably be continuing your studies.

656
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:47,240
If you become a director,

657
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,620
don't forget to call me to play in it.

658
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,379
I want to play in every piece too.

659
00:56:52,379 --> 00:56:55,719
And us to be like... frequent collaborators.

660
00:56:55,719 --> 00:56:58,380
Like Tony Leung and Wong Kar-Wai.

661
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:00,713
Nonsense.

662
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,693
I'm serious.

663
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:11,920
All right. If I make it as a director...

664
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:15,873
You said it.

665
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:28,253
Yeah.

666
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:46,320
I've tried revising my memory already too.

667
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:49,953
How was it?

668
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,813
You wanna try it?

669
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,153
I mean...

670
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:10,380
trying... to work on that exercise.

671
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,140
One more time...

672
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:23,933
All right.

673
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,240
[Oh-aew]

674
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:46,079
Come on. I'll start.

675
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:50,700
May I touch your shoulder?

676
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:53,093
You can.

677
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:03,900
May I touch your hand, too, then?

678
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:15,260
Focus a bit more.

679
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:28,360
May I... move my hand to your neck?

680
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:54,033
May I... move my hand to your waist?

681
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:20,060
May I... put my arm around your back?

682
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:50,670
It's your turn now.

683
01:00:57,340 --> 01:01:01,740
May I... put my face on your neck?

684
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:41,113
May I... look at your face?

685
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,420
May I kiss you?

686
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:32,279
Auu wanted me to ask you what time you are sending him the work.

687
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:33,499
We're going to have him make the slide.

688
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:35,860
I just arrived here at Prachayanan.

689
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:37,740
I'm on my way up to see Teh.

690
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:41,519
I think it should be... around 7 p.m. when I get back to my condo.

691
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:44,579
All right. Hurry up and go home to work, too! The work isn't going to be complete!

692
01:02:44,579 --> 01:02:48,700
Yeah, yeah. All right, once I'm done giving him the poster, I'll go back.

693
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:52,300
Hey, at first I had plans to eat with him, but I canceled it already.

694
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:57,953
Good.

695
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,300
You can do it now.

696
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:07,680
Remember this feeling. And use it in the scene.

697
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:15,180
And then tomorrow, we'll try it again with Dream.

698
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,960
That's it for today.

699
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:26,293
Okay?

700
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:10,600
♫ So you've gotten everything that you wanted, right? ♫

701
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:17,179
♫ Are you pleased now to see me suffer a heartache like this? ♫

702
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:23,600
♫ If you didn't love me, why did you act as if you
loved me? Please tell me ♫

703
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:27,279
♫ Why are you so cruel to me like this? ♫

704
01:05:27,279 --> 01:05:34,540
♫ Why did you fool me? You're someone who's heartless ♫
