00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,420
Yeah, see you.

Hello. Hey, sorry. I just...

23
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:22,019
Just now... I was rehearsing, and it got late.

Where are you now?

25
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,140
I just called to tell you that I won't be able to make it today.

Then... I'll come over tonight, okay?

Okay, then let me do my work first, all right?

Okay.

But P'Jai said to remember the feelings and use them in the scene.

32
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,860
Or is it just a workshop?

33
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:26,160
I think it would be better to talk to Teh and reach an understanding, no?

34
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,213
I can't.

Why not?

36
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,940
Because there's nothing clear-cut from today.

37
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,080
I want to know more before saying anything.

38

Just so you can sit around and keep wondering about it like this?

39
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,260
There's a logbook.

40
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:57,219
I think that there should be things about the workshop in Teh's logbook.

41
00:03:57,219 --> 00:03:59,580
What logbook?

Hey, Teh's here now. We'll talk later.

You came back kind of late today.

I just had something to consult with P'Jai for a bit.

45
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,373
Consult about what?

46
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,893
Well...

47
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,979
The same scene. The one that I still can't play.

48
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:31,380
And what did P'Jai say about it?

49

P'Jai, well he...

Well, quite a bit.

00:07:32,299 --> 00:07:34,079
that, no matter how much he changes,

61
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,499
I would still love him all the same.

62

But truthfully, whenever I go see a play alone...

63
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:42,960
in my heart, I'm always thinking about Ai'Oh.

Although I love Oh so much,

67
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:54,999
I must admit that some of my feelings

68
00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:57,260
have changed, too.

69

00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,510
When I saw it portrayed,

153
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:50,600
I understood the character's feelings better.

154
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,553
But... I heard that Ai'Teh was complaining

155
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:59,030
that he couldn't really play this scene.

156
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:05,820
How'd you do it? To get him to be able to play it?

157
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,570
Well, I didn't really do anything.

158
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,100
He just lost his concentration,

159
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,199
so I helped him concentrate.

160
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:22,099

Well, that's the workshop for this scene. Like what you really saw.

167
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:01,019
What workshop, P'Jai?

168
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:03,019
A director kissing an actor?

169
00:20:03,019 --> 00:20:06,640
- Well, this is my directing style.
- What directing style?

170
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:18,420
You saw it, didn't you? That I made Teh able to actually play it.

171
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,553
Nong, I don't want you to sit and overthink like this.

172
00:20:25,553 --> 00:20:27,499
Ai'Teh is an actor.

173
00:20:27,499 --> 00:20:30,119
If one day he plays a role that requires him to kiss someone else again,

174
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:32,939
will you keep being paranoid like this?

175

Everything that I did...

176
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,540
was for my play.

177
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:45,019
And if Teh was actually able to play it by himself, I probably wouldn't have to do this.

Of course, I love you.

Why did you have to kiss the director?

200
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,780
And in the actual thing, there's no kissing. Isn't that right?

201
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:04,060
The lights are off before the kiss. So what was it?

the reason you made the poster for this play

was because you're trying.

The plum wine that I had tried before... it had a taste that was very bitter, drying my throat,

turned out to have a taste that was fragrant, sweet, and enchanting.

At that time, I never thought that P'Fang's plum wine

00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,680
but they didn't even come.

329
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,050
Go after them and kick their ass.

330
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,920
P'James, he...

331
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,170
really didn't come to see my thesis.

332
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,333
It's so clear.

333
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,153
He hates me now.

334
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,550
But if I were him, I wouldn't come to watch it either.

335
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,560
Why's that?

336
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,360
Oh! Why would anyone go see their ex's play?

337
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,000
They would surely use our story in it, right?

338
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,693
Oh, that's true.

339
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,780
After the play finished,

340
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,450
someone invited me to the casting of their series, too.

341
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:41,019
Shit! Really?

342
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:47,793
When you said that I made leaps in progress in the past week,

343
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,450
I could do it because of you.

344
00:35:54,460 --> 00:36:02,293
You know, I loved it every time I played Akin.

345
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,759
Although he's a character that's hard to understand,

346
00:36:04,759 --> 00:36:09,920
but... being able to understand Akin

347
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,580
it's like it makes me understand you, too.

348
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,193
And I also...

349
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:23,079
I'm very happy that I got to know you this much.

350
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,430
After this, I'm probably going to really miss Akin.

351
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,930
And I'm gonna miss you, too.

352
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,600
When you said

353
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,070
I would become your Akin.

354
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,680
You're my P'Fang, too.

355
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,853
Teh.

356
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,580
Everything that I did

357
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:39,290
was for you to be able to play this role.

358
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,340
It's all about work, that's all.

359
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,640
I did everything on purpose.

360
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,370
I had it all planned

361
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:06,260
so you would feel this way toward me.

362
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,260
Yeah, but you said

363
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:26,700
that every action has its own meaning.

364
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,630
And what you did to me,

365
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:45,900
did it have no meaning at all?

366
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,550
I just wanted to make my dream come true.

367
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,020
Do you understand me?

368
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,459
Don't do this to me.

369
00:39:15,459 --> 00:39:17,393
No, you...

370
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,440
don't do this.

371
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:25,020
You're an actor, you know?

372
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,300
You must be able to manage yourself.

373
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:41,960
And you must be able to accept my directing style.

374
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,940
You're drunk, I think.

375
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,620
What took you so long?

376
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,613
I had a stomach ache.

377
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,053
Hey, Mr. Lead Actor!

378
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,393
Mr. Lead actor!

379
00:41:00,393 --> 00:41:02,273
Hey!

380
00:41:02,273 --> 00:41:03,860
- Teh!
- Teh.

381
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,893
There.

382
00:41:05,893 --> 00:41:07,339
Would you come and sing?

383
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:09,940
I didn't see you sing anything today.

384
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,899
Hey! Come on!

385
00:41:12,899 --> 00:41:15,799
Hey, Ms. Lead Actress. You come, too!

386
00:41:15,799 --> 00:41:17,699
Come on. Just a bit. Just one song.

387
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:19,779
- I'm begging you, come on.
- Hey! I don't want to!

388
00:41:19,779 --> 00:41:21,559
Let's have Oh-aew sing!

389
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:23,439
- A duet?
- Yeah.

390
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,220
Hey! Let's do it!

391
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:27,799
- Come on.
- Just one song.

392
00:41:27,799 --> 00:41:30,300
- For the post-production party.
- Please, please.

393
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,220
Please, do the honors.

394
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,180
Awesome.

395
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,739
Let's sing together.

396
00:41:37,739 --> 00:41:40,380
- Show us!
- Go on!

397
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,020
- Just a bit, come on.
- Go on!

398
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,240
Perfect!

Oh!

422
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:10,100
I'll take this back.

423
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,833
Oh!

424
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,793
Wait!

425
00:44:16,793 --> 00:44:18,813
Oh!

426
00:44:18,813 --> 00:44:21,100
Oh! Talk to me!

427
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,159
What else is there to talk about?

428
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,993
Oh.

429
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:30,490
How much more do you want me to act like I don't know?

430
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:39,210
Do you think I'm that stupid? Do you think I'm that stupid?

431
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,810
Do you think I'm that stupid?

432
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,100
Do you think I'm that stupid?

433
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:02,453
Oh.

434
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,793
Oh! Oh!

435
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,200
Oh.

436
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,513
Hey.

437
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,650
What is it?

438
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,040
Is Oh-aew here?

439
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:51,140
The thing is, he won't talk to me at all.

440
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,219
I texted him, and he wouldn't reply.

441
00:46:53,219 --> 00:46:54,859
I called him, and he wouldn't answer.

442
00:46:54,859 --> 00:46:57,839
I waited for him at his place, and I didn't see him.

443
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:00,990
He just suddenly disappeared like this for a week already.

444
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,160
He's here.

445
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,520
Can I go in and see him?

446
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,500
I don't want you to go in and see him.

447
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,779
He's been crying for a week already.

448
00:47:21,779 --> 00:47:25,539
If you go in, it'll get worse.

449
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:31,380
I know. That I... I was the one who was wrong.

450
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,233
For everything.

451
00:47:34,233 --> 00:47:36,619
But I want to apologize to him.

452
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:39,119
I don't want him to be sad like this.

453
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,770
Q, I'm begging you, please.

454
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:44,270
Please let me go in and talk to him, please.

455
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:14,513
Aew.

456
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,470
Why did you let him in?

457
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:33,240
I think that you guys should probably talk and sort it out.

458
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,373
I'm not talking.

459
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:30,160
I know that what I did... there's no way you can forgive me.

460
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,880
You can curse at me.

461
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,940
You can do anything,

462
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:48,570
but could you please turn to talk to me?

463
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,133
Do you love me?

464
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:12,253
Of course!

465
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:15,913
Then what about P'Jai?

466
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,980
I've stopped getting involved with him.

467
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,370
You can be assured of that.

468
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:35,310
I could never be assured, Teh.

469
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:40,760
I don't have what you want.

470
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:46,660
Like P'Jai does.

471
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:02,380
Maybe I'm not the one you've been looking for since the beginning.

472
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,080
What if one day

473
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:14,679
you meet someone who is able to give you what you want...

474
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:18,150
You would leave anyway.

475
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,240
No, Oh.

476
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,360
I wouldn't leave.

477
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,430
We should break up.

478
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:44,153
Oh,

479
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:46,900
I don't want that.

480
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,400
Can we not do this?

481
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:55,819
I've never thought about breaking up with you.

482
00:51:55,819 --> 00:51:58,470
It's never been on my mind.

483
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:01,280
Please, don't do this.

484
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:05,320
But I'm hurt.

485
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:10,393
I'm hurt!

486
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,933
That's enough!

487
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,999
Oh, I'm sorry. Please.

488
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,773
Please, don't.

489
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:28,460
Please, don't. Can't I stay by your side like this?

490
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:34,473
Don't.

491
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,890
Can I have a chance, please?

492
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:43,040
Let's start over again, please.

493
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,453
Have pity on me.

494
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:02,000
Just get the hell out of my face already.

495
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,600
I don't want to see your face anymore.

496
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,293
Oh...

497
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:17,253
Get out.

498
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,320
[Mon. 19 May: I know you'll never forget the shit that I did. You can even hate me]

499
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,240
[Please just come back to me. You can come curse at me. I'll do anything you want.]

500

[Today: I'm sorry. What do I have to do? Can I go see you?]

501

[Don't be silent. Please answer me.]

502
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,700
[Do your best on your exams.]

503
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,859
I just went out to get the packages.

504
00:55:45,859 --> 00:55:47,960
There's yours, too.

505
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,620
Aren't exams coming up?

506
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:27,270
Are you not going to do work, study, or anything?

507
00:56:27,279 --> 00:56:30,010
I've only seen you sleeping for a whole week already.

508
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:34,260
That's my business.

509
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:35,679
You must've broken up with your boyfriend.

510
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:38,680
I haven't seen you spending the night at your boyfriend's lately.

511
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:45,453
How annoying.

512
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,439
Why the hell are you messing with me?

513
00:56:48,439 --> 00:56:51,279
Can't we mind our own business, like we normally do?

514
00:56:51,279 --> 00:56:54,880
Well, I'm annoyed whenever I see people who act like this.

515
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,600
You sleep all day.

516
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,350
Are you going to study for a fifth year like me?

517
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:03,580
If you don't understand, can you not stick your nose in my business, then?

518
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:07,979
Last semester, I got dumped by my ex. Why wouldn't I understand?

519
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,050
Go out to see your friends.

520
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:26,019
Just staying in your room isn't going to stop you from being sad. Believe me.

521
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:32,080
Even a guy like you has friends?

522
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,240
What the hell?

523
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,590
But I don't have one.

524
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:43,370
I have issues with my friend group from the faculty.

525
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:02,999
My high school friends, they're all my boyfriend's friends.

526
00:58:02,999 --> 00:58:05,900
I'm the one who fucked up. Everyone hates me now.

527
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:10,800
The friend that's closet to you probably wouldn't hate you.

528
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:18,620
My closest friend?

529
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,573
Well, that's Oh-aew...

530
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,439
Come help me eat Nem Nuong.

531
00:58:40,439 --> 00:58:42,299
My mom just sent them to me out of nowhere.

532
00:58:42,299 --> 00:58:44,779
Was she not afraid that they'd go bad or something?

533
00:58:44,779 --> 00:58:47,430
Why are you being nice to me?

534
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:56,010
Well, I get frustrated when I'm in a room with someone who is sleeping and crying day and night for me to see.

535
00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:58,300
I don't know how to react.

536
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:00,913
Trust me,

537
00:59:00,913 --> 00:59:04,740
one day, that sadness that you feel will eventually go away.

538
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:07,919
But if you're just going to lay around and not do a fucking thing like this,

539
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:12,020
you'll regret later, for sure, for wasting your time.

540
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:16,540
We won't get to eat it after all!

541
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:20,139
My mom sent me a pair of shoes, not Nem Nuong.

542
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:23,040
What the hell? I thought I'd get something to eat.

543
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:26,213
I'm hungry.

544
00:59:26,213 --> 00:59:28,610
Want to eat at the canteen together?

545
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,080
All right, I'll go to the restroom real quick.

546
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:45,410
Hello.

547
00:59:46,093 --> 00:59:49,139
Is this Nong Teh? It's me, P'Chom.

548
00:59:49,139 --> 00:59:53,380
Do you remember? We talked about a casting call.

549
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:56,313
Yes.

550
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,360
Thanks so much, man.

551
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,570
I'll be all right.

552
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:11,440
Someone like you, in times like this, can't be alone.

553
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:17,160
You're really underestimating me.

554
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:22,599
Actually, you could continue staying over at my place.

555
01:00:22,599 --> 01:00:25,470
My parents aren't home that much anyway.

556
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:29,873
I don't want to inconvenience you.

557
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:35,939
Then go to sleep. We'll continue the tutoring tomorrow.

558
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:43,319
Q, do you want more pillows?

559
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:54,060
Hey, what's that paper?

560
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:56,790
Are you into voodoo?

561
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:01,179
It's a talisman for good fortune.

562
01:01:01,179 --> 01:01:03,380
- Here's the pillow.
- Hey, it's all right.

563
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:05,060
This is enough.

564
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:10,110
So do you want me to turn off the lights for you?

565
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:10,560
- Here.
- What? Don't spill it.

566
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,460
- Can I put it on now?
- Go ahead and put it on, gently.

567
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:21,959
Oh. I thought you were already asleep.

568
01:02:21,959 --> 01:02:24,060
Why aren't you sleeping yet?

569
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:28,033
Hey.

570
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:14,253
Oh.

571
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:18,899
It's a shitty guy. Just forget about him.

572
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,860
Don't give him any worth.

573
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:30,340
We don't want to see you like this.

574
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:48,540
I'll forget him for sure.

575
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:50,993
Very good.

576
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:53,773
That's very good.

577
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,300

01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:19,660
- Hello.
- Hello there.

581
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:22,579
Teh, I've seen your casting video.

582
01:04:22,579 --> 01:04:23,979
I think you're great.

583
01:04:23,979 --> 01:04:27,260
It seems like you've got potential and will be able to go very far.

584
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:29,199
Oh, thank you very much.

585
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:30,300
- Right.
- Yeah.

586
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:32,650
I think this role is yours.

587
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,639
- Really?
- Really.

588
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:42,920
But do you have any company affiliation yet? Have you signed with anyone yet?

589
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:45,499
I haven't, not yet.

590
01:04:45,499 --> 01:04:49,050
Then would you be interested in signing with me?

591
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,299
Here it is.

592
01:04:52,299 --> 01:04:54,139
- Give it a try.
- This is the contract, Nong Teh.

593
01:04:54,139 --> 01:04:55,699
Nong Teh, try reading through it.

594
01:04:55,699 --> 01:05:00,279
Read thoroughly, and if you're stuck with anything or have any questions, feel free to ask me.

595
01:05:00,279 --> 01:05:03,079
And if you're really interested, next week

596
01:05:03,079 --> 01:05:05,339
we can make an appointment to sign the contract.

597
01:05:05,339 --> 01:05:07,299
Thank you very much.

598
01:05:07,299 --> 01:05:11,020
But there's just one thing I might ask you to do.

599
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:14,653
It's a small matter... That is...

600
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:42,560
I happened to take a look at your Instagram.

601
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:46,340
And I saw these photos.

602
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:49,199
Actually, I noticed since the first day we met

603
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:52,960
that both of you were close.

604
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:57,079
Let's say that today, you become very famous...

605
01:05:57,079 --> 01:06:00,019
you get a lot of followers,

606
01:06:00,019 --> 01:06:03,860
they're sure to ask you who this is.

607
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:08,420
So I just wanted to suggest to you that you

608
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:11,300
delete these photos first. Is that all right?

609
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:16,980
What... what if I just hid all these photos, would that be all right?

610
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:24,560
But I think that

611
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:29,460
if, one day, your Instagram account gets hacked,

612
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:32,139
it would be safest to just delete them now.
