[Final Project Presentation Day]

20
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,539
Because our product is a brain-boosting beverage,

21
00:01:05,539 --> 00:01:08,419
our target group is students.

22
00:01:08,419 --> 00:01:13,759
So we thought of how we actually would like to be a part of promoting education with our customer group.

23
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:16,419
Asking ourselves, "what if, aside from the usual studying in class,

24
00:01:16,419 --> 00:01:20,259
there were some tricks to help make studying easier and more fun?"

25
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:23,379
Therefore, we thought of running this campaign along with another product

26
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:26,779
in order to build the brand image for the products.

27
00:01:26,779 --> 00:01:29,420
Yes, so that is flashcards.

28
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,819
Flashcards are a method used for memorizing words in foreign languages

29
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:35,619
in a way that is easy to learn and it's also fun.

30
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:38,999
We thought that this trick could be used to lead the campaign,

31
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:41,859
and would be used as a freebie to go along with the product.

32
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:45,759
Panwa, my friend at the agency made lots of good remarks about you.

33
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,059
He said you're a great intern.

34
00:01:48,059 --> 00:01:49,970
And you're a fast learner.

35
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,259
After seeing your presentation today,

36
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:54,819
I wasn't surprised at all for him to compliment you to that extent.

37
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:56,339
Thank you very much, Professor.

38
00:01:56,339 --> 00:01:59,720
And if my friend wanted you to work with him,

39
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,670
would you be interested?

40
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,779
I'd be interested, Professor. Of course, I'd be interested.

41
00:02:04,779 --> 00:02:06,419
Congratulations.

42
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:08,370
Thank you, Professor.

It's finally over.

44
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,319
After tonight, I'd like to sleep for 20 hours.

45
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:28,739
No waking me up. I'm not going anywhere.

46
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:32,799
No one is gonna wake you up, that's for sure. Everyone will be passed out!

47
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:34,540
We didn't get any sleep.

48
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,350
Look at my face. It's all ruined.

49
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,140
But seriously, how did we manage to do it?

50
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,100
We'd been doing the artwork for two weeks!

51
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,699
Look, my hand is all stiff.

52
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:46,679
- But you won, though.
- Yeah, that's true.

53
00:02:46,679 --> 00:02:51,559
- We have to thank Mr. Aew for coming up with the flashcards idea.
- Right?

54
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:54,599
- Once they heard about the flashcards, the customers' eyes were sparkling.
- That's right.

55
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,620
Yeah, the professor even offered him a job.

56
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,599
Don't exaggerate. Mang and Plug got their jobs before I did.

57
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,819
Dude, I'm a freelancer. They didn't hire me the same way they hired you.

58
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:05,219
Geez, I'm the one that is stressed now.

59
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:07,779
I haven't even started looking for a job.

60
00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:11,079
What? Auu, didn't you say you wanted to take a break for a month or two?

61
00:03:12,113 --> 00:03:16,040
Yeah, that's right. Think about it, we've been studying for almost 10 years.

62
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,339
It's tiring. But I've got to make a living, too, right?

63
00:03:19,339 --> 00:03:22,839
Hey. Just take a break. Don't think too much.

64
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:26,019
Once we start working, it's for our entire lives.

65
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:28,239
We don't know when we'll get to rest.

66
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,999
You've got so many requests, it must be hundreds.

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,200
You're not going to talk to anybody?

68

Let's move on to the hottest imaginary couple,

70
00:03:56,739 --> 00:03:59,579
Teh Krittikorn and Airy Pichamon.

71
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:03,620
Their fame has blown up even as far as China with the series "Lovely Ghost,"

72
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,779
which the pair starred in at the end of last year.

73
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:09,279
And today, both of them are starring in a new film

74
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:12,379
that is co-funded by China, too.

75
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:14,079
Having worked together so often like this,

76
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:17,819
the fans seem to have hope that the two will go from being an imaginary couple

77
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:19,699
to a real couple.

78
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:21,739
Right now, I'd like to focus on work

79
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:24,219
because actually, both of us have been very busy. Right?

80
00:04:24,219 --> 00:04:26,480
- I just started continuing my studies as well.
- That's right.

81
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,980
So right now, I have to both study and work at the same time.

82
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,059
And I think that truthfully working on a movie...

83
00:04:32,059 --> 00:04:34,720
- Aew? Geez...
- is different from working on a TV series.

84
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,800
- You're watching with doe eyes. Are you his fan?
- Preparation for the production is quite heavy as well.

85
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,700
I'm his ex-boyfriend, not his fan.
(T/N: It's a pun. The word for boyfriend sounds like "fan")

86
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,959
Oh, how annoying! Annoying! Just annoying!

87
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:56,319
About Ee'Teh, I'm happy that you were able to move on.

88
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,400
At first, I thought about having it removed, this tattoo.

89
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,039
But thinking back and forth about it, I'd rather keep it.

90
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,860
As evidence of my crazy love.

91
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,880
Keeping it as a reminder to myself.

92
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,270
Back then, I was a mess, right?

93
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,039
Yeah, you were, big time.

94

to be able to work at my dream company.

100

To be able to really feel good about myself,

101
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,170
and really getting to be with myself.

102

And to have such good friends like you guys... to look after me.

103

- Both of them?

- Then I'll take care of them both.

Is it with Nosomi-chan, Mom?

Yes, that's right. She's his Japanese girlfriend, right?

00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,819
♫ On our way, ♫

157
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:39,900
♫ What is certain? ♫

158
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:45,640
♫ There are those who were together just the day before,

159

160

00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,220

162
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,199
Nong Teh, there are 30 minutes left. Would you like to eat something?

163
00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:28,580
Is there anything quick and easy to eat?

164
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,160
Hold on, let me see.

165
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,853
Here.

166
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,479
That works. Thank you, P'Chompoo.

167
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:42,941
All right, then I'll be back later.

168
00:11:42,941 --> 00:11:44,620
- Oh, Nong Airy!
- P'Chompoo, hello!

169
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,650
- Hello there.
- Hello, P'Chompoo.

170
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,660
Still can't figure out what to do on your thesis?

171
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,413
Yeah...

172
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,379
I'll probably use something personal.

173
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:09,339
That way, it'll be easy to write the script.

174
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:12,299
But I haven't found anything interesting.

175
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:14,400
Help me think of something.

176
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,139
Then how about a story about us?

177
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:19,099
I guarantee you the tickets will be sold out.

178
00:12:19,099 --> 00:12:24,139
But truthfully, you're already working, so you don't really need to waste that much time on your thesis.

179
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:26,419
Just graduating is enough, isn't it?

180
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:28,539
Look, it'll just tire you out for nothing.

181
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:32,499
You can't even accept work, and you're missing out on your career opportunities too.

182
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,139
I think I'll come up with something easy.

183
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:40,939
Right, after we're done with work, come to the rehearsal room with me.

184
00:12:40,939 --> 00:12:42,739
I have a long-take rehearsal.

185
00:12:42,739 --> 00:12:44,890
I want you to help me observe.

186
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,379
Hey,

187
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:52,739
so you're going to finish work, and continue working right after?

188
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:55,040
Don't you have work early tomorrow morning too?

189
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:01,200
Should we find something really delicious to eat and then rest?

190
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,540
I don't want to waste my time.

191
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,140
Let's finish eating and then do the rehearsal instead.

192
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:13,099
P'Pern, after this, could you have the van send me and Teh to the rehearsal room?

193
00:13:13,099 --> 00:13:16,359
We should be there for a while until it's pretty late. I can go home by myself.

194
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:18,659
And tomorrow, you can just pick me up early, P'Pern.

195
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:20,493
Okay, got it.

196
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,379
- Oh, P'Top! Hello.
- Hi, Airy.

197
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:29,479
- Shit! P'Top!
- How have you been, man?

198
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:30,950
What brings you here?

199
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,730
My dressing room is right next door,

200
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,890
I heard you were here, so I stopped by.

201
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:39,419
Here. The customers brought these.

202
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,880
Increase your sugar, man.

203
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,010
You look tired today.

204
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,653
Are you all right?

205
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,553
Well...

206
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,340
I'm a little tired.

207
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,459
I just happen to be thinking about my thesis lately.

208
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:02,300
I still can't think of what I should do.

209
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,333
Shit...

210
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,459
Working on a thesis while working too,

211
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:09,510
that reminds me of when I did that. It was fucking exhausting.

212
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,580
- P'Top.
- Yeah?

213
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,020
Since you've been working,

214
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:29,920
have you ever felt so tired that... that you just wanted to quit?

215
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,253
What's wrong?

216
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,713
It's nothing.

217
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,080
I just feel like...

218
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,059
I'm exhausted to the point that I don't want to work at all.

219
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,420
And my thesis too,

220
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,340
I don't want to do it anymore.

221
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,390
It's like day by day, I just don't wanna do anything at all.

222
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,240
It's normal, man.

223
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,240
We all have lazy days sometimes.

224
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,780
I just feel weird.

225
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,320
It's like in actually, my life...

226
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,200
it's like everything I've ever dreamt of...

227
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,900
But I don't know why...

228
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,400
- That is...
- Why, what?

229
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,113
It's like...

230
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,720
I feel empty.

231
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,320
Like something is missing.

232
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,859
Well, if you still feel like there's something missing,

233
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:03,139
that means that you haven't gotten everything that you dreamt of.

234
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:04,673
Isn't that right?

235
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,880
- P'Chompoo, hello.
- Oh, hello.

236
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,460
- Hello.
- Hello.

237
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,039
Please wait one moment. We still haven't finished organizing the room.

238
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:22,700
Of course, it's no problem at all.

239
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,079
- Please have a seat right over here.
- Okay.

240
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:27,519
- I'll excuse myself to set up the room first, all right?
- Certainly.

241
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,180
- Let's go. Want to sit?
- Go ahead.

242
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,100
Hey, Oh-aew!

243
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,360
Please take care of Mr. Teh for me. I need to go set up the room.

244
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,259
What are you doing here?

245
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:31,479
Oh, it's just...

246
00:17:31,479 --> 00:17:34,830
The creative director wanted to interview me

247
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,299
to get some ideas to start a campaign.

248
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:40,800
And I happened to be working around here, so I stopped by right away.

249
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,699
Go have a seat first. I'll... go get you some water.

250
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:49,400
Hey, it's all right.

251
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,413
It's okay.

252
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,380
How are you doing?

253
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,273
Have you been well?

254
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,313
And you?

255
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,913
I've been good.

256
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,833
That's good.

257
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,839
Nong Teh? The meeting room is ready.

258
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:32,379
- Oh, all right.
- P'Chompoo?

259
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:34,690
- Yeah.
- The meeting room is ready.

260
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,580
Well then. This way, please.

261
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,579
- After you.
-Yes.

262
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,999
- Either way, thank you so much.
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

263
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,059
Goodbye.

264
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:54,320
P'Chompoo? Regarding the appointment that was requested last week,

265
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,390
how did it turn out?

266
00:18:56,399 --> 00:18:58,900
Next week, Nong Teh's schedule should be quite busy,

267
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,599
but I'll try to see for the week after, all right?

268
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,539
- Because it should be a bit easier than this week.
- Oh.

269
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:06,199
- Oh, let me check first...
- Yes.

270
00:19:06,199 --> 00:19:08,499
- Next week, right?
- Yes.

271
00:19:08,499 --> 00:19:11,240
Here, around the 18th, 19th, or 20th is good.

272
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,940
All right, we'll set a date again.

273
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,840
- Of course.
- Thank you very much.

274
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,913
Let's go. Let's head back.

275
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,139
Wait... P'Chompoo, you can go ahead first.

276
00:19:24,139 --> 00:19:26,840
I'm thinking of running some errands around here for a bit.

277
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:29,559
Would you like me to leave the car here for you?

278
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:32,159
- It's all right. I can go back on my own.
- Okay. Go back safely, all right?

279
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:34,790
- Yes, goodbye.
- Bye-bye.

280
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,530
Is this spot available?

281
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,493
Let me sit here, too.

282
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,533
Sure, have a seat.

283
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,659
So... you finished your work discussions?

284
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,053
I did.

285
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:28,080
It just happened that my manager had to go do business elsewhere.

286
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,099
So I have to find a ride home myself.

287
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:34,059
That's why I asked to sit here while waiting.

288
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,893
Coconut scent?

289
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,120
Am I interrupting your work?

290
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,600
I'm only sending an email, that's all.

291
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,760
There. Done.

292
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,593
Wow.

293
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,700
You're so cool.

294
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,880
Just sending an email. How is that cool?

295
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,379
Oh, so you're working as a planner?
[Oh-aew Media Planner]

296
00:21:24,379 --> 00:21:26,440
What's that?

297
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:31,379
It's... taking the requirements from the customer

298
00:21:31,379 --> 00:21:33,739
to plan communication strategies.

299
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:37,299
Like... which target customers we'll be talking to,

300
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:41,440
through which channels, what the message is, or something like that.

301
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,220
I didn't understand at all.

302
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,500
I watched the series you starred in.

303
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,233
You acted well.

304
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,979
Are you my fan?

305
00:22:08,979 --> 00:22:11,600
- No, I'm not your fan.
- Then what are you?

306
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,153
I'm...

307
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:25,619
Well... I'm just a regular viewer.

308
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:28,000
Also, your series was a hit.

309
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,840
If I didn't watch it, I wouldn't be able to speak with and understand everyone else, would I?

310
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,600
Now that you're famous, you must be busy this year.

311
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,059
Actually, I was thinking of taking a break from work this year.

312
00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:45,379
It just happened that last year, I dropped out for one semester.

313
00:22:45,379 --> 00:22:47,579
So I was thinking of finishing university first.

314
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:50,139
But I still have a film I agreed to do.

315
00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:52,579
There's a shooting in China as well.

316
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:56,859
Just working on one movie, and I don't even have time to work on my thesis.

317
00:22:56,859 --> 00:23:00,699
Oh, right. You have to work on the thesis for your final project too.

318
00:23:00,699 --> 00:23:03,093
Right.

319
00:23:03,093 --> 00:23:05,299
I still haven't figured out a story.

320
00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:07,019
I've only ever played for other people.

321
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:10,139
But once I had to write my own script, I'm just... damn lost.

322
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,699
Then just write a story about yourself. That's easy.

323
00:23:12,699 --> 00:23:15,000
Well, do what P'Jai did.

324
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:40,370
Well, I was thinking like that.

325
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:43,959
But... I'm not good at scriptwriting.

326
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:47,580
So I thought that even if I wrote it, it wouldn't be as interesting as P'Jai's.

327
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,059
Why not?

328
00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:53,800
I think that your life has plenty of interesting things.

329
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,859
Like when you used to tell me...

330
00:23:55,859 --> 00:23:57,580
that your mom said you looked like Yongjian.

331
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,899
So you wanted to become an actor.

332
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:03,600
When you told me about it, I thought it was fun.

333
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,873
Or... The feeling

334
00:24:06,873 --> 00:24:09,899
of a younger brother that has an older brother that is super talented.

335
00:24:09,899 --> 00:24:12,100
I think this point should also be pretty interesting.

336
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,379
Create a lead character who acts like a cool guy.

337
00:24:15,379 --> 00:24:17,619
Someone who's seeking attention,

338
00:24:17,619 --> 00:24:20,719
- and needs to be taken care of, something like that.
- Hey, hey, hey!

339
00:24:20,719 --> 00:24:22,739
Are you sneakily dissing me?

340
00:24:22,739 --> 00:24:28,400
No... Like, he's also patient, determined, and doesn't give up.

341
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:40,059
The story about your mom being a single mother is good too.

342
00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:43,759
That she sold Hokkien noodles to provide for and raise her two sons on her own.

343
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:45,779
I think that she's damn amazing.

344
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:47,613
Or maybe...

345
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,380
about your older brother's job as a tour guide?

346
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,339
I think that there must be a lot,

347
00:24:55,339 --> 00:25:00,480
with him having to meet many people, having to go to different places...

348
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,899
I think that he's got a lot of stories to tell.

349
00:25:02,899 --> 00:25:06,339
You should try interviewing him. I think you'd be able to get a lot of stories there.

350
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,659
Or you could write about Tuty.

351
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:12,970
A dog who worries over his owner so much,

352
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,310
that he barks at anyone who gets near him.

353
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,473
What is it?

354
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,993
It's just...

355
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,880
Tuty's passed on.

356
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,940
When?

357
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:54,400
Tuty developed kidney disease in the middle of last year.

358
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,760
He was old.

359
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,940
The vet said it's normal for everything to deteriorate.

360
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,820
So these days Ma has been lonely.

361
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,220
There's no one at home to keep her company.

362
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:31,419
Actually, Ma has been complaining about how she misses you all the time.

363
00:26:31,419 --> 00:26:36,079
If you ever get to go back to Phuket, visit her, would you?

364
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,833
Oh, right.

365
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:51,260
P'Hoon and Nosomi are going to get married already, right?

366
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:54,559
Yeah, they're finally getting married.

367
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,740
They've been together for years now.

368
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,870
Please congratulate them for me.

369
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,120
Why don't you go tell them yourself?

370
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,890
The ceremony will be at your place anyway.

371
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,160
I don't know if I'll be available.

372
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,100
But if I'm available, then I'll go.

373
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,033
Just go.

374
00:27:14,033 --> 00:27:16,270
MoRaoYuLok will all be there.
(T/N: the name of the group of friends)

375
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:27,160
And you can... bring your boyfriend as your plus one.

376
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,993
Sure.

377
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:41,280
Well, if I can find a boyfriend in time, I'll bring him as my plus one.

378
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,113
And what about you?

379
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,899
You and Airy...

380
00:27:56,899 --> 00:27:59,100
is it just fan shipping or real?

381
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,780
Come on, tell me, I wanna know.

382
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,580
Are you gonna sell my news?

383
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,020
Come on, just tell me!

384
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,560
Well, we really dated.

385
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,639
That's what I thought.

386
00:28:16,639 --> 00:28:19,299
I knew it. You and Airy had to have something going on.

387
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:22,219
Well, well... And you told the press,

388
00:28:22,219 --> 00:28:25,060
"There's nothing between us." Geez.

389
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,779
You know, I've been thinking about it for a while.

390
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:31,539
Airy is suitable for you.

391
00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:35,099
Both of you seem to be really hard-working.

392
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:39,720
I think when being together, you should support each other well.

393
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,180
Right now, you're already famous in China.

394
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:49,480
I think that you two might have a chance to go to the Oscars for real.

395
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,350
I haven't finished talking...

396
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,080
I already broke up with her.

397
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,859
What?

398
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:14,140
I broke up with her about two weeks ago.

399
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,653
Why?

400
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:22,740
Well, I just feel like... she's not the one.

401
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,600
You felt like she's just not the one?

402
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,870
Then why would you date her in the first place?

403
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:38,000
Hey, don't get me wrong. It's just...

404
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,570
At first, I really did like her.

405
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,350
She also had the same dream as I did,

406
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:47,050
her personality is similar to mine,

407
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:49,500
and she's easy to talk to.

408
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,639
But after being together for a long time...

409
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,359
I just felt that she wasn't the one for me like that.

410
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:00,960
It was like there was something missing,

411
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,819
so I didn't want her to waste her time.

412
00:30:05,819 --> 00:30:08,420
Did you even try to work it out with her?

413
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,193
See?

414
00:30:17,193 --> 00:30:19,440
You're always like this.

415
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,139
You should go talk to her.

416
00:30:23,139 --> 00:30:25,440
Try slowly fixing it together.

417
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:31,120
But either way, she and I... don't share the same thoughts.

418
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,600
Just try a bit harder.

419
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,640
Fight for her.

420
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:11,059
Well... Well, never mind.

421
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:15,160
Life is like this.

422
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,539
At first, you may think that something is right.

423
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:22,600
But when time passes, it might actually not be right.

424
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,139
Look at me, for example.

425
00:31:28,139 --> 00:31:31,190
At first, I wanted to become an actor so much.

426
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,440

I'm okay now.

And what if one day...

476
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,280
I don't want to be an actress anymore...

477
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,140
What would you say?

478
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,560
I would probably be mad.

479
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,900
I would find an excuse to argue with you.

480
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,620
And even after we stop fighting,

481
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,880
we would still talk less and less.

482
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,790
Because we both wouldn't have the same interest anymore.

483
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,260
And I might meet someone...

484
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,690
whom I think I would rather talk to more.

485
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,819
The one whom I think

486
00:38:51,819 --> 00:38:54,980
would rather walk on the same path by my side.

487
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,220
And I might slip up...

488
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,930
Slip up and make you sad.

489
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,480
And we might not be together anymore.

490
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:22,380
I might even become an actor like I wanted.

491
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,800
Get everything that I wanted.

492
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,859
But I would probably ask myself...

493
00:39:30,859 --> 00:39:33,193
"Why?

494
00:39:33,193 --> 00:39:35,379
Why is it that no matter what I do,

495
00:39:35,379 --> 00:39:38,810
whether I'm successful or fucked up, get criticized or praised...

496
00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:41,840
why would I still think about you?

497
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:47,219
Why would I still want to tell you and share everything with only you?

498
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:50,259
Why is it that, when I do this with someone else,

499
00:39:50,259 --> 00:39:53,200
it doesn't feel like when I do it with you?"

500
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,060
And lastly,

501
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:02,520
I would realize that I can't be without you.

502
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,200
The person that I've been looking for...

503
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,160
in the end, it's always you.

504
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,420
Hey, I'll leave it to you for a sec.

505
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,853
Oh!

506
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,400
Where are you going?

507
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,820
Are you not going to watch it until the end?

508
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,160
Why did you make this play?

509
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,600
What do you want?

510
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,560
If you want me to go back to you,

511
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,000
my answer is no.

512
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,353
I just...

513
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,230
wanted to do as you suggested.

514
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,470
I made a play about myself.

515
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,790
And the thing that I'm most into right now...

516
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,700
is probably you.

517
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,699
During the past year that we didn't see each other,

518
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:56,740
there were many things that came into my life.

519
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:04,030
Suddenly, I just... went to work every day,

520
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:06,080
saw new people every day.

521
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,720
I suddenly got famous.

522
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:14,110
So many people gave me attention.

523
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:23,280
At that time, I just thought that...

524
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,500
it was pretty good.

525
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:30,050
Because all this really helped me move on from you quickly.

526
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:36,720
But once I happened to meet you that day,

527
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,600
with just a few minutes of seeing you,

528
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,720
it was like I was falling in love with you all over again.

529
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,633
Oh.

530
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:13,360
I know I made a mistake.

531
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,153
But from now on,

532
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,320
I promise I won't ever make you sad again.

533
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:33,240
Can we start all over again?

534
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:41,280
And what about when you promised me,

535
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,570
that your love for me wouldn't change...

536
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,950
And what about that time when you cheated on me?

537
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:58,113
Did you know? I always kept asking myself,

538
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:04,300
that every single time you said you loved me,

539
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,710
if you really did feel that way.

540
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,920
Because if you really felt that way,

541
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,500
how could you ever have feelings for someone else?

542
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:31,560
And now, you're asking me to trust you?

543
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:41,210
But you used to ask me...

544
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,640
not to ever disappear.

545
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,230
What if I asked you the same thing today?

546
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:03,180
Even being not-so-close friends would still do.

547
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:23,600
I hope your play is successful then.

548
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,890
I hope that the audience will love it.

549
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,860
So why did you call me over here?

550
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:50,313
Well...

551
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,670
I don't know who to talk to.

552
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:58,350
Some things can't be discussed with friends, right?

553
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:13,033
So... what happened to you?

554
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,973
The thing is...

555
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:23,690
Ai'Teh asked me to get back together with him.

556
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:31,179
Truthfully, I felt good that he felt guilty.

557
00:47:31,179 --> 00:47:34,400
That he really went back and though about his own actions.

558
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:39,320
But once I thought of getting back together with him...

559
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,760
I just felt terrible.

560
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,699
Feelings of anger.

561
00:47:43,699 --> 00:47:45,680
Feelings of sadness.

562
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:49,219
They all came back to me.

563
00:47:49,219 --> 00:47:51,570
And I'm so damn frustrated about it.

564
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:55,139
I just don't know what to do.

565
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:58,360
It took years for me to finally be able to move on.

566
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:03,300
Why is it that I became so weak-hearted after meeting him just once?

567
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,350
I don't wanna lose.

568
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:09,460
Why do I always have to lose to this person?

569
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:18,640
I'll be honest, man. I think that like... our hearts

570
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,139
have already made a choice.

571
00:48:21,139 --> 00:48:23,459
That we'd like someone like this.

572
00:48:23,459 --> 00:48:25,520
You losing like this,

573
00:48:26,259 --> 00:48:29,539
it's because you're not able to resist what your heart wants.

574
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:32,459
So should I completely cut him off? Or...

575
00:48:32,459 --> 00:48:34,710
should I take him back?

576
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,800
There's no exact answer.

577
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:42,439
Like... for some couples, it gets better once they're back together.

578
00:48:42,439 --> 00:48:44,139
They love each other much more.

579
00:48:44,139 --> 00:48:47,160
But some couples get back together and it's toxic.

580
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:51,319
They get back together and hurt each other. It's an endless cycle.

581
00:48:51,319 --> 00:48:55,040
So how will I know?

582
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:03,770
I don't know what I should do.

583
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:15,659
If you really want to know whether you getting back together would work out,

584
00:49:15,659 --> 00:49:18,060
you should go back and try.

585
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:22,879
But if you don't want to know, then there's no need to go back.

586
00:49:22,879 --> 00:49:24,810
Because in the end,

587
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:28,560
the one who chooses what's best for you...

588
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,860
is yourself.

589
00:49:56,420 --> 00:50:00,180
[Teh]

590
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:07,659
[Come down and talk, I'm begging you. I wanted to let you know first.]

591
00:50:07,659 --> 00:50:09,759
[Friday, September 12th, 2025]
[Oh. Happy birthday. I wish you lots and lots of happiness.]

592
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:15,260
[I hope you get what you wish for. Stay healthy.]

593
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:18,680
[Thursday, January 1st, 2026]
[Happy new year! I hope you're happy all year.]

594
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,040
[Sunday, May 25th, 2025]
[I got the role for the series.]

595
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,190
[Please come down and let's talk for a bit. I wanted you to be the first person to know about it.]

596
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:38,639
[Thursday, May 21st, 2025]
[I'm sorry. What do I have to do?]

597
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:40,990
[Can I go see you? Don't be silent. Please answer me.]

598
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,039
[Monday, May 19th, 2025]
[I know you'll never forget the shit that I did.]

599
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,660
[You can even hate me. But please just come back to me.]

600
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:54,140
[You can scold me or whatever. I'll do anything.]

601
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,479
[Thursday, May 15th, 2025]
[I know that you're probably annoyed that I keep messaging you.]

602
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,479
[You don't even want to see my face, that's fine.]

603
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,280
[But could you please talk to me, at least? I want to know how you're doing.]

604
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,979
[Tuesday, May 13th, 2025]
[I'm selfish. I've never thought about how you would feel.]

605
00:51:10,979 --> 00:51:14,640
[I've destroyed us both. It's all my fault. I'm sorry.]

606
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,059
[Monday, May 12th, 2025]

607
00:51:22,059 --> 00:51:25,560
[Oh, for me, no one could ever replace you. You're the most important person in my life.]

608
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:51,420
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

609
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,620
Congratulations, Son.

610
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,273
Ai'Teh!

611
00:51:59,333 --> 00:52:01,833
Hey!

612
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,859
- Wow!
- How have you been, superstar?

613
00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:07,499
Wow. Superstar?

614
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:10,319
I haven't seen you in ages, assholes. How have you guys been?

615
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:12,139
Hey, we've been pretty good.

616
00:52:12,139 --> 00:52:14,770
As for me, I don't wanna brag about it, but I just got a new job.

617
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:16,860
Look, I'm working for a hotel in Chiang Rai.

618
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:18,690
I'm moving next month already.

619
00:52:18,699 --> 00:52:20,499
- Really?
- Whoa.

620
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:26,320
Once everyone graduated, you just suddenly moved out of Phuket.

621
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:29,579
But that's good. When I visit Chiang Rai, you can show me around.

622
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:31,220
Right.

623
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:33,879
- As for me, I'm completely different from him.
- Why is that?

624
00:52:33,879 --> 00:52:36,819
I've been in Bangkok for so long. I want to come back to Phuket already.

625
00:52:36,819 --> 00:52:39,519
My dad and mom are also lonely. They want me to be closer to them.

626
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:41,539
Yeah, but it's true.

627
00:52:41,539 --> 00:52:43,659
My parents have also been complaining that they want me to come back home.

628
00:52:43,659 --> 00:52:46,019
But instead, I'd rather stay in Bangkok first.

629
00:52:46,019 --> 00:52:47,899
Nong Karakade still hasn't finished school yet.

630
00:52:47,899 --> 00:52:50,100
Damn.

631
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,699
You and Nong Karakade have really been together for a long time.

632
00:52:52,699 --> 00:52:55,499
So long that I'm amazed at how you could do it, Ai'Mod.

633
00:52:55,499 --> 00:52:57,779
Well, am I not good-looking?

634
00:52:57,779 --> 00:52:59,900
- How could you?
- Get the hell away from me.

635
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,379
You're so over yourself.

636
00:53:01,379 --> 00:53:03,130
And how about you, Ai'Bas?

637
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:06,693
How have you been?

638
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:12,060
I've been all right.

639
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:15,010
My life isn't as exciting as yours, Ai'Teh.

640
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:16,859
Yeah, adventurous boy.

641
00:53:16,859 --> 00:53:19,139
Oh, my! Look at this!

642
00:53:19,139 --> 00:53:22,239
You kids grew up to be so handsome now!

643
00:53:22,239 --> 00:53:26,000
- Hello, Ma.
- Hello!

644
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,440
And is Oh-aew not coming?

645
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:35,099
Oh... Oh-aew is stuck with work, Mom.

646
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:38,379
Oh, what a pity. I wanted to see him.

647
00:53:38,379 --> 00:53:40,360
- Yes.
- Yes.

648
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,479
Let's go, boys. Let's go take a picture together.

649
00:53:45,479 --> 00:53:47,700
- Of course, Mom.
- Of course.

650
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:36,059
Ladies and gentlemen, I think that you'd all like to know the story

651
00:54:36,059 --> 00:54:39,339
or the path of love between P'Hoon and Nosomi-chan.

652
00:54:39,339 --> 00:54:41,660
No less than I would.

653
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:43,419
P'Hoon, could you please tell us the story?

654
00:54:43,419 --> 00:54:46,579
How did you two meet? And where did you meet?

655
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:50,780
We met in Japan.

656
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:55,430
At that time, she was a friend of my friend.

657
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:59,180
- When we first met, we couldn't even communicate.
- Not at all.

658
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:01,400
But it was very fun.

659
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,419
So fun that every time I had the chance to go back to Japan,

660
00:55:04,419 --> 00:55:08,000
I would always find the time and opportunity to go see her.

661
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:13,480
And then we were flirting,

662
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,760
and we became a couple.

663
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,880
So why did you choose to marry Nosomi-chan?

664
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:22,420
I don't know, either.

665
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:28,320
But there was a day when I woke up and I saw her,

666
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:35,499
realizing that this is the one, the person I want to wake up next to for the rest of my life.

667
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,739
So, I asked her to marry me.

668
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:45,360
Maybe love is just that simple.

669
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,699
But that doesn't mean everything is easy.

670
00:55:48,699 --> 00:55:51,880
The thing is, she and I grew up differently.

671
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:54,770
She believed in one thing, and I believed in another.

672
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,499
- There were many times when we'd argue.
- Hey.

673
00:55:58,499 --> 00:56:01,239
- We even almost broke up, right?
- Yeah.

674
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,550
But the important thing is...

675
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:09,160
whenever I turn and see her face,

676
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:14,979
there's not a day that I'd want to let her go or lose her.

677
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:19,780
This is the person whom I want to be with even when I grow old.

678
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:22,190
I want to hold hands with her and move forward together.

679
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:27,320
She's the one that I call my love.

680
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:39,339
Are you tired, Ma?

681
00:56:39,339 --> 00:56:40,779
Oh! Oh-aew!

682
00:56:40,779 --> 00:56:43,659
I thought your friends said you were stuck with work?

683
00:56:43,659 --> 00:56:46,799
It's P'Hoon's wedding. I had to be here, no matter what.

684
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:48,819
- Here's your present.
- Thanks.

685
00:56:48,819 --> 00:56:50,659
And how have you been?

686
00:56:50,659 --> 00:56:54,030
- I'm good.
- You look so grown up.

687
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:55,390
I can't believe it.

688
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:59,790
It seems like yesterday when you were just junior high kids running and playing around.

689
00:56:59,799 --> 00:57:03,600
Time went by in an instant and you're all working now.

690
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:09,920
I heard from Teh that he met you working at an agency, right?

691
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:13,980
Yes.

692
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:19,319
I'm always thinking of you, Oh-aew.

693
00:57:19,319 --> 00:57:23,239
I'm happy that you've got a happy life.

694
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:26,220
A good life.

695
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:30,460
Can I give you a hug? I miss you.

696
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:39,819
Come back to Phuket and visit us sometime, all right, Oh-aew?

697
00:57:39,819 --> 00:57:43,700
You're always welcome in my home.

698
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:47,713
Of course.

699
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:51,739
- Let's go. Let's take him to get a picture together.
- Let's take a picture, okay?

700
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:02,599
Everyone! All the single people!

701
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:05,339
Your time has come!

702
00:58:05,339 --> 00:58:08,499
All right! Come in closer. Come closer.

703
00:58:08,499 --> 00:58:10,499
Now is the time we'll find out

704
00:58:10,499 --> 00:58:14,139
who's going to be the one to get the flowers from Nosomi-chan.

705
00:58:14,139 --> 00:58:16,979
- They said that for these flowers, whoever gets them,
- That's enough.

706
00:58:16,979 --> 00:58:19,600
- will be the next in line to get married.
- Aren't you being too serious?
- Yeah.

707
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:23,099
When it comes to competitions, you can believe in me. I'm ready to give it my 100%.

708
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:24,933
Are you ready?

709
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,660
Let's count together.

710
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:30,299
One.

711
00:58:30,299 --> 00:58:31,959
Two.

712
00:58:31,959 --> 00:58:33,493
Three.

713
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:52,900
Sorry I came late.

714
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:55,610
I got off the plane and took the ferry here right away.

715
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:00,770
I thought that you weren't coming.

716
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:15,950
I once asked you not to disappear from my life...

717
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:20,260
so how could I disappear from your life?

718
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:32,880
I already went back and thought about it.

719
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:42,520
If we were back together,

720
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:49,020
there's no way...

721
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:52,240
that the two of us wouldn't have any problems in the future.

722
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:58,160
Time goes by.

723
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,240
We grow up.

724
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:04,080
We'll both keep changing.

725
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:12,280
Look at you and me now.

726
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:17,480
The two of us are not the same people...

727
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:22,220
we were the first day we loved each other anymore.

728
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,720
But what you told me...

729
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,853
that you

730
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:48,690
have no one who could ever replace me...

731
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:55,670
I just want to tell you that...

732
01:01:57,900 --> 01:01:59,840
for me,

733
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:04,920
no one can ever replace you, either.

734
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:10,610
I still want to see your face every day.

735
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:16,030
I want to see your smiley eyes.

736
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:24,730
I want to see your dimples when you smile.

737
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:31,240
I want to know where you've been,

738
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:34,280
if you're doing well.

739
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:40,680
I miss you.

740
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:46,653
So...

741
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:52,380
we don't have to promise that we're going to love each other forever.

742
01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:00,930
We don't have to expect that things will be the same and never change.

743
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:06,770
Because I just want to be with you.

744
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:18,190
And if we ever have any problems,

745
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:23,040
can you just talk to me?

746
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:26,920
We'll just fix it together.

747
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:35,710
I won't give up so easily ever again.

748
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:40,280
Could it be like that?

749
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:35,420
Not a sunflower this time?

750
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:40,000
Are you going to take it?

751
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,573
Yes.

752
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:54,453
Doing this,

753
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:57,990
it's like you're asking me to marry you.

754
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:01,390
What are you saying?

755
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:40,940
Guys, take a look at this!

756
01:05:42,379 --> 01:05:44,639
- Shit!
- That's awesome.

757
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:47,160
- Take a look at the caption too.
- Damn!

758
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:49,299
- Look at this!
- What is it?

759
01:05:49,299 --> 01:05:52,719
Hey! Shit! Let me see, man!

760
01:05:52,719 --> 01:05:55,120
- Shit!
- Damn.

761
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,750
Didn't see that coming.

762
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:02,520
[teh_tunn: I do.]

763
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:08,339
What's so funny?

764
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:09,819
Not telling you.

765
01:06:09,819 --> 01:06:11,739
- Let me see! Are you not telling me?
- Hey!

766
01:06:11,739 --> 01:06:14,020
- Khim.
- Yeah?

767
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:16,599
Whoa!
[teh_tunn: I do.]

768
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,000
They have come this far?

769
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,959
- How adorable.
- Right?

770
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:26,379
Teh's finally revealing his boyfriend, huh?

771
01:06:26,379 --> 01:06:30,430
I don't know if someone around here will be revealing his girlfriend as well...

772
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:36,280
[teh_tunn: I do.]

773
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:53,539
You shouldn't have posted our picture on Instagram.

774
01:06:53,539 --> 01:06:55,740
You'll get in trouble.

775
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:03,599
Well, here it is. The first problem that we'll need to solve together.

776
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:14,970
Thank you for joining us in this story
