00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,160
Military Prosecutor Doberman

8
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,030
Recruit No Tae Nam, come out.

9
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,230
No Tae Nam!

10
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,760
Recruit No Tae Nam, come out.

11
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,220
No Tae Nam!

12
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,010
No Tae Nam!

13
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,900
No Tae Nam!

14
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,240
Mother, you said that the military is better than prison?

15
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,250
For me, I think prison is better.

16
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,320
Recruit No Tae Nam, come out.

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,250
The contempt from inferiors that I've never had to experience since I was born.

18
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:15,000
The humiliation, the disrespect I felt at the trial.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,350
I don't think I can stay here any longer.

20
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:21,670
My life has been completely controlled by you, Mother.

21
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:26,590
Now I will never again submit to your command, Mother.

22
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,540
Prosecutor Cha,

23
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,910
you said it took you 6 years to get here, right?

24
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,280
I'll finish it in 3 months.

25
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,750
Exactly 90 days.

26
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:45,200
Look forward to my icy cold revenge.

27
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,210
Where are you going?

28
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,780
I have to report my resumption of position to General No Hwa Yeong.

29
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,290
Are you going to announce your attack?

30
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,140
It's too early.

31
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:03,380
My style is not with a passionate heart but a cold brain.

32
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,700
You have a lot to learn, friend.

33
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,260
You're lacking.

34
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,440
Lacking a lot.

35
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,580
The innocence of the defendant has been revealed.
Episode 6

36
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,960
But there's still the victim's wound.

37
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,750
This Recruit No Tae Nam will use his time performing his service to reflect on himself,

38
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,340
and I promise that he will complete his duty in an exemplary fashion.

39
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,460
Now, I will take my leave.

40
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,080
Thank you for your words, Lawyer.

41
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,650
Thank you.

42
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,810
Today's trial was not the defendant's but the lawyer's victory.

43
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,910
Military Prosecutor Cha Wu In, do you think those two are different?

44
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,070
Earlier at the trial No Tae Nam showed us.

45
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:47,530
It's not a victory to the defendant.

46
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:51,010
For all who select the military as a refuge after committing crimes,

47
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,890
it's not a time for them to reflect. Rather it must be a time for them to pay for their crimes.

48
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,210
If there is a group who dares abuse the military in such a way,

49
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:04,360
the military prosecutor Cha Wu In must eradicate that group at its roots.

50
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,740
Eradicate at the roots?

51
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,530
Yes, I will.

52
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:16,630
Do you know why I like the occupation of lawyer?

53
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:21,460
I get a thrill in knowing someone's fate rests in my hands.

54
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,350
A military prosecutor who is determined to ruin a person's life

55
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,730
versus a lawyer who is determined to save a person's life.

56
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,060
Who is the more righteous and just person of the two?

57
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,850
How funny

58
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:35,860
that on the lips of someone who wielded a sword mercilessly on the innocent when he was a prosecutor

59
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,870
comes the word, justice.

60
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,840
I think he has felt extreme humiliation at the trial.

61
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,450
I'm worried if he won't try to desert.

62
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:50,790
Don't be too drunk on your victory. I hope instead you guard No Tae Nam well.

63
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,240
Please give us a comment, General.

64
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,740
Today at the trial, Chairman No Tae Nam got a not guilty verdict.

65
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,410
I would like to request a comment from you about it.

66
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,770
Is there a particular reason that you did not attend the judgment hearing?

67
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:28,700
If I, the division commander, had attended the trial that the entire populace's attention is focused on,

68
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,820
the presiding military judge would've felt immense pressure.

69
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,660
It is true that the fact that one of my subordinates from my division's allegations have been resolved, made me more free.

70
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,690
Anyway, for my remaining time in the military,

71
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,050
I hope to do my best to answer to the concern and worry of the people.

72
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,120
The military is a place that cannot be exploited as a refuge against crimes,

73
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,110
but it's sacred ground. I will protect it with my honor.

74
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,440
I'd like to request comments from you as a mother.

75
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,930
Before considering myself, when I think about the victim's mother, my heart feels heavy.

76
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,420
I sincerely hope that they will get back on their feet as soon as possible.

77
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:11,330
Please say a word to your son who has suffered much.

78
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,330
Division Commander.

79
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,400
Division Commander?

80
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,950
Unity.

81
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,760
Captain Do Bae Man, Reporting the resumption of post as military prosecutor.

82
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,700
Go on ahead.

83
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,690
As your commanding officer, if I refuse to sign your resumption of post, what will you do?

84
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:45,530
As you had already seen me at the court, I am a bit late. I hope you would give your permission.

85
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,210
Where's that arrogant attitude when you reported your discharge.

86
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,420
I would like to apologize, Division Commander.

87
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:00,460
As you know, out of the 4th Division, I am the person who knows Chairman No Tae Nam the most.

88
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,200
I am also the most suitable person to assist Chairman No to adjust to the military.

89
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:10,010
Though he won the first trial, we still have the appeal and Lawyer Yong Mun Gu is just a civilian.

90
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:14,210
I am certain that as a military prosecutor I have more to contribute.

91
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,960
Is that so?

92
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,860
What is your true reason for returning?

93
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,740
I realized the place I need to be is here, the military.

94
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:37,620
I sincerely congratulate the judgment of not guilty on your son.

95
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,430
Unity.

96
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,270
One moment please.

97
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,670
Before returning to your personal affairs, allow me to talk to him.

98
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,610
Yes, understood.

99
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,760
You should have been judged not guilty no matter what, Chairman.

100
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,240
Please understand.

101
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,670
When you told me to go to the military, you had seen far ahead

102
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,110
today's trial.

103
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,350
What did you receive from mother as a result of winning the trial?

104
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,840
You probably were promised the Chairmanship of IM Defense.

105
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:29,240
You. You cornered me to hell to take charge of that position, you planned it all.

106
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,290
Isn't that right?

107
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:43,180
I don't care if you made me innocent, but you lost me.

108
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,990
Forever.

109
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,590
Whenever you open your mouth, you say, "I'm not a soldier."

110
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,260
"I'm a prosecutor."

111
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,390
You shouted that. Look at you. Looking great. So good.

112
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:10,250
For the military prosecution to lose without a fight like this. Does that make sense?

113
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,990
As the legal division chief,

114
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,730
I cannot carry my head proudly. Because of you! Cha Wu In!

115
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,450
Please consolidate your position as one.

116
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:23,860
It's clearly written on your face that you're now able to stand proudly before the division commander because I lost the trial.

117
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,930
What?

118
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:30,190
Captain Do, how exactly do you manage the legal department?

119
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,940
I am sorry.

120
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,960
A troublemaker like you who only says the right things, do you know how difficult you make it for your superiors?

121
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,040
A superior that is different on the inside and out. A superior who doesn't take responsibility,

122
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,030
but takes credit for results also makes things difficult for his subordinates.

123
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,920
Hey! Cha Wu In!

124
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,220
You, who's your father?!

125
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,480
Why... why exactly are you doing this to me?

126
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,140
I will also leave.

127
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,600
Unity.

128
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,550
Wow truly.

129
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,680
Really.

130
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:11,080
Of course, it's a truly good thing.

131
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,750
If we had won the trial, what would we have done?

132
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:20,180
By the way, could you tell that I was happy?

133
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,070
A lot.

134
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:27,640
If No Tae Nam had gone to military prison, I wouldn't be here either.

135
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,460
Anyway, I'm so glad you're back.

136
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:38,500
You know I played a big role getting you back here despite the disapproval from higher-ups, right?

137
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,450
Yes, I will work much harder.

138
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:45,890
And I will do my best to totally take control of Prosecutor Cha.

139
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,830
Great. Great.

140
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,000
It's very good.

141
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:06,330
I'll text you the address, so come here. It's not far from the base.

142
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:11,080
Appropriate Horticulture Cooperative

143
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,750
What is this? Is it here?

144
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,420
Coffee Shop

145
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,310
Ma'am, I'd like to order. Where do I take a seat—

146
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,930
Use the kiosk.

147
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,180
Where is the kiosk?

148
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,720
Kiosk. Yes.

149
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,990
It's very unique here.

150
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,980
You can also order with ice.

151
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,240
Ah, I am the one who gets cold easily.

152
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,460
So I'm fine.

153
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,490
Hey Prosecutor Cha.

154
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,310
Hello.

155
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:22,160
Nice to see you again, Prosecutor Do.

156
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,120
Didn't we drop formalities last time? Quite dramatically, at that.

157
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,810
Oh, are you putting up a facade in front of Prosecutor Cha?

158
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,850
Why did you bring him here?

159
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,910
Because we're a team.

160
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,110
Team?

161
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,110
I don't remember allowing you to join.

162
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:49,710
Allow me to join? You've got the wrong order.

163
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,210
You're the one who joined the game we started.

164
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,850
And I'm the one that allowed it to happen.

165
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,560
Gosh, forget it.

166
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,990
How are we to discuss strategy here?

167
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,790
This isn't the place. Let's go elsewhere.

168
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,290
That lady is watching us, too.

169
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:17,840
Hey, Prosecutor Cha. Where are you—

170
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,450
Follow me.

171
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,920
You've prepared lots for six years, Cha Wu In.

172
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,470
It's CEO Kang's building so we set it up easily.

173
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,180
Don't feel too burdened by it.

174
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,860
I just followed Wu In's requests.

175
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,890
So why exactly are you—

176
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:00,490
Wh-Why are you needed here?

177
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,900
CEO Kang has been my partner for a long time.

178
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,950
He'll be helpful to you too, Prosecutor Do.

179
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:12,550
Madam Paik at the counter is trustworthy as well, no need to have your guard up.

180
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:17,900
From now on, all meetings which require privacy will take place here.

181
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,800
Let's get started.

182
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,400
The Patriotic Society.

183
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:34,130
It's a secret organization within the military that No Hwa Yeong is a part of.

184
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,660
Lee Jae Sik's father founded this group.

185
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,010
We know that it fell apart and disappeared,

186
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:43,260
but Lee Jae Sik, who became a member of the military following his father's footsteps, took over.

187
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,940
It's been deeply involved with military personnel.

188
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,550
It has increased its power in the military and taken over key positions.

189
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,570
The Patriotic Society...

190
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,280
What do they have to do with our revenge?

191
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,950
Their avarice resulted

192
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:59,350
in the death of your parents and my father.

193
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:04,980
No Hwa Yeong is the first female two star general division commander since the founding of the army.

194
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,090
While serving as Chief of Staff at army headquarters,

195
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,800
she assisted the President's Chief of Staff, Lee Jae Sik.

196
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,300
After taking office as the 4th Division's commander, she became the number 3 member of the Patriotic Society.

197
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:18,830
First in rank is Lee Jae Sik.

198
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,570
Who's second?

199
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,600
Lieutenant General Hong Mu Seop.

200
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,820
He's the military prosecutor who was in charge of your parent's case twenty years ago.

201
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,080
He played a part in covering up that trial.

202
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,060
Currently, he is the Commander of the 4th Army and direct superior of No Hwa Yeong.

203
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,930
He is the one most wary of No Hwa Yeong.

204
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,260
Why is that?

205
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,180
There's no telling when the ranking will change.

206
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:45,360
That's how much Lee Jae Sik trusts No Hwa Yeong.

207
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,990
Lieutenant Colonel Won Gi Chun. He's the Battalion Commander of the 4th Division Search Operation.

208
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:51,770
The youngest of the Patriotic Society, who joined 6 years ago.

209
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,930
Isn't the Lt. Colonel the Landmine Hero?

210
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:58,880
That's right. No Hwa Yeong's word becomes law and dictates life to him.

211
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,870
Within the Patriotic Society, he's completely subordinate to No Hwa Yeong.

212
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:06,190
The Landmine Hero is a member of the Patriotic Society. Interesting.

213
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,290
We need to dig into it.

214
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,060
He is Brigadier General Heo Kang In.

215
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,030
He is the deputy commander under Hong Mu Seop.

216
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,830
He's both No Hwa Yeong's military academy colleague and rival.

217
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:19,160
Lately, while Lee Jae Sik has been sending a lot of support in No Hwa Yeong's direction,

218
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,510
within the society his position is weakening.

219
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:25,660
It seems like you're planning on using this to your advantage.

220
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,330
The only person who can give commands to No Hwa Yeong.

221
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:33,870
In a few days the inauguration ceremony for the Minister of Defense will be held.

222
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,510
Current Patriotic Society

223
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,740
The scale is much larger than anticipated.

224
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,100
And... Yong Mun Gu.

225
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,670
I predict he'll become a member of the Patriotic Society soon.

226
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,380
Do you know what that means?

227
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,290
No Hwa Yeong's authority within the Patriotic Society is growing

228
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:57,580
since she's planted one of her own,

229
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,010
a civilian at that, into the organization.

230
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,850
Correct.

231
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:08,050
They're using Yong Mun Gu to fill the vacancy of IM's CEO position since No Tae Nam went into the army,

232
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,370
something that's been planned since years ago.

233
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:14,800
The most necessary thing for a corrupt military is money.

234
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:21,560
You've lured me into a multi-layer spider web, Cha Wu In.

235
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,240
There's only one way to catch a spider.

236
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,330
Ripping it out with its web.

237
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,850
No Tae Nam 013

238
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,900
Goodness.

239
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,450
This little one knows no control.

240
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,720
The meals here at the base are great at suppressing my little guy.

241
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,260
That means you don't need to eat this. I'll eat it for you.

242
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,350
Give me that. Give me that.

243
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:15,040
What are you all snickering at?

244
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,580
Eat a lot of rice with beans (prison food). You army bastards.

245
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,840
So scary. So scary.

246
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,780
Army prick. Army prick.

247
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:28,210
Trainee 13.

248
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,020
Special treat for you!

249
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,770
(T/N: In Korea, eel meat is believed to enhance virility.)

250
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,490
Wow, it's strong.

251
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:45,500
I picked out the largest one, just for you.

252
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,990
Eat this and stand... this tall!

253
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,290
Stand tall!

254
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,120
It's already been two days...

255
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,410
Is it not coming?

256
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,130
Not being able to urinate is all in your head.

257
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,610
I heard you have ED.

258
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:17,850
This bastard... What did you just say?

259
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:30,280
You might be a CEO in the real world, but you're nothing in here.

260
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,790
Got it? You tiny prick.

261
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:48,460
If I stay here any longer, I'll go insane and die.

262
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,200
I must find a way.

263
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,180
A way. A way. A way.

264
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:03,120
Good work. Let's have a smoke. Let's head out.

265
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:46,100
I came to the military as you and Lawyer Yong requested.

266
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,910
But this is a hell that isn't made for people to live in.

267
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,620
It's worse than I imagined.

268
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,590
The fact a place like this exists in our country

269
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,790
- Let's go!
- is unbelievable, Mother.

270
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:15,550
They say the reason why prison rations are better than rations for the military

271
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:18,020
is because many wealthy heirs go to prison

272
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:22,190
but never go to the military.

273
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,030
Let's go!

274
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:33,400
Eating, sleeping, and bathing with men I've never seen in my life.

275
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,990
The thing I can't stand the most is the alarms that blare every morning.

276
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:41,480
I can't stand the repetitive nature of being here—

277
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,170
Division Commander, the recruit training officer is here.

278
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,230
So late?

279
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,140
Escort him in.

280
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,740
What's going on?

281
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,490
There's an issue with Trainee No Tae Nam.

282
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,700
- Issue?
- Yes...

283
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,010
Why the hesitation? Report it immediately.

284
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:14,940
No Tae Nam has deserted.

285
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:18,830
We made groups with the training assistants and searched every inch of the military base.

286
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,390
Are you certain?

287
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,810
Yes. We're certain he's deserted.

288
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,790
What shall we do?

289
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,950
Take care of it according to procedure.

290
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,930
Excuse me? Will that be alright?

291
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:34,790
Have we ever given No Tae Nam special treatment because he's my son?

292
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,680
No, ma'am! Never under any circumstance.

293
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,590
The same goes for this. Take care of him the same way.

294
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,620
Yes, I understand.

295
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:47,520
In a short while Lee Jae Sik will be inaugurated.

296
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,230
Before the biggest occasion for the Korean armed forces,

297
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:56,020
the desertion of a single soldier must not cause a decline in the morale of 600,000 uniformed service persons.

298
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,990
It is a matter of military prestige.

299
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:01,190
I understand what you mean.

300
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,690
Good. Leave now.

301
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:42,180
No Hwa Yeong

302
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,580
Yes, Madam.

303
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,050
Tae Nam has deserted.

304
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:52,380
I'm on my way.

305
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:32,390
You said you had no other choice than to reveal Tae Nam's embarrassing weakness in trial?

306
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:35,810
I should've considered how it would impact Chairman No.

307
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:38,760
I'm at fault for only considering the outcome of the trial.

308
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:43,470
I explained it clearly to the recruit training officer.

309
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:52,560
Use Do Bae Man. He's returned with more vengeance than ever.

310
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,030
He'll do anything to prove his worth.

311
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,800
So warm.

312
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:15,930
I finally feel alive.

313
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:18,450
Poor boy.

314
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,220
Eat. Ramen.

315
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,210
Go buy some.

316
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,700
Hey, do you know how much I have?

317
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,550
I'm the CEO of IM.

318
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,390
I'm also the queen!

319
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,270
- Mr. CEO!
- Mr. CEO.

320
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:40,770
Boy, do you have a place to sleep tonight?

321
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:43,960
I'll ask my honey.

322
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:49,450
Can I borrow this phone?

323
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,310
You treated me like a beggar earlier.

324
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:56,950
Okay. If you let me use this phone, I'll shoot you 100 million won right away. Deal?

325
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:59,090
This too.

326
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,480
Huh?

327
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:16,660
1, 2, 3,

328
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,990
4, 5, 6, 7.

329
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:23,090
8, 9.

330
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:25,200
100 million.

331
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:35,350
After bullying a kid to death, did you think that changing your name and doing your military service diligently

332
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,320
would erase your past?

333
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,190
You little—!

334
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:43,450
I have a feeling that this won't be the last time we meet.

335
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,910
Ahn Su Ho, visitor.

336
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:55,660
Military Police

337
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,850
You dare to come here again?

338
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:07,570
I've become a star as a stellar military prosecutor, thanks to you.

339
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:10,760
Thanks for it.

340
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,920
Because of me... my father—

341
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,430
Not only did he get fired from the bank he's worked at his entire life,

342
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:21,000
but he got his entire fortune taken by them.

343
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,630
He's received a belated punishment for not raising you well.

344
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:37,970
I'm leaving in 2 months.

345
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:40,140
Once I leave, I'll kill you with my own hands.

346
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:44,060
Two months? That's too long.

347
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:47,520
I'll help you get out before then.

348
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,740
This bastard is still messing around.

349
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,140
Sure, you probably can't believe me

350
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,980
since I'm the one that brought you here.

351
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:04,220
In a few days, a gift will arrive for you.

352
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,020
Stop spouting nonsense—

353
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:09,250
If you open it, you'll go crazy wanting to call me.

354
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,350
What are you talking about, you bastard?!

355
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:21,520
The person you should be directing your anger towards is not me,

356
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,790
but No Tae Nam.

357
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,990
Yong Mun Gu

358
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:40,650
If you're looking for me, it must mean something has happened, and I'm needed to resolve it.

359
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:43,250
No Tae Nam has deserted.

360
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,830
You don't seem surprised at all.

361
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,990
You know him less than I do.

362
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,900
Are you saying you anticipated this?

363
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,530
Within the military, No Tae Nam is nothing more than a race horse.

364
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:58,360
A horse ready to leave as soon as the trigger is pulled.

365
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,980
Whenever the opportunity arose, he would make a break for it

366
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,320
regardless of the consequences.

367
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,720
"Even if I get caught, my mother will figure it out."

368
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,090
That's probably his thought process as he stuck out across the boundary.

369
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,730
Even if he gets caught, he'd just spend time in the military prison.

370
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:15,490
Between a prison-like military and a military-like prison,

371
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:18,410
there's not much difference to Chairman No.

372
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:29,330
Judging from the fact that the base doesn't know, you're keeping it well under the radar.

373
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:30,830
Yes, sure.

374
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,300
You'd better move before the issue grows out of hand.

375
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:38,760
I'll catch him, just for you and Commander No.

376
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,660
In the middle of the night, the recruit training unit turned upside down.

377
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,530
A trainee has disappeared.

378
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:53,690
And that trainee is No Tae Nam?

379
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:56,650
But you came alone?

380
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:59,990
- Where's Do Bae Man?
- I don't know.

381
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:02,990
I couldn't reach him all day, and he's been out of the office.

382
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:05,290
Dammit.

383
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:09,460
If he's aware of this information, but he isn't sharing it with us,

384
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,800
it can only mean one thing.

385
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,410
He's got other intentions.

386
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,500
Loyalty. What brings you here, Sir?

387
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:28,020
I'm here to see the recruit training officer.

388
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,540
Loyalty!

389
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:35,860
Step. Step. Step.

390
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:44,700
Unity. I'm military prosecutor Do Bae Man.

391
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,750
Who are you?

392
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,310
I...

393
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,720
joked around with Trainee No Tae Nam a bit.

394
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,730
If you do that one more time, I'll kill you.

395
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:57,250
I'm sorry, sir!

396
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,860
If you can't take care of No Tae Nam's desertion properly,

397
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:04,460
you'll be ending your military career then.

398
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:08,650
And you'll be starting anew. In prison.

399
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:10,820
Get going.

400
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,230
Have you gotten any special orders regarding the desertion?

401
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:20,210
Orders?

402
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:24,070
No. She told us to take care of it according to the field manual, standard procedure.

403
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:29,820
So you're the one who decided to keep the mouths of the soldiers who searched shut about the case?

404
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:33,480
Yeah, it was my call.

405
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,120
I understand.

406
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:38,530
- Over here.
- Where are the trainees?

407
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:42,720
Out in the field for education and training. They will return at 6 pm.

408
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,120
Military Diary

409
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,150
This was found at a private home near the training center.

410
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:16,340
This is the CCTV footage from the training center.

411
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:22,090
The driver stopped the truck during transport because he heard a noise coming from the freezer trailer.

412
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:24,260
Once he opened that freezer,

413
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,820
I'm sure you know what happened next.

414
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,860
As you are aware, whenever there is a change of the Minister of Defense,

415
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:34,080
there will be an announcement of deserter pursuit.

416
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,490
In other words, desertion has no statute of limitations.

417
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:40,920
He'll be remembered as a deserter till the day he dies.

418
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:50,380
I missed this.

419
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:55,070
Are we signing a new contract, with this?

420
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:59,910
Since we know your skills based on the past five years, we need no contract.

421
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:02,320
Isn't that better?

422
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,580
Cha Wu In

423
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,860
You know what money wants?

424
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,100
More money.

425
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:22,840
Did you return after you became more frank, or did you become more blunt after you returned?

426
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,490
Just give me some information on Mr. No's points of contact.

427
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:29,200
I'll return everything to where it should be,

428
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,340
so people don't know he ever escaped.

429
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,400
Hello?

430
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,180
Where are you? You had your phone turned off, too.

431
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:43,480
Earlier, I wasn't in a situation to pick up a call.

432
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,910
The location or the person you were meeting?

433
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:51,540
Must I report all that information to you?

434
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:56,350
It looks quite heavy, that wine box.

435
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:04,330
Wine gifted to you by Yong Mun Gu?

436
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:08,780
Did you follow me here?

437
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,710
Didn't we agree to work together?

438
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:13,280
That's what I want to ask you.

439
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,960
Didn't we have the same goals?

440
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:23,940
No Tae Nam's desertion. Why didn't you tell us as soon as you found out?

441
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,070
Follow me.

442
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:35,080
I heard from Yong Mun Gu. How did you find out?

443
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,020
Is that important right now?

444
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,970
I told you.

445
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:43,250
I can only trust you if you let me know where you got your intel. Don't you agree?

446
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:51,700
There's a company that supplies stationery to the recruit training unit post exchange.

447
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:57,310
I see. So you bribed the person in charge for intel?

448
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,610
No.

449
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,310
Then where?

450
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:02,650
I bought that company.

451
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,100
What?

452
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,930
You bought a company just to find out where No Tae Nam was?

453
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:10,870
Is there something wrong with that?

454
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,510
No.

455
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:17,310
I feel small by acting so nonchalant about this.

456
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:20,720
Money is meant to be used in this way.

457
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,710
Now, answer my question. Why didn't you tell us about No Tae Nam?

458
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:28,850
Have you forgotten what I said already?

459
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:33,160
I told you I'd become your faithful hunting dog.

460
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:38,280
He might've gotten away with the trial but I'll make sure to hand him over to you this time.

461
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:45,330
I made No Tae Nam desert.

462
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,550
What?

463
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,560
He's a deserter.

464
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,960
Yes!

465
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:28,460
Even someone as fashionable as you can't make the military look cool.

466
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,910
Who would recognize you as an heir?

467
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,920
Dammit, just go.

468
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,790
Yes, trainee.

469
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:45,540
No Tae Nam

470
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:49,610
"Chairman, No Tae Nam Enlists Amidst Ongoing Controversy of Sexual Assault at Cartel"

471
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:57,220
No news on it. As expected of our No Hwa Yeong.

472
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:00,470
Maybe not. Is this Yong Mun Gu's doing?

473
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:08,300
Where's Bolt. Bolt? Is he in the trunk?

474
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:13,040
Are you crazy? If I bring a dog in here, it'll stink. This car is expensive.

475
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,640
I told you to bring him!

476
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,720
Are you crazy?

477
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,210
I came here to help you, and you're hitting me?

478
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,840
Because of that dammed dog?

479
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,080
What? Dammed dog?

480
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,430
Hey, you bastard, stop the car.

481
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:29,840
What are you doing? I'm driving!

482
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,640
Should I report you?

483
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,100
Do you want me to report that the son of the division commander has deserted?

484
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,550
Dammit.

485
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,240
Prosecutor Do is the one that made No Tae Nam escape?

486
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,740
Can you explain in more detail?

487
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,540
A soldier owed me a debt.

488
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:52,840
I asked him to provoke No Tae Nam a bit, and he did it well.

489
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,940
- Good.
- He was the one who closed the truck's door too.

490
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,650
Let's go!

491
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:11,630
Mission complete.

492
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:17,340
So where's No Tae Nam right now?

493
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:20,110
I don't know where he's hiding.

494
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,990
We went through all the trouble of getting him to desert.

495
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:25,400
How unfortunate.

496
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,140
It's more difficult to get him to escape. It won't be so hard to catch him.

497
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:33,770
That's what I'm saying. It's possible if it's you.

498
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:36,820
If you're going to do such things, tell me about it in advance.

499
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:39,500
We've got plenty of trackers we can use on people at the company.

500
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:43,590
We, military prosecutors, don't use such things. Right?

501
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:48,950
But... why did you plan for No Tae Nam to desert from the military?

502
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:52,320
The new Minister of Defense will be inaugurated tomorrow morning at the Ministry of Defense.

503
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,680
I plan to move the ball of fire that No Tae Nam started over to No Hwa Yeong.

504
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:02,220
He will get straight to work after his inauguration.

505
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:14,960
Oh, dear. The target is avoiding me now. How hurtful.

506
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,320
A soldier who can't hit the target can't call himself a soldier.

507
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,840
No, sir. It's just time to change the target.

508
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:28,180
Now that you're the Minister of Defense, you can aim towards politics now.

509
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,610
I'm confident that I can aim well for that.

510
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:37,630
Tomorrow is finally your inauguration. The day that we've all been waiting for eagerly.

511
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:40,630
Don't worry about a thing, and focus on the politics sir.

512
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:45,780
We have our mighty General No Hwa Yeong protecting the front line of this country.

513
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,960
Tae Nam's trial was handled well.

514
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,090
He'll need to stop causing trouble now.

515
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,770
Is he adjusting well?

516
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:00,400
Yes, sir. You mustn't worry about Tae Nam anymore.

517
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,160
Of course now. Now, he's not your son but a subordinate.

518
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,150
In the military, the superiors are responsible for everything.

519
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:12,540
How the times have changed. In the past, soldiers put civilians to trial too.

520
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,680
Those were the days.

521
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:19,620
These days, being a military officer is nothing more or less than an ordinary job.

522
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:22,380
A military position cannot be considered a job.

523
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:26,460
It's an identity. One that never changes.

524
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:31,090
As expected, you're a true subordinate of mine.

525
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:34,640
Hwa Yeong, let's see what you've got.

526
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:52,290
Great!

527
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:03,930
I'll borrow your car for now.

528
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:07,670
Sure. But Hyeong, what the heck are you going to do?

529
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,430
Do you have a plan?

530
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:11,560
Well I'll spend a few days at a hotel

531
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,240
and think about it with a clear head.

532
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,000
Allen's career is totally over for him now, as he got sentenced.

533
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,880
I thought you were safe in the military.

534
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,560
The other dudes all changed their numbers and are off the grid now.

535
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,290
Dammit, those unloyal bastards.

536
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:32,130
Hey. You used to use a commercial detective agency to take care of your stuff, right?

537
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:34,610
Not a commercial detective agency—

538
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,130
Do you think I'll work with anyone?

539
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:43,560
They are the top 1% who exclusively handle the problems of rich heirs like us.

540
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,400
The top 1% that'll put those who enrage you into an eternal sleep.

541
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,000
Abundant Devil Everywhere

542
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,400
Abundant Devil Everywhere

543
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,430
Come on.

544
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:06,070
Hyeongnim. This is the guy I was talking about. The ex-North Korean soldier.

545
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:10,440
My name is Black Tiger. I worked as a bodyguard in the 973rd Unit.

546
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:14,220
- Bodyguard?
- I was in charge of the head commander's security.

547
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,810
The head commander?

548
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:20,440
You mean Kim Jong Un?

549
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:25,960
If anyone looked at him for more than three seconds, I pulled the trigger.

550
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:33,170
Whoa, your face and experience are good enough for a free pass.

551
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:38,250
However, I'll need to put you to the test.

552
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,410
I don't intend to go through any sort of audition.

553
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:42,650
Is that so?

554
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:47,920
In that case, we'll have no choice.

555
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,180
I don't believe in resumes, and believe in what you say less.

556
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:56,270
I only believe things I see with my own eyes.

557
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:58,560
Understand?

558
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,360
Get out.

559
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:08,050
- Would a North Korean soldier know English?
- Of course, it's a global period right now.

560
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,870
P-Pass.

561
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,770
You passed the interview.

562
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:23,670
From now on, you'll be my body guard.

563
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:27,840
- Negotiate his salary and finalize his contract right away.
- Okay.

564
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,430
Which one of you is Mount Seol Ak?

565
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:34,840
M-Mount Seol Ak?

566
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:40,210
Which bastard butchered my precious name in the early morning?

567
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:43,880
Wait a minute.

568
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:49,560
Your montage seems so familiar...

569
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:55,710
Chairman No Tae Nam?

570
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:57,340
You recognize me.

571
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:01,740
Shouldn't you be in the military right now?

572
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,450
I escaped.

573
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:13,530
I'm a deserter.

574
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:17,520
That's why I need to ask you for a favor.

575
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,860
Forget-Me-Not Cafe

576
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:21,250
One of No Tae Nam's line has joined No Tae Nam.

577
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:24,760
It's one of the members who played cards with him that day. So if we look into him, we'll find something.

578
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,640
I understand.

579
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,850
You should stay out of this case.

580
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:32,570
- Excuse me?
- Send someone else.

581
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:34,470
Who are you talking about?

582
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:37,090
A professional at taking care of cases like this.

583
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:41,690
Hey, it's the phone.

584
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:44,550
Oppa, oppa, the driver must be here.

585
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:47,370
Get a hold of yourself! The driver.

586
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:49,610
Oh no, I bumped your car while parking.

587
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:53,320
I think the repair costs will be quite high. What to do?

588
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:00,920
What the hell? Who bumped where?

589
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,340
Dammit, blood?

590
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:12,130
Oh darn. I forgot to mention I bumped your car with your own head.

591
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:14,910
You... You red-head!

592
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:19,540
Correct, you remember me. Aren't you glad to see me again?

593
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,440
Where do you think you're going?

594
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,050
Making me do the same job twice.

595
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,290
What is this?

596
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:44,270
Untie my hands! Why do you do this every time?

597
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,090
Where's No Tae Nam?

598
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:52,770
How would I know that? He's probably in hiding somewhere so he won't get found.

599
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:56,140
So you do know he deserted?

600
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:02,670
Can we put him on mute for a second?

601
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:04,420
Can't you call outside?

602
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:07,620
It's too cold outside. I'll freeze to death out there.

603
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:13,290
Shut it.

604
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:17,900
I found the guy that Chairman No contacted after he left.

605
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,400
Really?

606
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,840
He must've made sure that he'd stay silent. Are you sure he'd talk?

607
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,960
That's why I'm planning on giving him about 10 chances.

608
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,570
Ten chances? Anyway, put a rush on it.

609
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:30,580
Sure. I'll call you back.

610
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,340
Okay, you can unmute.

611
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,090
I'm asking you one last time. Where's No Tae Nam?

612
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:41,960
I said I don't know. I really don't!

613
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:45,150
This is why I hate conversations.

614
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:49,940
You know Allen, that jerk became like that after he avoided talking.

615
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,580
Oh gosh.

616
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,630
My Zone

617
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:59,850
Here. You have 10 fingers, so I'll only ask 10 times.

618
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:03,250
Wait a minute. Wait! Hey!

619
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:06,510
What exactly did I do wrong, that you're doing this to me?

620
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:11,620
Your illegal gambling, aiding and abetting No Tae Nam's desertion

621
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,720
and spreading illegal footage of Han Se Na.

622
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,120
Is that a sin?

623
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:19,030
Is it a sin for some guys to share porn with our friends?

624
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:20,400
What?

625
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:24,490
This bastard—

626
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:36,800
What the hell? Did you... actually cut it off.

627
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,520
Weren't you going to just scare him?

628
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:41,820
I wasn't intending to, but what he said just made me so mad.

629
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:44,820
I see. Right.

630
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:49,330
Please save me! I really, really don't know where he is.

631
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:53,030
I only know what he's trying to do. Only what he's trying to do.

632
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:55,630
- What is he trying to do?
- He's trying to leave!

633
00:47:55,630 --> 00:48:00,760
Since he knows he'll be dragged back to the military if caught, he said he was going to leave by boat.

634
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:04,650
That's impossible to do alone. Who's helping him?

635
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:07,980
Speak up. We can only fix this if we head to the hospital immediately.

636
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:10,270
Dammit!

637
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:13,550
Tae Nam will kill me if he finds out.

638
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:17,570
You'll take responsibility? Right?

639
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:29,420
Restricted Number

640
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,740
Chairman?

641
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:40,380
You must've waited for my call.

642
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:42,230
Sir, where are you?

643
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:44,530
You won the trial for me

644
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:48,280
and have worked hard cleaning up my messes all this time.

645
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:52,900
Oh. I won't be able to call Mother,

646
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,880
so just relay the message for me. I'm leaving Korea.

647
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,290
Sir.

648
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:01,690
I heard next week would be the inauguration of IM's new CEO.

649
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:07,020
Are you satisfied now that you're taking that position after sending me to the military?

650
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:10,940
Everyone always bad mouthed how I got that position thanks to my mother who was a general,

651
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:14,320
but I worked really hard for the company. You of all people know that.

652
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,760
Mother didn't acknowledge me, but you should have.

653
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:21,400
Sir, please calm down and return. I beg of you.

654
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,550
To my mother,

655
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:26,440
you're nothing more than a tool.

656
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,380
Keep my words in mind.

657
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:32,680
And I won't listen to my mom's commands anymore.

658
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:37,530
Until when are you— Until when will you disappoint your mother?

659
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,800
Do Bae Man

660
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:51,910
I just got a call from Chairman No.

661
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:03,860
Hello.

662
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:06,360
I think he's trying to escape to China.

663
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,700
I have obtained information about the container port, and I'm on my way.

664
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:12,300
CEO No must not leave. Not at all!

665
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,100
Of course not.

666
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:18,380
That would make all my efforts up to this point meaningless.

667
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,490
Okay.

668
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:57,820
Five Sea Gold Thousand

669
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,520
Sea Gold

670
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,890
What the hell?

671
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:27,500
- What is this?
- What do you mean by it?

672
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:31,160
You just got tricked.

673
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:38,380
Shyster Do. You entered the tiger's cage with your own feet.

674
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:41,540
Oh goodness. I can't get on a boat like that because I get nauseous.

675
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:44,330
I've requested a private plane through a friend.

676
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:47,140
You're truly of another class.

677
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:50,880
In that case, what's the reason we must use a stunt-double for you

678
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,750
to put on this fake escape plan?

679
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:56,980
I'm certain my lawyer

680
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:01,120
will use that military officer Doberman to find me.

681
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,210
The military officer Doberman?

682
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:07,170
There's another guy that looks like a Doberman?

683
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:09,040
It's not a common face.

684
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,910
What? You know Do Bae Man?

685
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:19,550
Of course. My only enemy under this sky.

686
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,020
You used your brains.

687
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:33,900
You're not the only one with brains here.

688
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,970
What are you doing?

689
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:40,650
- Turn the boat around!
- Around!

690
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:42,580
Turn it around!

691
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:01,810
Bolt! Bolt!

692
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:04,670
Bolt, did you miss me?

693
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:06,950
I missed you so much.

694
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:11,820
Let's stay together from now on. I'll never leave you.

695
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:15,010
Congratulations 49-50th Minister of Defense Inauguration

696
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:55,180
We'll have your pet board our plane's designated pet area.

697
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:58,880
Bolt, I'll see you soon.

698
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:21,170
Sir, what would you like for dinner after boarding?

699
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:26,390
I'll start off with champagne. For the main dish, I'll have grade A Korean Beef.

700
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:29,420
What about grade A grilled eel?

701
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:32,410
Trainee 13.

702
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:37,660
- Red hair?
- No Tae Nam, get up.

703
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,930
You're the red-hair wretch Allen was talking about?

704
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:44,180
You're a deserter.

705
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:48,110
- How did you get here?
- Don't you think it's time to return to the military?

706
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:52,100
No way. You think I'll ever go back there?

707
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:54,640
That little—

708
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:58,470
♫ Hey, watch out y'all. I'm a little out of control ♫

709
00:54:58,470 --> 00:55:01,580
♫ There's nothing surprising ♫

710
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:02,680
Why is he running?

711
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:07,110
A smart rabbit digs many holes.

712
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:08,600
You're so pretty!

713
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,780
This baby's a Doberman, right?

714
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:11,660
You're so handsome.

715
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:14,480
To No Tae Nam, Bolt is his one and only family.

716
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,280
Bye.

717
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:20,080
If he leaves Korea, he'll bring Bolt no matter what.

718
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:22,580

724
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:34,710
Trainee 13.

725
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:37,900
You're great at running. Shall we do the rest of running on the base?

726
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:40,180
Let's go. One, two.

727
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:42,150
One, two.

728
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:45,140
One, two.

729
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:46,910

732
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,610
We meet again.

00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:58,780
♫ I'm going to bark viciously.  ♫

734

00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:12,760
♫ Step out of my zone. My, my zone. My zone. ♫

740
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:17,680
There he is.

741
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:25,400
Escort him well.

742
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,510
Yes, sir!

743
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:28,730
Kill him.

744
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:46,850
Why are there so many of you?

745
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:49,170
I think you're done warming up,

746
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:53,160
so let's get the show started.

747
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,680
This time, it'll be different.

748
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:58,980
North Korean Soldier!

749
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:07,510
We specially recruited a North Korean soldier.

750
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:10,410
First Rank Bodyguard.

751
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:13,530
I get to see a South Korean military prosecutor.

752
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:16,640
I've seen so much in the South.

753
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:33,540
Whoa, his gaze is something else.

754
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:35,460
It looks vicious.

755
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,170
Why're you trying to challenge me?

756
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:40,290
Hey, come slowly. Slowly.

757
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,650
Let me warm up a bit.

758
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:55,910
Move.

759
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,450
Let's hurry up and go.

760
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:16,080
I'm never going to the military ever again. Ever!

761
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,850
Oh, gosh.

762
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:25,930
Come here. Come.

763
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:28,400
Why? If we come in, do we get something?

764
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,990
I'm all warmed up now. Come on in.

765
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:32,910
Go get him.

766
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:35,090
Alright, go.

767
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:36,750
- You go.
- What are you doing?

768
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:37,880
I can't swim.

769
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:40,510
None of you can swim?

770
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:43,570
Turn the boat around. Get him.

771
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:45,230
In the North,

772
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:48,530
- we don't learn how to swim.
- What kind of soldier can't swim?

773
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:52,500
Hey, North Korean Black Tiger! I'm the South Korean Fish!

774
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,320
Come out, bastard!

775
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,910
Come back out!

776
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:57,990
Come in, you bastards!

777
00:58:57,990 --> 00:58:59,490
So refreshing!

778
00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:02,220
Military Prosecutor!!!

779
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:05,500
What is that?

780
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,420
It's the maritime police.

781
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:08,900
You jerk.

782
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:11,420
- Come on, hurry.
- You punk!

783
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:14,660
See you next time!

784
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:17,440
Hurry up.

785
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:26,480
Now. One, two, three.

786
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:29,300
Again. Again.

787
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:30,830
How did you know I was here?

788
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:34,170
I'll tell you what happened before outside of the water.

789
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:35,780
So cold.

790
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,030
That was perfect timing.

791
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:40,150
Pull!

792
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,500
Get him.

793
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:52,840
He fell.

794
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,430
Thank you.

795
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:58,310
But what did this person do wrong?

796
00:59:58,310 --> 01:00:02,630
He's a deserter. You can report him to the military patrol.

797
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:04,570
A deserter?

798
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:10,860
You'll now go to military prison. And your time in the military just increased.

799
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:13,560
Congratulations, No Tae Nam.

800
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,050
No.

801
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:17,280
I'll leave him to you.

802
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:25,470
- My gosh.
- She's amazing.

803
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:27,880
No Tae Nam caught at the airport. Redhead looks like a pro amazing. Throwing shade on division commander mother.

804
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:28,950
No Tae Nam's history has been preserved. That kind of jerk's mom is a general? He went to the military to get a 'not guilty, to desert?

805
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:30,180
- Who is she? She's amazing.
- My gosh, I'm a fan now!

806
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:32,860
- Go to the military and grow up, No Tae Nam.
- Totally girl-crushing on her.

807
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:34,130
No Tae Nam arrested at the airport.

808
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:37,580
No Tae Nam deserts

809
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:41,430
Former Chairman of IM Defense No Tae Nam, who was pronounded not guilty at the military trial,

810
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:44,920
this time, while receiving training as a trainee, left the base

811
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,560
and was arrested red-handed at the airport.

812
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,560
Chairman No's attempt to escape...

813
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:53,410
the stock price which had increased a little, rapidly crashed.

814
01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:55,510
IM Defense's owner risk...

815
01:00:55,510 --> 01:00:59,640
Recently, our military has suffered some incidents

816
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:03,080
and the loss of the people's trust is coming to a critical head.

817
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,260
Did you get the text?

818
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:08,170
Loving officers and military family members...

819
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:10,620
- What's it?
- In this critical time...

820
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:14,710
With the great task I have been given today as the Ministry of Defense...

821
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:18,290
That responsibility, I have—

822
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:23,430
- He got caught.
- My gosh.

823
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:25,070
It's General No's son.

824
01:01:25,070 --> 01:01:27,880
What is that? What are you doing?

825
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,810
How can he desert?

826
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:35,900
- Starting today our military—
- What's going on?

827
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:37,630
Division Commander! Division Commander!

828
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:39,660
Division Commander!

829
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:42,280
Ma'am, please!

830
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:47,400
Give us a statement, please!

831
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:51,950
The past Chairman of IM Defense has been arrested as a deserter.

832
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:54,540
Judging from his arrest at the airport,

833
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:58,360
people are suspecting he had plans of escaping abroad.

834
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:02,680
The anger of civilians at the scene is erupting through social media.

835
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:06,710
Although Former Chairman No received a not guilty judgment,

836
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:10,510
many are focused on the allegation of deserting,

837
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:13,920
which the military prosecution will prosecute.

838
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:20,650
Do Bae Man

839
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:24,820
Yong Mun Gu

840
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:28,850
Did you receive my package?

841
01:02:28,850 --> 01:02:32,800
The salary is measly, but now I'll only accept compensation from the nation

842
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,410
like a genuine soldier.

843
01:02:35,410 --> 01:02:38,550
Therefore, I decline to renew the contract.

844
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:40,950
Unity.

845
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,160
Let go of me. Let go!

846
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,560
- Stay still.
- Let go!

847
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:02,640
I'm not going in there!

848
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:03,770
No.

849
01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:06,560
No! Let go!

850
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,550
I'm not going in!

851
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:10,680
Let go of me!

852
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:14,320
Hey, hey!

853
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:19,050
The person you should be directing your anger towards is not me, but No Tae Nam.

854
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:21,110
Hey, what is this.

855
01:03:21,110 --> 01:03:23,440
I'll give you money. Money. Hey, Hey!

856
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,390
Hey! Let me go!

857
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:27,730
Open this!

858
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:36,850
Working after hours?

859
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:39,240
I'll head out soon.

860
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:50,370
Good work arresting No Tae Nam. You were a trending search, too.

861
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:53,230
I didn't succeed alone.

862
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:55,750
You know how to be humble?

863
01:03:57,460 --> 01:04:03,640
You asked me why I chose you to be a part of my revenge plan.

864
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:10,640
In here, the justice we speak of in society doesn't exist.

865
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:17,250
To fight in the dirty mud, we willingly dirty ourselves

866
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:19,560
You little—!

867
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:24,380
For those who squirmed out of their previous sins, you make new ones they pay for.

868
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:29,310
Whenever the opportunity arises, he would make a break for it, regardless of the consequences.

869
01:04:29,310 --> 01:04:34,760
Even if I get caught, my mother will figure it out. That was probably his thought process as he struck out across the boundary.

870
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:39,860
To those from whom you want to get revenge, you toss out bait for them to latch onto.

871
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:45,460
You're so competent, I'm afraid you'll get me too.

872
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:48,860
♫ Oh everywhere, all this violence, ♫

873
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:52,940
You didn't want to face that kind of person as your opponent?

874
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:59,240
♫ I'll keep it up with no one by my side ♫

875
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:31,040
Military Prosecutor Doberman

876
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:34,860
♫ Feels like I'm losing control. My style without hesitation ♫

877
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:38,680
♫ No chance, you can't get away now ♫

878
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:43,660
♫ You can't find your way out. You are the prey in my hand ♫

879
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:45,820
Open the door.

880
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,250
We are starting the fabricated interrogation, right?

881
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:50,440
Are you having fun? Are you having fun when I play up to you?

882
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,120
Official rank and name!

883
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:54,400
Make No Tae Nam your dog.

884
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:58,290
He was the commander of the search party, Won Gi Chun. A person who puts up his life for justice by saving his subordinate from the minefield.

885
01:05:58,290 --> 01:06:04,010
But why is your first target the minefield hero? Is this something you planned, too?

886
01:06:04,010 --> 01:06:06,730
I am sure that he knows something.

887
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:11,310
One thing is certain. Do Bae Man has made you and me enemies.

888
01:06:11,310 --> 01:06:14,010
♫ You've gotta pay for that ♫

889
01:06:14,010 --> 01:06:17,790
♫ I'm not struggling hard any more. ♫

890
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:20,020
♫  I won't let you go ♫
