♫ and same like that before ♫

4

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,070
Military Prosecutor Doberman

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,550
The salary is measly, but now I'll only accept compensation

9
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,200
from the nation like a genuine soldier.

10
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,370
Therefore, I decline to renew the contract.

11
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,420
Unity

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,740
Do Bae Man, you son of a bitch.

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,500
What the hell! What? What?

14
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,590
This is the information of Military Prosecutor Cha Wu In that you instructed me to search for before.

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,600
Okay, dammit!

16
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:08,190
When should I schedule the ceremony for the inauguration of the chairman of IM Defense?

17
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,930
Cancel the inauguration ceremony. Because of Chairman No, the atmosphere around the group is lousy.

18
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,180
I'll just move directly into the chairman's office.

19
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,170
I understand.

20
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,530
What should I do about this?

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,800
Burn it all.

22
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,010
Episode 7
A soldier's salary deposited in the bank account is so little.

23
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,650
Don't you think it's a waste of your five years of effort on Yong Mun Gu and No Tae Nam?

24
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,860
Of course it's waste.

25
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,540
I think the money I gave up will show up in my dreams.

26
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,680
Oh. How did you know about this place?

27
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,080
Please answer my question first.

28
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,030
I mean, you know that just a month ago you said you would handcuff Prosecutor Cha Wu In. But now—

29
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,920
I handcuffed No Tae Nam

30
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,270
Yes. So what the heck is going on?

31
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,630
Prosecutor Cha and I are kindred souls.

32
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,560
Aren't we, with the same goal kindred souls?

33
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,910
You're saying Prosecutor Cha and Prosecutor Do are kindred souls.

34
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:16,980
I don't know how that happened, but for now my question was answered.

35
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,090
So Sang Gi, are you going to continue to stick with me?

36
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,460
Well, I have to.

37
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,670
Is it all right that I have no money at all now?

38
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,510
Did you think I was the Yun Sang Gi who only cares for money?

39
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,000
That's a little disappointing, though.

40
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,650
Punk!

41
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,900
Yes?

42
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,890
I caught No Tae Nam. Who is going to cook the prey?

43
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,810
The prosecutor will be here soon, so be quiet.

44
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,920
Hey, open the door. Hey, open up.

45
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,270
Let me out of here. Can't you hear me?

46
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,540
Hyeong, how long have you been in?

47
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,990
Are you the prosecutor in charge?

48
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,330
It's game over. Game over.

49
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,040
I'm sorry to be meeting you here.

50
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,610
I feel better now that my person is here. Please get me out quickly.

51
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:26,570
It hurts where I was shot.

52
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:29,110
I should go the hospital soon and get an MRI.

53
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:34,110
Oh my. Just finish writing your statement and I'll take you somewhere else.

54
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,970
- Must I do that?
- It's just a formality.

55
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,220
Please understand because I'm in the army.

56
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,140
Take a seat.

57
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,990
No Tae Nam's interrogation started.

58
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,850
Listen carefully.

59
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:58,620
It's a chance to observe whether Do Bae Man still has any remaining feelings toward No Tae Nam.

60
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,120
Do you still not trust him?

61
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,910
I still don't trust him 100%.

62
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,800
Coincidentally, amid the news of former Chairman No Tae Nam's arrest,

63
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,930
the inauguration ceremony for Defense Minister Lee Jae Sik was held today.

64
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,000
General No Hwa Yeong, known to be Mr. No's mother,

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,800
abruptly left the ceremony.

66
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,870
On the armed forces' biggest day, you appropriately fed them the biggest piece of candy, Cha Wu In.

67
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,780
There will be a rift in the relationship between No Hwa Yeong and Lee Jae Sik.

68
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,570
Minister.

69
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,860
This bitch!

70
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,300
I am sorry. I did it unconsciously.

71
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,750
You bitch!

72
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,290
- You... If you were a woman, I wouldn't have been able to hit you.
- I know.

73
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,170
You ruined the most respected position I've had in my 40-year military career.

74
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:57,450
Not anyone else, but you, No Hwa Yeong. I was humiliated because of your idiotic son

75
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,910
while all members of the armed forces and the entire nation were watching.

76
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:07,170
As his mother and his immediate superior, are you saying you couldn't stop him?

77
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:10,010
You also didn't know about his desertion?

78
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,990
Take care of this even if you have to cut down your own son.

79
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:19,060
I will make absolutely sure my son is never mentioned by people again.

80
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,700
I'll stake my uniform on that pledge.

81
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,680
What?

82
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,560
If he causes trouble again, I will immediately give up my position.

83
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,880
Let's go.

84
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,820
Where is Tae Nam right now?

85
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,020
He's being interrogated at the legal office.

86
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,910
I should have listened to you then.

87
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,980
If I hadn't joined the army, why would I be suffering this kind of situation?

88
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,580
When I came back, it makes me crazier.

89
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,190
Now, how did you get out of boot camp?

90
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:04,530
Hey. Because I'm meeting my Do Bae Man here like this, you are a real military prosecutor.

91
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:10,160
We are starting the fabricated interrogation, right? Right?

92
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,760
Just give the details of what happened, okay?

93
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,820
It's just a statement for formality, right?

94
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,700
I went to the restroom and saw a refrigerator truck outside the window.

95
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,080
I went inside it, wondering if there was something to eat.

96
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,760
It was a freezer container. It must have been super cold.

97
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,020
Huh? Right, right. It was so cold I lost consciousness.

98
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,850
When you opened your eyes, you were outside.

99
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,950
That's right. That's right.

100
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:39,420
Then, you didn't desert. You were misled.

101
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:45,120
Wow, you're good. It was exactly that.

102
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,920
Not deserting but being misled.

103
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:51,520
But... it's so stuffy here.

104
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,420
I have claustrophobia. I need to get out quickly.

105
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,330
Before we get to that, you didn't intend to desert,

106
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,830
but why were you going to depart the country on a private plane?

107
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,060
De-Depart?

108
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,660
That was, so that... because I was already out.

109
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:15,620
I mean, it's sort of a waste to go right back when I had been misled.

110
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,820
I was going to get some fresh air and then return immediately.

111
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,700
That's a bit of a poor excuse.

112
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,210
- Right?
- Yes.

113
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,490
Actually, that's the weakest part.

114
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,660
Could you just make up some details?

115
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,390
Let me take a break now.

116
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,590
Are you having fun?

117
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,600
Are you having fun when I play up to you?

118
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,900
Camera off

119
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,150
No Tae Nam.

120
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:20,460
No Tae Nam, you aren't answering, Punk!

121
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,460
What?

122
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,390
What are you doing now?

123
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,710
I am a three diamond captain. You still haven't earned a single bar for basic training
(T/N: referring to army insignia).

124
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,760
From now on, respect your superior and address him properly.

125
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,580
Are you crazy. What's wrong with you all of a sudden?

126
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,210
You know how a prosecutor is, don't you?

127
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,510
Depending on what he decides, he can either hide a situation or exaggerate it.

128
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:47,250
When such a person even put on a uniform, what do you think he would do?

129
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,220
You shyster bastard, how dare you strike me?

130
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,710
I said to show respect to your superior.

131
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,850
- Official rank and name.
- Hey. My mom commands your division.

132
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,080
Official rank and name!

133
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:09,030
Hey, this is a coercive interrogation— Recruit No Tae Nam.

134
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:17,800
- Don't you have a training identity?
- Thirty-three, no Trainee Number Thirteen, No Tae Nam.

135
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,990
Trainee 13 No Tae Nam. You will never get out of here.

136
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,940
Starting now, you will experience the military experience forever.

137
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,440
Camera on

138
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:47,340
Oh, oh, it's working now.

139
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,190
Why are you standing there? Where were we?

140
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,710
Ah. Because of the statement of the night watchman about right before the desertion,

141
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,760
the video of the CCTV installed in the kitchen,

142
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,430
the statement of the friend you saw during your desertion,

143
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:05,970
and the footage at the airport prove you were deserting.

144
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:09,990
Article 30 of the Military Service Act, the crime of leaving the military service, will be applied.

145
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:13,830
Crime of leaving the military...

146
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,900
Sign it.

147
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,610
Attorney Yong Mun Gu

148
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,950
What the hell happened?

149
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:40,110
Yes. I'm trying to figure out what happened. One thing is certain.

150
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,220
Do Bae Man has made you and me enemies.

151
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,320
What's important about Do Bae Man right now?

152
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,140
Don't you realize how low my prestige has fallen because of Tae Nam?

153
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,550
That it was also during the minister's inauguration?

154
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,730
Please give me a little time, General.

155
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,460
Unity.

156
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,990
Cha Wu In.

157
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,050
Unity.

158
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,420
Captain Cha Wu In

159
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:29,140
That righthand salute you just bumbled through; do you know why we do it?

160
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:33,070
In accordance with Article 5 of the Military Decree, it shows obedience to a superior.

161
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,590
Wrong.

162
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:38,140
During medieval times, armored horsemen

163
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,870
would lift their helmets to confirm their identities. That's how it began.

164
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,470
It means I am not your enemy.

165
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,460
Captain Cha Wu In, at ease.

166
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,540
Do it again.

167
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:06,950
In a battlefield with bullets flying, it is a sign of comrades fighting together.

168
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,620
Do you understand now?

169
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,780
Yes, Division Commander.

170
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:15,490
Both at ease. You are working hard late into the night.

171
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:20,410
There was a questioning until late because of Trainee No. 13 No Tae Nam's desertion.

172
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:23,530
- Who is the one who questioned him?
- I did.

173
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,250
Report the contents of the questioning.

174
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,550
Are you here as his mother or as the Division Commander?

175
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,520
Depending on your answer, I can give you my reply.

176
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,170
In your eyes do you not see my uniform and rank?

177
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,030
I apologize, Division Commander.

178
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:41,320
I received the complete testimony regarding the desertion.

179
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:45,640
Thoroughly discipline Trainee No Tae Nam according to the rules.

180
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,770
As long as I am here, no one under any circumstance can be an exception.

181
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:55,520
I came to say this as your direct superior.

182
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,440
Understood?

183
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,270
Yes, understood.

184
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,560
Yeah.

185
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,220
Even if you don't open it

186
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,100
I will leave soon.

187
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,810
Let's see you outside, you bastards.

188
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,560
The bastard named No Tae Nam with the money borrowed from your father's bank

189
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,790
didn't want to pay it back, so he created that whole incident.

190
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,650
What?

191
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,900
You want me to believe it?

192
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:43,420
I'm the one who took out my sword, but it was No Tae Nam who put the sword in my hands.

193
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:47,380
What's the reason you're telling me this now? Huh?

194
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,390
For the ceasefire between you and me.

195
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,070
And

196
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,210
a solid motivator for your remaining time in the military?

197
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:00,200
Make No Tae Nam your dog.

198
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,490
Personnel Report

199
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:10,150
Father: IM Defense Ex-Chairman, Cha Ho Cheol
Mother: Jang Eun Ah

200
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,680
Died in Car Crash (2015)
Died of disease (1998)

201
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,340
Cha Wu In.

202
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,560
Daughter of Chairman Cha Ho Cheol.

203
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,920
2015

204
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,710
Police

205
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,890
- Have you come, Prosecutor?
- Yes, I'll confirm the scene.

206
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,020
Yes, please do.

207
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,140
Detective

208
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,140
Yes, I've arrived.

209
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,150
Chairman Cha died on the scene.

210
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:59,120
- There was a passenger with him.
- Passenger?

211
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,000
- Who is it?
- It was his daughter.

212
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,290
They say she had come back from the United States three days ago.

213
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:06,040
Did she also die with him?

214
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,180
She is unconscious.

215
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,710
Looking at the scene, it looks like there isn't any chance.

216
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,680
General?

217
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,020
Present

218
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,840
How funny

219
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,860
that on the lips of someone who wielded a sword mercilessly on the innocent when he was a prosecutor

220
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,520
comes the word, justice.

221
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,740
Cha Ho Cheol's daughter whom I presumed dead

222
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,710
became a military prosecutor.

223
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,990
She constantly entangled herself in Chairman No Tae Nam's affairs.

224
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,270
No Tae Nam desertion

225
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,930
If the coincidences are brimming over everywhere,

226
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:11,370
it is no longer a coincidence.

227
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,600
Customer 34's NY Steak Burger is ready.

228
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,950
Lady, your steak burger is out.

229
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:25,290
- Have a good meal.
- See you again.

230
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,750
Next cust—

231
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:35,080
How is work? Is it worth doing?

232
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,470
The CEO is really good to me and it's really great.

233
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:43,480
I was really in agony because of No Tae Nam's trial

234
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,870
but Allen got punished.

235
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:50,630
Now that I don't ever have to see them again,

236
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,760
that has allowed me to go on.

237
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,480
Se Na,

238
00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:01,280
remember that I said when it was time, I'd tell you everything?

239
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:10,250
- I...
- am the red-headed lady who caught No Tae Nam at the airport and disappeared.

240
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,500
That's your side character, isn't it?

241
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,560
It was me.

242
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,090
My thoughts were correct.

243
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:26,020
I was curious how the video ended up in your hands, Eonni,

244
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,670
but now I know.

245
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:32,330
There are many things I'd want to ask you, but I'll hold it in.

246
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:35,200
The fight that you're fighting right now, Eonni,

247
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,530
I know you're someone who won't give it up until the very end.

248
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,970
I also started a struggle with my own self.

249
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:49,510
I won't be held back and miserable about the past any longer.

250
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,980
Okay.

251
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,400
Let's both overcome.

252
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,650
DMZ Minefield Explosion Incident

253
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,420
Report the current situation!

254
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,380
I can't confirm the company commander. I think he stepped on a landmine.

255
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,810
Defend your positions.

256
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,700
Captain Gu Won Seok, ask backup from the battalion.

257
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:48,420
Pay attention! Your hand has two lives at risk.

258
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,330
Look.

259
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,650
- I will go rescue the commander.
- It's a minefield there.

260
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,390
What do you mean?! My subordinate is there!

261
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:01,220
I can go there even with my eyes closed through this minefield.

262
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,520
You all don't move.

263
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,230
This

264
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,090
is a command.

265
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:13,210
Battalion Commander!

266
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:24,190
Battalion Commander!

267
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,210
Battalion Commander?

268
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,880
Battalion Commander!

269
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,820
Are you okay?

270
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,840
Battalion Commander.

271
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:50,210
A person who puts up his life for justice by saving his subordinate from the minefield, the Landmine Hero.

272
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:53,040
He was the commander of the search party, Won Gi Chun.

273
00:19:54,890 --> 00:20:00,350
He lost his leg in exchange for being a hero and has a wooden leg.

274
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,870
But why is your first target the Landmine Hero?

275
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:07,840
Six years ago, there are two who did the most in destroying my father's company.

276
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,250
Yong Mun Gu and Won Gi Chun.

277
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:15,290
As a prize, Yong Mun Gu got Law & One and Won Gi Chun

278
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,230
entered the Patriotic Society as its most junior member.

279
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:21,360
What role did Won Gi Chun have in relation to IM Defense?

280
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,130
Hae Dong Daily

281
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:30,270
I would like to expose the leaking of military secrets by IM Defense Chairman Cha Ho Cheol.

282
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:34,400
In return for exchanging the highest classified military information

283
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,000
between China's military industry and IM Defense Chairman Cha Ho Cheol,

284
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,760
tens of billions of KRW of embezzlement occurred. I have the evidence here.

285
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,090
[Report]
- This all occurred under the guidance of Chairman Cha Ho Cheol.

286
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:53,470
Leaking of military secrets is a serious treasonous crime that sells out the country.

287
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:57,860
Even if Chairman Cha Ho Cheol were severely punished as a warning to others, it would be not enough.

288
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,240
Just Stay Alive, I am going.

289
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:05,120
You probably remember that at the DMZ during a patrol mission, a mine exploded.

290
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,680
In that time he staked his life to save his subordinate

291
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,510
and lost his leg. He is a soldier we are all proud of.

292
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,550
He was the commander of the search party, Won Gi Chun, Landmine Hero.

293
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:17,820
The autobiography contains what happened during the accident and about his life after.

294
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,400
Stay Alive, I'm Coming book signing

295
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,460
is being launched across bookstores nationwide among great enthusiasm and support.

296
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,390
Can I have a photo with you?

297
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,700
Shall we?

298
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,810
Thank you.

299
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,670
Everyone who wants a picture, please come to the front.

300
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,650
Yes.

301
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,740
There, look at your mom.

302
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:47,940
Six years ago he was a whistleblowing hero

303
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,410
- and now he's a Landmine Hero?
- Thank you.

304
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:57,220
That human is not one with character enough to go into a minefield for his subordinate,

305
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:02,680
because he made fake evidence to corner and push my father off a cliff.

306
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,490
Your face is one to want to shoot him right now.

307
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:10,020
I am thankful for the people's concern and love.

308
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,640
Is this something you planned, too?

309
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,950
Answer me.

310
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,880
No.

311
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:03,240
I'll give you the report on the shooting of Won Gi Chun, Division Commander.

312
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,590
The culprit who fired is one of my soldiers?

313
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:11,340
According to the results of the military police's investigation, 4th Division's Lee Han Yong. No...

314
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,510
Kim Han Yeong has been revealed as the culprit.

315
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,000
What's his motive?

316
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,330
It has yet to be revealed through our investigation,

317
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,890
so the culprit is currently being transferred to the law office.

318
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:24,660
But we've learned quite a shocking truth.

319
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:30,440
I'm troubled by how to process this information.

320
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,450
In the process of conducting Kim Ham Yeong's background check...

321
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:39,850
The identity of the person who shot at the Landmine Hero this morning is shocking many.

322
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:43,960
It has been revealed that Soldier Kim is the brother of the soldier

323
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,710
Landmine Hero Won Gi Chun risked his life to save.

324
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:50,430
And they've just arrived, as we speak.

325
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,500
What's the reason for your actions?

326
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,220
What was your motive?

327
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:57,000
How did you sneak the gun out?

328
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:03,650
Shooting of Battalion Commander Won Gi Chun

329
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:08,350
Corporal Kim Han Yong was in charge of guns and ammunition at the 4th Division.

330
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:29,220
He fabricated documents after he completed his inspection.

331
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:35,210
He stole the model K5 gun and bullets that were used in the crime.

332
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,460
Pass

333
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:42,290
Unity.

334
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:47,180
As soon as he left the premises, he went straight to the bookstore, which was the location of the crime.

335
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:50,630
It seems he prepared for his actions in the bathroom.

336
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,030
He used blank bullets, didn't he?

337
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:10,940
How did you know? We were just about to give that in our report.

338
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:15,040
Blank bullets have no deadly projectile, so the rebound is smaller when pulling the trigger.

339
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,540
They sound different too.

340
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,850
If a real bullet goes "bang,"

341
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,090
then a blank sounds like "thunk."

342
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:25,520
Is that possible to differentiate through CCTV footage?

343
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,500
It's almost as if you were on the scene when it happened.

344
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,380
Shouldn't you know how sharp I am by now?

345
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:37,060
If it was a blank bullet, it means he had no murderous intent.

346
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,210
Not necessarily.

347
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,490
It's not possible to kill someone with a blank bullet.

348
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:46,150
What if he had planned to use real bullets but accidentally reloaded using blank ones?

349
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:02,400
Corporal Kim Han Yong is an ammunition soldier. He can easily tell them apart.

350
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,760
In this case, he stole the gun with the purpose to kill someone though.

351
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,910
This is real life.

352
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:10,260
Kim Han Yong had real bullets with him at the time of the crime, correct?

353
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:14,880
Yes. Eight real bullets were found in his pockets.
Evidence Item 2

354
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,700
As expected, a clear intent to kill.

355
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:23,540
It was a blank shot but he had real bullets on him, so this has to be viewed as attempted murder.

356
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,250
Indict him for attempted murder.

357
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:31,200
Even if he carried real bullets, if he intentionally used the blank ones, that cannot be attempted murder.

358
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:36,180
We'll think more about that point.

359
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,940
That isn't the focus of this case anyhow.

360
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:42,600
Exactly. The focus is what his motive was.

361
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,910
Why did he point a gun towards someone who saved the life of his brother?

362
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,990
So you're saying that he's not a part of your revenge, right?

363
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,530
I'll carry out my revenge with my own hands.

364
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:03,100
Things have only gotten more complicated, thanks to Kim Han Yong.

365
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:08,590
I would say so if I did it.

366
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:14,040
They told you to go ahead since they're running late.

367
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,790
Goodness, he's the same as ever.

368
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,520
Is it someone you know?

369
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,950
He was my senior at the law corps. He's probably late from playing golf.

370
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:26,820
- Anyway, let's get him to talk.
- Yes, Sir.

371
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,010
Have a seat.

372
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,950
Kim Han Yong.

373
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:36,260
Military Criminal Act Article 53. Plotting and murdering your superior.

374
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:41,950
Though you have a right to remain silent, use it well. You're in a very serious situation.

375
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,530
You shot at a battalion commander.

376
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:53,690
Since the victim is your superior, your punishment will be even greater. Why did you shoot?

377
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:00,040
On top of that, doing something like that to a benefactor who saved your brother's life?

378
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,340
What a scumbag.

379
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,010
Why? Did I touch a nerve?

380
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:09,100
Which part? Saying scumbag?

381
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:12,520
Or... benefactor?

382
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:18,940
I'm just angry I wasn't able to blow that bastard's head off.

383
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,580
Sure.

384
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,560
You could've killed him.

385
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,270
You had enough bullets, too.

386
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:31,160
What? Were you afraid of the opportunity once you got it?

387
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:37,860
See? He's a scumbag and a total wimp.

388
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,980
You think I don't know your tricks?

389
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:46,240
You're trying to get a reaction out of me and use my words to write up the story you want. Am I wrong?

390
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,360
I will never trust military officers like you.

391
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,940
You're also military personnel, and so is your hospitalized brother.

392
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:01,140
Don't you dare speak of my poor brother!

393
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,340
One thing's for certain.

394
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,770
You shot for your brother.

395
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:11,940
People think the Landmine Hero saved your brother but you disagree.

396
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:16,140
But you have a reason you can't share with us.

397
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:20,350
Not only do you not trust military personnel like us

398
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:23,150
but also you loathe us.

399
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:32,910
You found out some crucial information. The fact that he has something against the Landmine Hero.

400
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:36,480
You take charge of this case. I'll support you in my own way .

401
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,350
I understand.

402
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,970
Already over?

403
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:45,240
I came here for nothing. You still haven't left the military?

404
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,200
No, things ended up that way.

405
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,620
Oh, you're in charge of this case?

406
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,470
Don't you think you're lacking sincerity?

407
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:56,430
Even if you're a military prosecutor,.

408
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:59,370
you wouldn't want to defend someone who shot the Landmine Hero.

409
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:01,900
I'm being forced to do this since it's my job.

410
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,920
It was a blank bullet.

411
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,050
I guess you haven't even read the reports.

412
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,950
Do you know the name of the soldier you're defending?

413
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:16,760
That little bast—

414
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,100
What good would knowing his name do?

415
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,770
If you act this way, who is the soldier supposed to trust?

416
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:26,450
He already can't trust military personnel as it is.

417
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,360
I mean, whose side are you on right now?

418
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,990
Why don't you be a lawyer in my place then, instead of a prosecutor?

419
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:38,510
Aren't I right, Bae Man?

420
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:43,440
If you don't do your job properly in court, I'll raise an issue.

421
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:53,610
What a total jerk. How dare she tell me what to do?

422
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,560
Is she your junior?

423
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,220
Yes. She hasn't been here long. Please forgive her attitude.

424
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:03,750
What about you? You're going to just watch as your successor talks down to your superior?

425
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:07,650
Sometimes successors teach things to their predecessor.

426
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:10,810
What? Are you directing that towards me?

427
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:13,660
I'm talking about myself.

428
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,000
I'll see you in court.

429
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,330
Unity.

430
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:35,270
Why do you think Corporal Kim Han Yong shot you?

431
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:39,720
Probably because he's family.

432
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:46,130
He probably wanted to let his anger out somehow, watching his half-dead brother.

433
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:52,130
And I became the target of it. It's all my fault.

434
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:57,520
If only I had brought his brother safely out of the minefield.

435
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,930
I'd like to respectfully ask you a question.

436
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:03,600
You have to live with a disability your entire life.

437
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,860
Do you ever regret going into the minefield?

438
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:11,070
Regret? I regret it with all my heart.

439
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:14,130
I regret I couldn't complete my mission.

440
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:20,650
However, I do not regret entering the land mine.

441
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:25,370
Let's take a break.

442
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,940
Thank you so much for making time today.

443
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:34,660
Thank you for your work.

444
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,330
- Thank you.
- Get well soon!

445
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,510
Yes, please recover soon!

446
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:40,580
Thank you. Get home safely.

447
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,360
Thank you.

448
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:53,560
As you know, Military Prosecutor...

449
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:59,570
As you know, this case is garnering lots of interest from the nation.

450
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:03,960
As much as the citizens are interested in this case, we'll be sure to investigate it thoroughly.

451
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,940
Sure thing.

452
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:10,250
But why did he shoot me?

453
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,730
Did you find out his motive?

454
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:14,830
Why do you think he shot you?

455
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,580
What you really think, not what you said to the press.

456
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,920
How would I know?

457
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,740
I saved his brother. He's a bastard who bit the hand that fed him.

458
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,930
Could you write an appeal for clemency?

459
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,590
An appeal for clemency?

460
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:33,370
If you would write an appeal for clemency, it would be considered.

461
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,560
Do you see the state of my leg? Yet you're asking for mercy?

462
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,580
On top of it as a military prosecutor?

463
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:42,180
Whether he shot a real bullet or a blank, he shot at his superior!

464
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:45,280
This is treason of the highest form!

465
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:50,450
Even if he were severely punished as a warning to others, it would be not enough! Understand?

466
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:54,890
Leaking of military secrets is a serious treasonous crime that sells out the country.

467
00:33:54,890 --> 00:34:00,050
Even if Chairman Cha Ho Cheol was severely punished as a warning to others, it would be not enough.

468
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:02,580
No need to worry.

469
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:07,680
As you wish, I'll be sure

470
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,580
to make this incident a clear example.

471
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,180
Good.

472
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:15,030
I'll see you in court.

473
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:17,460
Sure. Work hard.

474
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,170
Excuse me.

475
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:43,090
How is he doing?

476
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:46,640
It's not life threatening because life saving measures were rapidly done.

477
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:50,240
The CT scan showed there is a piece of shrapnel in his brain

478
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,230
but we haven't removed it yet.

479
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:55,210
We didn't want to risk complications that could arise from the removal.

480
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,730
He's lucky he's alive.

481
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:09,770
Is this really lucky?

482
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,550
They had a great relationship, the brothers.

483
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:21,970
After their parents died when they were young, he was a father-like brother and his only family.

484
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:25,310
Keeping familiar objects nearby

485
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:28,020
is a way to handle loss.

486
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:34,120
Even though they restrain his arms and legs, he keeps trying to escape.

487
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,130
I don't think he avoided brain damage.

488
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:40,150
He couldn't recognize people, but kept saying he needed to go somewhere.

489
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:43,700
It's not feasible for him to return to a normal lifestyle.

490
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,130
I'm not defending Kim Han Yong's actions,

491
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:06,300
but I think I'd also lose it if a family member became like this in a day.

492
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:14,420
Why didn't you report to me the division commander's visit to the law department?

493
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,640
Because I knew you'd react this way.

494
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,620
She just came for morale. There's no need for concern.

495
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,730
It's good for morale, right?

496
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:26,250
You didn't do anything that would upset her, did you?

497
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,460
No, well, not as far as I know.

498
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:31,720
Goodness, why was she here?

499
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,420
She told be to be strict about No Tae Nam's discipline.

500
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,860
Strict?

501
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,820
Strict toward her son?

502
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,510
Woah, she's really something.

503
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:44,470
What a scary woman, I mean, mother.

504
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:47,960
The General and Cha Wu In—women in the military are the most strict.

505
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,100
They show absolutely no mercy.

506
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:55,960
Who would've thought I'd be serving in the military sandwiched in between these two women.

507
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,620
On top of that, there's the one who shot the Landmine Hero.

508
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:04,730
I can never catch a break around here.

509
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:08,690
Goodness, you've gotten started on this again.

510
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,070
Unity.

511
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,610
At ease.

512
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:20,870
There is a list of corrupt defense contractors that were not handled during my predecessor's command.

513
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:23,990
Complain about the civilians to the civilian investigative agencies.

514
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:29,090
And investigate the military, stringently applying the law, and make them resign or prosecute them.

515
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,650
I'll be closely observing your ability, Legal Division Chief.

516
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:37,600
I will do my best in mind of cutting out the rotten flesh.

517
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:41,410
- And also, Do Bae Man.
- Captain Do Bae Man.

518
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:44,990
You and I have somewhere to go. Follow me.

519
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:54,590
Myeongsae Construction Company

520
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:03,200
Myeongse Construction
Urban District Design

521
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:06,500
Could I know what we're here for?

522
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:11,160
Myeongse Hotel

523
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,160
I'm sure you've already heard the statement from the 4th Division Law Office.

524
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,250
How can this be?

525
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:29,840
We made all the residents move out and the only thing left is digging the land.

526
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,200
Why are you suddenly canceling the plans to build the hotel?

527
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,790
The city has already approved the proposed project.

528
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:42,790
Everything was already approved by the prior division commander.

529
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:45,390
You're saying you want to overturn all of that now?

530
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:48,620
I found it quite strange that the conditions of the agreement

531
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:52,280
were never recorded in a contract or any type of writing.

532
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:57,120
- Captain Do Bae Man.
- Captain Do Bae Man.

533
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,720
As a military prosecutor, please clearly explain the legal issue

534
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,920
of a plan to build a hotel in the vicinity of a military site.

535
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:09,920
Under Article 13 of the Military Base and Military Facilities Protection Act,

536
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,110
no building may be constructed or renovated

537
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:16,660
without prior consultation with the Ministry of Defense and the division commander with jurisdiction over the region.

538
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:19,220
Moreover, if five 172 m high-rise hotels are built

539
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:22,210
in the vicinity of the anti-communist fort,

540
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:27,820
which is the center of defense for the outskirts of Seoul,

541
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:32,950
the anti-aircraft brigade would be completely surrounded, rendering it useless.

542
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:38,020
You know better than I do that construction laws are not enacted in a day or two,

543
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:41,080
however, there are two things that cannot be defeated by development projects.

544
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,190
Culturally significant sites and military sites.

545
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:47,320
The law does not excuse those who claim they didn't know any better.

546
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,540
Though, I doubt you truly didn't know.

547
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:54,730
After all your hard work, don't have it torn down by the receipt of a government injunction.

548
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:59,200
Even if it is now, it would be better to have the project reviewed from the ground up.

549
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,370
Do you understand what our military prosecutor is saying?

550
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:09,310
As long as I am here, the 4th Division Law Office will not change our stance.

551
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,760
Commander!

552
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:19,850
If you act up, things will become difficult for you.

553
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,590
Can you handle it?

554
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:29,220
Are you threatening me in front of a military prosecutor?

555
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,830
I apologize, ma'am.

556
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:46,310
Ah, this is complicated.

557
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:49,390
When am I to get through all of this?

558
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,090
Unity.

559
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,640
Unity.

560
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,860
- Cha Wu In.
- Yes sir.

561
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,630
- Let me see your hands.
- Excuse me?

562
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:14,970
Recently, I hear there are female military personnel who not only use makeup,

563
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:18,240
but get their nails done!

564
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,160
Show me your hands.

565
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:28,690
Look at this! Look. The nail art is flesh colored.

566
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,520
Oh, I guess not.

567
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,200
Well, you dodged the bullet this time.

568
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,640
You're lucky.

569
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,880
Chief. Do you still view me as a female soldier?

570
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,540
I am working diligently in my role as an officer and performing well as a military prosecutor.

571
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:52,350
I believe it's unjust to be receiving this sort of treatment my male colleagues do not receive, despite my performance.

572
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:56,700
Why must you always try to prove female officers are different than male officers?

573
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:01,120
That's all just because, you know!

574
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:05,200
I... It's not because... Unjust... well.

575
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,920
It's, you see, not to discriminate against women,

576
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:13,370
and perhaps men will also get their nails done, and—

577
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:18,320
Goodness, women are truly scary.

578
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,920
This is why I won't get married!

579
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,330
Why do I have so much work?

580
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:25,340
All alone.

581
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:32,360
I didn't say anything about it in advance. But you did pretty well, Captain Do Bae Man.

582
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:38,120
Will you reverse everything the prior commander did?

583
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:43,250
Do I look like I just came to wash the dirty dishes left by my predecessor?

584
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:46,710
That's not what I meant.

585
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:49,430
They aren't thinking about a possible war.

586
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,800
So the airport would have to change its runway

587
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:57,090
because there will be a 100 story building constructed.

588
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:02,510
What's going on in the search commander's trial?

589
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:06,960
Cha Wu In is investigating the reason why Kim Han Yong resorted to the use of a gun.

590
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,790
The reason?

591
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:12,990
In order to determine his punishment, we must know the reason behind his actions.

592
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:17,170
The military prosecutor is taking the side of the perpetrator to understand the facts of this case?

593
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:21,190
The prosecutor does not take the side of anyone, regardless of superiority and relations to those in the case.

594
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:24,720
The facts of this case are simply that a soldier shot at his superior.

595
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:29,520
The biggest crime to be committed within the military is one that disregards the ranking of the officers.

596
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,340
Such actions cannot be justified by any means in my division.

597
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:34,710
But you're seeking the reason behind those actions?

598
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:40,520
Was the reason you brought me along with you to set the guidelines under which I should investigate?

599
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,620
Watch what you say, Captain Do Bae Man.

600
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,630
It's true that Kim Han Yong disregarded rank in his action,

601
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:47,110
but I am telling you now that the military prosecutors

602
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:50,610
deem revealing the truth behind this case to be of utmost importance.

603
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:55,430
I'll be watching very carefully how you choose to proceed.

604
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:02,800
Hotel construction plan fails due to military opposition!

605
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:15,380
How dare you come here?

606
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:19,350
Sorry, Minister. I didn't contact you in advance.

607
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:24,270
This. It was your doing, Hwa Yeong?

608
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:26,120
I know that some money went to you

609
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:29,530
through the previous division commander too.

610
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:32,500
Which is why I cut it off.

611
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,810
Cut it off?

612
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:36,650
What peculiar word choice.

613
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:39,540
The bullet that got you the position of minister

614
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:43,740
will shoot through your heart in the end.

615
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,830
What did you say?

616
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:48,910
You little punk! Are you planning to step over me now?

617
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:53,070
I thought about how I could make it up to you regarding the issue with my son.

618
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:55,550
It's a decision I made after much deliberation.

619
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:57,770
I will do everything in my power and ability

620
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:01,830
and become your shield, Minister.

621
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,960
So you're saying, you'll block whatever comes my way,

622
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,290
and jump into the water for me, like a dog?

623
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,560
From now onwards, at the 4th Division,

624
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:21,220
you'll hear news report after news report about the arrest of those who were involved military corruption.

625
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:24,990
You will be the one to unleash

626
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:28,050
unprecedented discipline in the military.

627
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:34,450
I wasn't afraid of anything while living as a soldier.

628
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:37,280
But now that I'm in politics,

629
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,260
I don't know who's out to get me now, just like you mentioned.

630
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:43,120
It scares me.

631
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:47,580
I will protect you.

632
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:53,880
Up until now, I have been walking on the path that you laid out for me.

633
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,670
Now...

634
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:59,550
I am going to lay out a path for you, Minister.

635
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:16,740
I never leave my men behind.

636
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:19,510
You know, right?

637
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:34,570
Won Gi Chun. He doesn't even act like a soldier,

638
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:38,320
but he's about to be awarded a medal before me at this rate.

639
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:42,680
Even politicians are eagerly waiting for him to be discharged.

640
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,850
What a complete joke.

641
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:50,020
I will tell him. He'll be very happy.

642
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:52,690
That punk is one to use his subordinates as a human shield

643
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:55,450
if a war ever breaks out.

644
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:59,820
I can't believe a guy like that went into the minefield to save his men.

645
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:03,250
Even a dog who crosses him will laugh.

646
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:07,420
You never know what to expect in life.

647
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:22,300
I never leave my men behind.

648
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,500
You know, right?

649
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:29,440
It's not like he can leave the same person behind again.

650
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:48,120
- Unity.
- Unity.

651
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,700
What's the matter? Division Commander wants to see you.

652
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,480
He must have found something.

653
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:09,950
Yes? Who are you asking?

654
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:14,810
Kim Han Yong. The punk who shot at you.

655
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,510
I don't know how he found out,

656
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:20,280
I am sure that he knows something.

657
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,970
Th-That punk...

658
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,090
What are you saying he found out?

659
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:35,800
Have you taken your hero act so seriously that you forgot everything?

660
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:43,820
The fact that you shot his brother with a gun, you stupid idiot!

661
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,080
The trial is going to start soon.

662
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:57,900
The day the truth comes out, your hero story will come to an end.

663
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,080
Save me, Division Commander.

664
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,560
You'll be dying in my hand.

665
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,830
I'll do as you order. I'll do anything.

666
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:07,050
Whatever it is, I'll do it.

667
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:09,430
That's right.

668
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:12,760
You have to do everything.

669
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,650
CEO Yong Mun Gu

670
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:51,080
2015

671
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:57,370
Investigators are on their way here.

672
00:49:57,370 --> 00:50:02,300
You should go out first so you don't embarrass yourself in front of your employees.

673
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,850
I'll give you that much.

674
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:08,910
Lawyer Yong Mun Gu.

675
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:12,300
I didn't commit any of those actions that you charged me with.

676
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,750
What is the reason that you are doing like that to me?!

677
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:16,510
My daughter...

678
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:22,740
I'm asking, what is it that you'll gain from destroying my company?

679
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:28,420
This... is this all No Hwa Yeong's doing?

680
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:35,540
Take him out through the back door.

681
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:38,380
Cha Ho Cheol, let's go.

682
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:10,180
CEO Yong Mun Gu

683
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:38,930
After Cha Ho Cheol and No Tae Nam, I'm the third owner of this room.

684
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:42,050
I may be nothing but a puppet now,

685
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:44,380
but soon enough...

686
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:47,870
IM Defense will fall into my hands.

687
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,990
I'm asking, what is it that you'll gain from destroying my company?

688
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:07,770
This... is this all No Hwa Yeong's doing?

You don't know when I'm going to go for it.

696

Wow. My dad is really different from other dads.

697

00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,420
Anyway, the means of fighting are the same.

705
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,720

I want to show you something.

712
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:30,980
Did you fish up something good or something?

713
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:34,530
It's something big enough to break the fishing rod.

714
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:39,380
I cannot stay like that if I'm curious, you know that, right? Come to my office now.

715
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:40,800
Okay.

716
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,710
Cha Wu In, are you crazy?

717
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:47,620
The prosecutor hid a camera?

718
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:51,550
I became that target.

719
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,100
It's all my fault.

720
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,750
I get that you're out for revenge, but still.

721
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:02,640
For now, watch it and you'll know.

722
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,050
Why would I watch illegal evidence that can't even be used in court?

723
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:08,940
You got me all excited for nothing.

724
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:12,850
Then don't watch it. Anyway, I'm in charge of this trial.

725
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:19,380
If you keep this habit going and you'll get in big trouble one day.

726
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,380
My god... this is...

727
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,790
This video is before discharge from the hospital.

728
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:39,880
He has been acting from the beginning to now.

729
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,470
Bring in Battalion Commander Won Gi Chun immediately and we'll reinvestigate the minefield case.

730
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:48,050
- We cannot.
- Why not?

731
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:51,440
If we bring him in now, he'll prepare for it.

732
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,570
I'm going to strike him good

733
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:57,210
while he's still knee-deep in his hero act.

734
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:01,440
It was strong evidence to break the story of the self-made hero.

735
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,400
His injury-free leg will do the job.

736
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,980
Court In Session

737
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:09,950
Trial One: Incident of Gun Shooting At Search Party Commander Won Gi Chun

738
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:17,390
I will show the demise of a phony hero in everyone's presence.

739
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:20,220
Defendant / Defense Counsel

740
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:25,330
Witness

741
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:32,240
Do Bae Man

742
00:55:34,610 --> 00:55:36,400
It's just me, Do Bae Man.

743
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,390
Yes, where are you? Aren't you coming to the trial?

744
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:43,760
Do you now know you are incompetent and aren't interested in this trial?

745
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,220
What? Do you want to die? Come right now.

746
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:52,590
I'll send you some pictures before I die. Take a look and let's talk.

747
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:05,080
Defense Counsel

748
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:09,190
Even during Kim Han Yeong's interrogation, you were on the golf course and arrived late, weren't you?

749
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:12,660
How many times have you skipped a trial and played golf?

750
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:16,540
Well, you undeservedly received the extra pay for legal activity as though you were eating the law.

751
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:20,860
Do you remember that it was my work in the Gusan Bank president's son's imperial treatment case?

752
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:24,550
I'm thinking about preparing a case of an imperial military lawyer for episode 2.

753
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:26,770
Should I do it or not?

754
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:30,260
You... what do you want from me?

755
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:33,440
Oh, you caught on right away.

756
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:38,580
Listen to me starting now. Give your final statement without changing a single punctuation mark.

757
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:42,070
- What?
- Be my avatar in court.

758
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:45,190
I'll make you a star lawyer.

759
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:52,020
There are wireless earphones under your desk. Let's pair them.

760
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:57,650
Defense counsel. How long are you going to be on the phone?

761
00:56:57,650 --> 00:56:59,760
Aren't you going to put on a defense?

762
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,610
I will.

763
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:13,860
The witness was the rescuer of Corporal Kim Han Yeong, the defendant's older brother,

764
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:16,500
in other words, the commander of the search squad.

765
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,780
The witness was the rescuer of Corporal Kim Han Yeong, the defendant's older brother,

766
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:22,040
in other words, the commander of the search squad.

767
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:25,200
However, the hero's story is different from the truth.

768
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:28,300
Your Honors, that is irrelevant.

769
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:32,100
There is an important reason to know the accused Kim Han Yong's motive.

770
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:37,100
We see the same kind of stories coming out of some tabloid. They are groundless.

771
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:39,590
Witness, please be quiet.

772
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,860
What do you think, Prosecutor?

773
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:49,690
I won't answer questions framed like a novel from an attorney.

774
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:55,860
Oh. Strangely enough, I am an attorney. It's getting more and more suspicious.

775
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:57,400
What do you mean?

776
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:00,980
It's an important trial receiving the public's attention

777
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:05,390
It's an important trial receiving the public's attention

778
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:09,070
as the defendant is accused of shooting the commander of the search party.

779
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:14,120
The doubts about the Landmine Hero should also be clarified, Your Honors.

780
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:18,970
Are you now insulting the witness who actually sacrificed himself?

781
00:58:21,390 --> 00:58:23,500
During the prosecution's investigation and during the trial,

782
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:27,130
if evidence is discovered that is favorable to the defendant,

783
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,450
During the prosecution's investigation and during the trial,

784
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:33,200
if evidence that is favorable to the defendant is discovered,

785
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,700
it must be submitted to the court to benefit the defendant.

786
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:40,780
Supreme Court Case Precedent 20018-23447.

787
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:44,900
May I add something else?

788
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:47,500
A military prosecutor is neither a person who punishes

789
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:50,350
nor is the prosecutor a person who protects or defends anyone.

790
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:55,880
As a guardian of military and the country's laws the prosecutor reveals the truth.

791
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:05,190
While you were preparing for trial,

792
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:08,420
did you also investigate the search squad commander?

793
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,330
Of course.

794
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:16,310
When a judge sees an honest soldier, I think the army becomes strong.

795
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:19,750
What do you think, Military Prosecutor?

796
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:23,220
I agree. Then...

797
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:27,360
Let me tell you the part that I found out.

798
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,880
All right.

799
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:39,020
Starting now, it's your solo performance, Cha Wu In.

800
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:41,320
Weather report for November 15.

801
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,990
It was foggy day on the day of the landmine accident

802
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:46,400
so it wasn't a good day for a search.

803
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,670
However search party commander Won Gi Chun pushed ahead with the decision.

804
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:54,090
Hey, lady Military Prosecutor,

805
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:57,030
a battle comes suddenly.

806
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:59,850
Because it is raining or foggy, does a battle not happen?

807
00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:04,820
If you don't know the strategic environment of the DMZ, you should be quiet.

808
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:08,500
That's what you say but according to your service record,

809
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:12,090
not once did you ever conduct a search on a bad weather day.

810
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:15,230
Let me show the evidence.

811
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:18,520
CLASSIFIED
Search and reconnaissance log

812
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:22,800
It's true.

813
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,900
The relevant area is a region which is often foggy.

814
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:28,820
When the fog rolls in, it is difficult to secure clear vision.

815
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:31,910
It's hard to tell whether that soldier in front of you

816
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:35,200
is your friend, foe, or an elk.

817
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:39,790
Because friendly fire might injure the wrong person, it becomes an even bigger problem,

818
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:42,820
you don't do search and reconnaissance patrol at all.

819
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:45,970
Are you still going to use that battle excuse?

820
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:51,410
That day was no exception! What was the reason for the search?

821
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:56,800
There was no special reason.

822
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:04,500
The second question is why did you go to the minefield?

823
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:07,420
This is joint report by four army corps.

824
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:09,040
It is estimated

825
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,700
that during the Korean War, over 2 million land mines were planted in the DMZ.

826
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:16,570
The DMZ is believed to have the highest landmine density on the earth.

827
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:20,310
That's why you must travel there on a fixed route.

828
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:24,300
However the location of the incident occurred was not a route where safety had been verified.

829
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:27,390
This was the very minefield.

830
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:33,300
Witness. Why did you leave the search path and enter the minefield?

831
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:38,100
I was on a safe route I could travel with my eyes closed.

832
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:42,110
If it had been a safe path, then I don't think a mine would have exploded.

833
01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:45,540
As long as it was not the case that a mine had its own legs and moved himself.

834
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:53,630
This is the last question.

835
01:01:53,700 --> 01:02:00,300
Witness, how did you get out of the minefield?

836
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:05,580
- I crawled out on my belly.
- You crawled?

837
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:08,000
So you're saying, you held the Company Commander, who weighed 80 Kg

838
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,560
and came sweeping out over the pressure-sensitive mines?

839
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:15,230
On top of that, despite the loss of use of one leg,

840
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:19,030
you endured the pain and crawled out?

841
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,700
Are you and the court insulting the Landmine Hero?

842
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:31,890
Military Prosecutor, will you be responsible for the punishment?

843
01:02:31,890 --> 01:02:35,630
How dare you raise in court such an outrageous rumor?

844
01:02:44,810 --> 01:02:46,500
Prosecutor

845
01:02:55,330 --> 01:02:57,890
Who do they think I am?

846
01:02:57,890 --> 01:03:00,090
Are they kidding me?

847
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:10,060
What? What are you doing now?

848
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:14,760
We are going to re-investigate the DMZ mine explosion.

849
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,900
- Arrest him.
- Yes.

850
01:03:18,350 --> 01:03:21,400
You guys. Aren't you letting go of me?

851
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,420
How dare you touch me?

852
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:28,750
We have conclusive evidence. Please calm down.

853
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:32,910
I can no longer give you any reason.

854
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:36,060
What? Evidence?

855
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:39,820
Bring it. I said bring it!

856
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:44,650
Shall I show it to you right now?

857
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:51,300
Starting now I will show you how the fake hero

858
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:54,560
performed his self-written play.

859
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:15,570
You bastard. How far are you going to go?

860
01:04:15,570 --> 01:04:18,300
Do you think you can get away with this?

861
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:41,310
It's real.

862
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:45,830
It's a false leg.

863
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:53,170
You. You, Is this what you wanted to know?

864
01:05:10,370 --> 01:05:12,380
It's General No Hwa Yeong.

865
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:40,640
♫ Feels like I'm losing control ♫

866
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:44,360
♫ My style without hesitation ♫

867
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:48,270
♫ No chance to get away now ♫

868
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:50,550
♫ You can't find your way out ♫

869
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:53,310
♫ You are the prey in my hand ♫

870
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:58,360
I accept responsibility for everything in this incident.

871
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:01,430
The Do Bae Man I know is not the sort of person to do such a thing without proof.

872
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:05,040
- Don't you know me?
- Starting now I will let you know some clues unofficially.

873
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:08,030
I'm taking away the soldier and moving as a civilian.

874
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:09,940
From now on, you'll follow me like a shadow.

875
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:12,570
The truth is still buried.

876
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:15,340
Besides us, there's someone else who's looking for the military doctor.

877
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:17,790
This is the last chance I'll be giving you.

878
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:23,520
We might be dealing with a monster that's much more terrifying than we had imagined.

879
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:30,610
♫ I'm not struggling hard any more. I won't let you go ♫
