Military Prosecutor Doberman

8
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,170
Fourth Division Group Observation Post (GOP) Shooting Trial

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:43,100
Before the shooting was there any abuse in the GOP platoon?

10
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,160
There wasn't any.

11
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,260
Abuse.

12
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,940
A Few Days Earlier

13
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,180
Report everything without a single lie.

14
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,800
Private Pyeon Sang Ho sent me several emotional letters.

15
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,240
But why did such a situation occur?

16
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,940
Well, that's—

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,550
Say it this instant. Why didn't you follow-up?

18
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,800
- I did do something about it, Commander.
- How?

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,480
Those involved were ordered to run laps on the training field with full military gear.

20
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,620
- On your feet.
- Yes, Commander.

21
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,030
Listen carefully to what I say.

22
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,970
There was no sign of anything, understand?

23
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,010
Yes.

24
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,100
Do you understand precisely what I mean?

25
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,780
There was no indication shown by Private Pyeon Sang Ho.

26
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:54,050
- All right.
- Unity.

27
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,880
Episode 14

28
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,970
The Patriotic Society's X-File.

29
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,820
You didn't know about it and Division Commander doesn't have it either.

30
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,820
No Tae Nam?

31
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,490
After Cha Ho Cheol died, he was the next IM owner.

32
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:37,290
No way. When even No Hwa Yeong doesn't know, how could that kid know?

33
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,700
Even so, I should check.

34
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:45,290
But then, do Do Bae Man and Cha Wu In know of the existence of the Patriotic Society's X-file?

35
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,790
I myself never told them.

36
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,380
They probably don't know.

37
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:55,770
What reason is there to tell me something that you never told them?

38
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:01,540
Chairman Cha didn't want her to know. He asked me to do it.

39
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:06,270
The X-file would be full of corruption incidents between defense contractors and the military.

40
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,260
It's not just the Patriotic Society.

41
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,220
It is all the filthy defense contractors for the entire country.

42
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,030
It is too big for Wu In to handle.

43
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,400
Yes?

44
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:37,140
There's been a mass shooting on the front.

45
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,880
- Mass shooting?
- No Tae Nam is at the 4th Division GOP.

46
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,720
No Tae Nam? Was he armed?

47
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,910
Was he shot?

48
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,450
It should be neither.

49
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:58,680
He should neither kill nor be killed.

50
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:10,030
I think the shooting by Private Pyeon was caused by abuse.

51
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,150
Don't rush to judgment.

52
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,170
Even the shooter is silent as to motive for the crime.

53
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,960
It was not that he was silent.

54
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,730
Why do you think the motive for the crime is unimportant?

55
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,550
Everything...

56
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,690
Everything is an excuse.

57
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:30,540
He said it was an excuse. An excuse.

58
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,380
Whether he should die, bearing the cruelty

59
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,920
or if it was cruelty beyond endurance and he couldn't stand it, he kills everyone.

60
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,740
I can't make a conclusion whether it was an act of cruelty or not,

61
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,590
but it's our job to get the truth before we go to court.

62
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:53,170
We'll find out when we meet the surviving soldiers.

63
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,380
Ward 21

64
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:04,490
Chairman. I was so relieved once I heard you were at the hospital.

65
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:11,970
All the way here today I was trying to calm down

66
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,630
the feeling that you might be the shooter.

67
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,170
I asked if you were the shooter from the mass shooting.

68
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,590
Did this happen because of you?

69
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,170
Move over!

70
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,540
Please save me, Mom! Please!

71
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,010
What's the matter? Are you okay?

72
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,890
Are you—

73
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,410
No Tae Nam.

74
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,890
You were bullied by Sergeant Ma too. Let's look for him together.

75
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:13,430
What? Don't you want to kill Sergeant Ma?

76
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,430
Then you are the same as he is. You're exactly the same.

77
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,640
I couldn't help it. I'm sorry.

78
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:30,860
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

79
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,720
Save me. Please save me.

80
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,210
Help me please. Help me.

81
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,150
- Please save me.
- Are you okay?

82
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,790
I think he has post-traumatic stress disorder.

83
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,280
He is a completely different person now.

84
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,160
I'll take his statement.

85
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,180
I'll take other other surviving soldiers'. And also, Yong Mun Gu's.

86
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:10,600
He is not the sort of person to come here out of concern for No Tae Nam.

87
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,210
Let's go.

88
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:27,200
I guess you didn't come here as No Tae Nam's lawyer.

89
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,950
Why are you here?

90
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,670
If you have nothing to gain, you wouldn't take a single step.

91
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:37,990
Ah! You are leaving empty-handed.

92
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,960
Well, if I had to argue with you, you're the ones who ended up with nothing.

93
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,660
I'm talking about Chairman Kang Ha Jun.

94
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:51,670
I've received a big present for saving his company.

95
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,430
Do you mean Won Gi Chun's material?

96
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:58,040
No way. Do I look like a person who would be satisfied with just that?

97
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,220
When you and Pros. Cha find out, you are going to be so surprised. I also was truly shocked.

98
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,890
Oh. I also am very curious.

99
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:12,600
Stop sounding me out there. I can hear your brain spinning its wheels even here.

100
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,060
It's quite interesting. You two and Kang Ha Jun.

101
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,190
The real battlefield, where yesterday's friend becomes today's foe,

102
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,580
is not separate.

103
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,560
Living is war.

104
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,270
Isn't it?

105
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,060
Kang Ha Jun

106
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,300
Yes.

107
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,630
Does Chairman No know about the Patriotic Society's X-file?

108
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:08,290
I couldn't even ask. His condition is very bad.

109
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:11,080
He survived at the scene of a mass shooting.

110
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,900
After the trial, when things are calmer, I'll check again.

111
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,880
Until then, are we going to stop looking for the Patriotic Society's X-file?

112
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,310
No way to do that.

113
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,330
- Drive to the armed forces prison.
- Yes, sir.

114
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:49,020
Private No, how are you doing?

115
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,260
Are you calm?

116
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:57,420
I'm going to ask you a few questions about the case.

117
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:04,310
You, holding a gun, confronted the soldiers who were dispatched to the scene of the mass shooting.

118
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:07,250
Are you also asking if I shot it?

119
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,170
That's not it.

120
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,000
You're a victim too.

121
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,530
- A victim?
- Yes.

122
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:22,350
I've already confirmed that according to the initial military police investigation, you are not a suspect.

123
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:26,890
Private Pyeong Sang Ho also said he acted alone.

124
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,590
But why did you have the gun?

125
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,550
Private Pyeong gave it to me.

126
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:48,080
You were bullied by Sergeant Ma too. Let's look for him together.

127
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:53,660
He didn't shoot you and he gave you a rifle. Does that mean there was no enmity between you and him?

128
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:58,260
I don't want to know the reason. I don't know why.

129
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,150
Were you close to Private Pyeon?

130
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,630
According to the records, he is your assigned superior.

131
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:11,200
No. We've never been close. There wasn't anyone there who I was close to.

132
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,160
All right.

133
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:27,460
Now I'm going to ask you the most important question.

134
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,080
Was there any abuse in the GOP platoon?

135
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,800
From now on, you must do exactly the same as I say with your mouth.

136
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,650
If one of us messes up,

137
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:45,500
we will all end up together in military prison.

138
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,200
Do you understand you will never ever get out of this shitty army?

139
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,110
Anyway, those bastard military prosecutors can't find any evidence...

140
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,980
unless we confess.

141
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,700
There was never

142
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,750
any abuse.

143
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,800
You say there wasn't any.

144
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,480
Are you certain?

145
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,020
Yes.

146
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,450
Are you asking about abuse? It never happpened.

147
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,700
We all were nice to Private Pyeon Sang Ho.

148
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,260
What about the rest of you?

149
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,870
Sergeant Ma is correct. We were all nice to each other.

150
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:42,320
Private Pyeon said it was tough serving in the military but we treated him well.

151
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,330
Yes, we were very attentive to him.

152
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,110
How is No Tae Nam?

153
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,280
He calmed down.

154
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,900
No Tae Nam said there was no abuse.

155
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,000
Every survivor gave the same answer.

156
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,310
- Do you mean all of them?
- Yeah.

157
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,710
But their statements have no details.

158
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,100
Are you suspecting the answers?

159
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,540
For this case, there isn't going to be corroboration either way.

160
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,260
What did Yong Mun Gu say?

161
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,890
He looked like the cat who caught a big fish.

162
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,570
Big fish?

163
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,430
But there's nothing to worry about.

164
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:33,160
I am the expert who knows Yong Mun Gu better than he knows himself.

165
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:47,260
No-kachu, did you talk to the military prosecutor?

166
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,120
Why aren't you answering?

167
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,260
Tae Nam,

168
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:06,200
it's all my fault.

169
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,050
It's my fault for sending you to the army.

170
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,020
I'm sorry.

171
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,120
You want to get out of the army, don't you?

172
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:26,170
- Excuse me?
- I will get you out of the army and give you the chairman's position in IM Defense.

173
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:31,420
In return, just tell the military prosecutors

174
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,170
there was no abuse at all.

175
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,410
That way, I can keep my position.

176
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,230
We have to point the arrow of blame only at Private Pyeon.

177
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,580
He killed the innocent members of your platoon.

178
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,570
So Tae Nam, you help your mom.

179
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,450
That way, you also can return to the way things were

180
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:01,280
before you put on an army uniform.

181
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,920
Aren't you answering?

182
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,830
You crazy punk.

183
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:14,410
Did you answer the military prosecutor, Punk?

184
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,360
Hey, aren't you answering?

185
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,590
You crazy bastard.

186
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,610
Look at him. Since he's out of the platoon, he can't keep his head on straight.

187
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,740
Don't touch me, you son of a bitch.

188
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,880
Because I am getting out of this so-called army.

189
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,430
Crazy bastard.

190
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:37,020
- Stop him.
- Seriously.

191
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,940
Are you okay?

192
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,660
Nothing happened.

193
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:48,920
Yes. Just the way you want it. Nothing happened.

194
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,720
Did you see Hong Mu Seop?

195
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,380
- Yes.
- Did he know about the Patriotic Society X-file?

196
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,710
Yong Mun Gu.

197
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:28,850
That snake-like guy shamelessly showed his face.

198
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:32,050
What do you think? Are you interested?

199
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:37,500
You've been thrown out of the Patriotic Society. You have nothing to feed Yong Mun Gu.

200
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,250
There is something.The Patriotic Society's X-file.

201
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,080
Is Yong Mun Gu looking for the Patriotic Society's X-file?

202
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,460
Yes. He came here to dig up information.

203
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,890
Yes.

204
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,240
This is getting more and more interesting.

205
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:00,370
Do Bae Man, you are looking for the file to destroy the Patriotic Society.

206
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:05,450
Yong Mun Gu is looking for the file so that he can control the society.

207
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:11,190
Of course, no one knows if the file actually exists.

208
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:28,560
That can never be so. That sort of file doesn't disappear or get buried.

209
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:34,280
The desire of a person who possesses it doesn't make it happen.

210
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:41,550
So we just don't know where the X-file is.

211
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,120
Right.

212
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:48,370
About No Tae Nam. He may have PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder).

213
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:51,880
Well, that could be. He'll need treatment.

214
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,830
You're so indifferent.

215
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,450
Am I?

216
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:02,060
Do you know the significance of that?

217
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,510
- Does it have any significance?
- Yes.

218
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:10,030
Medical discharge from military service due to PTSD?

219
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,550
Minister Lee Jae Sik, you, CEO Yong Mun Gu,

220
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:17,440
and I at Kang's Solution need to step on the accelerator.

221
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,600
- If you don't want to lose your position.
- Damn.

222
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,470
What are they talking about?

223
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:31,500
Hyeongnim, what are we now?

224
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,870
We're not even on a five-minute military standby.

225
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,220
Shhh. Can't you be quiet? But why are we on a five-minute standby?

226
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:43,270
If so, what are you doing here? That pimp-like guy took your seat next to CEO Yong.

227
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,540
Hyeongnim, you couldn't even sit together but you are sitting with me in the corner.

228
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:50,380
So picky. How many times do I have to tell you, Ji Ri?

229
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:55,110
The more successful Chairman Yong becomes, his enemies will double or triple.

230
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:59,260
We don't know when or where someone with a knife will appear and stab him.

231
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,730
In five minutes, we...

232
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:07,690
- In ten minutes here—
- That's the five-minute standby, Hyeongnim.

233
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:11,630
Because your head grew bigger, has your tongue gotten longer too?

234
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,380
Ever since we met him, we have been delivering money.

235
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,260
We picked up after soldiers and got shot by a BB gun like a kid.

236
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,080
Do you know how humiliating that was?

237
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,280
We always used to take only the top 1%, didn't we? Oh my.

238
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,310
Shut your mouth. I'm also barely restraining myself.

239
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:35,900
I don't want to wake up another bloody personality hiding within me.

240
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,110
Hyeongnim, wake up now.

241
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:44,540
Hyeongnim, aren't you usually a terrifying person?

242
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,470
Time to get a drink.

243
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,540
Hello.

244
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:14,370
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

245
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,500
This is my regular place. What brings you here alone, Chief?

246
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,250
Auntie.

247
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:35,570
It's the first time I've had such a major case since I became head of the office.

248
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:41,380
Now I can't sleep at all. I just think about the case.

249
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:47,300
Thinking about the dead soldiers breaks my heart.

250
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Legal Division Chief! In this case,

251
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,060
you only have to make a judgment as a prosecutor!

252
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,910
If you worry what your superiors think again,

253
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:02,160
I'm not going to stand for it this time!

254
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,080
But Aunt, how can you speak to me like that?

255
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,540
I'm also a military prosecutor! A military prosecutor.

256
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,220
I was a prosecutor like Cha Wu In back in the day!

257
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:15,200
Oh, my! Did you say you were like Prosecutor Cha?

258
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,420
I can't believe that at all.

259
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,790
The military made me the way I am now.

260
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,910
The ranks, the orders did!

261
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:25,090
Do you know why I haven't got married until now?

262
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:30,580
It's because I dedicated my soul to this country's military!

263
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:36,040
You also haven't got married yet...

264
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,080
As a legal division chief,

265
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,020
I commanded over this case properly,

266
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,230
to Prosecutor Do and Prosecutor Cha!

267
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:47,220
Do it precisely. Precisely!

268
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,340
Do it right!

269
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:58,410
Now that I look at you again, you are a man.

270
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,160
Do I look like a man to you?

271
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,210
Yes, you do look like a man to me.

272
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,120
Shall we have another glass?

273
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,480
Shall we?

274
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,520
Let's have another drink.

275
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,740
It's good!

276
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:25,620
Legal Division Chief! Why don't we try to get to know each other from today— Let's skip that part.

277
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,470
- Let's date each other.
- Excuse me?

278
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:31,420
We have to start dating to know if the other person is good or bad.

279
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,250
Are you asking me out?

280
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,540
What? Are you not into the idea?

281
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,510
If that's the case, forget about it.

282
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:41,440
Boss! Can we get the check?

283
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,560
Wait, Prosecutor Do's Aunt.

284
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:50,980
Oh, my God. I mean, you have to give me some time to think!

285
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,770
Let's go to another place to drink!

286
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:59,600
It's not late to think about it after we start dating.

287
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,300
I don't date just anybody.

288
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,900
I won't make you regret it.

289
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,640
- Boss, please leave the tab under my name.
- Yes.

290
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,750
Division Commander Major General No Hwa Yeong

291
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:27,220
No Hwa Yeong, you definitely said it with your own mouth.

292
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:31,580
When your son makes trouble again, you'll take responsibility.

293
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:35,730
Minister, did you come hear withhout properly hearing the case report?

294
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,730
- What?!
- In this case,

295
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,800
my son was a victim who might not have survived.

296
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,040
Whatever it is, your son is related to this case!

297
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,010
Do you think I don't know about your son?

298
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:48,000
Even if he didn't grab the gun for himself, he would've made the other person grab it!

299
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,600
You are speaking carelessly, Minister.

300
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,680
What did you just say to me?

301
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,480
You should explain what you just said,

302
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,000
and you have to take responsibility for this case.

303
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,150
I heard you said you would give up your position to the Minister.

304
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:02,620
Why do you have so much to talk about when you are about to leave the military?

305
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:07,350
Are you going to let him hear what I'm about to say from here on as well?

306
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:10,230
Should I just start talking right away?

307
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:16,110
I'm being considerate of you, Minister. Why don't you make a decision?

308
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:19,400
Wow, No Hwa Yeong, you are really...

309
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,340
Go outside, Vice Corps Commander.

310
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,600
- Minister.
- I said go out of the room!

311
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:43,420
No Hwa Yeong, I will end your military life with my own hands!

312
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,840
Why is this door so thick?

313
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,560
Why can't I hear a word?

314
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:58,440
You should be dismissed from your position and move to a rear post.

315
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,830
I'll call you back when things get settled.

316
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:06,180
This is the best I can do for you.

317
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:10,270
I can't give up the division commander position just because of this minor incident.

318
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,750
What did you say? Just?

319
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,920
Minor incident?!

320
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,100
Thirteen of your division's soldiers lost their lives!

321
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:22,670
If someone has to take responsibility for this incident and gives up a position,

322
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:26,510
that's not me but you.

323
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,120
Did you just call me "you" without my title?

324
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,880
The position you have right now. Do you think you went up there all by yourself?

325
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,960
I put you in that position! This No Hwa Yeong did!

326
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,580
What?!

327
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,820
I guess you lost your mind because of your son.

328
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:44,640
Now you are finally showing your dirty self to me.

329
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,390
There's nothing more to hear from you.

330
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:50,520
You are getting a dishonorable discharge right now!

331
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,440
This is an order, No Hwa Yeong.

332
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,410
I completed your order perfectly.

333
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:06,810
I told you to make the investigator couple understand.

334
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:09,040
Did I ever tell you to kill them, Bitch?

335
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:13,720
When there's any problem, the way I solve it is to cut it off at the root.

336
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,790
That way there is no trouble later.

337
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:18,130
Are you insane, Bitch?

338
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,960
Colonel, you have to—

339
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,780
"You and I have to go together now,

340
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:28,100
until the end of my time in the military."

341
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,040
That's what I said to you back then.

342
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:35,110
How dare you...

343
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:37,410
How can you dare to do this?

344
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:40,510
I have been eavesdropping on you for a long time, Minister.

345
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:45,380
It means this recording is just the tip of the iceberg.

346
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:51,860
Hey, are you doing this even though it might be the end of you as well?

347
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:56,180
There's no fight you can win without putting blood on your own hands.

348
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:01,260
Every battle can be won by blood.

349
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:05,870
If I wanted to go higher up than now,

350
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:12,180
there would be a puddle of blood underneath me. I'm always ready for that

351
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:19,360
because this place is filled with men who are afraid of putting blood on their hands.

352
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:26,870
So if you want to keep your title even one more day,

353
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:29,790
handle this case right now.

354
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,700
From now on, I'm the one who's giving you orders, Minister!

355
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,790
Unity!

356
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,960
Okay, you may go.

357
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:53,420
What happened, Minister?

358
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,580
Legal Division Chief Seo Ju Hyeok

359
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,670
Prosecutor Do, come to my office.

360
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:05,740
How is the investigation of the mass shooting case going?

361
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:09,180
Private Pyeon Sang Ho admits to all crimes. And with the surviving soldiers' testimony,

362
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,930
we figured out most of the sequence and locations of activity.

363
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:14,040
There will be a reason for this incident.

364
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,620
Currently, we are checking if there were any acts of abuse.

365
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,240
I read all of the testimony from the surviving soldiers.

366
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,320
But we have to look into it more closely!

367
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,640
You guys are my military prosecutors!

368
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,170
When these kinds of incidents happen,

369
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:35,170
what parents would want to send their children to the army?

370
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:39,140
When I was younger, there was a mass shooting like this,

371
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:44,780
and they tried to reduce and cover the case and got more anger from the public.

372
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,580
When it's a case like this!

373
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,480
We, military prosecutors, shouldn't lose our cool

374
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,160
and find the truth precisely!

375
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,540
It was like that when I was young!

376
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:56,230
So you guys should do it like that as well!

377
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,600
Do you understand?

378
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,050
Yes, Legal Division Chief.

379
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:03,060
Yes, sir! Lieutenant Colonel, Legal Division Chief, Seo Ju Hyeok.

380
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,800
Unity!

381
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,060
Unity!

382
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,130
You may go.

383
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:10,740
Yes, sir!

384
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,010
Why don't we go for a latte, Prosecutor Cha?

385
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:15,070
Do it precisely. Precisely!

386
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:17,400
Yes, sir!

387
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:26,600
It would've been the first time you saw a mass shooting scene as well. How was it?

388
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,540
I saw with my own eyes that this is what a war is.

389
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:33,080
It was very horrific.

390
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,390
Private Pyeon is not talking at all about the motive of the crime.

391
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:40,350
I think it won't be easy for both prosecutors to recommend a sentence for this case.

392
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,350
Whether there were abusive acts or not,

393
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,710
Prosecutor Do will find it out.

394
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,020
You know, something like that.

395
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:50,270
Physicians only see the x-ray film and can diagnose right away.

396
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,940
It's like that to the experienced prosecutors.

397
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:56,590
What's good about Prosecutor Do? He has great intuition.

398
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:59,010
He was amazing back in the day, too.

399
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:03,000
It was so good that juniors called him "Psychic Do."

400
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,020
And now he's a 5-year-old human big-data.

401
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,980
But I was curious about this for a while.

402
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,000
What's your relationship with Prosecutor Do?

403
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,540
I think I heard you calling Prosecutor Do "Hyeong."

404
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:21,800
Why are you asking me about that?

405
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,420
Stop right there.

406
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,660
Are you MC Sang Gi?

407
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,690
Why are you arresting him?

408
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:00,200
He's not the culprit. My intuition says so.

409
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,440
Follow me.

410
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,420
He's so cool. I knew it.

411
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:36,830
Prosecutor Do put you on this path.

412
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:39,470
Yes. I wanted to become a military prosecutor like him,

413
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:42,710
so I tried to go to law school but immediately realized I'm not cut out for it.

414
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:46,010
I studied until my nose bled to become a military investigator after that.

415
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:49,120
That nose bleed is what made me who I am today.

416
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,430
You're bleeding right now.

417
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,870
- What's bleeding? My nose at this moment?
- Yes.

418
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,530
- Tilt your head back.
- My gosh.

419
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:59,990
This brings back a lot of memories. I've pushed myself too much recently.

420
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:02,040
- Yes, I agree.
- Do you have any tissue on you?

421
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,550
I'll get some for you.

422
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:07,780
Gosh, is it because I winked? How embarrassing.

423
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,780
Ministry of Defense - Kang's Solution & IM Defense: MOU Signing for New Weapon Project

424
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,370
This concludes our contract.

425
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:49,240
You'll never regret this gracious decision you made to trust me.

426
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,180
Thank you, Minister.

427
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:55,150
I've heard the production of the new weapon is a classified secret.

428
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:57,530
I will learn a lot from CEO Yong.

429
00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:01,420
That's the reason why one can't easily break the defense industry's corruption.

430
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,780
It's easy to maintain secrecy and it leaves no traces.

431
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:08,210
If I may ask,

432
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:11,950
is there a special reason you rushed this?

433
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:15,970
I'll use this contract for the new weapon

434
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:21,570
to put an end to No Hwa Yeong.

435
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:27,630
Pardon? What do you mean all of a sudden?

436
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:30,140
I will do everything in my power

437
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:33,440
for you to take full control over IM Defense

438
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,480
from Hwa Yeong.

439
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,420
Thank you so much, sir. I dedicate my loyalty entirely to you.

440
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:46,210
If anyone should be above me, it's you, Minister.

441
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,360
Next, we have news from the Ministry of Defense.

442
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:55,180
They have signed a new contract with Kang's Solution and IM Defense,

443
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:58,170
who are dominant leaders in the defense industry business, to produce a new weapon.

444
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:01,030
With this agreement, the Ministry of Defense will invest ten percent of its budget in both companies,

445
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:04,520
making them the leading companies in the market.

446
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:08,180
Development of the new weapon will be in full swing soon.

447
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,890
Until now—

448
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,720
No Hwa Yeong

449
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,660
You must've seen the news.

450
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:31,360
Why did I have to learn about this through the news?

451
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:35,350
I was planning on making a visit soon anyway.

452
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:38,530
You better have a clear and convincing explanation.

453
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:43,070
Don't worry, General. You'll understand right away.

454
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:52,030
An official from the Ministry of Defense said this agreement...

455
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:56,040
Yong Mun Gu and CEO Kang. They even signed a contract with Lee Jae Sik.

456
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,260
It's a clear sign that conflict has erupted within the Patriotic Society.

457
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,970
With Hong Mu Seop driven out,

458
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:04,190
the remaining members will have to choose between

459
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:08,250
Lee Jae Sik and No Hwa Yeong. They will compete for loyalty.

460
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,480
Identification of a friend or foe is important in war.

461
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,120
And that is what compromised a certain someone's position.

462
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,920
Vice Corps Commander Heo Kang In.
Heo Kang In (Age 56)/ 45th Class Military Academy/ 4th Division Deputy Commander

463
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,080
Do you know why I'm on top of you? It's simple.

464
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,800
I'm a stronger soldier than you.

465
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,750
He's the symbol of an incompetent soldier obsessed with male chauvinism.

466
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:33,980
He put on a military uniform with a vow to never accept orders from a woman.

467
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:38,080
But it was a turn of fate that he's being mercilessly trampled on by a woman's military boots.

468
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,740
How have you been, Minister?

469
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:44,670
He's survived this far by firmly hanging onto his connection to Hong Mu Seop.

470
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,980
But now that the connection has been cut off,

471
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,120
his life as a soldier is at risk of ending too.

472
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,590
No Hwa Yeong shows no respect for him,

473
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:55,990
and he hasn't yet proven himself to Lee Jae Sik.

474
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:00,860
I'm thinking of using Heo Kang in as bait.

475
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,300
Bait?

476
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,730
Not as prey?

477
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:10,070
He's bait. Bait that will help us catch a big fish.

478
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:12,440
That's a good idea.

479
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,660
Yong Mun Gu is after the Patriotic Society's X-File right now.

480
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:19,160
We need something big too.

481
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,590
Let's finish up Private Pyeon's trial first.

482
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:26,390
Then we'll try using this bait to catch the big fish.

483
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,300
No Hwa Yeong, 56 / 45th Class Military Academy/ 4th Division Commander

484
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:42,820
Military Prosecutors.

485
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:48,980
Would it be possible to meet my son one more time?

486
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:52,560
I need to deliver this to him, but I don't know how.

487
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,900
I've been waiting for you to come.

488
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,910
I beg you.

489
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:03,100
His eyesight is terrible. Please give it to him.

490
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,920
I beg you.

491
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:09,020
I understand where you're coming from,

492
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:12,860
but I don't feel comfortable meeting the defendant's mother so often

493
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:16,960
when the trial is right around the corner. I'm sorry.

494
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:34,340
You conduct the second investigation for Private Pyeon.

495
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,390
I have to report to the division commander.

496
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:39,930
Yes, sir. But

497
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:43,190
you allowed Private Pyeon and his mother to meet last time.

498
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:46,070
Why did you refuse this time?

499
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,410
- That's because—
- His mother didn't commit the crime.

500
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:56,630
I know you feel bad, but let's not get emotionally involved.

501
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,720
Yes, sir.

502
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,390
I will deliver it to him.

503
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:26,240
You will?

504
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,950
Thank you. Thank you so much.

505
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:35,820
I don't know how to thank you.

506
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:00,580
Your chief already briefed me.

507
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,610
All of the soldiers who survived

508
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:06,410
are testifying that there was no abuse?

509
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:07,740
Yes, ma'am.

510
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,590
What did Private No Tae Nam say?

511
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:12,180
He testified there was no abuse.

512
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:16,240
Okay. Is the assailant saying the same thing?

513
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,990
Prosecutor Cha Wu In is investigating it further right now.

514
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,520
Further investigation? Do you suspect abuse or something else?

515
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:31,320
It was our team's decision to investigate as thoroughly as we can due to the large number of victims.

516
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,880
Is that so?

517
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,720
Do Bae Man.

518
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,260
Captain Do Bae Man.

519
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,260
Will you be able to demand my opinion

520
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:51,860
as a mother or Division Commander for this case too?

521
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:56,690
I'm the mother of a soldier who was victimized in this case.

522
00:39:56,690 --> 00:40:01,670
My son is alive but he experienced severe mental trauma.

523
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:05,990
Don't dig into the surviving soldiers' pain anymore.

524
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:08,560
Mind my words.

525
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,480
Sit down.

526
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,350
Your mother asked me to deliver these.

527
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:34,810
From now on, until the trial begins,

528
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:37,350
it'll be hard to see your mother's face.

529
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:40,860
Is it okay for me to take this?

530
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,990
Try it on.

531
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:46,170
It wasn't easy for your mother to get this delivered.

532
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:58,760
I can't wear this.

533
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,440
Those glasses. When did you damage them?

534
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,670
It's not a hard question.

535
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:16,090
Why can't you answer me?

536
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:20,190
It seems like someone broke them on purpose.

537
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:25,000
Or did you tape them because they were damaged?

538
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:27,760
Yes, ma'am,

539
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:31,040
they got broken,

540
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,190
but Tae Nam fixed them for me.

541
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:37,920
No Tae Nam?
Were you close to Private Pyeon?

542
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,530
According to the records, he is your assigned superior.

543
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:43,700
No. We've never been close.

544
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:49,240
There wasn't anyone there I was close to.

545
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:55,110
Private Pyeon. You spared No Tae Nam on purpose, didn't you?

546
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:00,550
Because he didn't bully you, am I right?

547
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,120
- Prosecutor Do.
- Hi.

548
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,700
I figured I'll watch from here since they're deep into the interrogation.

549
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:19,090
Gosh, Cha Wu In.

550
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:21,920
Private Pyeon is finally starting to talk.

551
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,590
He is?

552
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,430
The surviving soldiers claimed there was never any abuse.

553
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:33,320
They all said they treated you well.

554
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:38,810
You asked why the motive of your crime was important, right?

555
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:42,380
You said everything you say will sound like an excuse?

556
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:59,310
Your mother won't hear it that way.

557
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:05,830
If you don't say anything, your mother will be labeled

558
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:08,680
the mother of a merciless murderer for the rest of her life.

559
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:32,970
There was abuse.

560
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:44,120
At first it was only Sergeant Ma and a few others.

561
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:49,190
But as I continued to endure it, the other soldiers joined in.

562
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:51,730
Even the guys who didn't bully me,

563
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:56,380
would mockingly laugh at me and looked the other way.

564
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,040
The platoon leader and assistant platoon leader were the same too.

565
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,140
They were all demons.

566
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:07,890
Every day felt like hell.

567
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:13,730
I was terrified that I'd have to live it another day.

568
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:30,830
You finally got a statement from him thanks to the glasses.

569
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:34,360
The cause was abuse within the platoon, as suspected.

570
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:39,220
Once Private Pyeon's trial is over, we'll start investigating the abuse.

571
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:41,720
There must've been an organized cover-up.

572
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,140
We'll have to punish everyone related to it.

573
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:48,970
The problem is that all the survivors are telling the same story.

574
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:51,510
Meaning getting testimony will be hard.

575
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:54,780
But there's a possibility

576
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:59,100
- that one of the witnesses could change his mind.
- One of them?

577
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:02,570
The Ministry of Defense will hold a joint funeral ceremony

578
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:05,440
for the 13 victims from the mass shooting

579
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,930
that happened at the 4th Infantry Division GOP.

580
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:13,280
If anything happens here,

581
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:19,970
everyone will suspect you first

582
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:25,020
because you're No Tae Nam, the deserter.

583
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:37,110
That bastard.

584
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,490
Tae Nam. How could you say that?

585
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:44,430
Don't mess with me, I'm pissed.

586
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:49,800
Hey, no matter how mad we are, let's not compare them to dogs.

587
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:54,370
Sergeant Ahn and Ma are absolute trash who can't even be compared to dogs.

588
00:45:55,390 --> 00:46:00,010
I think that dogs are way better than humans.

589
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:04,730
Dogs have no greed and are good. Humans are so greedy and selfish.

590
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:09,230
They're all mean bastards, just like our superiors here.

591
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:14,750
Dogs are just one of many things that humans have, but to a dog, humans are their everything.

592
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:20,180
You're right. Bolt is my family. My only family.

593
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:23,070
We, dog lovers are forbidden

594
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:26,630
to use dogs as a bad word.

595
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:29,520
Okay, sir.

596
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:32,460
It's forbidden.

597
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,220
Let's go.

598
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,970
Follow me.

599
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,550
For the first time in history, they'll hold a panel to discuss the prospects of

600
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:49,320
processing the victims as soldiers who died in the line duty and compensating the survivors.

601
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,580
Hey, hey! They're talking about giving us compensation!

602
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:55,430
- Are you serious?
- Yes, they're reporting it.

603
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:58,630
- You'll get it too.
- That's awesome.

604
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:02,250
It's right. Ah, my leg, leg!

605
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:04,710
We'll receive around one million won, right?

606
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:08,310
No way, it's the government. I think they would give us twenty million won.

607
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:10,760
That's right. We worked for the country.

608
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,970
- I'm still in pain.
- Don't be a baby.

609
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:16,490
It really hurts.

610
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:25,060
Nothing will change by putting No Tae Nam on the stand.

611
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:27,120
I know.

612
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:32,050
The ruling isn't what's important in this trial.

613
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:38,200
Have you worked on a difficult case like this before?

614
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:41,090
This is my first too.

615
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:49,380
The soldiers are victims. Let's never forget that.

616
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:55,790
Yes, sir. The victim became the assailant and vice versa.

617
00:47:56,550 --> 00:48:03,290
Nobody wins from this case, which makes it even harder.

618
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:10,460
The trial for the mass shooting at the 4th Division GOP begins today.

619
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:14,920
It's been reported that the assailant has been charged for not only murder but many other things.

620
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:20,200
Many are waiting to hear about Private Pyeon's sentencing.

621
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:25,190
- Comment, please!
- How do you feel?

622
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:28,450
Is there anything you would like to say?

623
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:32,250
How is your condition right now?

624
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,810
Comment, please!

625
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:48,770
Why did you do it?

626
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:56,600
Please give us a statement.

627
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:17,290
Military prosecutors, make your argument.

628
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:20,600
Trial for Mass Shooting at 4th Division GOP

629
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:32,040
It all started when the defendant was on guard duty

630
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,860
and assaulted his senior who was with him.

631
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:38,160
This punk!

632
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:48,120
After that, he armed himself with a grenade and rifle.

633
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:51,310
He threw the grenade at the soldiers who were in the common room.

634
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:54,860
- Yes, he is.
- At least he's got that.

635
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:03,220
Then he roamed the hallway and shot soldiers randomly.

636
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:14,870
- He then murdered the soldiers who were sleeping in the barracks.
- You're all the same!

637
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:24,860
Lastly, he shot Sergeant Ma who was in the bathroom once.

638
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:29,900
When he was assaulting him, the MP's surrounded him and captured him.

639
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:32,400
Stop!

640
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:43,190
A total of 13 died and many of the surviving victims are undergoing treatment.

641
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:45,740
From these facts, the prosecution asks

642
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:48,530
that the defendant be charged under Military Criminal Law for murdering his superior,

643
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:53,410
and the seven other charges he's been indicted for.

644
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:56,570
Defendant. Do you admit to these charges?

645
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:59,120
Yes, we do.

646
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:04,090
But we'd like to state the motive is due to abuse within the military.

647
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:07,670
Prosecution. Are you aware of this?
Judge's Bench

648
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:12,920
Yes. We obtained the defendant's testimony during the interrogation.

649
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:17,980
However, all the surviving soldiers deny the abuse.

650
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:24,140
But we agree with the opinion that we should confirm the motive and look further into the circumstances of the incident.

651
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:28,230
I'd like to request that the surviving soldiers testify.

652
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:34,520
Surviving soldiers. Please head to the witness stand.

653
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,530
I swear.

654
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:40,290
Relying on my conscience I shall state the truth without hiding it.

655
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:44,360
If there's any lie, I swear to be punished for perjury.

656
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,630
Witness stand

657
00:51:57,630 --> 00:51:59,940
Before the mass shooting happened,

658
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:03,900
were there any acts of abuse in the GOP platoon?

659
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:15,340
There were none.

660
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,320
There were no acts of abuse.

661
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,100
It doesn't make any sense. There were no acts of abuse.

662
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,950
There were no acts of abuse.

663
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:26,810
I agree. It never happened.

664
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:32,340
He was on duty with me but suddenly started gibbering that he needed to kill Sergeant Ma like a crazy person.

665
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:35,360
And he abruptly knocked me out and left the post.

666
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:39,580
Private Pyeon completely lost his mind and went on a shooting spree.

667
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:44,300
When an attention-seeking soldier like Private Pyeon comes, it's really difficult for the seniors.

668
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,190
He couldn't get along with others in the GOP.

669
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:52,790
Also, he had severe insomnia, so I let him sleep next to me, gave him a lot of advice and took care of him.

670
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:57,490
But I guess he felt that was abuse.

671
00:52:57,490 --> 00:53:00,220
I only thought of Private Pyeon!

672
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:05,590
I can't express more ardently how well our platoon members treated Private Pyeon.

673
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:09,300
The members who treated him well, those innocent soldiers!

674
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,570
There were none.

675
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:12,950
There were no acts of abuse at all.

676
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:14,970
There were no acts of abuse.

677
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:18,070
That way, I can keep my position.

678
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:22,420
We have to point the arrow of blame only at Private Pyeon.

679
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:28,000
Republic of Korea Army

680
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,250
I'm going to get rid of all these restrictions when I become a super senior.

681
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:37,650
Until then, for a little while I endured it.

682
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:41,120
It's okay for you to say it like the other seniors.

683
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,680
I'm okay, Tae Nam.

684
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,690
What's okay about it?

685
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:53,150
You should've held it until the end if you were going to endure it.

686
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:58,020
Private Pyeon is not a soldier.

687
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:01,530
No, he's not even a human.

688
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:09,090
There were acts of abuse.

689
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:17,380
Witness, what did you just say?

690
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:20,000
Private No Tae Nam?

691
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,320
There were acts of abuse, you bastard!

692
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:29,290
This is not right. This is really not right!

693
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:34,170
Don't you think so? You guys didn't come to the military to do this.

694
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:38,340
The one who shot...

695
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,630
Hyeong, who shot the gun, should get punished too,

696
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:47,600
but all of you who made him shoot!

697
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,020
You should all get punished as well.

698
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:56,800
I guess all of you might be wondering why I'm saying this. Sure.

699
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:02,740
I know I have no right to say this, but this is not okay.

700
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:05,360
This is really not right!

701
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,370
Witness, be careful of your words.

702
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:14,300
Mother. No, Division Commander No Hwa Yeong.

703
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:18,100
Mother, you forced me to give false testimony for you to keep your title.

704
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:20,580
Witness! Please sit down.

705
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:23,800
Is this the military that you wanted to make, Mother?

706
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,100
Please answer me.

707
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:28,760
Is this the military that you wanted to make!

708
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:32,280
Bailiff. Please take that witness out from the court right now.

709
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,080
Please answer my question.

710
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,820
Please answer me! Please!

711
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:39,600
Please answer me!

712
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:58,690
Defendant, are there any last words you want to say?

713
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:04,500
It's all my fault.

714
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:09,220
It's my fault because I couldn't endure it more.

715
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,990
It's my fault that I couldn't hold it in until the end.

716
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:25,450
I'm sorry.

717
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:29,990
I'm truly sorry.

718
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:48,560
One soldier got severely abused.

719
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:53,750
Because of that, a horrific tragedy that cannot be reversed happened.

720
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:58,040
The majority of violence that happens within an organization gets concealed with silence.

721
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:05,030
And usually the reason the curtain of silence is lifted is a tragic incident.

722
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:09,260
Before the truth was revealed, the victim turned into an offender.

723
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:14,120
After the truth was revealed, the offender turned into a victim.

724
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:20,580
As a military prosecutor of this case,

725
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:25,280
I wanted to avoid this most painful moment.

726
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:27,950
But from now on,

727
00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:32,360
as a military prosecutor who must judge justice on behalf of the nation,

728
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,770
I will do my best duty.

729
00:57:34,770 --> 00:57:40,250
Murder cannot be justified for any reason.

730
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:46,110
Therefore, to Defendant Private Pyeon Sang Ho,

731
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:52,490
please sentence the death penalty, the maximum sentence of the court.

732
00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:06,190
When you look at all aspects of the trials,

733
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:12,810
it's not possible to avoid giving the maximum sentence to the Defendant. I sentence Defendant as follows.

734
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:18,690
The court sentences Defendant to the death penalty.

735
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:26,560
Sang Ho! Sang Ho!

736
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:29,070
Sang Ho!

737
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:30,660
Sang Ho...

738
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:33,560
No, my Sang Ho!

739
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:05,870
I delivered the new glasses that you gave me to Private Pyeon.

740
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:12,170
I thought he might not be able to see well when he's going a long way.

741
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:15,150
That's why I wanted to give that to him.

742
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:25,730
Military Prosecutor.

743
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:28,130
Thank you for listening to my last request.

744
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:32,310
♫  The nostalgic memories  ♫

♫  gradually come to mind  ♫

You do the briefing, Prosecutor Cha.

751
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:04,140
Do you want me to do it?

752
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:09,190
I only took care of this case consistently with my head cool.

753
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:14,740
But you didn't give up on both Pyeon Sang Ho and No Tae Nam.

754
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:18,520
You didn't give up on either the offender or the victim.

♫  and keep them there  ♫

758
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,100
Yes, sir.

759
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:33,190
Please say a word about it.

760
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:34,780
Please talk about it.

761
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:39,230
Related to this case, all of the soldiers who were involved in the acts of abuse

762
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:44,320
and all of the people linked to the attempt to cover up the abuse in this case will be investigated.

763
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:49,610
Also, Division Commander No Hwa Yeong's attempt to suborn perjury, which was brought up during the trial,

764
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:54,500
will be investigated thoroughly to determine the truth.

765
01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:15,400
Starting with the investigation of Division Commander No Hwa Yeong,

766
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:20,830
we will begin a full-fledged investigation into the huge military corruption that has been suspected until now.

767
01:01:20,830 --> 01:01:22,960
Proceed!

768
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:48,300
♫ The endlessly distant sadness within me ♫

769
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:53,370

770
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:58,140
Do as you wish, Do Bae Man and Cha Wu In.

771
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:01,440
But you will have to take responsibility for the aftermath.

772
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:06,110
You would be the one to do so, Division Commander.
