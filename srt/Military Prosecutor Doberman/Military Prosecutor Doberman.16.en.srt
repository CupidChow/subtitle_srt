Military Prosecutor Doberman

8
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,460
Life is full of cruel irony.

9
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,090
Good fortune in the midst of life's misfortune.

10
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,440
Failure like success.

11
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,660
The darkness which spreads like light

12
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,250
disguises evil.

13
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,630
In surgery

14
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,570
Operating Room

15
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:30,780
Surgery Waiting Room

16
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,940
How life will appear is determined in those ironies.

17
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,960
I know who I am.

18
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,860
Pros Cha, are you okay?

19
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,640
Final Episode

20
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,800
- It's been three days since you opened your eyes.
- Three days?

21
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,920
The bullet passed through your shoulder.

22
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,680
If the position were a little higher, you would have been in big trouble.

23
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,400
That was too close.

24
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,910
But why are you here?

25
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,160
No Tae Nam set off a grenade.

26
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,890
A grenade? Pros Do, are you okay?

27
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,080
As for me, I was lucky, well.

28
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,210
But No Tae Nam...

29
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:42,390
There is shrapnel in his body and he still hasn't regained consciousness.

30
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,500
Doctors say he has a slim chance.

31
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,400
Adjutant Yang must've gotten an incentive to commit murder by No Hwa Yeong.

32
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,300
Who? Who made you like this?

33
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,800
I'm okay, don't worry.

34
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,820
- It's Adjutant Yang's fault.
- No Hwa Yeong's adjutant?

35
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,430
No Hwa Yeong abetted this?

36
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,590
For now, we should issue an All Points Bulletin for her.

37
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,990
No.

38
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:58,100
When I'm discharged, I'm going to do everything I can to find her and persuade her.

39
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,130
Wu In.

40
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:03,920
Adjutant Yang could shut her mouth forever and take all of the fault by herself.

41
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,460
You will take charge of her until the end.

42
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,960
Yes.

43
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,750
Prosecutor Do, have you told Wu In?

44
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,650
Tell me about what?

45
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,730
I obtained the Patriotic Society's X file.

46
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,380
Intensive Care Ward

47
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,200
How is Cha Wu In doing?

48
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,790
Where is Adjutant Yang?

49
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,970
Why ask me?

50
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,630
Was it that face twenty years ago?

51
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:53,390
The face when you killed my parents and got away with it?

52
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,870
Be careful what you say, Do Bae Man.

53
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,600
- You...
- "You"?

54
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,800
will never emerge from the hell you created for yourself.

55
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,460
Hyeongnim, we are done for.
Suspects Wanted

56
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:34,380
What's this? I thought he was a noble,

57
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,710
but he was a load of crap.

58
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,350
All three of us are on the wanted list.

59
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,930
Wanted?

60
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,200
Suspects Wanted

61
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,720
My company, Seorak Heaven and Earth,

62
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,180
is completely ruined!

63
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,330
Pros Cha.

64
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,260
Chief! Managers!

65
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,920
Your chief prepared this and I paid for it.

66
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,120
Do you know how much we worried about you?

67
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,810
I never expected you would come like this. Thank you for coming.

68
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,530
Yes.

69
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,620
I heard you had a gunshot wound. Who is the shooter?

70
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,310
Who is it? I heard you saw the culprit.

71
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,850
What is the reason that you aren't telling?

72
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,010
Trust this Lieutenant Colonel Seo and tell me, huh?

73
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:46,960
Umm... I'll tell you everything when I am preparing for Division Commander No Hwa Yeong's trial.

74
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,430
Is the case connected to her?

75
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:57,330
Rehabilitation Room
Hemodialysis Unit

76
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,840
Come on.

77
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,360
Intensive Care Unit

78
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,950
What's this?

79
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:27,100
- Didn't they say he survived the massive shooting spree?
- I thought so too.

80
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,980
Because we came in secretly, we can't ask a nurse.

81
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,990
Hey, wake up!

82
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,970
You know, right? Where's the X-file?

83
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,950
Idiot. He's obviously in a coma. Is he waking up even if you say so?

84
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,270
We must find it.

85
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,650
All the stocks are gone. Do you think I'm in my right mind?

86
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:48,070
Parking

87
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,040
Are you leaving the hospital already?

88
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:25,120
The military doctor said I need to be hospitalized longer, but we don't have time for that.

89
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,280
There's not much time left now until the 90th day that I promised to you, Pros Cha.

90
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,030
I will join you soon.

91
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,710
Yong Mun Gu came here last night.

92
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,550
You saw him but you missed him?

93
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:42,820
I didn't miss him. I let him leave.

94
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,010
I have a plan.

95
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:49,000
You must do your best to recover completely.

96
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,210
Oh, your reporting attitude is wonderful.

97
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:59,150
After the Patriotic Society's X-file left by your father went through various detours,

98
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:02,250
it has finally returned to you.

99
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,750
He had lived a much more intense life than I knew.

100
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,630
How he could investigate and find out all of these...

101
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,770
Perhaps, I think I will complete

102
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:19,490
the revenge my father wanted but couldn't complete.

103
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,360
I need someone to verify the contents of the file.

104
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,130
We decided to use as bait a person who can verify the allegations of corruption

105
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,290
between the Patriotic Society and the defense industry.

106
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:36,420
Deputy Corps Commander Heo Kang In.

107
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:48,230
Do Bae Man, how and where did you obtain this?

108
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,110
Hey, isn't this amazing?

109
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:57,550
The corruption within the rotten defense industry which colluded with the Patriotic Society has been sorted out.

110
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,310
I don't know about that.

111
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,560
From your reaction, I think you know it very well.

112
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,890
I don't admit that. Do you think I'll take the rap instead of the minister?

113
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,860
When people feel guilty, they usually get angry.

114
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,500
When they're scared, they bark.

115
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,650
Do Bae Man, you bastard!!

116
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,950
With taking off my military uniform,

117
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,340
can you just make it even for my wrong doing?

118
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:38,990
You should get a punishment while in uniform for the crime you committed while in uniform.

119
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,840
I just followed orders!

120
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,960
How can a soldier do anything?

121
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,660
Okay, I promise you one thing.

122
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,860
What is it? What?

123
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,240
I'm saying, for the crimes that you haven't committed,

124
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,460
I will make sure you won't get charged!

125
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,830
I mean, everything was ordered by Minister Lee Jae Sik.

126
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,400
Of course!

127
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,150
What power do I have to make my own decisions?

128
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,380
Minister Lee decided everything.

129
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,270
Your face expression right now was great.

130
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:19,140
Like just now, please do it like that at Minister Lee Jae Sik's trial.

131
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,980
Your face expression was perfect. Good!

132
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,740
Vice Corps Commander Heo Kang In will testify.

133
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:37,980
Wow, this became five times bigger than the beginning.

134
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,630
That's why I said it's a "Gate."

135
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,630
Wow.

136
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:50,410
I don't think I can make Minister Lee Jae Sik fall for one defense industry corruption.

137
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:54,110
You gave information for investigation and helped to form the trial.

138
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:58,160
Prosecutor Do, I heard that you are like a Doberman,

139
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,460
and that is really true.

140
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,900
How is Division Commander No Hwa Yeong's trial preparation going?

141
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,940
It's going well. I'm making Yong Mun Gu move

142
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:11,410
without him even knowing that he's getting moved around.

143
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,350
Military Doctor Cho Su Chan. You kept him well, right?

144
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:27,600
Yes, why do you ask?

145
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,830
For now, that military doctor is the last card.

146
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,800
I'm going to use him when I negotiate with No Hwa Yeong.

147
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:40,650
No Hwa Yeong's trial will start soon.

148
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:46,560
The only charge that Do Bae Man can use to bring No Hwa Yeong to court is Failure to Frustrate Crimes of Subordinates.

149
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,530
But with that mere charge, he can't even hurt her.

150
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:54,330
So he'll gather every charge possible and merge them together.

151
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,170
Where's that military doctor?

152
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:06,250
- I left him at the pawnshop.
- Pawnshop?

153
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,580
Pawnshops handle various kinds of things.

154
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:15,040
That pawnshop takes humans, too.

155
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,410
My god.

156
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:23,260
I'll go there when the sun comes up.

157
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,940
Did you already get discharged from the hospital? Your wound hasn't healed yet.

158
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,510
I'm not good at lying down.

159
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,720
Oh, you.

160
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,160
By the way, Yong Mun Gu started to move.

161
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,820
Now, all we have to do is watch.

162
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,080
I'll look forward to it.

163
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:14,600
With this, you did a lot of things, Cha Wu In.

164
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,890
You are exactly like your father.

165
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:25,510
He also relentlessly threatened me only with his principles.

166
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,470
If my father thought of you as special,

167
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:33,390
I believe my father would've tried to stop you from being out of control.

168
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,100
Do you still care about that?

169
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,930
You're very naive.

170
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:44,230
I don't have any relationship with your father.

171
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:50,740
This time you were lucky, so you survived. But, next time, you might end up like your father.

172
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:55,550
I get rid of everything that blocks my way.

173
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:06,900
You are using your subordinates' loyalty. But how long can you do so?

174
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:11,270
Subordinate? Are you talking about that idiot who couldn't even finish you?

175
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:16,010
She's just a tool of mine, even though she's now useless.

176
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:21,340
Now I might put a bullet in your head with my own hands.

177
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,870
Come to get me whenever. I'll be waiting for you.

178
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:30,020
If you know my father well, you'll know what I'll do as well.

179
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:38,150
The end of your time is not that far away, No Hwa Yeong.

180
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,230
Oh, those pawnshop punks.

181
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:07,210
If we asked them to keep the product safe, then they should return it in its original condition.

182
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:11,070
- Where are we going to use him when he's this badly damaged?
- Bring him over.

183
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:34,370
So this punk will be an item for your life's 2nd round, right, sir?

184
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:41,250
It makes me itch to go to the division commander's office and make a deal with No Hwa Yeong.

185
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,490
I guess you've been spending time a lot with us

186
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:50,200
so you have become like us. Your style is becoming similar to ours.

187
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,030
Let's go.

188
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:04,370
- Do Bae Man.
- Wow, the tracking device's quality is great!

189
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,590
I think you can sell this on the market right away.

190
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:11,550
But will you be okay on your own? It seems like there are a lot of them.

191
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:16,090
A lot of them? It's only two of them.

192
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:19,190
Also, Yong Mun Gu can't fight.

193
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:28,890
Hey, Kang Ha Jun. Did you put a tracking device on my car as well?

194
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,750
Where are you?

195
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,630
Do you know about that?

196
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:37,890
Tricking the deceiving one is twice the joy.

197
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:42,280
Also, asking if you will be okay on your own meant will you be okay without Wu In.

198
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:48,110
I think you coming here right now won't help me at all, Kang Ha Jun.

199
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:54,360
Drop your prejudice that I won't be good at fighting, Do Bae Man.

200
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,760
Hey!

201
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,740
It hurts!

202
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,970
My god...

203
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,650
Where do you think you are going?

204
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:53,490
Hey, Do Bae Man.

205
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,800
Hey!

206
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,370
The end.

207
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,820
My god.

208
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,690
Be a good person, everybody. Okay?

209
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,220
Be quiet!

210
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,210
- Excuse me, Detective.
- What?

211
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:32,360
Can I have a last goodbye with this fugitive?

212
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,250
Only for a second.

213
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,440
Last goodbye?

214
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,300
I was always the same. You are the one who betrayed me.

215
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:53,860
Aren't you still looking for the Patriotic Society's X-file?

216
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:59,340
That thing. I've got that in my hand.

217
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,540
What?

218
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,550
You clearly said it doesn't exist. You said so!

219
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:09,130
Soon, the entire nation will download the Patriotic Society's X-file.

220
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:13,570
And everyone will see what's in there.

221
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:16,190
You'll get bored in prison.

222
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,320
Enjoy reading it in there.

223
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,660
- Do you think I'll just end like this?
- Hey, stop it!

224
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,360
I'll come back!

225
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,080
Don't go away, you punk!

226
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,490
Oh, that person.

227
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,900
Regarding the suspicion of severe injury and murder of Battalion Commander Won Gi Chun,

228
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,340
we've secured Military Doctor Cho Su Chan.

229
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:44,750
Please follow the arrest without a warrant procedure, Division Commander.

230
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:52,170
I wonder how guilty I will be judged in my own division's military court.

231
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,560
We'll see you in court.

232
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,160
- Take her with you.
- Yes.

233
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,720
How much do you know?

234
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,330
♫  I'll burn it all down  ♫

235
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:28,080
♫  Everything in front of me  ♫

236
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,150
♫  Just burn it all down  ♫

237
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,990
♫  Confidently stand up to it  ♫

238
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:39,050
♫  like the hot sun, like a flame  ♫

239
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:42,420
♫  I'm constantly burning  ♫

240
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,170
♫  I'll never turn off  ♫

241
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:57,720
It feels so nice!

242
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:02,420
It feels great.

243
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:12,260
Aunt. You are getting prettier and prettier these days. Is it the power of love?

244
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:16,250
It's the power of love and the power of tools.

245
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:20,840
Put this when your eyes are puffy, and it makes it goes down immediately.

246
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,380
I can't live without this anymore.

247
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:28,200
Today is Yong Mun Gu's trial. I'm going to look pretty to Yong Mun Gu!

248
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,740
Yong Mun Gu, Lee Jae Sik.

249
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,960
Just thinking about them getting charged makes me excited already.

250
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:51,310
Bae Man. The trial of Yong Mun Gu and Lee Jae Sik just started.

251
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,470
I'll report it to you live.

252
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,370
Your Honor, I would like to call a witness.

253
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:02,870
It's Vice Corps Commander Heo Kang In, a member of the Patriotic Society.

254
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:06,600
He'll testify to the defendants' charges of defense industry corruption.

255
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,410
What? Heo Kang In?

256
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:11,420
Why does he come out as a witness on the prosecutor's side?

257
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,900
He volunteered only to save himself.

258
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,020
Volunteered?

259
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,910
Oh, well.

260
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:22,130
You couldn't even secure your subordinate. What is this?

261
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,510
That punk.

262
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,230
Hey, you!

263
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:34,330
You punk! How dare you stab me in my back!

264
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:38,880
Let me go! Don't you think I have to survive as well?

265
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,430
Mr. Lee Jae Sik! Let go of this!

266
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:47,520
What? "Lee Jae Sik"? This punk!

267
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,990
Are you okay, sir?

268
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:56,830
All these soldier punks. I really hate soldiers now.

269
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,500
I really hate them all.

270
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,020
Aigo, wait!

271
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:08,460
Now, we only have No Hwa Yeong left.

272
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:15,160
Tomorrow, No Hwa Yeong will sit on this seat finally.

273
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:21,080
You kept your promise. It took exactly three months.

274
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:28,330
From my parents and your father's incident, every crime that No Hwa Yeong committed until now,

275
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:32,180
I'll make sure she gets punished for all of it.

276
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,910
No Hwa Yeong will project her last effort as well.

277
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:41,020
She'll do anything to protect the place she got to by turning herself into a monster.

278
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:52,090
Actually, the reason why I called you over here is different.

279
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,820
What's the reason?

280
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:59,670
After the No Hwa Yeong's trial is over and we can charge her,

281
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:03,090
there's something I have to do afterward.

282
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,770
Aren't our jobs done when we can charge her?

283
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:11,200
It's something I decided to do since I became a military prosecutor.

284
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,570
So please understand me, Prosecutor Do.

285
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:28,700
Case number, 2001 GO 25,

286
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,530
2015 GO 97, 2022 GO 13.
 Division Commander No Hwa Yeong's First Hearing

287
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,720
2022 GO 26.

288
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,840
2022 GO 30.

289
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:41,530
With these five cases combined, we'll start the trial.

290
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:44,630
Prosecutor, please make your opening statement for all charges.

291
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,060
Yes, Your Honor.

292
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:52,830
Regarding the shooting incident in GOP, the defendant, No Hwa Yeong,

293
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:58,100
ordered the first Battalion Commander to conceal the incident and forced a victim to commit perjury.

294
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:03,400
She interfered with the analysis and investigation of the true nature of the case.

295
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,700
Listen carefully to what I say. There was no sign of anything, understand?

296
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:13,430
Just tell the military prosecutors there was no abuse at all.

297
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:16,380
That way, I can keep my position.

298
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,930
We have to point the arrow of blame only at Private Pyeon.

299
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:24,180
Also, the defendant ordered Search Battalion Commander Won Gi Chun,

300
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:27,700
the suspect of the gun accident in the DMZ,

301
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:32,480
to manipulate the incident, which made a fool of the entire nation.

302
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,030
After that, to prevent revealing the complete story and the subsequent fabrication,

303
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:42,510
the defendant mutilated the search battalion commander's body,

304
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,560
and murdered him,

305
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:50,190
and then disguised it as a suicide.

306
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:55,220
In addition, the defendant joined a domestic private organization that is strictly prohibited by the military.

307
00:26:55,220 --> 00:27:00,520
The defendant shared bribes and ran the defense company, IM Defense, with borrowed-name shares

308
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:07,190
and constantly embezzled most of the profit for personal gain.

309
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:14,310
Finally, 20 years ago, to cover up a faulty grenade explosion incident,

310
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:18,570
the defendant intentionally hit the military investigator couple's car and killed them.

311
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:26,490
Also, the defendant is suspected of instigating the murder of Chairman Cha Ho Cheol of IM Defense six years ago.

312
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:34,400
According to this, I, the Prosecutor, charge the defendant, No Hwa Yeong, with suspicion of murder, severe injury,

313
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,240
violation of the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes

314
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,310
of embezzlement and breach of fiduciary duties,

315
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:42,380
and violation of the Act on the Aggravated Punishment and violation of the law against bribery.

316
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:47,530
I indicted her for a total of 7 criminal charges.

317
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:55,980
As the first female Division Commander, praised for breaking the glass ceiling,

318
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:01,110
the 4th Division Commander No Hwa Yeong's military trial is in session now.

319
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:05,780
A suspicion of operating and managing IM Defense with borrowed-name shares was also raised,
[Law Office]

320
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:11,790
so this trial will proceed with five cases merged together.

321
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:19,090
I'll turn myself in.

322
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:22,630
I shot Military Prosecutor Cha Wu In.

323
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:32,030
Private No Tae Nam, a witness at the GOP shooting incident trial,

324
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:36,260
testified that the defendant forced him to commit perjury.

325
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:40,660
Mother, you forced me to give false testimony for you to keep your title.

326
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,990
Do you admit the charges with respect to the mass shooting incident?

327
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,720
I never did that.

328
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,940
Then what is Private No Tae Nam's testimony?

329
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:52,290
My son is not in a sane condition.

330
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:57,200
After the mass-shooting incident, he's experiencing severe PTSD.

331
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,740
Do you deny his testimony?

332
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:08,400
I've tried my best to guide my son to go on the right path.

333
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,150
I persuaded my son, who didn't want to serve in the military, to join the army.

334
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:17,340
And I placed him in the front line unit so that he wouldn't receive privileges as the division commander's son.

335
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:22,870
Putting my son at the dangerous and difficult front line can be considered a privilege as well.

336
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:27,960
Despite my effort, Private No Tae Nam lied in an open trial

337
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,500
as a rebellious act against me.

338
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:37,860
I'm the top commander of the 4th Division before I am the mother of Private No Tae Nam.

339
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:43,690
As the commander, I can't be falsely accused with the disgrace of concealing the case.

340
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:50,710
Also, the charge of Failure to Frustrate Crimes of Subordinates is a bigger humiliation than killing me.

341
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:57,460
If that's the case, why did Private No Tae Nam call you to the troop's storage room and attempt suicide?

342
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:03,200
He called me over and repented his wrongdoing.

343
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,990
He regretted his wrongdoing?

344
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:14,810
He said with hatred toward his mother, he committed irreversible behavior.

345
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:17,200
He sincerely apologized to me.

346
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,220
I'm sorry

347
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,530
for being born your son.

348
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:29,830
As a sign of repentance, he pulled out the safety pin from the grenade.

349
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:40,410
I'm only deeply sad that my son is still unconscious.

350
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:48,910
What did you feel watching Private No Tae Nam's action?

351
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:57,430
What did you feel when your own son was pulling out the grenade's safety pin in front of your eyes?

352
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,450
Is the Division Commander title something you have to keep, even by abandoning your own son?

353
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:13,850
Have you ever thought of the reason why your son had to attempt suicide in front of his mother?

354
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:19,820
I will be your safety pin, Mother.

355
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:29,240
A child is just another person that came out of my body.

356
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,430
How can you understand every thought of another person?

357
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:39,140
Please answer just once as a mother, Defendant.

358
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:45,970
Prosecutor, please only ask questions that are relevant to the trial.

359
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:50,350
Private No Tae Nam apologized because of his guilt toward the defendant.

360
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:54,190
Doesn't this sound familiar from somewhere?

361
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:57,990
When Won Gi Chun died, you gave the same testimony.

362
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:03,180
He confessed his crimes. I told the Legal Division Chief. You can check with him.

363
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:07,440
Is this how you always evade your offenses?

364
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,400
Your Honor, Prosecutor is condemning the defendant by speculation without evidence.

365
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,100
Sustained.

366
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:18,010
Prosecutor, please watch your words.

367
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,390
We'll finish the hearing for the charge of Failure to Frustrate Crimes of Subordinates.

368
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:29,580
On the next trial, we'll continue the hearing for the severe harm to the body

369
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,950
and murder of Search Battalion Commander Won Gi Chun.

370
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,160
Yes, Section Chief?

371
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:56,080
What? I'll head over right now.

372
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:01,960
Adjutant Yang is at the legal office.

373
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:12,820
Adjutant Yang. Take the fall for everything.

374
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:16,210
You want me to take the fall for everything?

375
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,860
Yes.

376
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:21,320
I never commanded you to do anything.

377
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:26,110
Just say you acted independently out of loyalty for me.

378
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,460
Division Commander.

379
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:32,560
Shouldn't you take responsibility for not fulfilling your commander's orders?

380
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,090
More so than that,

381
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:39,060
this is your last chance

382
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,330
to repay me.

383
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:46,590
Yes, ma'am. I'll do as you commanded.

384
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:09,680
As you can see, I'm fine.

385
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,230
You had no intention to kill me.

386
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:18,660
But I'm sure you had no choice but to obey as a soldier.

387
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:24,220
Did Division Commander No command you?

388
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,490
No.

389
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:34,070
It's unrelated to the Division Commander. I acted alone.

390
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,040
Adjutant Yang Jong Suk!

391
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,950
That's the truth.

392
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,230
I have nothing left to say.

393
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:48,170
Adjutant Yang has been approved to stand witness tomorrow.

394
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:51,010
They have good reason to call her as their witness.

395
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:53,830
I'm sure they're positive she'll be used to their advantage.

396
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:58,950
I will not let No Hwa Yeong get her way.

397
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:02,930
Appear at the trial alone tomorrow.

398
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:06,690
I'll persuade Adjutant Yang and bring her over.

399
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,850
I promise you I will.

400
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:16,900
Don't feel too lonely in court tomorrow.

401
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:20,130
Make sure to bring her, Cha Wu In.

402
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:24,520
We'll begin the trial for the case of assault and murder of Battalion Commander Won Gi Chun.

403
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,800
Prosecution, start your case.
 The Second Hearing for Division Commander No Hwa Yeong

404
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,200
Prosecution?

405
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,650
I already confessed.

406
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:58,780
It wasn't ordered by anyone.

407
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:03,020
Your records show you're a great marksman.

408
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,920
Why did you fail to shoot me correctly?

409
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,830
You reported it yourself too, right?

410
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:11,610
I confirmed your voice from the call you left to the report center.

411
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:15,260
The hesitant look you had when you held the gun in front of me.

412
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:18,600
The scared voice from when you reported it.

413
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,310
You had zero intention to kill me.

414
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,780
Listen to me carefully, Adjutant Yang Jong Suk.

415
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:32,090
You received help from the division commander.

416
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:35,730
You revealed your past hurt and through that, the corps commander was convicted.

417
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:39,300
Then you thanked me.

418
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:44,380
You had no reason or motivation to shoot me.

419
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:47,280
The real culprit who stood behind you and pulled that trigger.

420
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,680
Help me get Division Commander No Hwa Yeong to pay for her crimes.

421
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,290
Subordinate? Are you talking about that idiot who couldn't even finish you?

422
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:16,720
She's just a tool of mine,

423
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,390
even though she's now useless.

424
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:23,690
Now I might put a bullet in your head with my own hands.

425
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,140
Even if you take the fall for her crimes,

426
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:33,240
other soldiers will pick up a gun because of her orders.

427
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:38,770
The tragic cycle of being used and thrown away will continue.

428
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:42,140
As long as No Hwa Yeong wears that uniform, it'll go on forever.

429
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:50,540
Don't let other soldiers fall victim to wrongful orders.

430
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:53,110
Please help me

431
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,880
to end that cycle.

432
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:59,240
I'm begging you.

433
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:04,640
This is the recorded conversation between Won Gi Chun and No Hwa Yeong.

434
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,000
There is a witness from our search squad.

435
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,160
They've called a press conference today

436
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,300
and will expose everything. Once it explodes,

437
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,410
I will die.

438
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,030
I'll talk to you later.

439
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:20,300
General. General.

440
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,640
I think Do Bae Man knows

441
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,360
you amputated my leg.

442
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:29,340
Objection. This is just a deceased victim's unilateral argument.

443
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:33,590
The defendant did not agree or admit to anything in the recording.

444
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:35,370
Sustained.

445
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:39,330
I ask to summon a witness who will verify the credibility of this recording.

446
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:42,790
Witness, please come forth.

447
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:54,790
Witness

448
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,620
Were the statements from the recording true?

449
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:05,420
Yes, they were true.

450
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,050
What's your reason?

451
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:11,840
I was present when Battalion Commander Won Gi Chun had his leg cut off.

452
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,620
After his amputation,

453
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:17,110
I was called to stitch it up.

454
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:22,910
The division commander ordered Adjutant Yang at first.

455
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,170
But when she hesitated,

456
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,380
the division commander

457
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,790
amputated Battalion Commander Won Gi Chun's leg,

458
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,470
herself.

459
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,260
The prosecution rests.

460
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:49,530
Defense counsel, you can start your cross-examination.

461
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,520
Your Honor.

462
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,430
Can I say something about military doctor Jo Su Chan?

463
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:57,060
Go ahead.

464
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,530
Captain Cho Su Chan.

465
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:05,680
While serving as a doctor at the military hospital,

466
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,260
you didn't show up to work for over a month without any notice.

467
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,780
But I—

468
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,480
On top of that,

469
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,260
you were given multiple warnings because of your gambling.

470
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:18,890
Who could trust a soldier like that?

471
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:24,870
Your Honor. The defendant is denouncing the witness with claims unrelated to this case.

472
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:28,990
Sustained. Watch yourself, Defendant.

473
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:33,420
Defense counsel, are you done?

474
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,040
Yes, sir.

475
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,080
We'll proceed with the next witness.

476
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:45,190
Prosecution. Is Adjutant Yang here?

477
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,070
If she didn't...

478
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,570
You're here, Cha Wu In.

479
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,810
Your Honor.

480
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:34,710
We have Lieutenant Yang Jong Suk, who is No Hwa Yeong's adjutant.

481
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:38,970
She's a crucial witness who can prove the multiple crimes the defendant committed.

482
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,500
Defendant No Hwa Yeong claims that Battalion Commander Won confessed.

483
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,800
Is it true?

484
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,340
Battalion Commander Won Gi Chun never confessed.

485
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,670
How are you certain about that?

486
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:03,360
If anything, he threatened her.

487
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:07,180
You, No Hwa Yeong, Corps Commander Hong Mu Seop, and Minister Lee Jae Sik.

488
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:10,830
I have a bomb that'll blow all of you up.

489
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:14,660
Your fates are now in my hand.

490
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:18,920
How did the defendant respond after being threatened?

491
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:27,970
She made a decision that was most fitting to her character.

492
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:33,300
She pulled the trigger herself.

493
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,850
You're saying she murdered Battalion Commander Won Gi Chun?

494
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:50,510
That's correct.

495
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:55,410
The day of the murder, the defendant forged the entry log for her alibi.

496
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:59,070
She ordered the witness to do so.

497
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:02,650
I submit the evidence.

498
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:15,690
There is also one more.

499
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:19,050
Witness.

500
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:22,730
Can you really testify?

501
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,180
Yes.

502
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:32,750
The division commander

503
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,700
ordered me to murder Military Prosecutor Cha Wu In too.

504
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:50,100
I rest my case.

505
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:06,360
The last card that will completely destroy No Hwa Yeong is here.

506
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,470
Do you have to be so happy?

507
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:24,540
Yes. A 15-year sentence and endless rows of other trials.

508
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:27,880
You pull the uniform off well too.

509
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:32,320
What the hell do you have against me?

510
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,690
I have nothing to do with your parents' death.

511
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:37,120
It was all No Hwa Yeong's doing.

512
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,190
Can you say the same thing about Chairman Cha Ho Cheol's death?

513
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,210
You manipulated the case as the lead prosecutor.

514
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:50,380
You framed him with crimes he didn't commit. Plus the press conference with Won Gi Chun.

515
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:53,210
You're the one who wrote the testimony for him.

516
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:54,990
That's it.

517
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:56,390
I didn't do any more.

518
00:44:56,390 --> 00:45:01,020
Fine. I heard you're going to appeal?

519
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:07,700
I'll make you an offer you can't refuse this time.

520
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:22,110
I request the witness who was involved in Chairman Cha Ho Cheol's murder case

521
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:24,090
from six years ago to be summoned.

522
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:28,090
It's IM Defense's previous CEO, Yong Mun Gu.

523
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:41,610
Objection.

524
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:46,400
The witness is still imprisoned and had a big argument with the defendant.

525
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,940
It's highly likely he will bear false witness out of spite.

526
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:54,430
The witness volunteered to testify to straighten the past.

527
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:58,630
Please allow the witness' courageous decision, Your Honor.

528
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,470
I will allow it.

529
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:02,470
Please be seated.

530
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:18,740
Were you the lead prosecutor in the case that IM Defense's Chairman Cha Ho Cheol was involved in six years ago?

531
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:19,980
I was.

532
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:24,230
Was the defendant, No Hwa Yeong, involved in that case?

533
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:28,400
Yes. She was very clearly involved.

534
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:30,980
Clearly.

535
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:34,400
Please explain the situation from back then.

536
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,660
I received an order from the defendant.

537
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:40,810
It was to frame Chairman Cha Ho Cheol with corruption.

538
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:42,730
I was told to manipulate the case.

539
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:46,570
So? Did you comply?

540
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:47,910
Yes.

541
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:52,380
I drank from the poison chalice for guaranteed success.

542
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:57,320
Your Honor, I'll submit evidence to back this testimony.

543
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:09,940
Witness. Do you have evidence related to the solicitation of murder?

544
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:15,440
I have recordings of the calls that the defendant and I shared.

545
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,260
I will submit them right after the trial is over.

546
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:24,000
Are you claiming you only manipulated the case but had nothing to do with the solicitation of murder?

547
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,110
Yes. I found out only after Chairman Cha died.

548
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:31,000
I, No Hwa Yeong,

549
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,800
have never lived a single moment for myself.

550
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:38,030
I only worked for the nation and people.

551
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:41,530
The country's peace and stability you all enjoy.

552
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:43,340
Who gave that to you?

553
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:46,390
This country is always at the brink of war.

554
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:51,430
Do you even know what it's like to live as a soldier?

555
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:57,080
I considered rank and commands equal to my life in order to uphold military discipline.

556
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:00,530
I tried my best to train strong soldiers.

557
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:05,380
But this is how I'm repaid for all that?

558
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:08,260
This all happened because of that wicked woman.

559
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,680
No Hwa Yeong is truly wicked.

560
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,370
You ordered it!

561
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:14,710
You ruined my life!

562
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:17,000
You're my life's biggest mistake, you hear me?

563
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,950
What? You did what for your country? Serve it?

564
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:20,210
Order.

565
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:22,390
Silence!

566
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:24,700
What the hell are you saying!

567
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,490
The prosecution may continue.

568
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,860
For the past 20 years,

569
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:36,470
the defendant used her title as a soldier to commit a number of horrible crimes.

570
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:42,720
Using her rank, she concealed her crimes in a meticulous and crafty way.

571
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:47,160
The defendant always took pride in her job, calling it her identity.

572
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:52,020
But she tore herself down because of her blind greed for power.

573
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:58,300
It's because of soldiers like the defendant that the military has failed to change.

574
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,790
Rank

575
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:06,460
and command only exist for this nation.

576
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:11,870
I'll make it clear that they can't be used for personal goals.

577
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:15,250
With that, the prosecution

578
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:19,970
requests that she receive the death penalty.

579
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:38,500
Doctor! Mr. No Tae Nam is awake.

580
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:54,860
I find the defendant guilty for all the charges brought up by the prosecution.

581
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:59,530
The court will announce the sentencing.

582
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:05,680
I sentence the defendant to the death penalty.

583
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,460
Don't touch me.

584
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:20,050
I will walk out on my own.

585
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:31,320
Prosecution

586
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:59,540
♫ The nostalgic memories gradually come to mind ♫

587
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:01,470
Direction to court

588
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:08,170
♫ Still I let go of all of feelings ♫

589
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:13,660
♫ I feel I am falling into a deep place ♫

590
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:18,090
I'm going to quit being a military prosecutor.

591
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:18,980
What?

592
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:23,700
I'm going to disclose everything I did as the Red Head.

593
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:25,270
Do you really have to?

594
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:26,560
You only did that to criminals—

595
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:30,090
Yes, I must.

596
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:33,710
I started fully prepared to do so.

597
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:39,930
I no longer have the right to wear the robe.

598
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,220
Prosecutor Cha.

599
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:45,130
Prosecutor Do.

600
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:50,190
♫ Dive in ♫

601
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,750
♫ With your strong arms ♫

602
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:59,920
She's coming out!
♫  remove me from the approaching reality  ♫

603
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,480
♫ Hold me ♫

604
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:08,100
Starting today, I, Cha Wu In, will step down from my position as 4th Division's military prosecutor.

605
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:12,050
I had been wearing a red-haired wig

606
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:16,880
to punish criminals that the law failed to.

607
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:22,500
4th Division

608
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:30,100
One year later

609
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,520
I think I'm going to die!

610
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,330
Su Gyeong. Let's induce labor like the doctor said.

611
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:40,890
My heart feels like it's going to be ripped out.

612
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:43,770
It's possible even if I'm over 40.

613
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:47,730
I'm going to do it without any help.

614
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,150
Hello?

615
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:57,040
The 4th Division is doing fine without me, right?

616
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,000
Okay, hold on.

617
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,240
Bae Man!

618
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,470
Aunt. Hang in there. Hang on!

619
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:03,270
You can do it!

620
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:05,770
Restricted Area

621
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:11,330
Thank you.

622
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:31,240
What the?

623
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:36,420
What's the use of convicting someone when they're released so fast?

624
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:39,780
They reduced my sentence for being a model prisoner.

625
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:44,140
Why is this country so generous to economic offenders?

626
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:47,700
I'm curious too. But my intention wasn't bad.

627
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,990
They really considered the extenuating circumstances.

628
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:55,930
Hate the crime, not the person. That saying is perfect for this.

629
00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:58,200
I paid for all my crimes.

630
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,680
You should've let me know, I'd have bought you tofu.

631
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:06,080
Actually, how about we have tofu stew and soju?

632
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,320
What a shame.

633
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:12,080
I don't like tofu.

634
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,830
Where are you going?

635
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:21,420
I'm going straight to America. I'll start over from the bottom again.

636
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:25,050
I've given IM Defense back to Wu In now.

637
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:28,470
Bye then.

638
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,530
Oh, right. Wu In's coming to Korea tomorrow.

639
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:40,480
Safe flight.

640
00:54:54,610 --> 00:54:57,450
The prisoner has refused to see you.

641
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:04,930
Could you perhaps deliver this then?

642
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:15,010
Mother. Are you doing well?

643
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:17,270
I'm doing well too.

644
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:20,130
Bolt, whom you never once hugged.

645
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:26,410
The only family I had. I gave him to Prosecutor Do Bae Man.

646
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:31,900
I cried a lot when I did, but I suddenly felt like an adult.

647
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:38,750
I hope you're comfortable there, Mother.

648
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:41,530
I don't know when it'll be,

649
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:44,950
but I really want to see you,

650
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:46,770
Mom.

651
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:05,940
Boarding announcement.

652
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:11,290
Please come to departure gate 1.

653
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:12,720
Where is she?

654
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:18,420
Flight 489 is now boarding.

655
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,470
Wu In!

656
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:26,050
You came right on time.

657
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:31,050
I'm glad I saw you before I left.

658
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,610
It must've been hard.

659
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:47,650
I'm fine. I hope there's no more avenging left for you to do.

660
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:50,620
I hope IM Defense will do well too.

661
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:52,150
I mean it.

662
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:56,140
I bought a ton of IM stocks. You better do well.

663
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:59,210
I'll be watching until the very end.

664
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:03,400
You haven't changed since the day we met.

665
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,640
Except for one thing.

666
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:18,330
It finally found its real owner.

667
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:32,100
You are truly a great friend to me.

668
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,010
I'll have to get going.

669
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:41,180
Okay. Keep in touch.

670
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:10,700
No Tae Nam handed all of his shares over to Wu In.

671
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:34,840
Bolt!

672
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:41,050
Thanks, No Tae Nam.

673
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:43,840
I'm sure it wasn't easy saying goodbye to Bolt.

674
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:48,040
Bolt is the most loyal and brave dog out there.

675
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:50,450
Being a military dog suits him much more.

676
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:54,370
So please take good care of him.

677
00:58:54,370 --> 00:58:56,300
All right.

678
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:02,700
I heard you handed over all of your shares to Wu In?

679
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:07,450
I got them because of my mom anyway.

680
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:13,030
My mom lost everything, so it didn't feel right to keep it.

681
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:16,450
Is it still the same with your mother?

682
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,850
Yes.

683
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:23,320
I'm sure she'll see me one day.

684
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:31,500
IM Defense Industry
President Cha Wu In

685
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:07,560
Dad?

686
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:14,400
My daughter. It was tough, right?

687
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,170
Dad...

688
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:20,700
You suffered a lot.

689
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:27,660
And thank you, my daughter.

690
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:37,120
Things will get much harder when you're sitting there.

691
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,370
You can do a good job, right?

692
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:48,360
Yes, I will. Please watch over me.

693
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:01,830
You have a visitor.

694
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:04,160
A visitor?

695
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,260
I have a lot of work today.

696
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:08,520
Who is it?

697
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:12,490
She said she's from the 4th Division's legal office.

698
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:14,370
Shall I politely ask for her to leave?

699
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:18,110
No. Please cancel all my other appointments for the day.

700
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:21,680
Yes, ma'am. I'll bring her in right away.

701
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:27,040
Prosecutor Cha!

702
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:32,250
Oh, I mean Chairwoman Cha.

703
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:35,770
Section Chief Ahn. Have you been well?

704
01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:39,360
How could you not contact me once?

705
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,520
It's also not fair to become so cool.

706
01:01:43,330 --> 01:01:45,940
Is Section Chief Yun doing well?

707
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:48,080
He's the same.

708
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:53,440
Aren't you curious about Prosecutor Do?

709
01:01:56,790 --> 01:02:00,220
Are you Prosecutor Do Bae Man? The one who refused the special promotion?

710
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:04,000
Captain Do Bae Man. Yes, ma'am.

711
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,110
What's your reason?

712
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:10,530
Every soldier wishes for a high rank.

713
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:15,860
I believe military prosecutors are guardians of justice within the military who can refuse rank and command.

714
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:21,360
I want to do better at the job the people have bestowed me with.

715
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:25,510
Also, I still have many things left to do

716
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:27,340
as a military prosecutor.

717
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:31,330
You're brave like a Doberman, just as I heard.

718
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:34,410
I will command 4th Division to the best of my abilities too.

719
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:36,120
Yes, ma'am!

720
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,480
Unity!

721

It's me.

730
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:23,830
You still look great in uniform.

731
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:30,230
What? You said you were busy.

732
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:34,020
Gosh, I haven't seen you in awhile and you've become a different person now, prosecutor Cha.

733
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:38,080
I'm no longer Prosecutor Cha. I'm a civilian.

734
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:41,100
Meaning I'm no longer your subordinate.

735
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,550
Right, that's true.

736
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:45,370
You're not.

737
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:50,690
My revenge is over and I got my company back.

738
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:56,460
Now we meet again like this. So let me make an offer you can't refuse.
