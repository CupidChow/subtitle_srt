Military Prosecutor Doberman

8
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,420
Drop the gun.

9
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,350
Drop the gun, bastard.

10
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,250
Mom. Mom.

11
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,230
What are you going to do? What are you going to do, bastard?

12
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:15,230
One Week Earlier

13
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,980
However, as my father's daughter,

14
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,930
it was an incredibly hard decision.

15
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,720
It was tough.

16
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:37,830
And I'm sorry for not being able to tell Prosecutor Do Bae Man in advance.

17
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,710
- I am deeply sorry.
- That's enough. Stop.

18
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,890
You may stop talking.

19
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,660
I don't need all the other reasons.

20
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:04,950
So you can stop talking, Cha Wu In.

21
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,100
What are you two doing?

22
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,030
Unity.

23
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,560
We're in the middle of clearing up the court records.

24
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,770
In any case, in every trial you always assign me something to do, huh?

25
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:36,390
It was you who called the division commander's adjutant as a witness, wasn't it?

26
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,780
It was for me to do my best as a military prosecutor, as I always said.

27
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:45,930
Pros Cha has completed another tough trial. You should compliment her.

28
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,210
All right.

29
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,790
Cha Wu In, you are amazing! It was amazing.

30
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:56,120
Look here. Now there isn't anyone in the 4th Division who doesn't know her.

31
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,020
Detective Do Su Kyeong will be visiting your office soon for trial material.

32
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,020
Huh? Auntie... Detective Do?

33
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:10,130
Jeez. I should practice being brave. Seriously.

34
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,120
Oh, shut it. I mean...

35
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,640
His inner voice is rather loud.

36
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,880
Although I expected that No Hwa Yeong would hit Hong Mu Seop hard,

37
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,270
I didn't think it would be so soon.

38
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:27,710
A full-scale war will break out within the Patriotic Society, won't it?

39
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,710
It's disappointing one person is being excluded from the hostilities.

40
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,850
Yong Mun Gu. Now that he was stabbed in the back at the trial,

41
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,210
he will show his naked face to No Hwa Yeong.

42
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:43,320
I am looking forward to how Yong Mun Gu, who was waiting for a rift between No Hwa Yeong and the Patriotic Society,

43
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,490
will approach No Hwa Yeong.

44
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,580
One of the items confiscated from me in the search and seizure must be an SSD hard drive.

45
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,960
- That's my response.
- What's in the hard drive?

46
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,550
A fatal blow to No Hwa Yeong.

47
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:10,000
Prosecutor Kang

48
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,420
Yes, Seonbaenim.

49
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,610
Thanks for the quick search and seizure warrant for Kang's Solution.

50
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:21,820
As you instructed, we're going through the allegations thoroughly.

51
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,430
There's a new factor, so could you slow it down a little?

52
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,940
Pardon?

53
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,180
Oh. I understand what you're saying.

54
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,340
But the thing is...

55
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:43,900
Is it possible for me to see one item among the items seized from Kang's Solution?

56
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,620
Are you still wearing that watch?

57
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,110
It saved my life. I exchanged it for my life.

58
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,570
Episode 13

59
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,990
You're here?

60
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,830
Hey, No Hwa Yeong. Try to explain yourself to me right now, Bitch!

61
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:48,550
Why did you attend the trial for the corps commander and ruin the trial?

62
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,800
If you can't convince me here and now, prepare for the worst!

63
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,540
You said you would use both a sword and shield and guaranteed he would win.

64
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,940
Didn't you hear what the Minister just said. He said to explain immediately.

65
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:05,530
Calm your anger and take a look at this first, Minister.

66
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:08,090
What use is this article?

67
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,220
Read it to the Minister, Vice Corps Commander.

68
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,350
This little...

69
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,520
"Commander No Hwa Yeong's courageous action on behalf of the two non-commissioned officers,

70
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,220
who suffered incredibly, was a spark."

71
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,460
"Thanks to that, the divisive blame for the army's irresponsibility

72
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:37,790
has been dispelled throughout the country."

73
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,050
The next part is important.

74
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,070
"A key official at the Blue House (President of Korea's office) said

75
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:51,880
Minister Lee Jae Sik's initiation of a drive to revolutionize military culture,

76
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,850
which even included setting up a special investigation team, should be commended."

77
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:02,490
M-M-Minister, the situation which you worried about has been completely reversed.

78
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:07,340
Minister, have you also known about the sadistic nature of the corps commander,

79
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,640
who treats his men as disposable for a long time?

80
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,380
You just pretended not to know.

81
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,670
Vice Corps Commander, who was closer than anyone to Corps Commander Hong

82
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,590
will not be able to deny knowledge.

83
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:25,210
My subordinates cannot be only ones who were abused.

84
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:30,000
This time we must self-purify within the army

85
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,290
and you must put a period on it.

86
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,250
A period?

87
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:43,410
You must remove the corps commander from the Patriotic Society.

88
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:52,180
I'll handle all the risky situation of dealing with people.

89
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,440
The only thing you have to do

90
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,110
is take care of showing off.

91
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,520
Get in a little bit later.

92
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,710
I never expected the situation would turn around like this.

93
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,960
Did the division commander really testify for the sake of her subordinates?

94
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,570
Or was this intended to demolish the corps commander?

95
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,860
I think it was the latter.

96
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,950
One thing is obvious. She is sitting on top of my head

97
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,560
trying to manipulating me.

98
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,460
That's right. Right!

99
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:49,030
I think you raised a fire fox with a thousand tails.

100
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:53,970
At this time, what do you think about cutting her off also?

101
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:59,610
Idiot. That's why you will never beat her.

102
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:04,310
Don't you see it's turning out like this because I can't get rid of her?

103
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,260
Oh, No Hwa Yeong. Damn.

104
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:12,060
So what will you do now, Minister?

105
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,470
May I ask you something?

106
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,080
What is it?

107
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:22,460
I wonder how you hide your feelings like that in front of No Hwa Yeong.

108
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,670
The person who murdered your parents is right in front of you.

109
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,680
There are times when I also want to personally strangle her immediately.

110
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,760
Just as you wanted to end everything with a single bullet.

111
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,790
Not long ago, my father appeared in a dream.

112
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,880
It was a very long time since I last saw him. My father.

113
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:53,490
What did he say?

114
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,890
"You must win

115
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,730
and you must win righteously."

116
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,060
Let's go in.

117
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:10,300
No Hwa Yeong said something strange to me.

118
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,980
What did she say?

119
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:17,060
She said there was something I don't know about in her relationship with my dad.

120
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:21,630
But the two never had any relationship.

121
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,720
Even in my dad's keepsakes I don't see a single photo.

122
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,360
Don't pay too much attention to what she says.

123
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,850
Let's go in.

124
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,670
I'm saying there are things you don't know.

125
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,230
You were too young at that time.

126
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:59,260
We could've had a completely different relationship than now.

127
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,430
Praying Major No Hwa Yeong has peace. From Cha Ho Cheol.

128
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,170
Yes, I've arrived.
[4th Infantry Division]

129
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:56,870
Chairman Cha died on the scene. There was a passenger with him.

130
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,680
Passenger? Who is it?

131
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,170
It was his daughter. They say she had come back from the United States three days ago.

132
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:06,030
Did she also die with him?

133
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,300
She is unconscious.

134
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:12,290
Looking at the scene, it looks like there isn't any chance.

135
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,510
General?

136
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,950
Thank you. Thank you.

137
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,530
- I'll make good use of it.
- Tae Nam, thank you.

138
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,360
Thank you.

139
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,320
Lawyer Yong, how did you get in here? Civilians are prohibited from entering.

140
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,540
This is the general's division. Nothing is impossible.

141
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,590
You called me a few days ago. That's why I came.

142
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,550
Then did Mother send you here?

143
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:56,600
I guess not. My mother wouldn't do that.

144
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,770
When I think about it, I don't have anyone but Lawyer Yong.

145
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:03,420
Chairman, you're having a tough time in the army, right?

146
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:08,610
Now that you have started military service, let me give you a tip.

147
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,610
- Tip?
- You don't understand the army, do you?

148
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,810
How does one understand this place? How?

149
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,490
That's why it is hard.

150
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:21,040
the military is not a place to understand. It's a place to give up.

151
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,120
When you said you'd give me a tip, how can you be saying that?

152
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,160
Never understanding a monster like your mother and ultimately giving up.

153
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,290
Just like you now.

154
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,550
You... just now...

155
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,700
Your having not gone crazy under your mom,

156
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:40,540
and not going crazy here, too, is amazing, Tae Nam.

157
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,020
No Tae Nam.

158
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:04,050
- Private No Tae Nam.
- Follow me for a personal interview.

159
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,090
Why did you collapse last time you were on guard duty?

160
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:22,340
Sergeant An Su Ho was the paired superior for you.

161
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,430
Did something happen?

162
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:32,280
Stop whining like a baby, you punk!

163
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:37,040
You want to know something really funny?

164
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:47,030
No matter how much I torment you, the world won't believe it.

165
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,720
They'll think the opposite.

166
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:09,440
It was nothing, sir. I just felt dizzy for a moment.

167
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,060
Are you sure? This won't become an issue later, right?

168
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,900
Yes, sir.

169
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,230
We're good then. You can leave.

170
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,520
Did you do as I told you?

171
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,540
I said nothing happened.

172
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,630
Good job.

173
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,540
You even fixed the way you talked. You sound like a real soldier now.

174
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:51,410
Don't forget what I said. If anything happens here, everyone will suspect you first.

175
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,430
Because...

176
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,170
you're No Tae Nam, the deserter.

177
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,120
That bastard.

178
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:21,290
Why are you here instead of the Minister?

179
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,490
He has some important business, so I came instead.

180
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:33,430
What could be more important than me? The Patriotic Society is at risk of being uprooted!

181
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:36,690
I guess you still need a reality check.

182
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,930
What? You little—

183
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:43,140
I wasn't going to say this.

184
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:47,500
The minister has been invited to a luncheon at the Blue House

185
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:52,060
to show him support in the special investigation of abuse of power in the military.

186
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:57,760
Which is why I came in his place to deliver his message.

187
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,720
He ordered me to deliver these words.

188
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,560
It's an old saying.

189
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:14,290
Drive out what's unclean to bring in what's clean.

190
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:17,130
The Minister has spoken.

191
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:20,920
He also said this is the path that the Patriotic Society must take.

192
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,570
Goodbye then.

193
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:29,610
You, Heo Kang In. How could you insult me like this too?

194
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:36,880
A soldier is loyal to his superior only when he's stronger.

195
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:43,420
Let's be honest. It's not like you were the backbone of the Patriotic Society.

196
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,620
A joint investigation with military prosecutors and civilian police. This is right up my alley.

197
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,990
Now that we've blown the corps commander away...

198
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,610
it feels like justice has been served.

199
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:16,700
Does this mean I was born to be a soldier too?

200
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,460
Why the long-face though? Are you feeling bitter?

201
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:29,800
Well, I wouldn't say bitter.

202
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:35,460
Listen, Auntie. Do you know the agony of waiting for the higher-ups' orders after a trial?

203
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,930
Do you have any idea?

204
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,230
- Unity.
- Unity.

205
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:45,690
You're here. I brought this just in case you need it to investigate Hong Gyeong Ok.

206
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:49,620
- Daebak.
- What now? What did you bring?

207
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,960
Cha Wu In, you always act before me. That's your problem!

208
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,050
You don't know how lucky you are to have a subordinate like her.

209
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,810
This is Seo Ju Hyeok.

210
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,990
Division Commander! Unity!

211
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:11,040
Sorry? Thank you.

212
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:15,080
Thank you, Division Commander. Unity!

213
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:25,430
Cha Wu In. I'm getting promoted one rank.

214
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:29,210
The Division Commander has signed on it.

215
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,990
- Congratulations, sir.
- Yes!

216
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,990
- Let's wrap it up now.
- Okay.

217
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,490
All right.

218
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,490
Where did you go so early?

219
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,900
I'll tell you after lunch.

220
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,400
Shall we eat out? What do you want?

221
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,410
I'm not sure. Let's head out first.

222
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,930
Did Sang Gi and Section Chief Ahn go somewhere?

223
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,220
They're going to get lunch? Together?

224
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,850
They didn't even think to look for us, right?

225
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,000
The curiosity is killing me.

226
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,380
We'll have to confirm it with our own eyes then.

227
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,930
Yes, I agree.

228
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,620
It's my treat today.

229
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,500
Hey, Prosecutor Cha.

230
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,020
What's wrong?

231
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:42,590
This is it? I would've ordered a course meal then.

232
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,320
Order a tangsuyuk (Chinese sweet sour pork) for me too.

233
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,730
Yes, okay, I'll do that.

234
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,280
No, wait.

235
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:59,560
♫ hold on the moments which are becoming blurred one by one ♫

236
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,940
This is your reward for completing your second hunt.

237
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,840
Enjoy your meal.

238
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,510
Yes, thank you, Master.

239
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,310
Oh, wait.

240
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:15,700
Chili powder is a must with jjajangmyeon (Chinese black bean noodles).

241
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,800
I don't really like red stuff.

242
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,520
Enjoy it.

243
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,740
Those two. The way they look at each other has changed.

244
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,060
It's always like that with dating in the workplace.

245
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,380
Everyone knows except for themselves.

246
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:33,220
Those two don't know. They really don't.

247
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,740
Hold on a minute.

248
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:43,920
Gosh. Section Chief Ahn, the game is over.

249
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,490
- They're sharing their meals.
- What?

250
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:51,730
We were too busy with work, so we didn't pay enough attention to them.

251
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,230
All right, what should we eat? Shall we order jjajangmyeon and jjambbong  (spicy seafood noodles)?

252
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,340
When I'm depressed...

253
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,400
You eat ulmyeon*?
(Noodles in thick broth, Korean sounds like "cry.")

254
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,500
When I have a lot on my mind?

255
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,460
- You eat fried rice.
- Tang, tang, tang!

256
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,030
Tangsuyuk! It hurts.

257
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,040
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

258
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,100
Lieutenant Colonel Seo Ju Hyeok.

259
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,350
So cool. I'm so proud of myself.

260
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,860
I prepared it for you.

261
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,730
Eat a lot.

262
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:34,530
Congratulations on getting promoted, Honey.

263
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,840
Love shot.

264
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,760
Amazing. Take a bite, Honey. No, you first.

265
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,100
Okay, thank you.

266
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,780
It's delicious.

267
00:22:55,470 --> 00:23:00,900
I have no one to share this happy moment with me.

268
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:08,670
Who will help this successful lonely man?

269
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,880
What a beautiful day. It must be spring.

270
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,360
Unity.

271
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:26,600
What were you going to tell me earlier?

272
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,530
Things are going as we predicted.

273
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,340
You mean the Patriotic Society?

274
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:35,910
Yes. Hong Mu Seop asked for me.

275
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:40,850
I'm impressed, Do Bae Man. You got me locked up for three years

276
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:46,000
just for having my subordinates run a few errands for me and hitting them a couple of times.

277
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:53,640
It was a big win for me since I revealed your true self and stripped you of your rank.

278
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:59,730
Also, we're getting a ton of reports from soldiers who were abused by you.

279
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:05,910
Think of the three years as an appetizer. The real meal hasn't even started.

280
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:12,190
I found out why you did this even after you promised your loyalty to me.

281
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:14,440
I expected you would.

282
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:19,170
You were the son of my direct subordinate investigators.

283
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:22,340
I was your target from the very beginning.

284
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:27,950
You can't forget about No Hwa Yeong who benefitted from my hard work.

285
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:31,880
- No Hwa Yeong.
- Also don't forget about the Patriotic Society either.

286
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:41,550
From now on, the military prosecutor will not use honorifics in speaking to you, a criminal, got it?

287
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:44,310
You. The Patriotic Society abandoned you, right?

288
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,410
Why do you think that?

289
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,400
Because you called me.

290
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,990
You're probably trying to find a way to save yourself since you were abandoned by them.

291
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:56,290
Isn't that right, Corps Commander?

292
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,580
Your real target is No Hwa Yeong, isn't it?

293
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:05,340
I just got caught in that process. It was No Hwa Yeong who killed your parents.

294
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:11,030
You must know that she took control of Cha Ho Cheol's company too?

295
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:16,500
So aren't you curious about why she even killed him too?

296
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,890
She could've just taken the company and kicked him out.

297
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:25,340
Tell me, what did Hong Mu Seop say?

298
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:29,410
Is there another reason why she killed Chairman Cha?

299
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:33,670
Cha Ho Cheol threatened No Hwa Yeong.

300
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:36,710
That's basically threatening the Patriotic Society.

301
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:42,790
Cha Ho Cheol gathered documents of corruption within the Patriotic Society like crazy.

302
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:46,270
It was like a Patriotic Society X-File. That was what we called it.

303
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:49,550
Patriotic Society X-File?

304
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:54,380
That was completed about six years ago. He used that to threaten No Hwa Yeong?

305
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:59,380
That's right. If that X-File had been revealed then,

306
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:02,310
then the Patriotic Society wouldn't have existed up to now.

307
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:09,130
No Hwa Yeong silenced everything and took control of the company.

308
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:12,230
She got rid of Cha Ho Cheol who was a pain.

309
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:15,790
You were right, Do Bae Man.

310
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,460
The Patriotic Society abandoned me.

311
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:26,640
I must see them sink, from in here, with my own eyes.

312
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:30,430
Father tried to destroy the Patriotic Society?

313
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:34,100
The X-File of the Patriotic Society that your father made.

314
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,880
Apparently he threatened No Hwa Yeong and the Patriotic Society with that.

315
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:42,330
How much of his claim can we trust?

316
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:46,400
Did your father leave anything behind—

317
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,450
You're curious if there was anything related to the Patriotic Society X-File?

318
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:54,410
No, there wasn't.

319
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:58,650
I thought so. There's no way you would miss it.

320
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:05,380
Then there are three possibilities. That file has disappeared forever,

321
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:10,840
No Hwa Yeong has it, or someone else does.

322
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,120
I doubt No Hwa Yeong has it.

323
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:20,000
If she had taken it from Father, she would have used it to secure a much higher position.

324
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,580
Hold on.

325
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:28,700
I just thought of a person who could get his hands on the X-File.

326
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:34,170
It can't be... right?

327
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:39,970
I doubt it. It can't be No Tae Nam.

328
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:41,430
Shoot!

329
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:49,100
- What? Say that again.
- What is it?

330
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,610
I did everything as I was told. I even went in the sleeping bag.

331
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:55,820
But I won't have you insult my mother. Apologize.

332
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,500
Gosh, take a look at this punk.

333
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,610
You know how to put on a show too.

334
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:06,730
Hey. I'm the only villain in your eyes, right?

335
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:09,220
But it's all your fault.

336
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:14,020
Why did you put up with it? It only made it more fun.

337
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:17,130
You see! This is what I'm talking about. This is it!

338
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:20,460
I can't do this any more once I'm discharged.

339
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,920
- Should I just enlist again?
- Yes, sir!

340
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,670
I think you should do that.

341
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:35,730
You shouldn't have put up with it. Why did you?

342
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:37,600
Shall we finish our conversation from before?

343
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,980
Pyeon. Your mom sells tteokbokki (spicy ricecake) at Seonmun Station, right?

344
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:47,780
I went to try it while I was on leave so I can make a scene once I'm discharged.

345
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:52,610
- It seemed like she hurt her legs.
- Aigoo.

346
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:54,350
You f***ing bastard.

347
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:59,660
Hey, I'm kidding. It's a joke.

348
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:05,640
- Pyeon. You can't tell the difference between a joke and the real thing?
- Just let it go.

349
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:10,430
Continue to put up with everything while you're here. For your mother's sake.

350
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,420
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

351
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:17,310
- Let's go!
- Hey, over here.

352
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:20,680
- Give me the ball.
- Nice.

353
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,300
I can see clearly.

354
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,100
Don't put up with it from now on.

355
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,450
Are you sure you left it here?

356
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:17,060
You didn't leave it at your residence?

357
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:20,210
CEO Kang must've taken it.

358
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:27,820
The receiver cannot be reached. You will be directed to voicemail.

359
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,580
The receiver cannot be reached. You will be directed to voicemail.

360
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:36,270
Why didn't he tell us? What was he thinking, taking something so important?

361
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:40,250
He was probably looking for more material since the hard drive had nothing.

362
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:44,230
This is ridiculous. Darn it.

363
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:51,840
It just arrived, prosecutor Kang. I'll see you at the headquarters soon.

364
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:26,010
Even when you framed Chairman Cha Ho Cheol. I stepped up

365
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:28,780
and lied in court. It was all

366
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:32,880
solely for you, Division Commander. That's not all.

367
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,440
Twenty years ago. The accident you caused with the truck.

368
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,520
I'm talking about the accident where you crashed into the young soldier couple.

369
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,400
What is this?

370
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,110
The crimes you committed six years ago as a prosecutor.

371
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,450
It's a recording of my past?

372
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:00,550
And that's Won Gi Chun's secret safe.

373
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,580
CEO Kang. Did you take Won Gi Chun's file box?

374
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,830
The corruption charges against Chairman Cha Ho Cheol that you framed him with.

375
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,730
Won Gi Chun was collecting this stuff.

376
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:24,990
He probably kept it to save himself if things went wrong.

377
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:29,290
CEO Kang. Now that you've turned your back on them, you've become ruthless.

378
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:32,060
You brought me a present I never could've expected.

379
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:40,440
I gave you more than you expected. Now it's my turn to receive more than I expected.

380
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:45,450
I have a meeting with Minister Lee Jae Sik soon. Join us then.

381
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:51,710
You'll get a picture of what I have envisioned in my head.

382
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:04,790
Vice President. How is the company doing?

383
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:09,680
I guess CEO Kang hid it from you. The prosecution came in with a search and seizure warrant.

384
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,530
Search and seizure?

385
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:17,410
Yes. But luckily we took care of urgent matters, thanks to CEO Yong Mun Gu.

386
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:22,970
CEO Kang went to IM Defense to meet CEO Yong just now.

387
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:28,380
Thank you again for the unexpected present.

388
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,410
Keep it up.

389
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,740
Bye.

390
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:53,000
Haven't we been friends for a long time?

391
00:33:53,610 --> 00:34:00,750
I thought we were the only family we had—someone we could lean on when things got tough.

392
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,320
You don't need my help anymore.

393
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,380
You have Do Bae Man.

394
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,320
You're blaming Prosecutor Do?

395
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:21,820
I only helped you to repay my debt to Chairman Cha.

396
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,960
But you don't need me anymore.

397
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,280
Also, this is getting exhausting.

398
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,830
You should've told me if your company was struggling.

399
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:33,780
How could you join hands with Yong Mun Gu?

400
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:41,380
I gave the files to him to save my employees who are relying solely on me.

401
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,210
Oh, right.

402
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:49,490
Here. You probably won't need it.

403
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:52,030
But I can't hold onto it anymore either.

404
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,230
It's okay.

405
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:37,420
It will be all right.

406
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,650
Do Bae Man

407
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,250
Did you meet CEO Kang?

408
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,970
Yes.

409
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:07,630
Are you still with him?

410
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:12,390
CEO Kang has joined hands with Yong Mun Gu.

411
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:14,380
What?

412
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,060
He betrayed us...

413
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:19,500
I mean, he betrayed you?

414
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,120
He used his company as his excuse.

415
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:27,050
I also think he resented me too.

416
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:32,740
I'm sure Yong Mun Gu approached him first.

417
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,470
He wanted to split us up.

418
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:42,780
Cha Wu In. Are you crying?

419
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,840
I'll take care of this.

420
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,230
This problem is between me and CEO Kang.

Stop talking. I don't want to hear anything that you say.

Tell me. What did Yong Mun Gu offer you?

436

It was an offer I couldn't refuse.

437
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,220

Also, don't ever let Cha Wu In see you again.

He is.

458
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,560
It's an honor to meet you, Minister. My name is Kang Ha Jun.

459
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,950
You're not even 30 years old?

460
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,460
You're a very talented man.

461
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,800
I'm trying my best to develop into a good businessman.

462
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,320
I look forward to working with you, sir.

463
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,520
Not only is he extremely smart, he's also talented.

464
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,890
You can count on him.

465
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:49,980
There's a saying, "It's a waste to give youth to a young man."

466
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,610
Being young can be a big risk too.

467
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:56,620
But he looks like he's got guts.

468
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,740
He doesn't seem faint-hearted.

469
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,250
I'll vouch for him.

470
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:08,090
In between the orders you give to IM Defense,

471
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:11,240
CEO Kang Ha Jun's Kang's Solution will be there.

472
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,370
I will do my best to not cause you and CEO Yong any trouble.

473
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,440
Tell me. What's your relationship with him?

474
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,920
Friends?

475
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:24,170
I've never seen business between friends end well.

476
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:29,820
I'll become friends with CEO Yong through this business.

477
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,170
- I want to look indifferent.
- Noted.

478
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:42,480
- Make me look chic.
- Got it.

479
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,130
- Did you get the shot?
- Let's take one more.

480
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,440
- Okay.
- Post it.

481
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,340
- Hashtag, daily.
- Okay.

482
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,000
- Hashtag, every day.
- All right.

483
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,560
- Hashtag, Seol Ak.
- Okay.

484
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,140
Hashtag... what?

485
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:59,130
- Isn't he the man who got five cases?
- Yes.

486
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:03,330
Who's the new face?

487
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:06,320
Don't tell me he's my rival?

488
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,860
He doesn't look hip like us.

489
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,830
Are you okay?

490
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:42,980
I'm trying... to be okay.

491
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:48,490
He's your long-time friend who helped you with this.

492
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:51,570
You probably don't want to accept it.

493
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:55,970
He did it for the company and his employees.

494
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:01,820
I'm trying to tell myself that he had no other choice.

495
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,700
My father protected IM for a long time

496
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:07,480
as a businessman.

497
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,770
It's making me ask myself

498
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:13,420
how he endured all those years.

499
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:19,440
Yong Mun Gu will know all the information we know now.

500
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:24,390
I'm sorry, Prosecutor Do.

501
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:32,980
Starting now, we have to become stronger.

502
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:38,230
Yong Mun Gu is now as big an enemy to us as No Hwa Yeong.

503
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:40,580
Yes.

504
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:02,740
Hey, Pyeon. Is that the only pair of glasses you own?

505
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,000
Don't be such a cheap loser.

506
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,140
Ask your mom to send you a pair.

507
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:13,440
I went to try it while I was on leave

508
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,150
so I can make a scene once I'm discharged.

509
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:20,560
- It seemed like she hurt her legs.
- Aigoo.

510
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:24,290
Do you have your cellphone with you?

511
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:25,160
What?

512
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,020
I need to call my mom.

513
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,960
What are you suddenly talking about, you punk?

514
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,440
I need to check that my mom is safe.

515
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,960
Once Sergeant Ma is discharged, then my mom...

516
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,580
My mom...

517
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:40,410
Get it together, you punk.

518
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,350
Hey. Are you playing games with me?

519
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:45,520
Once Sergeant Ma gets discharged,

520
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,340
he said he would harm my mom.

521
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:51,350
My mom... if she hurt her legs again,

522
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:53,820
she won't ever walk again.

523
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,200
Sergeant Ma is sleeping right now, you punk.

524
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,380
Get it together!

525
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,380
Sergeant Ma hasn't been discharged?

526
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:08,430
You punk.

527
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:10,370
Let it go.

528
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:14,610
Let go. One, two—

529
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,740
You bastard.

530
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,560
I'll return to duty after I find Sergeant Ma.

531
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,590
Unity.

532
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:54,560
The ambulance approached me,

533
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,220
so I fainted like this.

534
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,480
After I fainted,

535
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,590
- the EMT took me away in the ambulance.
- I see.

536
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,790
Where is Sergeant Ma?

537
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,330
- What?
- I didn't hear you say "sir."

538
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,470
Do I look like your peer?

539
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:11,420
I thought I heard Ma's voice.

540
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:14,170
Where are your manners, you punk?

541
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:17,920
Hey. This may be his last year, but he's still your superior.

542
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,600
Where is he?

543
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:23,180
Aren't you on duty though?

544
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,700
Who's rifle is that?

545
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:30,360
Wait, good point. Why does the idiot have two rifles?

546
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,960
This punk completely lost his mind.

547
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:50,540
Man, what are you doing?

548
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,550
You're going to shoot us?

549
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:55,760
Cut the crap, we know you can't pull the trigger.

550
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:00,700
- Hey. Shoot us. Do it.
- Go ahead then.

551
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:07,350
Get it together, you punk. Do you have a death wish?

552
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:23,290
That's it. That's the Pyeon we know.

553
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:28,440
Good boy, Pyeon-kachu. Get going.

554
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,780
I told you to leave.

555
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:39,830
He needs a good slapping to learn.

556
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:42,550
What an idiot.

557
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:44,370
- Let's eat.
- Let's carry on eating.

558
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:49,650
- He's only good at being Pikachu.
- Yes, he's good at that.

559
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:53,840
- Yes, he is.
- At least he's got that.

560
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,260
- The 100,000 volts—
- Grenade!

561
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,980
I won't put up with this anymore.

562
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:05,380
If I do, my mom will be in danger.

563
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:11,960
Pyeon Sang Ho! What the hell are you doing?

564
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:27,810
- What's this sound?
- Aren't those gunshots?

565
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:30,090
Which psychopath is it?

566
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:32,160
Hey, go and check.

567
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:36,040
I said go out and check!

568
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,410
You, No Tae Nam! You go.

569
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:42,240
- Hurry up, you punk!
- Get going!

570
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,440
- Is Sergeant Ma here?
- You bastard—

571
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:52,130
He's not here either.

572
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:03,810
Rifle!

573
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,230
He's not here either.

574
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:18,940
Go out and check, you punks!

575
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:21,750
Bunch of idiots.

576
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:27,580
Gather around me.

577
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:31,010
Hurry up! Stick together.

578
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:43,820
One.

579
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:48,570
Two. Three!

580
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,770
Is Sergeant Ma sleeping here?

581
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:03,310
- I thought he was discharged.
- Pyeon.

582
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:06,950
Have you gone mad? Put the gun down.

583
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:11,870
- Put it down, you punk!
- Sergeant Ma! Sergeant Ma!

584
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:15,300
What? He's not here.

585
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,420
Did he really get discharged?

586
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:20,120
Hey, calm down.

587
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,000
Calm down. Let's talk about this, Sang Ho.

588
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Hey, Pyeon!

589
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,160
No, Sang Ho.

590
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,190
- Let's talk this out.
- You have no idea how torturous it was for me

591
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:31,970
every time I was on duty with you, right?

592
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:35,150
You're all the same!

593
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:57,100
Private Pyeon. Please spare me.

594
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:01,040
Hyeong Sang Ho! Please get it together!

595
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:13,230
Only you treated me like a human being.

596
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:24,640
You were bullied by Sergeant Ma too. Let's look for him together.

597
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,520
Hyeong Sang Ho. Hyeong!

598
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:33,070
Mother. M-M-Mom...

599
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,890
What's going on?

600
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:42,660
Please s-s-save me.

601
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:45,640
What are you talking about?

602
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,000
Please save me, Mom! Please!

603
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,640
Tae Nam. Tae—

604
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:57,060
Adjutant Yang!

605
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:02,550
- Division Commander.
- Check in with 14th G.O.P.

606
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:04,270
We actually just got a report

607
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:06,470
that multiple gunshots have been heard from there.

608
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:10,660
I'll get the car ready immediately.

609
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,240
Save us!

610
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:39,740
Sergeant Ma, are you here?

611
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:58,670
I have one cubicle left.

612
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:00,930
Hurry up and answer me.

613
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:23,170
I'm sorry! I'm really sorry!

614
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:52,130
Put down the gun.

615
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:55,370
Put it down, you punk!

616
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:01,710
Put it down and raise your arms.

617
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,870
- Unity!
- Report immediately.

618
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:33,310
It's been confirmed that it wasn't an attack from the North.

619
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:35,900
We suspect it was one of our soldiers who went on a shooting spree.

620
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,920
Shooting spree?

621
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,070
How many survivors?

622
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:42,400
The soldiers out on duty on the frontlines during the shooting survived.

623
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,400
But many including the soldiers and officers

624
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,900
who were sleeping in the barracks have died.

625
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:51,110
Was Private No Tae Nam one of the survivors?

626
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,340
- Answer me.
- Yes.

627
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:57,010
He's one of them.

628
00:54:57,010 --> 00:54:59,390
But there was a confrontation with our men during the siege.

629
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:02,160
So we handcuffed him and have him in custody.

630
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,560
Private No Tae Nam in a confrontation?

631
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:06,270
That's correct, Division Commander.

632
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:08,160
Where is he now?

633
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:29,570
Mother.

634
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:30,640
M-Mom.

635
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,010
M-Mom. Mom.

636
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:37,050
Mom... Mom.

637
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:38,980
- Give us some privacy.
- Mom...

638
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:40,710
Yes, ma'am.

639
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:48,540
Mom... Mom.

640
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:52,320
Tae Nam. Did you do this?

641
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:57,310
- What?
- I asked if you were the shooter from the mass shooting.

642
00:55:57,310 --> 00:55:59,700
Did this happen because of you?

643
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,500
Hurry up and answer me!

644
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:06,500
- It's not me.
- Are you sure?

645
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:10,560
It's r-r-really not me.

646
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:13,010
I didn't do it.

647
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:16,130
That's a relief.

648
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:34,380
Mom...

649
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,750
Who is it so late?

650
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:56,550
What's all the fuss? Is it urgent?

651
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:59,240
There was a mass shooting incident at the frontline.

652
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:01,310
You should head over now.

653
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:02,550
What about Prosecutor Cha?

654
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:04,270
She's waiting outside.

655
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:06,340
Hurry on out.

656
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:15,790
We'll talk about the Ministry of Defense and the defense industry the next time we meet.

657
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:18,570
You'll understand just how big of a business it is

658
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:20,780
that you stepped into.

659
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:22,360
Great.

660
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:28,760
Oh, I thought of this after I met up with the members of the Patriotic Society.

661
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:33,590
Were there no files about them from what you got from Chairman Cha's property?

662
00:57:33,590 --> 00:57:35,370
A file?

663
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:42,950
I guess Division Commander No kept a lot of things from you.

664
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:44,870
Hurry up and tell me.

665
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:48,550
Chairman Cha has a corruption file against the Patriotic Society.

666
00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:51,760
He called it the Patriotic Society's X-File.

667
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:57,260
The Patriotic Society's X-File.

668
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:00,780
There has been a mass shooting incident...

669
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:03,150
at the 4th Infantry Division in Woncheol, Gangwon Province.

670
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:05,810
It's been reported that multiple gunshots were heard.

671
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:09,810
We anticipate that there will be a large number of fatalities. People are shocked to hear this news.

672
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:13,850
Officials don't know the details of the case yet.

673
00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:18,540
The soldier who committed the crime was captured on site.

674
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:21,040
According to the initial investigation done by the MPs

675
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,950
the first explosion was heard here.

676
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:26,580
It was in this common area.

677
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:38,710
Do Not Enter

678
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:42,650
They suspect Private Pyeon Sang Ho acted alone.

679
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:47,690
But he didn't speak during the investigation. So the interrogation was brief.

680
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:50,440
Pyeon Sang Ho. "I make myself."

681
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,260
Where was Sergeant Pyeon Sang Ho arrested?

682
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:04,590
In the bathroom. Follow me.

683
00:59:22,910 --> 00:59:25,330
I'm s-sorry. I'm sorry, okay?

684
00:59:25,330 --> 00:59:26,490
I was wrong!

685
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:28,330
Pyeon! I'm sorry, Pyeon.

686
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:31,160
I'm sorry! Truly!

687
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,350
Save me.

688
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:38,820
Say that you won't hurt my mom! Say it!

689
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:41,380
Say it! Say it!!

690
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:43,950
Say it!

691
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:45,950
Say it!

692
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,940
Section Chief Ahn said he's ready to be interrogated.

693
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:19,860
You said he didn't say a word to the MP's?

694
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:21,420
Yes, sir.

695
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:44,040
Unit, name and rank.

696
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:49,590
Private Pyeon?

697
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,550
Private Pyeon.

698
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:03,580
You miss your mom, right?

699
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:07,900
It's all right, just answer.

700
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:11,580
No, it's okay.

701
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:15,120
Get up.

702
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,160
Your mother is outside.

703
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,850
I called her.

704
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:23,310
R-Really?

705
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:30,120
Pyeon Sang Ho

706
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:34,740
What is it? Are you finding it hard to face her?

707
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,610
Sang Ho.

708
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:53,380
Mom.

709
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:04,680
Sang Ho. Why did you do it?

710
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:07,470
Why? You're a good kid. Tell me.

711
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:09,630
Why did you do it?

712
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:22,080
You should've endured it a little more.

713
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:26,360
Just a little more.

714
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:30,530
Mom...

715
01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:32,800
What are we going to do?

716
01:02:33,770 --> 01:02:36,290
My poor son.

717
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:46,150
4th Infantry Division, 24th Unit.

718
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:49,460
1st Battalion 3rd Platoon. Private Pyeon Sang Ho.

719
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:54,380
I'll read the charges against you from the MP's investigations.

720
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:58,280
Murdering a superior, attempted murder of superior,

721
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:00,070
tampering and theft of military goods,

722
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:02,890
dereliction of duty, criminal homicide,

723
01:03:02,890 --> 01:03:05,080
attempted murder.

724
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:12,850
- Who's your accomplice?
- I don't have one.

725
01:03:12,850 --> 01:03:15,080
I did it alone.

726
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:17,360
What was your motive?

727
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,830
Your motive.

728
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:30,620
They're all dead now, so does it even matter?

729
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:36,860
Your sentencing depends on your motive.

730
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:40,520
It's important if your crime was planned or accidental.

731
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:43,000
Why do you think the motive for the crime is unimportant?

732
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,860
Everything...

733
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:48,150
Everything is just an excuse.

734
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:50,840
Because they're all dead?

735
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:59,390
That's enough for today.

736
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:19,050
It's the updated list of the deceased.

737
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:20,170
Victims of 4th Division GOP Mass Shooting Case

738
01:04:20,170 --> 01:04:24,380
The remaining survivors are resting and being treated at the military hospital.
Sergeant Ahn Su Ho

739
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:26,780
Private No Tae Nam is there too.

740
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:29,690
- No Tae Nam?
- Yes.

741
01:04:31,050 --> 01:04:33,000
Let's head over.

742
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:39,720
Korean Armed Forces Capital Hospital

743
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:42,610
You all understand, right?

744
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:45,010
We'll be investigated by military prosecutors now.

745
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:49,950
Why should we have to lie for you?

746
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:52,630
You're saying it's all on me?

747
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:54,130
Of course.

748
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:56,870
You were the one who bullied Pyeon every single day.

749
01:04:56,870 --> 01:05:00,020
Don't try to throw me under the bus. You did it too!

750
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:02,260
What about you? And you.

751
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:05,630
You all turned the other way.

752
01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:09,140
Listen, what did we do wrong?

753
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:11,100
We're the victims.

754
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:15,090
Pyeon Sang Ho, that psycho tried to kill all of us.

755
01:05:15,090 --> 01:05:18,610
Hey, No Tae Nam. You'll cooperate, right?

756
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:20,630
Your mom is the Division Commander.

757
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:23,830
You know what'll happen to your mom if you don't, right?

758
01:05:29,850 --> 01:05:31,530
Be smart about it.

759
01:05:31,530 --> 01:05:34,070
Nothing happened.

760
01:05:34,070 --> 01:05:37,540
Or else we'll take the fall for everything, got it?

761
01:05:38,610 --> 01:05:41,070
Mark my words.

762
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:42,550
Okay, sir.

763
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:50,800
Chairman.

764
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:56,480
The Patriotic Society's X-File.

765
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:00,950
You didn't know about it and Division Commander doesn't have it either.

766
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,120
No Tae Nam?

767
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:08,460
After Cha Ho Cheol died, he was the next IM owner.

768
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:19,780
Chairman. Let's go out for a moment.

769
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:30,600
Chairman. I was so relieved once I heard you were at the hospital.

770
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:35,610
All the way here today I was trying to calm down

771
01:06:35,610 --> 01:06:39,060
the feeling that you might be the shooter.

772
01:06:40,550 --> 01:06:41,660
Move over!

773
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:42,720
It's an emergency.

774
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,620
Move over.

775
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:53,820
What's wrong, Chairman? Are you okay?

776
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:56,520
Sir? Are you—

777
01:07:02,070 --> 01:07:03,980
No Tae Nam.

778
01:07:29,030 --> 01:07:32,520
Military Prosecutor Doberman

779
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:44,640
♫ The endlessly distant sadness within me ♫

780
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:48,470
♫ The moment we are face to face ♫

781
01:07:48,470 --> 01:07:51,200
♫ All the time which accumulated ♫

782
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,320
♫ made me as I am now ♫

783
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,960
Private No Tae Nam. Were you close to Private Pyeon?

784
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,070
Why are you here?

785
01:07:57,070 --> 01:08:02,080
Yong Mun Gu is after the Patriotic Society`s X-File right now. We need something big too.

786
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:03,110
About No Tae Nam.

787
01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:05,270
He may have PTSD.
(T/N: Post Traumatic Stress Disorder)

788
01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:07,590
Medical discharge from military service due to PTSD?

789
01:08:07,590 --> 01:08:11,640
I'll use this contract for the new weapon

790
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,410
to put an end to No Hwa Yeong.

791
01:08:13,410 --> 01:08:16,350
You help your mom. That way, you also can return to the way things were.

792
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:22,550
Before the mass shooting happened, were there any acts of abuse in the GOP platoon?

793
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:24,650
♫ like the hot sun, like a flame ♫

794
01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:27,960
♫ I'm constantly burning ♫

795
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,330
♫ I'll never turn off ♫
