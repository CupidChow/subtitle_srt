♫ Happy birthday to you.

Congratulations for the new job.

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,910
Thank you. It's so pretty.

13
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,140
Help yourself.

♫ Happy birthday to you.

Make a wish.

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,100
Seo Ah, a special present for you.

17
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,160
Someone once said,

18
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,930
if you look at the world upside down, it changes your perspective.

19
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,140
The sky becomes a lake and the mountain becomes

20
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,710
a shadow reflected in the lake.

21
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:53,700
Is this how a horribly screwed up life ultimately ends?

22
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,800
I'm going to flip everything around and watch it again.

23
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,260
Because that way I can see what the truth is.

24
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,680
Where should we begin the discussion?

25
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,750
Right. That's the best time.

26
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,350
The first time I saw the upside-down world.

27
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,310
The last time he was hung outside of his friend's window, his mother—

28
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,000
I mean, after his aunt visited the friend,

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,970
apologized and compensated them, it was settled,

30
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,170
but this time a teacher and child are unconscious.

31
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,870
Yes. Well, anyway, immediately...

32
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,510
Hey! Hey! Where are you going, Punk!

33
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,510
I was expelled from the third school I had been transferred to.

34
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,420
Well, it was always the same reason.

35
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:48,060
Do violation of school rules and failure to adjust to the school interfere with the learning environment?

36
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,010
What matters now is that there is no longer any school that will accept me.

37
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,260
Do Bae Man.

38
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:04,240
Hey! You punk. You.

39
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,350
Bae Man, you got expelled on purpose.

40
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,290
Because not graduating from high school is an exemption from military service,

41
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,280
why didn't you tell me to remove your name from the family register? That is also a military exemption.

42
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,080
Aunt, you would be left all alone in the family register.

43
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,290
What are you going to do?

44
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,060
Do you have any plan?

45
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,160
There is only one way that a crap spoon like me,

46
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,210
who can't aspire to become even a black spoon,

47
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,240
can climb to the top of the pyramid.

55
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,000
Do Bae Man?

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,200
Yes sir.

57
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,230
This is the first time we have received an application from someone who only graduated from middle school.

58
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:05,020
If you only graduated from middle school, you can't serve in the military, can you?

59
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:10,550
Elimination of discrimination in education, career, gender, and age is the reason I applied to Law & One.

60
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,740
Ah, I am curious.

61
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:17,970
Didn't we want to interview him because the news reported that a middle school graduate passed the bar exam?

62
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:25,090
I mean, even though we are amazed that a middle school graduate passed the bar exam—

63
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,270
What can you do without a middle school education these days?

64
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,230
In Korea, even college graduates work part-time in convenience stores.

65
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:34,400
Do Bae Man, do you think we can entrust a case to a middle school graduate lawyer?

66
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,590
The bar exam cannot scale the obstacle, which is a middle-school education.

67
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,760
That's when I realized that.

68
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,160
You do look at pictures on the resumés and

69
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,610
I heard for fun you interview female applicants.

70
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:56,320
You got me. Did you call a middle school graduate for fun too?

71
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,170
What are you doing?

72
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,140
Oh my!

73
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,910
Have you seen the face of the middle school graduate clearly?

74
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:10,700
I will definitely remember yours, too.

List of law firms he interviewed at

76
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,250
The day the tenth law firm rejected me,

77
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,280
the man who turned my life around appeared at that point.

78
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,440
He received the defendant's request. The substance of the report was that

79
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,430
there was a request to wine and dine him as a bribe.

80
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,960
An investigation was immediately launched and confirmed the report's allegations.

81
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,950
My Aunt

82
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,790
Hi Beloved Aunt!

83
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,930
From the loudness of your voice, I see you got rejected again.

84
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:58,320
They asked me to come back but what can I do when the terms aren't acceptable?

85
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,660
If I was willing to be employed anywhere, I would have already been hired.

86
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,590
I will be home early. Let's have dwaenjangjigae (fermented bean paste stew) and a glass of soju for dinner.

87
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,540
Loyalty! Officer Do Su Gyeong.

88
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,160
Are you eating kimchi without the flavor of kimchi?

89
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,660
Do you know who I am?

90
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,800
You are Yong Mung Gu, the head of Law & One Firm.

91
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,220
Yes. I've been investigating Do Bae Man for a while.

92
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,740
What? Wasn't my interview completed?

93
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,760
Just the name Do Bae Man. Your parents were both in the military.

94
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,730
When you were ten, they both died in a car accident and you were sent to live with your aunt.

95
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,900
Including today, you have been interviewed but rejected by ten law firms.

96
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,390
In the snowball of debt incurred while preparing for the bar exam, you will soon become a bad credit risk.

97
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,990
Oh. You are a total stalker. What are you trying to do?

98
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:05,780
You have passed my interview, Do Bae Man. Have a drink.

99
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,090
Have you heard of an offer you can't refuse?

100
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,720
It's the well-known line in The Godfather. I'm making it.

101
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,530
Did it cost 1.5 billion won to create this office?

102
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,330
Money can solve a lot of problems.

103
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:34,160
I'm far more interested in things that money can't buy.

104
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,330
Get to the point.

105
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,450
Here.

106
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,190
Join the army.

107
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,460
What do you think about becoming a military prosecutor?

108
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,160
Thank you for showing off your money.

109
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,620
I am exempt from military service because I only completed middle school.

110
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,900
Work less and make a lot of money.

111
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,370
You saw the news earlier about the arrest of a military prosecutor, didn't you?

112
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:20,310
Do you know how much money that guy drew while working for me?

113
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,000
He got a ten percent commission of all the money he drew.

114
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,220
And it was five times the annual salary of the lawyers who looked down on you during the interview. Five times.

115
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,110
At that level won't that change your life completely?

116
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,700
I see that.

117
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,990
When it is money, you can change life completely.

118
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,560
Even though guys who study law are smart,

119
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,770
it's not an error to say they fail in empathy.

120
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,940
Didn't you feel anything while digging into my life?

121
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,610
Salute!

122
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,130
Mom, when I grow up I'm going to be a soldier.

123
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:13,280
Really? That's great.

124
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,120
Our son will become a great soldier.

125
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,190
Dad, a car!

126
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,800
Bae Man.

127
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,190
Bae Man.

128
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,810
Mom.

129
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,630
I'm sorry.

130
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:02,120
Bae Man, I'm sorry.

131
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,950
Mom.

132
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:12,450
Open your eyes. I said open your eyes!

133
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,980
Mom!

134
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:25,400
Both my parents died in uniform.

135
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,530
In front of my eyes.

136
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,250
For me, when it comes to the military, I am someone whose feeling is divided,

137
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,890
but you want me to voluntarily enlist?

138
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:40,350
Not even five times, but even fifty times more money is not enough.

139
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,260
It seems you handle adversity well

140
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,440
but have a lot of wounds in your heart.

141
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,550
Do you know why the military is a gold mine?

142
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:02,510
To those with power in South Korea, the military is a ticking bomb.

143
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,630
It's problematic both if their sons get exempt from service,

144
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,980
or fulfill their duty.

145
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,970
It's my job to dispose of my clients' bombs when they don't know when they will explode.

146
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,780
To put it simply,

147
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,430
the military is a vulnerable spot for those with power.

148
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,200
No god will fill your wallet.

149
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,680
So you're suggesting I treat you like a god since you'll fill mine with money?

150
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:33,920
You've gotten this far on your own, but who's supporting you?

151
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,980
You've never had any backing.

152
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:43,520
What if I were to become your supporter?

153
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:49,380
I promise to hire you as a Law & One partner if you wear the uniform for just five years.

154
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:55,140
Of course, on the condition that you'll perform at a level to my liking.

155
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,260
If that's the only condition,

156
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,840
I'm sure there are plenty of other applicants to your firm.

157
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,070
Is it too cruel of me to admit your painful past is what I need?

158
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,990
That's not something that can be bought with money.

159
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,490
Why are you so late?

160
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,980
Aunt, I got a job.

161
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,100
Yeah right.

162
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,650
Did you really?

163
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,740
Really?

164
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,710
Wait, wait.

165
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,800
Which law firm?

166
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:48,680
Hey, I'm asking where it is.

167
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,800
The military.

168
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,230
Forget it.

169
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:07,460
The military to which mom and dad dedicated their lives.

170
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,620
What kind of place is it?

171
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,820
5 years later

172
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,920
Cha Wu In

173
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,320
Oath.

174
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,620
I, Cha Wu In, am a new officer who just joined the military,

175
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,410
but will fulfill my duty as a guardian of martial law

176
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:42,590
and will do my best to fairly and strictly enforce the law

177
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:46,760
and protect the soldiers' civil rights and rights as members of the armed forces

178
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,780
in order to maintain the fundamental principles of the armed forces.

179
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:54,180
October 18th, 2021. Captain Cha Wu In.

180
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,110
Salute!

181
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,010
Salute.

182
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,100
Unity!

183
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,880
Unity!

184
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,740
Here, Dormitory 1.

185
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,530
Unity!

186
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:57,160
Relax, relax. I want to arm wrestle too.

187
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,830
Sit down and relax.

188
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,280
Are you Sergeant Ahn Su Ho?

189
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,720
Sergeant, Ahn Su Ho.

190
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,540
- Have a seat.
- Yes, sir.

191
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,290
How long do you have til your discharge?

192
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:11,270
I've only just become a sergeant.

193
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,660
Nothing's been too difficult?

194
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,540
Not at all.

195
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,740
Sorry.

196
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,590
You don't seem sick, but it sounds like you've got a stuffy nose.

197
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,620
Yes, I have allergies.

198
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,910
You must do lots of weeding since you're on the guard post.

199
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,910
That's true.

200
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,170
The pollen from all that work must be miserable.

201
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,160
You must be struggling because of that.

202
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,170
Not at all. It's endurable.

203
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,620
What's this injury on your wrist from?

204
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:47,490
I was on lookout at night and got a few mosquito bites. It's nothing much.

205
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,980
Of course, that's something.

206
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,920
You can't ignore mosquitoes on a military base.

207
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,350
You'll get malaria and have to receive a medical discharge.

208
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:00,480
Actually, maybe that's for the better.

209
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,980
Not at all.

210
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,080
I'll tell the platoon leader, so get it treated outside.

211
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,900
Can I really do that?

212
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,200
Of course.

213
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,760
Let's arm wrestle.

214
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,070
Come here.

215
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,820
Ready, go.

216
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,300
He's very famous.

217
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,880
- Good job.
- Unity!

218
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,580
What brings you here, sir?

219
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,300
I came to see sergeant Ahn Su Ho.

220
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,750
- Sergeant Ahn?
- Yeah.

221
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,610
Did we receive a grievance? That shouldn't be the case...

222
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,940
Sergeant Ahn seems to be adjusting well here.

223
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,170
Yes. He's very kind to his subordinates.

224
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:47,090
Even the hyeongs (older members) who were transferred miss him and take vacation time to come visit him.

225
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,710
Quite impressive, that bank president's son.

226
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,780
Did you say bank president?

227
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,520
Didn't you know?

228
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,900
Sergeant Ahn's father is the president of Gusan Bank.

229
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,650
I had no idea.

230
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:05,210
He's never said so.

231
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,700
I shouldn't have said that.

232
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,710
Don't tell anyone this, okay?

233
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,860
Don't make it obvious by being too friendly either.

234
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,550
I understand.

235
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,490
Let's go.

236
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:21,080
But a bank president's son is serving at the guard post.

237
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,880
How interesting.

238
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,540
He's just an ordinary rifleman, though he could've gotten all the special treatment he wanted.

239
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,060
Celebrities?

240
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:33,430
Sure, to take care of their images, they volunteer for the frontline to wash their dirty linen.

241
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,910
But the son of a bank president has no reason to do that.

242
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,940
Right? No reason.

243
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,060
He might have a reason. A reason.

244
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,380
Unity. Yes, battalion commander, this is Captain Do Bae Man speaking.

245
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,170
There's a sergeant suffering from rhinitis in the dorms.

246
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:59,420
Yes sir. There's an urgent need for an air purifier.

247
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,090
Unity.

248
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,920
Unity.

249
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,370
No one else is here.

250
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,150
Are you using this unit all by yourself?

251
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:30,770
Yes, there's been an order for me to use this space alone for the rest of my service.

252
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,590
Lucky you.

253
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,500
Oh, how's your nose?

254
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,110
I'm sure this couldn't have magically fixed it.

255
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,960
It's gotten much better.

256
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,070
But...

257
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,850
What is it?

258
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,930
I feel a bit uncomfortable.

259
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:49,750
After you visited, I've been excused from weeding

260
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,410
and am spending time alone here with the air purifier.

261
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,770
It's true I had a hard time due to my rhinitis.

262
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,400
Thanks for taking action for me.

263
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:13,190
Sure. I don't think they take care of the water dispensers here.

264
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,090
Not at all, I'll just drink out of the fountain.

265
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,460
I put this here for you to drink.

266
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,830
Just drink it. Doesn't matter who it's from.

267
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,320
Yes?

268
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,750
Be happy.

269
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,250
Unity.

270
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:40,410
I'll leave after delivering this to Sergeant Ahn, Captain.

271
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,210
Sure thing.

272
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,790
What's this?

273
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,600
Your uniform?

274
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,080
Your undergarments, too.

275
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,800
The washing machine is broken. The platoon leader brought it from the dorm.

276
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,000
I told him I'd wash it myself—

277
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,670
Everyone's treating you this way because you adjusted so well.

278
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,420
Don't think too much of it.

279
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,250
Captain, you're really a great person.

280
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,320
I'll be sure to visit you even after I'm discharged.

281
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:19,310
Following reports of so-called "emperor service" that a Gusan bank president's son

282
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,660
is serving and receiving preferential treatment,

283
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,480
the military prosecutor is investigating an enlisted soldier.

284
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,900
While attention is focused on what conclusion the prosecution will draw

285
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,170
about the emperor service to a gold spoon (rich) soldier,

286
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:36,010
The sergeant in question has denied allegations of preferential treatment.

287
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,610
I'm cool.

288
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,280
I'm the man.

289
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,480
There are a lot of cool guys.

290
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,590
I'm the man.

291
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,390
Prosecutor Cha Wu In?

292
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,820
- Yes.
- Unity!

293
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,100
Unity!

294
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,040
I'm section chief Ahn Yu Ra. Let's get along in the future.

295
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,840
Yes, take care of me too.

296
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,190
I'll show you around. This way.

297
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,650
Sure.

298
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,840
Attorney Seo Ju Hyeok is working outside of the office.

299
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,030
Generally, one prosecutor is assigned to the region's prosecution office,

300
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:29,050
but our division has so many incidents and accidents that we have two military prosecutors.

301
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:32,740
The other person... is just arriving.

302
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,480
Absolutely.

303
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,620
It's Captain Do Bae Man.

304
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,180
- Today the new incoming—
- Uni—

305
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,410
Sorry, I am busy with an interrogation.

306
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,060
Come quickly.

307
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,600
Yes.

308
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,280
You know about the emperor service case, right?

309
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,520
The media is focusing on the incident, so he is very touchy.

310
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,070
I will show you the data storage room.

311
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,730
Isn't the incoming new prosecutor very pretty?

312
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,900
Did you contact all the reporters?

313
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:10,120
Oh, yes. Every single one without omitting anyone.

314
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,830
But Captain, Captain.

315
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:22,740
They said I got some kind of privileges and was treated like an emperor.

316
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,810
You know me best, so please straighten out any misunderstanding.

317
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:32,440
If there has been any misunderstanding, this is the place to resolve it.

318
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,640
Even though this office concept may be unfamiliar, sit down for now.

319
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,470
Yes, Captain.

320
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:42,640
I'm not a captain here, but a military prosecutor. Okay.

321
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,640
Yes, Military Prosecutor.

322
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,170
Take a seat. Sit.

323
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:57,040
Now. All you have to do is answer "yes" or "no" to the questions I ask.

324
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,580
Yes, Military Prosecutor.

325
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:04,720
Is it true that you were using by yourself a dormitory meant for eight people?

326
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,280
I didn't ask for it. I just followed instructions—

327
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,850
Just answer with "yes" or "no."

328
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,130
Sergeant Ahn Su Ho,

329
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,010
did you use the dormitory by yourself?

330
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,980
Yes. That's true.

331
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,060
You used the living quarters alone.

332
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,030
Was your use of the living quarters alone

333
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:31,600
right after the air purifier was installed?

334
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,520
The material for cases where prosecution was suspended are collected here.

335
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,860
On this side, there is data on mysterious deaths that have not been resolved.

336
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:43,960
If you need anything, feel free to ask me. Or you can just use the materials freely.

337
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,410
Is there anything you're curious about?

338
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,190
There isn't.

339
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,210
Then let me now introduce you to your official residence.

340
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:54,920
Instead let's go to the interrogation room first.

341
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,700
Right now?

342
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,520
Prosecutor Do Bae Man is using it to interrogate someone.

343
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,500
Can't you go afterwards?

344
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,070
I'm not here to sightsee. I'll take care of my quarters myself.

345
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,950
I'm going to the interrogation room where there is an ongoing battle.

346
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:11,230
I'm curious about Prosecutor Do Bae Man's style.

347
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:18,320
But as to the air purifier, Captain...

348
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,320
I mean, Military Prosecutor, didn't you arrange it?

349
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,890
Did I?

350
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,200
Why would I?

351
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:34,790
There's testimony that you stacked up foreign bottled water in your private dormitory and drank it.

352
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,110
I didn't ask you to buy it.

353
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:39,380
It doesn't matter who bought it.

354
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,990
I'm asking you if you had the privilege of stacking

355
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,240
and drinking foreign bottled water in the dormitory, Sergeant Ahn Su Ho?

356
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,390
Yes. I drank it.

357
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:53,520
There's testimony that a platoon leader was ordered to do your laundry.

358
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,070
Your uniform? Your undergarments, too.

359
00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:02,110
That doesn't make sense. How could I order a platoon leader to do my laundry?

360
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,220
He was just being considerate of me.

361
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,710
Didn't you see it also?

362
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,410
Consideration.

363
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:13,100
I can't say. The platoon leader's testimony contradicts yours.

364
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:17,800
He thought he had no choice because it might adversely affect his promotion.

365
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,140
No way...

366
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,650
He testified that although it was humiliating,

367
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:27,790
he had no choice but to run errands and do laundry for a subordinate.

368
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,600
To top that, there was weeding work, non-participation in training,

369
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,670
exemption from guard duty, absent without leave, illegal visits.

370
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,940
You went out with the excuse that you were bitten by a mosquito.

371
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:46,330
You returned the next day without a medical certificate. This is tantamount to desertion.

372
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,090
Tell me, is there is anything you didn't do among all the things I've verified today.

373
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,230
Sign it.

374
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,860
Why is he doing that?

375
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,290
Do you feel wronged?

376
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:32,220
Then you should've met better parents.

377
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,160
Then you wouldn't have to go through such an unpleasant situation.

378
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,430
After a thorough investigation that considered the public interest and the gravity for the organization,

379
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:03,610
in the matter of the case of the son of a Gusan bank president receiving emperor treatment,

380
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:07,410
all charges have been confirmed to be true.

381
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:10,470
At our military prosecution those who continue to take advantage of parental wealth

382
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:14,590
for personal convenience, that should be fairly distributed

383
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:17,050
to all members of the armed service in the country,

384
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:21,130
will definitely be disciplined in the future.

385
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:26,270
Furthermore, we hope that this investigation becomes the precedent

386
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,310
that will eradicate preferential treatment in the army.

387
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:32,710
I am Do Bae Man of the military prosecutor's office.

388
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,930
Ahn Byeong Gu, father of the soldier in question, stating that he would be responsible for the incident,

389
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:44,130
made a written apology and resigned from the president's position of the Gusan Bank.

390
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:47,680
This has been Ju Il Seok of TBC news.

391
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,110
Lawyer Yong, did a demand for payment from Gusan Bank come in?

392
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,630
I don't want to repay 500 billion won. What should I do?

393
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:00,480
After I invested that money, it's terrible to think about profit declining.

394
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,030
Isn't this the easiest time to make money since Dangun, the mythical founder of Korea?

395
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:08,830
Is the decision up to the bank president who started last year?

396
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:13,120
Then I should send the president away. What's his name?

397
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,780
Ahn Byeong Gu, president of the bank.

398
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,990
Lawyer Yong Mun Gu.
Good job.

399
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,790
Prosecutor Do Bae Man.

400
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:37,530
The Attorney General is waiting for us. Let's talk on our way.

401
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:40,580
Thank you for the briefing. I want to learn a lot from you in the future.

402
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:43,030
Did you enjoy sneaking a peek of the interrogation room?

403
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:46,750
I'm sorry. But you shouldn't have been able to see me from the inside.

404
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,170
Should I give you a quick tip, since it's your first day here?

405
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:54,660
Even if you live with eyes in the back of your head here, you will barely last.

406
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:59,590
I am fortunate to be able to start work underneath a capable person like yourself.

407
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,750
What do we do? It looks like you are only half fortunate.

408
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:06,320
I'm leaving soon.

409
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,430
Oh, that's a shame.

410
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:14,380
I understand that you're enthusiastic, spying on the interrogation and everything,

411
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:17,990
but don't go creating trouble. At least not until I leave.

412
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,430
I understand.

413
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:24,390
Good job on the investigation, and even better job on the briefing.

414
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,320
Thank you.

415
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:31,810
Cha Wu In, whenever newbies like you come in to become a military prosecutor,

416
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:34,680
there's always a question I ask.

417
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:39,090
Are you a prosecutor or a soldier?

418
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:45,570
I am simply wearing a military prosecutor's uniform, but I am a solider! Unity.

419
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,040
Good!

420
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:58,560
I did not understand the point of the question. I apologize.

421
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,880
I am asking whether rank outweighs the law.

422
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,520
When military commands and the law collide, what will you prioritize?

423
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,210
Why can't you understand things in one go?

424
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:12,900
I am a prosecutor within the military court.

425
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,120
Prosecutor? Why are you a prosecutor?

426
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,640
You are a soldier!

427
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,260
I don't think so.

428
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,640
Hey, that uniform you're wearing.

429
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,710
Even if you take that off, are you still a military prosecutor?

430
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:28,480
The reason you have power within the military court

431
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,920
is because the power comes from your uniform.

432
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:35,220
Even so, I am a prosecutor.

433
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,390
If I am a soldier that must comply with the hierarchy,

434
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:41,250
I would be unable to judge criminals who rank higher than me.

435
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:45,120
So I cannot be a soldier within the military court.

436
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:51,670
What? You dare... judge who?

437
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,300
Criminals.

438
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,470
Get out immediately!

439
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,340
Hey.

440
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,260
Come to your senses. This is the military.

441
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:18,820
If you were a newbie at a law firm and butted heads with the superiors from your first day, what would happen?

442
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:22,570
I never talked back. I simply answered his question.

443
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:26,460
You see? You're not scared of me either.

444
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,410
If you continue behaving this way, you will end your military career.

445
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:32,730
Whether it's a commissioned officer or an enlisted soldier, the army is the army.

446
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:34,530
Military life is the epitome of rank.

447
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:39,220
I don't think I need your advice. Didn't you say you were going to leave soon anyway?

448
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:46,350
Are you saying you don't want to interact with an old, toothless senior?

449
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,970
Please don't jump to conclusions.

450
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:54,950
Looks like I'd better give you hard training before I leave.

451
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:04,820
Military Prosecutor Cha Wu In, Unity.

452
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:07,390
If you need help with anything, just let me know—

453
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:10,120
Hey hey, you know that soldier whose interrogations we postponed?

454
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,980
Pass it to her.

455
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,610
Huh? Him?

456
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:20,090
It's her first day today. She'll need some time to catch her breath, especially since we're off work soon.

457
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:22,410
Prosecutors are never off work.

458
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:25,710
Don't you think so? Prosecutor Cha.

459
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:30,490
Yes. I agree that, for a military prosecutor, cases come before getting off work.

460
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,400
That's right.

461
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,940
Since I'm a soldier, my shift is over so I will get off work.

462
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:42,840
Prosecutor Cha, you spend today analyzing the case and start interrogations tomorrow.

463
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,820
Yes, I understand.

464
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,980
Let's have some wine together.

465
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:57,670
- Clean up, won't you?
- Did he wink?

466
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:03,780
This guy is a little rough. Be careful while you interrogate him.

467
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,420
I look forward to working with you.

468
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:11,840
Did you do something wrong to Military Prosecutor Do Bae Man?

469
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,160
I'm sure that if there is a reason, I will find out soon enough.

470
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,470
Law Firm
Law & One

471
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:33,530
Military Prosecutor Do Bae Man is here.

472
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:35,580
Welcome.

473
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,150
Take a seat.

474
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:47,050
Would this be a good finale to the 5-year promise you made?

475
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:51,270
The platoon leader played a big role. What did you feed him?

476
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,200
You mean the laundry?

477
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,180
I didn't bribe him. Imagine how much trouble there would be if that got found out.

478
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,730
I simply leaked a bit of information.

479
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:03,460
That his father is a bank president.

480
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:06,450
The rest they did on their own?

481
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:09,230
Taking him off duty, sending him on leave.

482
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:12,400
Basically, a lot of preferential treatment disguised as consideration happened.

483
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,080
Gosh, who would have known they're greedy?

484
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:31,700
When should I start at Law & One?

485
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:36,370
Isn't it a waste of your five years of experience there?

486
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:38,940
You even became a star prosecutor.

487
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:50,880
Do you remember what you told me five years ago?

488
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:55,630
You told me to resolve any hatred or sympathy I had for the military.

489
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:58,240
Yes. Which side is it?

490
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,240
Neither.

491
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,830
I simply like the musty smell this makes.

492
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:08,870
Once you actually have it it's meaningless.

493
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:13,460
I think it would be better to possess strong authority.

494
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,290
Strong?

495
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:17,100
Chairman No Tae Nam.

496
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,070
Yes, Chairman.

497
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:25,960
They gave it to me so I need to see you.

498
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,560
I'll go to your office right now.

499
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,570
Not to the company. Come to Cartel instead. To celebrate.

500
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,220
Certainly,

501
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:44,060
Wow. I wonder who is the person who can call the shots for our Lawyer Yong.

502
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,540
Introduce me too.

503
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,730
It's not time yet.

504
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:54,650
Yes. Well. I understand.

505
00:35:54,650 --> 00:36:00,260
Be sure to chew carefully so that the table I set doesn't get flipped over.

506
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:08,800
You can't go past the five years you promised by even one day.

507
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,340
Then.

508
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,600
No Tae Nam.

509
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,880
Businessman, born December 30, 1995.
Affiliated with IM Defense Indie Story.

510
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,500
Yes.

511
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,860
What is this? Is the chairman younger than me?

512
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,130
He is a well-known dog lover.

513
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:32,570
He has a veterinarian and a cook at his home. Jeez.

514
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:35,350
I'm beginning to envy the dog.

515
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:38,860
Why are you looking like that?

516
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,400
I didn't know who Yong Mun Gu's backer was until today.

517
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,240
Who are you talking about?

518
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,560
IM Defense Chairman No Tae Nam.

519
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,480
Cartel

520
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:05,910
What is this?

521
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:09,470
Who let him go? Aren't you going to tie him up?

522
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:12,750
Before I kill you, Mr. Lee.

523
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,350
Let's go.

524
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,530
Hey.

525
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,660
Someone made me feel I should stop drinking.

526
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:31,020
When he said to put my baby on a leash,

527
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:34,100
he should be saying, "Oh, yes. I'm really sorry."

528
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,310
Will you drink your fill while saying that?

529
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,610
What is this bastard saying?

530
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:43,110
Answer.

531
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:47,760
There... is that your dog there?

532
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:55,930
Your crazy bastard. Why did you let your dog off-leash in the club?

533
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:11,830
I'll ask again.

534
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:14,960
There's someone who made you stop drinking.

535
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,390
If you tell your kids to kill me,

536
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:20,440
will they do it.

537
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:25,370
That's what I'm saying. It's because there's a dog walking around the club.

538
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:28,360
Answer! I said will your kids kills me?

539
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:32,100
I'm sorry.

540
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:39,280
No way. You shouldn't beg me to forgive you. Bolt was hurt.

541
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,970
Bolt.

542
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,970
Beg.

543
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,550
Hurry.

544
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:04,220
I am sorry.

545
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,760
If you are going to apologize,

546
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,500
look into his eyes and do it properly.

547
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,620
Until Bolt says it okay.

548
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,400
Let the bastard go.

549
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:35,010
With a leash on.

550
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:43,600
I'll handle this.

551
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,040
Sure. Go ahead.

552
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:12,240
How unfair was it to the bank president's son?

553
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,630
You sent an innocent person to prison.

554
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:18,860
He admitted everything so that his father would not be damaged.

555
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:21,540
I don't think the military prosecutor even feels guilty.

556
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,340
Well, no matter that you ordered him to do it.

557
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:29,020
But he's not a prosecutor. He's a soldier. An if-there's-an-order-I-should-obey-it soldier.

558
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,800
It depends on how he is being used.

559
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,100
That's up to you.

560
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,020
Doesn't that military prosecutor know the inside story?

561
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:41,750
Even if he doesn't know, one thing is clear.

562
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:44,310
He is loyal only to money.

563
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:53,830
Our Lawyer Yong, we still have a long way to go.

564
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:57,760
It's because you only raise people on the outside, like an old geezer.

565
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,800
In this world, there is no one who is loyal to money.

566
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:08,250
People must be loyal to people.

567
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,850
What? There's a customer.

568
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,700
Lawyer?

569
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,410
Hello.

570
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:26,740
- Sit down.
- Hello.

571
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:32,000
We're going to drink and hang out.

572
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,510
Drinking with an old geezer is no fun.

573
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:39,470
Since I'm done observing, I was just about to get up.

574
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,900
I wanted to meet the shyster lawyer once.

575
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,440
I'll make some time.

576
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,440
Not that. Just the two of us.

577
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:52,950
I want for just the two of us to meet.

578
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,630
Sure.

579
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:24,110
Oh, here.

580
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,860
Why did you call me?

581
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,370
Do you still have something to say?

582
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:38,820
Why do I have to stay here for a crime I did not commit?

583
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:43,320
Did you call me so late at night for that?

584
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,570
- I have nothing more to say.
- No.

585
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:49,990
Can a military prosecutor fabricate evidence to make an ordinary person a criminal?

586
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:53,270
Even doing that, are you still a military prosecutor?

587
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,030
You feel wronged?

588
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:05,150
Yes, I feel so wronged that I'm going crazy.

589
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:09,740
Have you forgotten already? You have no right to say that.

590
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,790
Then you should know now

591
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:17,370
how wronged that friend who got beaten to death by you felt.

592
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:25,810
Hey it's over there, you film it.

593
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:28,860
Hey, film it properly.

594
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:35,860
Hey, do you feel wronged?

595
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:41,100
Then you should've met better parents, bastard.

596
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:46,050
Then you wouldn't have to go through such an unpleasant situation.

597
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:48,420
Look at him!

598
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:52,160
Bastard.

599
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,990
After bullying a kid to death, did you think that changing your name and

600
00:43:54,990 --> 00:44:00,230
doing your military service diligently would erase your past?

601
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:03,400
The world isn't as simple as that, my friend.

602
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,520
What does that have to do with this?

603
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:12,740
Here comes your true face.

604
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:16,970
It must have been so hard hiding this while you were enlisted.

605
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:20,740
Are you pretending to be a warrior of justice,

606
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:24,050
after destroying me like this?

607
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:25,790
Justice?

608
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:33,090
I don't think that word fits me, but I do feel a lot less guilty.

609
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:36,070
You little—!

610
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:40,630
I have a feeling that this won't be the last time we meet.

611
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,010
Till next time.

612
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:14,540
Oppa, I'll head out first.

613
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:19,590
It's alright, stay comfortably. He's a great guy.

614
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:24,690
I just came out for coffee and didn't realize the atmosphere would be like this, sorry.

615
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:28,980
What's up with you? Everyone else is lining up just to get in here.

616
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:32,210
I think I'm going to leave now.

617
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:34,420
If you don't like it,

618
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:37,290
do you want me to order coffee for you?

619
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:40,210
I mean I went out of my way to pamper myself.

620
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:43,420
Out of respect for my efforts, you should at least have one drink.

621
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:46,610
Yeah, you're putting me in a bad spot

622
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:49,880
Just one drink, Se Na. Just one.

623
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,190
Hey, bring a cup of coffee.

624
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:13,860
Would you like to pet Bolt? Go Bolt!

625
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:36,690
But how do you know him?

626
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:40,600
I was a fan of his ever since he was a trainee.

627
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,820
So I was really happy when he sent me a DM.

628
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:46,800
Why would you tell him that? It's so embarassing.

629
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,390
Here, drink up.

630
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,100
Unity.

631
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,190
Let's see.

632
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,790
- Stay alert.
- Yes, I will.

633
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:25,950
Thank you!

634
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:28,880
Excuse me. Wait a moment.

635
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,620
Are you alright?

636
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:33,590
It's okay.

637
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:38,450
Seriously though, you're an officer. Aren't you even yet past the point of disciplining soldiers?

638
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:41,660
That soldier is not in a condition to be interrogated.

639
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:43,590
Don't act like you didn't do it.

640
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:46,970
When Section Chief Ahn Yu Ra first came, were you or were you not hard on her?

641
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:50,460
He had me go to the scene and smell a dead body

642
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,920
and had me search an entire hill for three days straight for one strand of hair.

643
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,570
Oh, come on, Section Chief Ahn. When did I do that?

644
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:57,140
You did!

645
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:00,390
Even until this day, whenever I'm reminded of that smell...

646
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:04,600
- Prosecutor.
- Don't overreact.

647
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,820
I ordered her to do all that because it was necessary for the investigation.

648
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:11,760
Section Chief Ahn is who she is today because of what I did. She...

649
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,610
- She's the best investigator because of that.
- Unity.

650
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:19,270
All right. Smile, look alive, and let's do this. Yes!

651
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:23,290
I hope Prosecutor Cha has no issues with the interrogation.

652
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:26,270
Move!

653
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:31,000
- Don't come close.
- He suddenly freaked out during the interrogation.

654
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,030
Move! You hear me? I told you to move!

655
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:38,440
Don't come close! I'll handle this.

656
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,590
- Move, darn it!
- Stay still.

657
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:42,690
Don't come close.

658
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,570
Don't come close, darn it!

659
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:51,770
Put it down!

660
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:54,970
I told you not to come!

661
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:04,500
Let's go.

662
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:20,920
It's my fault. I'll gladly accept whatever punishment.

663
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,960
You still managed to stay calm in that situation.

664
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,420
I'm impressed.

665
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,750
But just now.

666
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:34,000
Sir?

667
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:37,020
Nothing.

668
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:44,260
Darn it!

669
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:39,120
I am leaving immediately.

670
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:42,440
Goodbye.

671
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,580
- I'll get going first!
- Okay, hurry up and leave.

672
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:53,060
Prosecutor.

673
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:58,260
What's up with you? You won't stop looking at me.

674
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:02,920
Well, you see, Prosecutor. I was wondering—

675
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:06,730
Hey, but wasn't Cha Wu In a little weird a while ago?

676
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:10,360
A little weird. Weird.

677
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:13,950
Yes, that's how it normally starts.

678
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:18,690
I think it's weird. No.

679
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:21,170
I can't think of the right word.

680
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:25,670
It's weird, but not really. What is this?

681
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:30,100
- What is this?
- That's love.

682
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:34,980
Our prosecutor's heart of stone has finally...

683
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:37,580
It's finally softening up.

684
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,710
No? Okay, I'll get back to work.

685
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:44,790
Gosh, it's finally softened.

686
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,100
How about having a drink with me?

687
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:57,100
What should I do? I have something important to do today.

688
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:00,430
You must've been really shocked earlier.

689
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:03,950
This is all because Prosecutor Do Bae Man had you interrogate him.

690
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:06,280
That's why I wanted to buy you a drink.

691
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:11,380
I'm disappointed too. I really wanted to talk trash about Prosecutor Do also.

692
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:15,880
WI?

693
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,030
It must the initials of a name.

694
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:20,540
Yes. It's the first two letters of my name.

695
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:23,340
It's pretty. It suits you well.

696
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:28,050
Then I'll get going. Rest well.

697
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:08,200
Something doesn't feel right. She's suspicious.

698
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,320
Cha Wu In. Bring me her personnel file.

699
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,500
New couple alert! That's exactly what you need.

700
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,240
Curiosity about the other person.

701
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:19,070
The desire to dig as deep as you can into her personal information.

702
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:22,850
- That sort of desire.
- Bring it to me immediately.

703
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:26,190
But you have to differentiate between having a crush and stalking her.

704
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:29,930
Those two things have a very different nature.

705
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:33,340
- Keep talking.
- I'm going.

706
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:36,970
- I said to keep talking.
- No, but why do your muscles keep getting bigger?

707
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:39,990
That punk. I guess I'm too easy on him.

708
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,470
All right!

709
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:50,840
- Bring it here.
- No!

710
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,850
Darn it.

711
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:04,110
Why is your face all messed up?

712
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:06,800
Just play your cards.

713
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:11,200
Don't tell me you filmed a new episode of Cartiana?

714
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,520
New episode, my foot.

715
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:15,580
You punk, you did!

716
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:17,140
Man, how long did this take?

717
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:23,020
You better upload it in the group chat. Unless you want to get kicked out.

718
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:26,080
I told you, I didn't! Just shut up and play your cards, you idiots.

719
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,650
- Darn it.
- Oh, man.

720
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:30,890
Seeing how he's hiding it, it must be an exciting one.

721
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:33,120
Hurry up and send it.

722
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:38,260
Who is it?

723
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:47,290
I said, don't call a woman!!

724
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:49,100
Woman?

725
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:50,560
A woman?

726
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,370
Who called her?

727
00:54:51,370 --> 00:54:53,520
I didn't.

728
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:57,070
Damn, she's hot.

729
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,320
Who are you?

730
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:12,730
Hello, President No Tae Nam sent me.

731
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:15,330
How do you know Tae Nam Hyung? There is no way.

732
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:20,110
He gave me a hefty tip on top of the normal rate.

733
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,020
Really?

734
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:26,120
What are you waiting for? Come in.

735
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:32,890
It's a girl.

736
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:35,520
Hello.

737
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:42,670
Hyeong Tae Nam's mood swings have always been bad.

738
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:46,490
I think he acted rashly again because of his mood today.

739
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:52,700
He really shouldn't be giving away my address so easily.

740
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:56,320
You. You came here voluntarily, all right?

741
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,730
You're dead if you change what you say later.

742
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:03,290
It's true that I came by myself.

743
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:05,530
Why so friendly all of a sudden?

744
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:11,730
- Are you always this impatient?
- Yes.

745
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:16,780
Let's get straight to the point.

746
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:21,900
It's going to take her eight weeks to recover.

747
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,180
What? Who is?

748
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:25,070
I mean Se Na.

749
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:28,350
What you and No Tae Nam did to Se Na at Cartel.

750
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:32,640
Assault and rape. Eight weeks to recover. She'll probably need even longer for therapy, right?

751
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,930
Maybe her whole life?

752
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,330
Who are you really?

753
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:43,900
You drugged a girl unconscious and recorded everything on your phones.

754
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,790
Then you shared it in the group chat.

755
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:48,030
Hand me the phone you recorded with.

756
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:53,000
If you don't want to die, you good-for-nothing pieces of shit.

757
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:20,400
How bold of you to come here by yourself?

758
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,480
That's what I thought. Words weren't going to convince you.

759
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,680
I didn't come here to just talk either though.

760
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,260
Hmm... I see.

761
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:36,890
She graduated from high school in California and went to Stanford Law School but dropped out.

762
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:42,490
Then there are zero records for the next three years before she passes the bar exam.

763
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:47,670
You're a lucky bitch.

764
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:53,390
You're unlucky though. I don't think your huffing and puffing can be heard outside because of the great soundproofing.

765
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:55,860
Multipurpose buildings are known for good soundproofing.

766
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:57,100
This crazy bitch though!

767
00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:00,750

♫ Just follow me, follow me ♫

771
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:13,820
After that, there are no records of her joining a domestic law firm or appearing at a court.

772
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:15,430
♫ It's an obvious trick to me ♫

00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,590
♫ Step out of my zone. My my zone. My zone  ♫

795
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:03,470
But she's not the military type either.

796
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:06,650
She barely passed the physical strength test by a hair.

797
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:09,380
She sucks at anything physical.

798
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:13,300
She doesn't even have something as common as a single belt in Taekwondo.

799
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:28,900
Fists under your chin.

800
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,450
Put your arms together.

801
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:32,560
Pull your chin down.

802
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,560
You bastard!!

803
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:37,480
You caught me off guard.

804
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,240
Stand up.

805
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:13,930
Stop whining like a baby and stand up unless you want to get beat up more.

806
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:21,890
Give the cell phone to me.

807
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:25,600
This is related to Hyeong Tae Nam. He's going to be furious.

808
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:31,290
No Tae Nam. Can you match him?

809
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:39,470
What I want is that.

810
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:06,100
Cha Wu In, why, of all careers, did she become a military prosecutor?

811
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,110
Did you hear anything else that's not in here?

812
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:12,360
You know that I know everything in the military, right?

813
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,220
I called everyone but nobody knows anything.

814
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:19,160
She apparently had no interactions with her fellow military judicial officers.

815
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,850
Is that so?

816
01:01:20,850 --> 01:01:26,120
By just looking at you, it's neither one-sided crush nor stalking. What is it?

817
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:29,450
What is really that you are curious about her? Really.

818
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:36,120
Why are you suddenly doing this?

819
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:39,280
Why are you getting weirder by the day?

820
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,900
She didn't get scared. Cha Wu In.

821
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:48,880
This is what started all my suspicions.

822
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,470
She was pretended to be scared.

823
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:06,200
It's over.

824
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,490
Come and clean it up for me.

825
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:28,450
If only I could turn back time.

826
01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:31,160
If I could do that,

827
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:35,870
If I could go back to that day,

828
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:39,070
Cha Wu In's childhood

829
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:43,930
Chairman Cha Ho Cheol

830
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,420
- Dad.
- Yes?

831
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:56,120
By the way, why is our company's name IM?

832
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:01,580
It's named after you, my daughter.

833
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:03,750
But my name is Wu In.

834
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:05,220
What?

835
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:10,280
My Wu In, do you know how to write the roman alphabetic initials for your name?

836
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:13,490
W and I.

837
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:14,380
That's right.

838
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:16,530
Here. Take a look.

839
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:18,880
Here.

840
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:22,320
Wu In's initial is

841
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:25,900
W and

842
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:31,400
- I, is it right?
- Yes.

843
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,410
Turn it upside down.

844
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:35,810
IM

845
01:03:35,810 --> 01:03:40,860
A world where justice and truth has been reversed.

846
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:46,120
Only from upside-down can you see it properly.

847
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:50,980
I lost everything when I lost my father.

848
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:52,120
♫ When this light ♫

849
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:55,820
Military Prosecutor Doberman

850
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:59,630
♫ I'll ignite ♫

851
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:03,520
♫ In this long night alone ♫

852
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:04,650
♫ I who am wandering ♫

853
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:08,250
What do you find so suspicious about Military Prosecutor Cha Wu In?

854
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:09,410
Allen has disappeared.

855
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:11,030
Why don't you ask him?

856
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:12,820
That soldier who did the "emperor treatment" case.

857
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:17,880
I throw myself into the wave that is No Tae Nam, who is running toward me.

858
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:21,390
Whether or not you want to make those punks pay for what they did. The decision is up to you.

859
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:24,630
What happened that day at Cartel?

860
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:26,130
Kill Do Bae Man.

861
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:28,710
The road was always paved after I walked it.

862
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:33,190
I plan to pave my way this time too.

863
01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:35,280
♫ My style without hesitation. ♫

864
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,020
♫  You can't stop me ♫

865
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:40,650
♫ No chance, you can't get away now ♫
