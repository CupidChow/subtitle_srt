"World's Best Festival" Pyeongchang Winter Olympics For 17 Days of Fierce Competition Has Started.

Captain Do Bae Man. Captain Cha Wu In. Please enter.

00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,350
Special Disciplinary Committee

12
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,400
- Salute.
- Yes, sir.

13
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,930
Episode 8 
Unity.

14
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,920
At ease.

15
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,710
Lieutenant General Hong Mu Seop.
[Disciplinary Committee Chairman]

16
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,600
He's the military prosecutor who was in charge of

17
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,300
your parent's case twenty years ago. He played a part in covering up that trial.

18
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,400
Who said you could sit?

19
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,140
What's the matter with the ones who are subject to discipline?

20
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,970
I'll stand and receive it.

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,320
Let's first identify the persons subject to discipline. Name and rank?

22
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,180
4th Division Military Judicial Officer Captain Do Bae Man.

23
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,510
4th Division Military Judicial Officer Captain Cha Wu In.

24
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:38,210
Captain Do Bae Man, Captain Cha Wu In.

25
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:43,440
We will start the disciplinary committee meeting on each charge against each of you.

26
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,290
Proceed.

27
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:52,010
You bastard. How far are you going to go?

28
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,850
Do you think you can get away with this?

29
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,960
It's real.

30
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,040
It's a false leg.

31
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,580
You. You. Is this what you wanted to know?

32
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,360
It's General No Hwa Yeong.

33
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,360
Unity.

34
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:25,600
I'll ask the subject of discipline a question about the relevant facts of the incident.

35
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,150
Why did you break the prosthetic leg of Won Gi Chun, commander of the search squad?

36
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,210
In the process of investigating the shooting by Corporal Kim Han Yong,

37
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,520
a question arose concerning the search squad commander Won Gi Chun.

38
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,270
What was the question?

39
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:42,240
We determined that Commander Won Gi Chun had deceived the army and the nation.

40
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,920
Deceived?

41
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,860
Did you suspect the mine explosion in the DMZ was fabricated?

42
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,760
That is correct.

43
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,800
What is the basis?

44
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,870
The conclusion drawn from your statement is

45
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,200
that you broke his leg because the commander deceived everyone.

46
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,930
Well, did you even see a normal leg?

47
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,750
No.

48
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,200
No.

49
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,430
If that is so, were there any witnesses or informants?

50
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,870
No.

51
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,920
Are you kidding me now?

52
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,310
The entire country is outraged that military prosecutors insulted a national hero.

53
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,590
Without either evidence or a witness,

54
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,760
why on earth did you do something so ridiculous?

55
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,820
It's because I secured a video.

56
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,990
A video?

57
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:32,380
It was a false report from an unknown source, Sir.

58
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,040
Did you prosecute a case based on false information?

59
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,190
Do you acknowledge your mistake?

60
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,640
I should have verified and confirmed the report.

61
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,100
It was my error.

62
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,890
I understood that Caption Cha Wu In performed all trial activities.

63
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,190
It was Captain Cha's first trial.

64
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,140
She was conducting the trial under my supervision.

65
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:05,040
I accept responsibility for everything in this incident as the senior prosecutor in the office.

66
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:12,120
What is your opinion as their immediate supervisor, General No Hwa Yeong?

67
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,100
On the basis of an unconfirmed report and without legal justification, two low-ranking military prosecutors

68
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,570
gave an indelible insult to a superior officer who had come to the courtroom as a victim.

69
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:24,760
The only way to restore honor to Commander Won Gi Chun

70
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:30,170
is to punish Do Bae Man and Cha Wu In as a warning to others.

71
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:36,020
The disciplinary committee will vote on a decision after a ten minute recess.

72
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,140
Do you know what makes me maddest right now?

73
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:53,800
Is that that I was humiliated in court and will get punished?

74
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:02,180
No. It's that I could not exercise my own judgment to stop you.

75
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,720
I think I'm going crazy because I am so pathetic.

76
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,300
I didn't consider that the video could be fake.

77
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,300
I am sorry.

78
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,840
The result of the committee's deliberation is that

79
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,160
we have determined that the abuse of authority

80
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,700
and violation of the duties to apply the laws and rules,

81
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,880
the duty of integrity and the duty to be dignified

82
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,370
by the subjects of discipline are grounds for discipline.

83
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:35,780
Accordingly, this disciplinary committee in compliance with Article 57 of the Military Personnel Act,

84
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:40,310
and the standards for disciplinary action under Article 2 of the Enforcement Rules of the Military Disciplinary Decree,

85
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:44,810
the subjects shall receive the following discipline.

86
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,180
Captain Do Bae Man, three months suspension,

87
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,670
Captain Cha Wu In, ten days confined to quarters.

88
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,470
That is all.

89
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:15,080
Three month's suspension, actually, is the longest suspension period.

90
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,800
Cha Wu In is also confined to the barracks.

91
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,640
She has to stay within the barracks until disciplinary action is completed.

92
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,790
She can't take a step beyond the guard post.

93
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,590
But if the order says don't leave the base,

94
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,770
does that mean she can't go to court? What do they want to do about investigations?

95
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,800
What do you mean what?

96
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,890
It means they need to stay off of cases.

97
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,970
Are you concerned about Cha Wu In now?

98
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:42,150
She got a slap on the wrist thanks to Do Bae Man taking the fall.

99
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,550
I'm sorry Chief.

100
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,700
But, speaking about that.

101
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,130
When Do Bae Man is suspended

102
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:52,090
and Cha Wu In is removed from her assignment,

103
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:56,200
who in our legal office is going take care of court issues?

104
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,410
- Who?
- Yes.

105
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,220
What do you mean, who?

106
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,720
Me. I will take care of all of them.

107
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,320
Yes? Oh.

108
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,320
You Chief, are you saying you personally?

109
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,700
Sure. I will use this as an opportunity to take up the slack in the law office.

110
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,440
What are the cases that Cha Wu In was working on?

111
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,900
Kim Han Yong's shooting and No Tae Nam's desertion.

112
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,970
Both are on the same day.

113
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,130
That's good.

114
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,250
Put all the relevant material in my office.

115
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,350
Pardon? Yes!

116
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,960
I'm emphasizing once more,

117
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,910
in the future, even if there is one in our office, if you say the word "landmine" aloud,

118
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:44,150
I'll throw a harpoon at you!

119
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,380
A harpoon?

120
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,590
I'm sick and tired of this.
(T/N: "Sick and tired" has same first syllable "ji" as "landmine.")

121
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,600
- Oh, "Ji"!
- That's not a joke!

122
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,790
Chief!

123
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:10,880
It was strong evidence to break the story of the self-made hero.

124
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,730
His injury-free leg will do the job.

125
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:16,640
On the basis of an unconfirmed report and without legal justification two low-ranking military prosecutors

126
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,840
gave an indelible insult to a superior officer who had come to the courtroom as a victim.

127
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,530
I haven't slept a single day since you came to the law office.

128
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:30,000
Stay out of all investigations until Prosecutor Do returns. Do you understand?

129
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,190
No. It's that I could not exercise my own judgment to stop you.

130
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:38,760
I think I'm going crazy because I am so pathetic.

131
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:44,360
♫ I remember the past days trying ♫

132
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:51,000
♫ to hold on the moments which are becoming blurred one by one ♫

133
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,790
♫ I am trying to fill my heart  ♫

134
00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:02,230
♫ with them and keep them there ♫

135
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,770
The decision of a military disciplinary committee that was convened after an unprecedented occurrence

136
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:07,650
during a military trial was announced.

137
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:11,600
The committee imposed a severe punishment on the military prosecutor who was the subject of the meeting.

138
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,980
Both the ruling and opposition parties are avidly trying to recruit

139
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,020
Lt. Colonel Won Gi Chun, Commander of the search squad who will be discharged shortly from the army,

140
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:23,610
as a candidate for the upcoming by-election by making a series of love calls to him.

141
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,730
Not just within political circles, but everyone

142
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:31,570
is watching to see where the hero Won Gi Chun will join hands.
[Attorney Yong Mun Gu]

143
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:44,040
I heard the news. Three months of suspension, right?

144
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,080
There's no way you came so late to have me cry on your shoulder. Why did you come?

145
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,100
If you were my subordinate, there would have been no disciplinary action

146
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,850
because I would have done it in advance.

147
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,650
Are you here to tell me I should feel sorry for not working with you?

148
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:02,240
The Do Bae Man I know is not the sort of person

149
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:06,760
who would have broken Won Gi Chun's prosthetic leg without proof.

150
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,870
What is the reason?

151
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,160
You are very direct in your spying.

152
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,350
Did General No Hwa Yeong send you?

153
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,440
She hasn't said anything about it to me this time.

154
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,780
You're trying to get something out of me without any order from the general.

155
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,330
You're so twisted.

156
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,680
Anyway, I don't think you're in a good mood after the disciplinary action.

157
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,170
Although I feel sorry for you, thanks to the discipline,

158
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:34,640
the desertion trial for No Tae Nam has been made easier.

159
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,880
Chief Seo Ju Hyeok is the prosecutor in place of Cha Wu In now.

160
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,270
Even if you were still in my employ, it could not have been a better situation than it is now.

161
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,880
It means you can never break a rock with an egg.

162
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,300
The more you think about it, the truer it is, right?

163
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,940
Military Prosecutor Do Bae Man

164
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,920
It hasn't been long since you canceled your discharge and returned. What's going on?

165
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,180
Why does our law office always get messed up? Why?

166
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:35,690
While I'm away, take good care of the chief. Don't fight with each other.

167
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,350
Prosecutor Do Bae Man can't come into the base.

168
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,690
Prosecutor Cha Wu In can't leave the base.

169
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,470
I'm off.

170
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,730
This isn't some kind of star-crossed lovers' story.

171
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:03,780
If someone were watching, they would think someone made a decision to separate the two. Seriously.

172
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:07,840
We even gave Won Gi Chun the sympathy votes.

173
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,130
When he is discharged from the military, he will have an assemblyman's gold pin.

174
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:16,410
And top of that, we can't even put an end to No Tae Nam with our own hands.

175
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,870
Why are you saying you are responsible for everything?

176
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:22,310
I made the mistake.

177
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,980
I know that.

178
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,960
This is what receiving discipline means.

179
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,290
It feels lousy.

180
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,660
Why do I take all the responsibility for everything?

181
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,760
What would we do if both of us had our hands tied?

182
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:49,210
- Sorry?
- You in here and I outside will be doing something.

183
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:53,020
We failed but we didn't quit.

184
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:03,600
I won't give up the landmine case, either.

185
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,280
Besides, I made a promise to Pros Cha.

186
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,340
You said you would finish in ninety days, didn't you?

187
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,890
Right. I can't rest for ninety days.

188
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,500
We need to wrap up the landmine case.

189
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:19,450
We both are excluded from our duties. I can't take any official action.

190
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:24,590
Things aren't always according to the book, both in investigations and in the world.

191
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,300
I am not someone who does as he is told. Don't you know me?

192
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,570
Call me.

193
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,420
I'm taking away the soldier and the prosecutor,

194
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,360
and moving as a civilian.

195
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,120
If you can't investigate officially, that means you can't stand out.

196
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:02,250
Of course. I must look like a very decent civilian.

197
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,680
That's why I came here first.

198
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,590
But, won't this fabric stand out too much, Mr. Prosecutor?

199
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,530
Clothes truly are wings.

200
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:17,670
No matter who sees me, I won't look like a military prosecutor. It's too perfect.

201
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:20,230
You said it. Good job.

202
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:25,170
Let's return to the beginning and properly take Kim Han Yong's statement first.

203
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,390
After today's trial, I will send Kim Han Yong to you through Sang Gi.

204
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,840
Chief, it's time to go to court.

205
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,190
I washed and ironed it.

206
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:43,130
Chief, how many years has it taken for you to make a comeback?

207
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,340
Old soldiers never die.

208
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,150
They just disappear for a while and re-appear.

209
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,240
Old solider. Just hearing that warms my heart.

210
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,780
- May I try on?
- Yes.

211
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,970
Good.

212
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:58,040
All the time...

213
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,190
Starting now I will let you know some clues unofficially.

214
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:07,500
I'll get that and move from the outside. Okay?

215
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,640
Yes, General. We're leaving now.

216
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,960
I'll see you in court.

217
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,600
IM Defense Chairman Yong Mun Gu.

218
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,280
Get out of here immediately. I'm calling security.

219
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,550
Chairman No Tae Nam's stowaway funds.

220
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,320
I personally processed them.

221
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,180
I have something to tell you. Please see me.

222
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,250
Huh?

223
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:43,520
- What the? Was I just ignored?
- You were.

224
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,260
Huh?

225
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,000
When you are a prosecutor or a lawyer,

226
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,390
you can only elegantly go up and down the courthouse stairs.

227
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:01,370
However, you've become a big company owner now.

228
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:04,800
Do you ever need to get your hands dirty?

229
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,520
Even if there is something hard to handle, and if I accept the work, it's going to be done smoothly.

230
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,990
Humble as I am, I only deal with the top 1%.

231
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,520
Did you help No Tae Nam stow away?

232
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,490
Well, besides helping him, I had a big fight with Doberman punk, too.

233
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:25,450
Even Do Bae Man, we know each other.

234
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,490
The timing is good.

235
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,980
I'll devote my heart and soul to you.

236
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:39,330
I'm make sure you don't even get a speck of dust on your hands.

237
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:56,200
Starting now will we catch Do Bae Man?

238
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,540
When I think about my reputation being ruined that day, I get angry and can't sleep.

239
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:05,540
The saying that there's nothing in the world that can't be thrown away is right.

240
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,980
What do you mean?

241
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,910
Thanks to shyster Do,

242
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:13,310
we've joined CEO Yong Mun Gu's team now.

243
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,080
We finally made it to the big leagues!

244
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,960
Are we catching him or hot?

245
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,930
This stupid bastard, you don't understand anything.

246
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:23,890
Hey North Korean fly,

247
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:29,240
If you want to work in the south, more than anything, you have to know how to restrain yourself.

248
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,740
Okay?

249
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,040
No pain, no gain. Got it?

250
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,600
- Company dinner!
- Company dinner!

251
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:45,250
As the legal office's head,

252
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,670
I deeply apologize to Commander Won Gi Chun

253
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:53,380
for last week's unpleasant incident.

254
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:59,740
Military Prosecutor, please proceed with matters relevant to the case being tried.

255
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,320
Yes, I understand, Your Honor.

256
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:10,290
Defendant Kim Han Yong have you reflected on your actions?

257
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,350
Did you reflect on yourself a lot?

258
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:17,220
Did you reflect on yourself a lot?

259
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,660
I am sorry to have caused so much trouble. I am deeply reflecting on my actions.

260
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,330
Look at this, Your Honor.

261
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:27,890
Look at this, Your Honor. He is deeply reflecting.

262
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:31,830
Pending the court's ruling even up to now, defendant Kim Yong Han is consistently shameless.

263
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,030
Although the defendant deserted the army,

264
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,960
the time off base was very short.

265
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,130
It doesn't matter that Kim Yong Han only shot a blank.

266
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:43,600
His privacy has already been exposed once.

267
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,740
This is an indisputable case of challenging a superior's rank.

268
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,330
His action was accidental.

269
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,530
It was a crime of mutiny.

270
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:56,700
I ask that you'll be merciful with your sentencing.

271
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:02,060
He most definitely deserves a harsh sentencing, your Honor.

272
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,730
- Defendant Kim Han Yong.
- Defendant No Tae Nam.

273
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,700
- is sentenced to five years in prison.
- is sentenced to one month in prison,

274
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,730
and the sentence for the defendant is suspended.

275
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,470
It's a relief the sentence was light.

276
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,830
A suspended sentence.

277
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:32,800
In the end, the army runs around in circles and everything turns out the way my mother wants.

278
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,590
I'm getting used to this.

279
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,900
Mother.

280
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,930
You'd better be grateful that this is your punishment...

281
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:57,500
for putting me through the humiliation I faced because of you.

282
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,420
You'll be assigned to a base tomorrow.

283
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,960
One that's on the front line.

284
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,690
- Wh-What?
- From now on,

285
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:14,030
you'll have to serve more diligently than anyone else.

286
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:16,730
How can I go to the frontline? How?

287
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:19,800
This is the last chance I'll be giving you.

288
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,390
If you cause trouble again...

289
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:26,690
I'll cut you out without the slightest hesitation.

290
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:35,710
Anyone who disobeys my orders,

291
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:39,090
I make sure to cut them out regardless of who that is.

292
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:42,400
Whether it be my son or my subordinate.

293
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,500
Whoever it is.

294
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,640
Will it really be okay to send him to the frontline?

295
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,390
It's my decision.

296
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:04,080
Yes, ma'am. I'll take care of everything.

297
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,580
Regarding Battalion Commander Won Gi Chun.

298
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,760
Is there anything I should know about?

299
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,410
What's your intention in asking that question?

300
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,600
Do Bae Man wouldn't have broken

301
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,700
Lieutenant Colonel Won's prosthetic leg for no reason.

302
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:25,250
Let me be clear.

303
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:29,730
Don't stick your nose into my division and subordinates.

304
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:40,730
DMZ Landmine Explosion Incident

305
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,020
Hi, it's been a while, Judge Advocate Oh.

306
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,330
Sunbaenim! It's been so long.

307
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,480
Aigoo, I should've called you first.

308
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,810
I just wanted to check something.

309
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:06,110
It must be urgent. Let me know how I can help.

310
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:09,300
Battalion Commander Won Gi Chun's mine explosion accident.

311
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,170
You were the first to investigate that, right?

312
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:14,450
Yes. We had a joint investigation for it.

313
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,280
Was there anything unusual about it?

314
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,580
Not really.

315
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,000
But I knew that punk Kim Han Yong would cause a big problem.

316
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:27,170
You're saying there were signs before he shot the battalion commander?

317
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,220
Absolutely.

318
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,950
Oh, goodness. What should we do?

319
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,380
What? What is it?

320
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,160
I forgot the transfer and trial books.

321
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,850
Gosh, Section Chief Ahn! Come on!

322
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,690
This isn't your first day on this job. How could you forget?

323
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:50,420
Wh-What are we going to do now?

324
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:53,160
I'm sorry, sir! I'll stop by the office and go get it quickly.

325
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,870
Then hurry up and turn the car around. Hurry.

326
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:01,160
I guess you'll have to tag along too.

327
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,870
Wait quietly.

328
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:38,470
Why was there another military prosecutor at court?

329
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,410
You acted like you understood me.

330
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,050
I've received disciplinary punishment.

331
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:50,320
- Today is our last chance.
- I've already received my sentencing.

332
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,900
What's the use now?

333
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,290
The truth is still buried.

334
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,130
That's why you picked up the gun too.

335
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,610
You snuck the gun out

336
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:08,030
and chose a place that would be packed with reporters.

337
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:13,070
You deliberated until the very end whether you should use the real bullet or a blank one.

338
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:16,560
You were only thinking about your brother,

339
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,600
Not yourself.

340
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,530
You agonized until the final moment on whether you should avenge him by killing him on the spot

341
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:26,580
or by revealing his upsetting truth.

342
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,420
You don't know anything about me, Military Prosecutor.

343
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,930
I know very well.

344
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:37,450
Because I picked up a gun before, just like you.

345
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:40,610
I also had someone

346
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,740
whom I wanted to kill with one gunshot.

347
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:48,380
♫ Where to go and how to make it right ♫

348
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:55,940
♫ I'll never give it up ♫

349
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:03,060
♫ You'll never get what you want ♫

350
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:07,770
♫ Oh everywhere, all this violence, ♫

351
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:11,350
♫ trying to tear my heart out ♫

352
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:16,730
♫ I'll keep it up with no one by my side ♫

353
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:21,570
♫ When this light gets dark ♫

354
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:25,670
I killed that person countless times in my head.

355
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:28,750
But when the opportunity came right in front of my eyes,

356
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,960
I couldn't shoot.

357
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:37,100
Because my hatred was too big to end it like that.

358
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,370
It felt like a bullet that weighed a mere two grams

359
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:44,630
made that person's crime disappear.

360
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:48,120
It must've been the same for you,

361
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,630
which is why you loaded it with blanks, not real bullets.

362
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,020
You could've killed him easily.

363
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:58,450
But the weight of the bullets couldn't compare to that of your hatred.

364
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:05,280
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said this to you.

365
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,520
- I just—
- My brother...

366
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:11,990
It was a picture of his CT scan.

367
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,140
CT scan?

368
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,820
This is Company Commander Kim's CT scan.

369
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,590
You see this small dot here, right? It's shrapnel from a landmine.

370
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:24,880
One, two, three, four, five, six.

371
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,170
It's embedded in here.

372
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:30,660
It's a miracle that he's alive with all this.

373
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:35,010
My brother got badly hurt from a serious traffic accident when he was younger.

374
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:39,000
That's when I first found out that the shape of his brain was different from others.

375
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,200
I was young when I saw it, but I remember it clearly.

376
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,880
But the CT scan that the military doctor showed—

377
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,040
Was not your brother's CT scan?

378
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,540
That's right. That ignited my suspicion.

379
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,540
The crucial thing was...

380
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,520
What was written in the letter?

381
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:55,330
It was written that Battalion Commander Won Gi Chun didn't save my brother.

382
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:58,350
But that he shot my brother.

383
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:00,670
Won Ki Chun.

384
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:03,030
He shot the gun?

385
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:08,180
The battalion commander didn't save the company commander, but he shot him with a gun.

386
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:19,350
That's it. Wu In told me she got it from Kim Han Yong.

387
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:23,000
Kim Han Yong showed that letter and pictures of his CT scan to the military's joint-investigation team...

388
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,550
and requested they re-investigate.

389
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,520
But he was turned down every time.

390
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,940
Which is why

391
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:34,120
it was hard for him to open up to us, who are military prosecutors too.

392
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:39,080
Well, I don't trust prosecutors in Korea either. So I understand him fully.

393
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,620
You must understand too,

394
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,860
since you were a rotten prosecutor before re-enlisting.

395
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:52,220
I only trust one prosecutor, and that's Cha Wu In.

396
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:57,110
But we only have Kim Han Yong's testimony to prove that letter is real.

397
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:02,170
Have you already lost your instincts from one day of suspension?

398
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:06,350
Both that letter and CT scan are sending the same sign.

399
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,460
If the military doctor switched the CT scan pictures,

400
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,410
it means that it's highly likely that there's a scan with a bullet inside instead of shrapnel

401
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:17,860
according to the letter.

402
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,230
Man, you really talk a lot.

403
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:28,580
The battalion commander didn't save the company commander, but he shot him with a gun.

404
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,520
I've arrived at the military hospital.

405
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,740
I looked into medical doctor Cho's personal information.

406
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:39,470
I found a link to Won Gi Chun.

407
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,770
You did?

408
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:44,870
Won Gi Chun's doctor was Doctor Cho Su Chan.

409
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:47,350
I knew it.

410
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:52,370
Finding the doctor may help unravel this very quickly.

411
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:54,000
Unity.

412
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:05,940
You have no right to arrest him. So how do you plan to get a confession from Doctor Cho?

413
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:09,030
I'll have to be gentle. Like a gentleman.

414
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:14,180
I'll have to be discreet, go unnoticed, and do it quietly.

415
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,310
You're saying there were signs before he shot the battalion commander?

416
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:37,820
Absolutely. He claimed his brother's CT scan picture was switched.

417
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:40,890
He insisted they should investigate the military doctor.

418
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:46,120
You're saying Kim Han Yong was suspicious of the military doctor, right?

419
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:56,070
My family was treated by this doctor. Where can I find him?

420
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:58,200
It's Military Doctor Cho Su Chang.

421
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,240
He's going on an extended leave today. He just left with his stuff.

422
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,620
- Just now?
- Yes.

423
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,400
Damn it.

424
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,560
Yes, CEO Yong?

425
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:21,150
I need you to find someone. 3467.

426
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,820
3467, you said?

427
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,460
It's a license plate number. Move out now!

428
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:28,390
- Understood. Hey, Jiri.
- Yes, sir?

429
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:30,610
- We're looking for 3467.
- 3467?

430
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,230
- Drive.
- Drive!

431
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,410
Excuse me?

432
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:40,690
- I told him.
- But how?

433
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,290
Excuse me?

434
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,270
Which room is Military Doctor Cho Su Chan in?

435
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,750
I'd like to meet him.

436
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:56,970
A lot of people are asking for him today.

437
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:00,300
Is that so? Who else asked?

438
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:06,590
I'm not sure. He just said his family was treated by Doctor Cho.

439
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:10,040
His room is the last one down the hallway.

440
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,070
I see. Thank you. See you around.

441
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:19,090
- My gosh.
- He's so handsome!

442
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,440
What's happening?

443
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,880
- Come here.
- Okay.

444
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,670
- Hurry!
- Come this way.

445
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:49,400
Run away! Hurry up!

446
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,140
I have bad news and really bad news. Which one would you like to hear first?

447
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,960
Are those sirens I hear?

448
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,900
I thought you were going to be discreet.

449
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:06,190
The bad news is that you probably lost him. What's the really bad one?

450
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:09,880
Besides us, there's someone else who's looking for the military doctor.

451
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:16,060
Someone else is trying to reveal the truth regarding the mine case?

452
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,950
We don't know if the goal is to reveal it or to bury it completely.

453
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,960
But one thing is for sure.

454
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:35,130
It's that we have an annoying fly following us.

455
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:43,060
Gosh, this is impressive.

456
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,680
What's this? Why is No Tae Nam's dog here?

457
00:36:54,680 --> 00:37:00,640
Wu In brought him here after arresting No Tae Nam at the airport. I've been fostering him temporarily.

458
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,710
Wu In can't leave the base, so I've been stuck with him.

459
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:11,090
You're going through a lot too, buddy.

460
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:15,990
Oh, Military Doctor Cho was using this. Search to see if there's anything useful.

461
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:19,450
You brought the whole thing?

462
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:23,850
That's stealing. Gosh, didn't you think of the consequences?

463
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:26,790
I just sped up the search and seizure process.

464
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:30,130
We'll get an arrest warrant for Won Gi Chun soon.

465
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:35,470
This is video from Won Gi Chun's hospital room. Check if it's genuine or not.

466
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,940
I thought you'd be sulking around after receiving your punishment.

467
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:43,010
Just look into that and let me know.

468
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,110
Oh, wait. Hold on.

469
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:50,490
Look after him for the time being. My dog hair allergies are killing me.

470
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:54,790
What? How can I look after him?

471
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:02,250
You're a good match. A soldier that's been kicked out and a dog who lost his owner.

472
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:05,340
Your sad situations compliment each other perfectly.

473
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,920
You look alike. You're a great match.

474
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,540
You're a much better match than I. You can do it, Do Bae Man. You got this!

475
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:16,570
Hey! CEO Kang. Kang Ha Jun! Kang Ha Jun!

476
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:18,580
We don't look alike!

477
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:24,900
What am I supposed to do with him? Wait. Good.

478
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:29,550
The military prosecutors who caused a scene at military court...

479
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:34,690
by harassing Battalion Commander Won Gi Chun have been harshly punished.

480
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:37,260
Oh, gosh.

481
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,770
What is this dog?

482
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:44,780
Aunt. Oh, you were home.

483
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:48,350
Hey... You're bringing a dog in on top of everything now?

484
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:51,450
Right, he said he was thirsty. Hold onto him.

485
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:56,040
- Hey, hey, hey! Damn it!
- Hold on.

486
00:38:56,850 --> 00:39:01,530
Wait. He looks familiar. A Doberman?

487
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:04,130
Where have I seen you from? Look over here.

488
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:07,930
Come on. Here's your water. Come.

489
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,800
You were nowhere to be found when things were busy.

490
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,210
Hey. You think this is your hideout whenever you get punished?

491
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:23,940
I... I was out all day investigating the Landmine Hero case.

492
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,440
I've been running all over the place all day.

493
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:30,000
- Ouch.
- I'm asking as a detective from now. So don't lie.

494
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,330
If you do, I'll cuff you up immediately.

495
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,610
I'm not joking around.

496
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:36,740
Gosh, Aunt. Why are you doing this?

497
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,400
Club Cartel. It was you, right?

498
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:44,320
I saw him from there. It's No Tae Nam's dog, right?

499
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:49,910
The rat that ran away after drinking with No Tae Nam. That was you, right Bae Man?

500
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,830
Aunt.

501
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,690
That's in the past now.

502
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:58,510
The past?

503
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:05,050
So it was you.

504
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,760
About that...

505
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,900
I was going to confess everything to you.

506
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,950
I have something bigger to tell you before that.

507
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:18,000
Something bigger? What is it?

508
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:21,990
It's about Mom and Dad.

509
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:28,960
- What?
- Where do I start.

510
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,890
Aunt. Listen carefully to me.

511
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:35,780
Hey, get out. Get out now!

512
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:38,010
You're going to use your parents as an excuse now?

513
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:40,770
- That's not it. Just listen to me—
- Get out!

514
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:43,720
- Go! I don't even want to look at you. Don't ever come here.
- You didn't even hear me out.

515
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,330
Take the dog too. Get out! Go!

516
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:50,010
You don't have to shout. You're startling the dog.

517
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:53,030
I said, get out! Go!

518
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,580
I'm going. Gosh, you scared me.

519
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,560
Let's go. Let's go.

520
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:02,390
- Gosh, let's go. I'm going.
- Don't ever come again!

521
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,400
DMZ Landmine Explosion Case

522
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,040
It was written that Battalion Commander Won didn't save my brother.

523
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,840
But he shot him instead.

524
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:30,540
Prosecutor Cha. I sent you the documents of the soldiers who went on the reconnaissance patrol.

525
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:38,380
Officer Personnel Record

526
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,440
Yes, Prosecutor Do?

527
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:50,310
CEO Kang is looking for the military doctor. We'll find a clue soon.

528
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:54,340
I'm searching for potential suspects who could've sent the letter to Kim Han Yong.

529
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:59,850
No Tae Nam's ruling is out.

530
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,430
Kim Han Yong's too.

531
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:02,840
I know.

532
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:07,900
No Tae Nam will get a slap on the wrist and start serving in the military.

533
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,950
Things don't always go to plan I guess.

534
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:15,140
Wrong. Everything is going according to my plan.

535
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:18,230
- What?
- Just wait and see.

536
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:25,140
I sent his worst nightmare to his side, so he can enjoy his military life.

537
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,740
I'm Sergeant Ahn Su Ho. You're the famous No Tae Nam, right?

538
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:39,580
Gosh, we went to the same military prison and now the same base.

539
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:43,300
I guess it's fate. I hope we get along.

540
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:49,380
Seems like you're not hoping for the same?

541
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:55,320
From now on, you'll have to serve more diligently than anyone else.

542
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,990
This is the last chance I'll be giving you.

543
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:03,260
I hope we get along.

544
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,820
Sergeant Ahn Su Ho.

545
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:09,310
All right, Tae Nam. You can be comfortable around me.

546
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:47,920
Barracks 1

547
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:54,780
All right, the platoon members will be back once they're done with their duties. Wait for them.

548
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,180
Yes, I understand.

549
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:00,970
Hey, don't you answer me?

550
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:03,960
You clueless newbie.

551
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,450
I get it.

552
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:07,440
Get it right.

553
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,330
Is this base at the frontline?

554
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:27,220
The exact name is GOP (Troops beyond the barbed wire fence). It's a platoon that protects the border 24-7.

555
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:29,180
It's different from regular troops.

556
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:32,980
- How is it different?
- There's no PX beyond the FEBA base.

557
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:35,880
There's no leaving or sleeping outside of the base either.

558
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,170
So what does this place have?

559
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:41,230
Real bullets and grenades.

560
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:43,310
G-Grenades?

561
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:46,710
What? Are you scared?

562
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,190
You'd better lay low here.

563
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:58,210
They live amongst grenades here. If there's conflict, they'll blow the grenade right away.

564
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:06,480
But what got you into military prison, Sergeant Ahn?

565
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,000
Me?

566
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:13,400
Are you curious?

567
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:19,290
I'll tell you little by little.

568
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:25,190
Hey, new ones, new ones!

569
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:26,620
Wow, is he a celebrity?

570
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:28,620
- Look at his face.
- What's with the stare?

571
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:32,360
- It's like you want to fight us.
- Are you No Tae Nam?

572
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:39,100
Wow, I won!

573
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:45,840
Man, you must've done all sorts of things to pay money to gamble.

574
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,600
For example, something like switching the CT scan pictures.

575
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,540
Shit.

576
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,540
Shyster Do.

577
00:45:55,900 --> 00:46:00,230
You must be short on money since receiving punishment, seeing how you're here to rip him off.

578
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:02,770
What? Why are you doing it to me?

579
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:05,740
- Are you all in the same gang?
- No.

580
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:08,860
Why are you interested in him?

581
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:13,190
There's an old saying about one's lack of knowledge. You probably wouldn't know.

582
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:18,170
You mean the saying, "How can a summer bug know the winter?"

583
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:21,590
Wow, our Doberman is so smart.

584
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:26,460
You've received an order from someone else to bring him in.

585
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:31,610
So it means, you're a thoughtless bug who just does as you're told to do.

586
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,150
- Bug?
- Yes.

587
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:42,830
Hey, Do Bae Man. You don't know my life.

588
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:46,650
Meaning I live according to my own thoughts too!

589
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:47,500
Come with me.

590
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,500
Take him out!

591
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,240
Comrade Do.

592
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:07,260
I'll finally get my revenge for the last time.

593
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:13,480
I'm sick of this. So sick of it.

594
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,690
That damn bastard.

595
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,030
He's cute now that I've seen him again.

596
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,620
Excuse me. Was it this guy who was looking for Military Doctor Cho?

597
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:42,460
Oh, gosh. You're the guy who came last time. Are you okay?

598
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:45,250
- Is it this person, right?
- No.

599
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:47,530
- You need to treat it right now.
- No, no!!

600
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:49,990
Are you sure you're not mistaken? It must've been him.

601
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:52,370
How can I confuse that man with this gangster.

602
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:55,970
That person was a total gentleman.

603
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:57,660
Perhaps,

604
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,890
is this person?

605
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:04,130
Right. Yes, he is.

606
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:06,890
- You're sure, right?
- Of course.

607
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:09,450
I get it. Thank you.

608
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,680
Military Doctor Cho is in Yong Mun Gu's hands?

609
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,260
- Then is No Hwa Yeong—
- No.

610
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:21,520
He didn't know about Won Gi Chun's incident at all.

611
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,550
The Do Bae Man I know is not the sort of person

612
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:30,070
who would have broken Won Gi Chun's prosthetic leg without proof. What is the reason?

613
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:34,730
If No Hwa Yeong ordered him to do it, he wouldn't run around personally like me.

614
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:38,470
So Yong Mun Gu is acting without orders from No Hwa Yeong?

615
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:43,620
Like us, Yong Mu Gu is curious about the landmine incident.

616
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:47,420
Anyway, it's a problem that we can't use the military doctor to our advantage now.

617
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:49,760
I'll give you an even better advantage.

618
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,360
Did you find the suspect who sent him the letter?

619
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,600
I'll give you the address.

620
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,390
Yes.

621
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,010
Yes, ma'am.

622
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:31,670
I've already warmed him up for you.

623
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:34,270
He'll spill whatever you ask him.

624
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:36,490
Not bad.

625
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:39,630
From now on, you'll follow me like a shadow.

626
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:41,960
Like someone who's there but undetectable.

627
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,900
Undetectable? I like that.

628
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:50,340
It sounds like you'll take care of everything, sir.

629
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:58,770
You must've hid the company commander's CT scan because there was information that had to be hidden.

630
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:03,310
It was because his brain had a bullet inside, not shrapnel.

631
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:06,790
Yes, that's right.

632
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:09,520
Did Won Gi Chun order you to do it?

633
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,330
Yes, yes.

634
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:14,370
It wasn't ordered by someone higher up?

635
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:18,330
No, sir. I received the order from the battalion commander.

636
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:20,900
You sure? That there's no one else besides Won Gi Chun?

637
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,640
Yes.

638
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:29,670
Then let's get to the main point now.

639
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:33,760
- Pardon?
- Tell me about Won Gi Chun's leg.

640
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,630
Okay.

641
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:56,980
Today's Midnight Snack

642
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,870
It's cold.

643
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:06,150
I am hungry.

644
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:10,730
You're Sergeant Gu Yeong Seok from 4th Division, right?

645
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:14,310
Man, it's cold. Did you receive a lot of orders today?

646
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:19,180
- What's your deal?
- You're the one who left the letter at the company commander's hospital room, right?

647
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:24,410
- Who are you really?
- Me?

648
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:29,410
I'm the military prosecutor who was in charge of Kim Han Yong's case.

649
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:32,240
Answer the question.

650
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:36,140
- No.
- Did you say no?

651
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,710
If it really wasen't you, wouldn't you ask what letter I'm talking about?

652
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:45,650
So this means you know what letter I'm talking about.

653
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:48,850
Don't go there. It's none of my business.

654
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:53,020
The day you left the letter happened to be the day you were discharged.

655
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:56,230
Gosh, what a coincidence, right?

656
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:58,350
Even the handwriting matches yours.

657
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:03,340
Why then? You weren't confident enough to do it in uniform?

658
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:09,010
Or did you want to rid of your petty guilt?

659
00:52:09,010 --> 00:52:13,250
So? Did it rid of your guilt?

660
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:16,420
Shut your mouth! I was already discharged!

661
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:19,500
You. You have no right to do this to me.

662
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:23,210
I'm never going to get tied in with the damn military ever again.

663
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:26,820
The letter you wrote became a trigger to Kim Han Yong.

664
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:34,130
He read that letter and shot Won Gi Chun.

665
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:36,840
He received a five-year sentence for that.

666
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:40,210
- Five years, you said?
- You shouldn't have left the letter behind.

667
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:43,830
How do you plan to rid of your guilt regarding Kim Han Yong now?

668
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:47,650
You said it's been decided. Isn't it all over now?

669
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:49,320
No.

670
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:56,450
I'm going to start again. I heard you relied on the company commander the most.

671
00:52:56,450 --> 00:53:01,020
Even if the military sucks, you can't let it slide just like that, right?

672
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:07,920
You're the only hope that the company commander has.

673
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,460
Please tell me the truth.

674
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:20,480
It was extremely foggy that day, so it was difficult to secure clear vision.

675
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,850
Halt. Five minute rest.

676
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:23,850
Five minute rest.

677
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:25,650
- Five minute rest.
- Five minute rest.

678
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:33,800
During the reconnaissance, Battalion Commander Won went to relieve himself.

679
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,790
Then a water elk appeared.

680
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:42,300
Isn't that a water elk?

681
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,690
- It looks like one.
- What?

682
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:48,180
Isn't it heading towards the battalion commander?

683
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:49,630
Yes, I think you're right.

684
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:54,320
That's a mine field. If the water elk steps on a mine, it'll be bad.

685
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,690
Hey. You boys wait over here.

686
00:53:56,690 --> 00:54:00,430
- Stay on your toes.
- Yes, sir.

687
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:04,200
I'll go together with you, Company Commander.

688
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:07,980
Stay here.

689
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,490
Who is it?

690
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:24,350
Company Commander?

691
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:34,850
I said, who are you!

692
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:36,770
I'm going to shoot if you don't give me your name and rank.

693
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:38,570
You hear me?

694
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:56,080
- Battalion Commander!
- I said, I'll shoot!

695
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:24,510
Company Commander?

696
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:26,440
Company Commander!

697
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,410
If the case really gets re-investigated,

698
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:47,880
I'll testify to everything in trial.

699
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:52,840
I'll see you in court.

700
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:57,700
If Sergeant Gu's testimony is true,

701
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:01,790
Won Gi Chun shot the company commander accidentally.

702
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:04,410
Then he transformed himself into the Landmine Hero to cover that incident up.

703
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:07,260
Division Commander No Hwa Yeong was involved?

704
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:11,670
They could've just punished Won Gi Chun alone. Why did they go through all that trouble?

705
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:16,780
If a shooting accident happens in the DMZ, it won't stop at just Won Gi Chun.

706
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:21,360
It happened right after she was inaugurated as division commander, which she had dreamed of for so long.

707
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,840
Then No Tae Nam's deserting case happened soon after.

708
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:28,600
So she manipulated the incident and turned Won Gi Chun into the Landmine Hero.

709
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:32,850
Hold on. Then what about this issue?

710
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:43,110
I ran it through a program, but found no traces of modifications or that it's fake.

711
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:45,440
You'll get the same results even if the NFS checks it.

712
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:51,840
Sergeant Gu's testimony too. He said Won Ki Chun didn't hurt his leg that day.

713
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,890
Then why did his leg disappear?

714
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:59,800
I think he cut off his leg before the trial.

715
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:03,020
There's no other explanation besides that.

716
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,670
What?

717
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:07,250
He c-cut off his leg?

718
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:15,190
We might be dealing with a monster that's much more terrifying than we had imagined.

719
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:46,090
Chairman No has been assigned to his base safely.

720
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:49,990
You have to always be on alert for both Tae Nam and IM Defense.

721
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:55,370
Your job is to prevent accidents from happening.

722
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:05,810
I found something out about Lieutenant Colonel Won's mine case.

723
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:11,560
I'm sure I made it clear to keep your nose out of my division and soldiers.

724
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:14,740
Did it not sound like a warning to you?

725
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:19,360
I did it to prevent an accident, just like you told me to.

726
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:24,110
As the CEO of IM Defense and your lawyer.

727
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:30,440
All right. What did you find out?

728
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:38,880
The real main character of the Landmine Hero's story was you, but not Won Gi Chun.

729
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:42,170
An accidental shooting happened in a mine field.

730
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:46,510
If the world found out,

731
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:50,630
you would've experienced the humiliation of stepping down from your position as soon as you got it.

732
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:53,430
On top of that, Chairman No's trial happened.

733
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:57,370
Which is why I made Won Gi Chun a hero?

734
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,900
You've got a good imagination Lawyer Yong.

735
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:04,610
I'm already certain of those facts.

736
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:09,990
I'm actually extremely curious about something else.

737
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:12,610
Won Gi Chun's leg.

738
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:31,780
Save me, Division Commander. I'll do as you order.

739
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:35,510
I'll do anything. Whatever it is, I'll do it.

740
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:40,410
That's right. You have to do everything.

741
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:43,420
Adjutant Yang.

742
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:55,700
Division Commander. What are you doing?

743
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:59,610
Lieutenant Colonel Won Gi Chun.

744
00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:00,980
Yes, Division Commander.

745
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:04,570
You can be a soldier who shot his subordinate

746
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:08,340
Or you can become a hero who's revered by every soldier.

747
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:12,180
Whatever you order, I will do it.

748
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:30,880
Remain a real hero for me.

749
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:47,850
You may have lost a leg, but you gained the world.

750
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:52,790
You don't need to act the hero now

751
01:01:52,790 --> 01:01:56,090
since you became a real hero.

752
01:01:56,090 --> 01:02:02,350
Many will come running to pin a gold assemblyman's badge on you after you're honorably discharged.

753
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:09,540
Minister Lee Jae Sik and I will lead you through the path that you can no longer walk.

754
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:26,320
It was chopped off.

755
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:33,770
I chopped it off.

756
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:45,010
Military Prosecutor Doberman.

757
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:48,890
♫ My style without hesitation ♫

758
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:52,760
♫ No chance, you can't get away now ♫

759
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:57,960
♫ You can't find your way out. You are the prey in my hand ♫

760
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:01,760
It's a surgery to extract what is lodged in the brain, so you can imagine the possible bad effects.

761
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:05,680
A member of the search party in the minefield will make a declaration of conscience.

762
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:06,630
What?

763
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:10,860
We have to find evidence so that No Hwa Yeong will feel the blow.

764
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:13,630
- This press conference is canceled.
- No, it's not!

765
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:15,900
Do Bae Man, you're the crazy one.

766
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:20,760
That's enough. The moment you step over the line, your fate will change.

767
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:25,590
This isn't a simple case where the Landmine Hero self-fabricated a story. It's only a preview of an enormous gate.

768
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:26,650
♫  You've gotta pay for that ♫
