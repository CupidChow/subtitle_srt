Military Prosecutor Doberman

8
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,180
How do you feel, Bae Man?
 Episode 15

9
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,570
That you're getting beaten by a bug?

10
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,780
Refreshing, right?

11
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:08,800
In comparison to what you have done to me, this does not alleviate my anger.

12
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,410
It doesn't relieve me, Punk!

13
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,920
Thanks, Yong Mun Gu.

14
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,570
What?

15
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,230
If the eardrums were damaged, it would be mine. Are your ears blocked?

16
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,840
I said thanks.

17
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,690
Why do you? Why? Huh?

18
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,850
Son of a bitch.

19
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,650
What are you grateful for? You arrogant punk!

20
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,300
For putting me in the army.

21
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:47,260
For making me an offer I couldn't refuse five years ago.

22
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,130
If you had not done that to me,

23
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,220
you wouldn't be in this situation.

24
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,440
If only you had not fallen for Cha Wu In,

25
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,960
and if you had not been blinded by vengeance,

26
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,910
I'm sure you would still have been eating and living well while receiving wine boxes with full of cash.

27
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:08,920
Isn't it fun? You never know what life might throw you.

28
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,370
We've brought Kang Ha Jun.

29
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,050
I told him to take care of himself.

30
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:36,530
Well, now, shall we get down to business?

31
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,960
A few days ago

32
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,280
Division Commander No Hwa Yeong.

33
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,920
We will begin interrogation concerning the claim that you failed to frustrate crimes by your subordinates.

34
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,430
Before that, did you find anything after doing a search and seizure of my office as you pleased?

35
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,350
We didn't do it as we pleased.

36
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,610
I followed legal procedures.

37
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,480
Legal procedures?

38
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,410
Then, was my name uttered by the squad leader you summoned?

39
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:13,130
I mean a statement that I told them to cover up any abuse.

40
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,970
The Division Commander didn't know.

41
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:21,520
No report of abuse at the 14th GOP was made to the division commander.

42
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,790
If that is so, didn't you ever receive an order to cover up abuse after the shooting?

43
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,410
I did not receive any instructions.

44
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,130
He stated that although he had received the letters of being abused a few times,

45
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:37,250
he disregarded them at his level.

46
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,200
That could be. That's true.

47
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,800
Did you interview Lieutenant Yang Jong Suk?

48
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,490
What did my adjutant say?

49
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:51,430
Right after the shooting incident, General No Hwa Yeong arrived at the GOP.

50
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,250
There are eyewitness accounts that she had contact with No Tae Nam.

51
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,830
Right before No Tae Nam was admitted to the hospital,

52
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:03,430
there are eyewitness accounts of the general contacting him.

53
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:09,860
At the scene, did the general order No Tae Nam to commit perjury?

54
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,020
There's no such fact.

55
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,950
If you hide the truth, you will be punished for perjury.

56
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,530
My answer is the same.

57
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:29,890
The division commander did not order that.

58
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,580
Adjutant Yang gave the same testimony as the squad leader did.

59
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:39,100
So the only thing you have is what No Tae Nam said in court.

60
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,460
We will formally interrogate him after we complete our investigation of you.

61
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,920
Who will believe his testimony?

62
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,580
Private No is not normal now due to the shock of the incident.

63
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:57,390
To save your own position, do you want to characterize your own son now as out of his mind?

64
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,620
That's a fact.

65
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:08,550
I'm saying this clearly. I am the victim's mother.

66
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:13,490
You're not even considering the pain I've suffered.

67
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,050
Just before I was admitted to the hospital, I received an order from the division commander

68
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,710
to perjure myself about abuse.

69
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:31,410
But the division commander is trying to make that testimony invalid.

70
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,310
What? How can she do that?

71
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,180
I clearly said it in court.

72
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,030
To avoid a charge of perjury

73
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:42,660
she will take advantage of the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder you're experiencing.

74
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,360
I wasn't having any problem when I testified in court.

75
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,370
I don't know how what I'm saying sounds,

76
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:52,120
but the division commander will try to get you a medical discharge from the army.

77
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,410
Then...

78
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,930
you're saying my mother will use my illness?

79
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,030
That is matter for us to deal with in court.

80
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:13,450
Never. I don't think she would ever do it.

81
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,480
Let's stop here and end the interrogation.

82
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,300
Sign.

83
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,630
I have Bolt.

84
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:35,640
We've gotten really close. When you see us together, you'll be jealous.

85
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,840
No Hwa Yeong. If she can avoid her charge,

86
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,300
she can easily cut off her own son.

87
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:21,640
She isn't the least bit fazed at a charge like failure to frustrate her subordinate's crimes,

88
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,520
because she is a person who has forgotten what being a mother means.

89
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,290
On top of that, the squad leader also will assume responsibility for everything.

90
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:33,150
The squad leader, who will accept responsibility by resigning his commission, is her staff.

91
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:36,540
He's also a member of the Patriotic Society.

92
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:41,430
Even if he receives a dishonorable discharge, he is guaranteed employment at IM Defense.

93
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,980
Speaking of that,

94
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:48,480
this time shall we hunt different prey?

95
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,160
Different prey?

96
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,520
We add a bigger additional charge against No Hwa Yeong,

97
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,510
and take her to the Peace Group military court.

98
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:59,840
Yong Mun Gu and Lee Jae Sik should be tried together in civilian court for defense industry corruption.

99
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,960
Is the bigger charge against No Hwa Yeong that you're talking about

100
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,160
the murder of Won Gi Chun?

101
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,340
At the time of the death, there was a lack of sufficient evidence, but you formed a link in the meantime.

102
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,390
Adjutant Yang Jong Suk.

103
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,420
I'm going to probe the new weapon business Yong Mun Gu is starting.

104
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,590
You convince Adjutant Yang.

105
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:27,460
I'm sure she knows something about Won Gi Chun's death.

106
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,020
Yes.

107
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,020
Military Prosecutor Cha Wu In.

108
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,120
What brings you? It's so late.

109
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,160
Isn't my interrogation finished?

110
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,700
Is your strong loyalty to No Hwa Yeong

111
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,630
the professional reason for maintaining command and discipline as a soldier?

112
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,250
Why do you ask?

113
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,690
Last time during Hong Mu Seop's trial,

114
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:42,650
Commander No Hwa Yeong offered me her adjutant's testimony.

115
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:46,750
Saying you were the critical witness who would make us win the trial.

116
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:53,050
Ultimately, your testimony led to the division commander's ouster of the corps commander.

117
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:57,630
You are No Hwa Yeong's closest adjutant,

118
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:02,770
but have you ever thought you know her the least?

119
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,250
Do you really not think so?

120
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,210
She kept her word to me.

121
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:17,490
I don't doubt my superior.

122
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,850
I'll go in now.

123
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,250
Thank you for the trial of Hong Mu Seop, Prosecutor.

124
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,420
Is it compensation for the Kang's Solution case?

125
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,130
What do you mean compensation between the two of us?

126
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:04,050
It's a sign of friendship toward partners.

127
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,230
I saw the news that IM Defense has signed a contract with the Ministry of Defense.

128
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:15,100
Huh? Because of that

129
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,540
my smiles never stop nowadays.

130
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,940
You should have told me in advance, so I could've bought some stocks.

131
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,800
There are a lot of changing variables to it, so I kept it secret this time.

132
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,640
But there's another party who signed the contract.

133
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,110
Kang's Solution.

134
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:37,910
The company that you asked me to search and step on a bit.

135
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,260
CEO Kang Ha Jun.

136
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,140
Ah.

137
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,090
Two of you were smiling widely and even took a photo together.

138
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,900
It happened to be like that. Prosecutor Kang.

139
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,720
This time, I won't ask anything

140
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,570
and just let it slide, Seonbae-nim.

141
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,950
Thank you.

142
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,850
I'll go ahead first.

143
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,570
Thank you.

144
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,120
Prosecutor Kang Hui Yeon?

145
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,440
Who are you?

146
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,050
Wow, you got an expensive wine gift.

147
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,940
What is with you? Who are you?

148
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,890
I'm Do Bae Man. A military prosecutor.

149
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,810
No. Star Military Prosecutor

150
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:40,600
Military Prosecutor? What kind of prosecutor is a military one anyway. What a joke.

151
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:45,320
There are a lot of great senior prosecutors and judges where you work.

152
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,680
You happened to have learned a lot of bad things from the trash, Yong Mun Gu, despite it.

153
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,470
You made a mess of Kang's Solution which only does research.

154
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:59,060
That... that's called a staged investigation, isn't it?

155
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,780
Fuck off before I call someone.

156
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:06,370
So I also want to solicit a staged investigation.

157
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,810
What?

158
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,350
Make a decision.

159
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:14,250
First choice: Become a star prosecutor by catching a big fish with the intel I give you.

160
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,450
Second choice: Hand that intel over to another prosecutor,

161
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:22,690
and be put in a situation where you'll have to explain all of your dirty laundry.

162
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:30,520
Oh, here, you'll also find information about Kang's Solution which you worked on.

163
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,600
So, first choice?

164
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,410
Or the second choice?

165
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,780
What do you think?

166
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:41,560
The table has been fully set. All you have to do is enjoy it, right?

167
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,640
Who's your source for this document?

168
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,030
I knew you would ask that.

169
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,700
I'm certain this was leaked from within the company.

170
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,260
That's right.

171
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,410
This document wouldn't be possible without an inside man.

172
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,330
Who in the world is it?

173
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:59,880
You probably could never guess...

174
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,050
the identity of the informant.

175
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,920
With the dual contract for the new weaponry development, we will use more than half of the budget to buy IM's stocks.

176
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,800
We will also contribute to Lee Jae Sik's political ambition.

177
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,270
As expected, getting military funding is the way to win a war.

178
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:20,190
I like you because you speak the same language as me, CEO Kang.

179
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:23,440
This is why you need to be born with business smarts.

180
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:29,060
Kang's Solution will have to take care of this job well.

181
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,120
Make sure it doesn't go south.

182
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,460
I trust you completely because of the gift you gave me.

183
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,740
You mean the SSD hard drive?

184
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,700
Gifts are the best way to express the heart.

185
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,580
It's been a while, Director.

186
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:56,800
I never imagined I'd see you again here, CEO Kang.

187
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:02,240
You two must know each other from before.

188
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,530
The special stockholder meeting's date has been confirmed.

189
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:10,960
Thanks to the business of developing a new weapon, everything should go according to your plan.

190
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,500
It must.

191
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,100
There's never been such a successful outcome since the founding of this company.

192
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,370
I'm curious about the bill.

193
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,490
It's about my right to be elected as Chairman.

194
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,420
Election right as Chairman?

195
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,280
You're declaring outright war against No Hwa Yeong.

196
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,600
War?

197
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,410
How is it a war when I already started as a winner?

198
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:38,890
Once I'm elected as chairman in the stockholder meeting,

199
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:44,060
IM Defense will be in my total control.

200
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,540
Congratulations, CEO.

201
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:52,400
Kang's Solution's CEO Kang Ha Jun is the informant?

202
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,650
Probably.

203
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:57,950
But CEO Kang is directly involved in this new business though.

204
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:02,990
Everyone has to wear a mask at a certain point in life.

205
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,090
It was me, Kang Ha Jun.

206
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:27,880
All right then. Are you fully in on this then?

207
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,770
Of course. It'll probably be the biggest case of my career.

208
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,850
But

209
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,380
even with extenuating circumstances, you'll have to serve time.

210
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,130
I was aware from the beginning.

211
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,360
I'll see you again then.

212
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,380
Both of you.

213
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,440
You're alive and well.

214
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,870
The date for IM Defense's stockholder meeting has been set.

215
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:11,180
Yes, I already got a text.

216
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,840
To you? Why?

217
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,750
I'm a stockholder there. I have an entire share.

218
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:21,100
I see you bought it in advance to entertain yourself.

219
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:25,340
I almost forgot. I leaked the information about the X-file to Yong Mun Gu as you said.

220
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,070
He's been obsessed with finding the file ever since.

221
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:29,180
- He even stopped by the military hospital.
- Yes.

222
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,580
He probably went to see if No Tae Nam had it.

223
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,460
- I'm going.
- Okay.

224
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:39,110
Oh, you'd better take care of yourself.

225
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:42,500
If something happens because of you, I'll kill you myself.

226
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,170
Okay, I will.

227
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,680
- Is this your way of worrying about me?
- Gosh.

228
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,670
You worry me. We really don't get along.

229
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,150
Just go, bye.

230
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,960
My gosh.

231
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,420
No Hwa Yeong

232
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:09,000
Special stockholder meeting?

233
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,160
You plan to make yourself chairman?

234
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,350
Yes.

235
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:15,560
Come and explain yourself immediately,

236
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,290
for this and for the new weapon business you secretly signed a contract for with Minister Lee and didn't tell me about too.

237
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,270
I have no intention to explain myself.

238
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,750
Only subordinates have to explain themselves.

239
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,280
What did you just say?

240
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,910
I will go and notify you.

241
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:46,090
You think the stockholder meeting would go as planned?

242
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,460
So what if you become chairman?

243
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,790
You would still be just a shell.

244
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:56,880
It's to show you, General No Hwa Yeong.

245
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:58,980
What?

246
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:04,170
The fact that the stockholders chose me, but not you.

247
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:13,460
IM Defense's stocks you illegally bought for 65 executives and staff members.

248
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,390
It's a statement of the stocks you bought with a borrowed name.

249
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,990
Director Choi played a big role.

250
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:25,570
He's been working for me for a long time.

251
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:30,440
The National Tax Service will start investigating now.

252
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,780
You'll have to hurry and pull out those stocks.

253
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,000
Yong Mun Gu.

254
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,540
You should've just chosen either the military or the company.

255
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:53,380
You'll no longer be able to rule IM with a borrowed name.

256
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,940
Instead, IM will be filled with my shares and my people.

257
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:02,600
I'll prove all that to you at the stockholder meeting.

258
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,780
The fact that I am IM Defense's true owner now.

259
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:39,690
Are you done setting up for IM Defense's stockholder meeting tomorrow?

260
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,160
Of course.

261
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,960
Tomorrow will be Yong Mun Gu's best and worst day.

262
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:52,240
I'm sad I can't witness the look on his face when he loses IM Defense right in front of his eyes.

263
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,120
You'll get to see No Hwa Yeong's face though.

264
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,390
I'm sure it'll be quite a sight to watch too.

265
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:01,100
What about Adjutant Yang? Can she be persuaded?

266
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,810
I think No Hwa Yeong is more than just a boss to her.

267
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:08,650
It doesn't look easy, but I'll have to try.

268
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,190
What is this smell?

269
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,380
My gosh, what's this smell?

270
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,230
It stinks!

271
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:34,800
What is this stench?

272
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:42,290
The CEO is coming in!

273
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,890
The first Provisional Shareholders' meeting for 2022

274
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:03,410
Now, we'll start IM Defense's first quarter provisional shareholders' meeting.

275
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:08,580
Today's agenda is about electing me as the chairman.

276
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,750
Wait one second!

277
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:19,840
As a shareholder of IM, I have a question for CEO Yong Mun Gu.

278
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,000
Although, I only have one share!

279
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,650
It's only one share!

280
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:30,700
The person with one share is also our IM's precious shareholder.

281
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,950
Yes, Shareholder. Please ask me a question.

282
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:38,450
The new weaponry project contract that got signed with the Ministry of National Defense

283
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:42,840
brought a big profit to IM,

284
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,740
and I compliment you for that.

285
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,040
Oh, a compliment.

286
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,620
Yes, sure. Thank you, Shareholder.

287
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,860
But!

288
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:58,420
There's a rumor that that contract is a fraud against the public. Is this true?

289
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,750
Is he crazy? What's going on?

290
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,840
That's a false rumor that has no basis.

291
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,400
I heard that there's even a dual contract.

292
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,190
I clearly told you. That's not true.

293
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:18,950
If it gets revealed as a fraud, the company will go down,

294
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:23,040
and my share will go down the drain as well. Then I'll have no choice but to jump into the Han River.

295
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,750
Over.

296
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:29,800
If this gets revealed as a fraud, the company will go down!

297
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:34,460
And my share will go down the drain as well. Then I'll have no choice but to jump into the Han River!

298
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:38,330
Are you not going to convey it properly? I'm really going to take you to the Han River with me.

299
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:41,920
I don't want to go to the Han River! It's too cold.

300
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,320
- Who the heck is that beggar?
- What is this?!

301
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,200
How dare you come in and say such things?

302
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,630
Now, now, Shareholders!

303
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:55,330
I'm sorry for the disruption. Since no one opposes the agenda,

304
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,880
we'll start the voting.

305
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,610
I have an objection! You punk.

306
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,270
I'll fly for a bit.

307
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:11,140
If you are going to ignore the shareholder, why the heck do you open the shareholders' meeting?

308
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,870
Chairman, my foot.

309
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:20,510
Everyone, why don't you vote to kick him out of the company? You losers!

310
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:28,340
Let me go. Don't touch me. I'm angry, and now we can't turn it back!

311
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,960
Okay, then, let's begin the voting.

312
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,690
IM Defense Military Lobby List
New Weaponry Development project Dual Contract
IM Stocks Purchase Status

313
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:38,390
You only have one share. Just get yourself out of here when we offer you the money to go home.

314
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,070
Do you think this is a mom-and-pop shop?

315
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:42,200
How dare you try to con us?

316
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,620
If you touch me!

317
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,430
If you touch me, you all die!

Recording of conversation in Yong Mun Gu's office
Military Supply Dual Contract of the Ministry of National Defense & IM Defense & Kang's Solution

320
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:58,570
With the dual contract for the new weaponry development, we will use more than half of the budget to buy IM's stocks.

321
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:01,400
We will also contribute to Lee Jae Sik's political ambition.

322
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,950
As expected, getting military funding is the way to win a war.

323
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:09,090
(T/N: When there is a "dual contract," one contract is for an inflated amount and one contract has the real amount.)

324
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,400
Players enter!

325
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,410
What? That punk's words were right!

326
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:25,800
Everyone! Every shareholder! Throw your stocks away!

327
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,640
Your shares have become toilet paper!

328
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,150
Now your shares will turn into dust and disappear!

329
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:37,820
- Sell your stocks!
- How dare you give false evidence? Are you crazy?

330
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:45,530
You should also sell it when you have time. You look extra anxious.

331
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:49,060
- Are you also a shareholder?
- Wait, one second.

332
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,960
I put all my money into this company!

333
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,800
Sell
Confirm

334
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,120
Completed Sale of Stocks

335
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,210
Mr. Yong Mun Gu. In violation of the Defense Business Act

336
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:13,610
and the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes, we arrest you without a warrant.

337
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:15,420
Take him to the prosecution office right now.

338
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:27,810
What the heck are you doing right now?

339
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:30,390
You'll know it when you go to the prosecution office.

340
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,410
Hey! Prosecutor Kang!

341
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,930
Have you ever heard "an offer you can't refuse?"

342
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:43,830
- It's a phrase in the movie "Godfather."
- You psycho!

343
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:46,490
I did that...

344
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,180
to Prosecutor Kang Hyeon Hui.

345
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:52,090
Do Bae Man, you punk!

346
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:55,860
I sold it right before I came in here.

347
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,410
I sold it well right before it fell, didn't I?

348
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,010
IM Defense: Notification of Execution of Stock Sale

349
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:02,310
Hey! Do Bae Man, you punk!

350
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,840
Hey! Do Bae Man!

351
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,930
An unprecedented defense industry corruption happened.

352
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:11,670
It was the Ministry of National Defense's business of the year,

353
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,290
and it was discovered to be embezzling the national defense budget

354
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:16,490
by signing a dual contract to convert old weapons into new weapons.

355
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:18,970
Prosecutor Kang Hyeon Hui of the Central District Prosecutor's Office, who is in charge of the investigation,

356
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,910
arrested Lee Jae Sik, the Minister of National Defense, Heo Kang In, a Vice Corps Commander of the 4th Division,

357
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:25,920
and Yong Mun Gu, the CEO of IM Defense, while proceedign with further investigation.

358
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,950
Also, she announced the investigation plan

359
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:32,330
that they would conduct a massive search and seizure on IM Defense and Kang's Solution.

360
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:36,340
Defense Corruption around the new weaponry project of the Ministry of National Defense... Minister Lee Jae Sik arrested.

361
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,850
What brings you to my office suddenly?

362
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:05,000
From the Prosecutor's Office, there was a request for us to cooperate with the investigation

363
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,350
of Vice Corps Commander Heo Kang In regarding the defense corruption investigation.

364
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,700
I'm here to report to you about that.

365
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:15,880
Also, I have a personal report for you as well.

366
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,950
A personal report?

367
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:24,680
Division Commander.

368
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,240
Are you smiling right now?

369
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,920
Or are you crying?

370
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,420
- What?
- The fall of Yong Mun Gu is happy news.

371
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,710
But isn't the company going down bad news for you?

372
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,350
Get out of here right now, Cha Wu In.

373
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:44,020
Before I leave, let me say one more thing.

374
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:47,160
As a military prosecutor, I'll take you to court.

375
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:52,540
All the evil behaviors you did to rise to your position will pull you down.

376
00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:02,170
I know you became a military prosecutor to take revenge for your father, and you are trying to destroy me.

377
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:08,320
But the dead person doesn't care for revenge.

378
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,470
Because vengeance is only for the living.

379
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:22,100
I know that all of my procedures won't be fair.

380
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,620
But the result will be justice.

381
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:29,050
It's because I'll make you pay for what you did.

382
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:34,190
It'll only ruin your life.

383
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,780
We'll see.

384
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:39,280
My life will be completed by establishing justice.

385
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:43,580
Also, that day doesn't seem that far away.

386
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,870
Prosecution Service

387
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:17,270
You went through a lot. I'm glad you came out quickly.

388
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,900
What about Minister Lee Jae Sik?

389
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,480
He was trying to destroy relevant documents right before he got arrested.

390
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,310
- Did he try to destroy the evidence?
- On top of that, he tried to run away.

391
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:28,290
So he got imprisoned.

392
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:31,290
And Vice Corps Commander Heo Kang In got sent to the Military Prosecution.

393
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:34,400
Aigo, they are all so stupid.

394
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,500
Then, what about Kang Ha Jun?

395
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:40,520
I think he's also getting investigated without detention like you, CEO.

396
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,890
CEO, there's something I have to report to you.

397
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,310
What is it?

398
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:31,730
The provisional shareholders' meeting that got dissolved today

399
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:35,530
decided to convene again in three days with a change of agenda.

400
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:39,160
- The agenda of the shareholders' meeting is getting changed?
- Yes, sir.

401
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:43,240
The agenda is about the dismissal of the CEO.

402
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,520
So, it's about kicking me out of this room.

403
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,270
I'm sorry, sir.

404
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:22,960
What on earth is going on, CEO?

405
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,930
Where did the information leak? It's you, isn't it?!

406
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:29,560
I don't have any shares in your company! What could such a person have done?

407
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,720
Then how did Do Bae Man know about this!

408
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:38,620
I know. I wonder how he came in at the moment when the prosecutors were coming in.

409
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,650
Do the prosecutors also have a group chat?

410
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,610
Kang Ha Jun.

411
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,860
Their company also fell down like this.

412
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,600
That weasel of a guy can't do anything.

413
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,630
Right.

414
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:59,030
What you said might be correct, CEO.

415
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:03,620
We have to hear if it's true or not from him directly first.

416
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:08,800
Go get them right now. Do Bae Man and Kang Ha Jun, both of them.

417
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,970
If this was schemed by those two,

418
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:16,010
I'm going to kill both of them.

419
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,280
Division Commander: No Hwa Yeong

420
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,380
Did you look for me?

421
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,720
Adjutant Yang Jong Suk.

422
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,820
Yes, Division Commander.

423
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:43,500
I kept my promise to you last time, didn't I?

424
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,960
Yes.

425
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,490
This time, there's something you have to do for me.

426
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,610
Kill Cha Wu In.

427
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:25,590
Division Commander is waiting for you in quarters.

428
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,660
Have a seat.

429
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:50,690
Don't hint anything that stirs up desire.

430
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:59,660
You commited a sin against me that you can never reverse.

431
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,890
But even so,

432
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:08,730
I will keep the promises that I made to you.

433
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:16,160
First, you'll get discharged due to a medical reason soon.

434
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,980
It means your military time is over.

435
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:24,840
Second, after you get discharged due to a medical reason, have some quiet time for self-reflection.

436
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,750
And you'll become in charge of IM again.

437
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:34,470
I'm giving you back everything you had before coming to the military.

438
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:44,430
Every wrong you did to me this time,

439
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:48,050
you have to pay back to me for the rest of your life by taking the IM's CEO seat.

440
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,880
I understand.

441
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,970
"I get it"?

442
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:56,520
You have to say "thank you," don't you?

443
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:03,940
I'm giving you everything you want. Why don't you look happy?

444
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:11,670
I'm happy. I'm very happy, Mother.

445
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:30,980
To avoid a charge of perjury

446
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:35,100
she will take advantage of the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder you're experiencing.

447
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:40,630
To you, Mother, I'm not a son

448
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,540
but a tool for you.

449
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:16,400
Unity! Congratulations on your promotion.

450
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,640
Aunt. Why do you look so pretty today?

451
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,040
Did you put on nice clothes for me?

452
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,590
But why did you come without calling me? Don't you usually call me before you come here?

453
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:28,220
Why would I call you? I came to surprise you.

454
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,880
Did you make all this for me?

455
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:34,110
Wow, it's so nice to have a home-cooked meal in a while!

456
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:37,850
- Yes, eat as much as you want.
- I will!

457
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,650
Ju Hyeok
Don't come in.

458
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,820
Who's coming?

459
00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:00,850
Bonjour, Auntie!

460
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,400
P-P-Prosecutor Do!

461
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,280
Legal Division Chief!

462
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,520
I just came here to say congrats because our joint investigation went well.

463
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,560
Good work, Sergeant Do!

464
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,730
- You, too.
- Yes, have a good night.

465
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,590
Stop right there.

466
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,660
Chief, come inside, please.

467
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:25,520
Also, that investigation ended a long time ago.

468
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:31,250
And you two. When did you share the passcode for the house?

469
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:34,930
Aigo, it's been a while.

470
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:37,700
- Why don't you just come inside?
- Oh, my. Oh, my!

471
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,260
Bae Man will find out eventually, no matter what.

472
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,890
Why don't we just tell him tonight?

473
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:45,230
This is for you.

474
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:49,080
It's a bit embarrassing.

475
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,720
What's there to be embarrassed about? I'm confident.

476
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,140
Did we commit a crime or something?

477
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,370
As a policewoman and a soldier of this country,

478
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:03,950
it's a bit late, but to contribute to this country's birth rate—

479
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:07,410
B-Birth rate? Oh, my...

480
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,900
As civil servants, we are doing good for the country. Pa...

481
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,530
Oh, you're saying it's patriotic.

482
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:16,310
Yes, patriotic.
(T/N: Both baby [aegi] and patriotic [aeguk] begin with the same syllable.)

483
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,490
Patriotic!

484
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:26,420
It's my bad. I almost made a huge mistake!

485
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,920
No, no. You two enjoy the dinner. I'll get going first.

486
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,470
Unity—! No, it's not that.

487
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:35,500
Uncle, good luck!

488
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,300
- Good luck with the patriotic act.
- Nephew, good luck.

489
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,750
Good luck!

490
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,770
- Why don't you finish eating before you go?
- No, no. Enjoy your time.

491
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:42,510
- Bae Man!
- Have a great time!

492
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,910
Thank you, but excuse me one second.

493
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:48,430
Bae Man! It's not like that. Bae Man!

494
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,820
Birth rate? Should we have three?

495
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,170
Or four?

496
00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:01,060
I just can't get away from soldiers.

497
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:07,370
My father, my brother, you, and now Chief Seo.

498
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:09,850
I think you guys will make a good couple.

499
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:14,750
I have known our Legal Division Chief for a very long time.

500
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:17,450
He's a very soft and tender person.

501
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:20,440
And he likes to tell old stories.

502
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:29,920
I didn't know your ideal man was Chief Seo. I totally didn't have any intuition.

503
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,100
What about you?

504
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,870
Me? What about it?

505
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,980
Prosecutor Cha Wu In.

506
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:40,780
What are you talking about it? There's nothing between Prosecutor Cha and me.

507
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,890
- Ouch!
- I hope you and Prosecutor Cha will be together.

508
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:48,250
You should go back now. Chief Seo is waiting for you.

509
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,220
Don't laugh at me!

510
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,080
I'll go now.

511
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:56,340
Aunt! You look beautiful today.

512
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,790
- I'm really going now!
- Yes, hurry up.

513
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,370
Run!

514

Is this better?

521
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:36,230
Yes, Prosecutor Do.

522
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:40,500
Yes, Prosecutor Cha! What are you doing? Weather's nice today.

523
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,220
Are you still working?

524
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:46,220
I was looking for any more proof in Won Gi Chun's case.

525
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,460
Okay.

526
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:52,020
Yong Mun Gu is released from detention right now,

527
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,440
but he'll get arrested soon with additional charges.

528
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,700
Yes. Since he saw you at the shareholders' meeting,

529
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:01,330
he must be filled with rage right now.

530
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:02,790
Please be careful.

531
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:06,990
Oh? Are you worried about me right now?

532
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:11,760
The night scene behind you is beautiful.

533
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,400
Why don't you show me the street?

534
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,040
Shall I?

535
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,810
Here you go.

536
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,960
Where are you?

537
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,470
It's in front of my aunt's house. Prosecutor Cha, I have big news. I'll tell you tomorrow at work.

538
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:27,660
This is amazing!

539
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,990
Prosecutor Do. Prosecutor Do!

540
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,520
Prosecutor Cha Wu In

541
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:48,620
Aigo, did he die?

542
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:53,260
Hey, hey.

543
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,830
Put him in the car.

544
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:08,480
46 Neo 99**
(T/N: Car plate number)

545
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,620
We've brought Kang Ha Jun.

546
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:24,450
I said be careful.

547
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:27,500
Oh, god.

548
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,130
Are you okay?

549
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:33,470
It hurts bad.

550
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:40,370
Let's cut to the point.

551
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:51,460
Let's skip the part where you two schemed together to screw me over.

552
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:54,960
But just tell me about the Patriotic Society's X-file.

553
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:01,800
Since you told me, so you talk first. Where's the Patriotic Society's X-file?

554
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:08,450
Oh, right. Do Bae Man.

555
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,120
It's with you. You wanted to get revenge on No Hwa Yeong.

556
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,620
You found it, right?

557
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,190
The truth is...

558
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:21,410
Yes, tell me.

559
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:24,510
Hurry up and tell me. Where is it?

560
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:29,650
About that...

561
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:33,000
It was a lure.

562
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:37,500
I leaked it on purpose.

563
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:39,920
What?

564
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:45,220
I did it to see how far you drifted from No Hwa Yeong.

565
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,190
I'm sorry, sir.

566
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,890
Who the hell are you?

567
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,500
What? It's empty.

568
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,870
The f-female soldier?

569
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:35,540
I don't know why you're held together, but I'll leave that for later.

570
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:39,980
But you both best be prepared.

571
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,800
What are you doing, you bastards?

572
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,260

Stop whining. You're such a baby.

613
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:50,210
So, CEO Kang fooled me,

614
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:52,750
and you too, Prosecutor Do.

615
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:54,580
Me?

616
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,140
Explain yourself first, Prosecutor Do.

617
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:59,850
Starting from when.

618
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:04,360
Oh, well, to be exact,

619
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:07,760
it was the day I comforted you.

620
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:12,290
My gut kept telling me...

621
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:15,350
there was no way CEO Kang would betray you.

622
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:17,650
That's why I looked into it.

623
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:27,800
Kang Ha Jun.

624
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,360
It's not you, right?

625
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:41,710
If you can't explain this, then you're really fooling us.

626
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,190
Let's talk somewhere else.

627
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:57,250
Why did you do that?

628
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:59,320
Why? Out of jealousy?

629
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:02,440
Tell me the real reason.

630
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,110
You've got nothing on me.

631
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:07,960
To deceive your enemy, deceive your friend first.

632
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,400
How can you not know such a simple strategy as a soldier?

633
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,900
What?

634
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,670
I don't want to deceive Cha Wu In.

635
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:18,890
Wait, no, stop. You can never tell Wu In.

636
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:20,800
Wu In will do everything to stop me.

637
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,210
Everything I prepared so far will go down the drain then.

638
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,600
What did you prepare?

639
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,830
Wu In has planned her revenge for six years.

640
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:30,580
But I prepared something else by her side.

641
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:32,390
Elaborate.

642
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:35,660
A way to return IM Defense to Wu In.

643
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:40,300
If you tell her now, all my effort will go to waste.

644
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:45,050
You want me to pretend I don't know you're a spy?

645
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:48,560
Until the very end. Please.

646
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:53,710
Gosh, this friendship is deep.

647
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:58,510
This is out of friendship, right? As her friend?

648
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:00,270
So you won't tell her?

649
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:03,290
Fine, it is what it is now.

650
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:06,400
Let's call this a strategic cooperation.

651
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,730
You know yourself we're not close, don't you?

652
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:14,690
I do. I know very well.

653
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:17,630
Am I right or wrong?

654
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,010
What did you show him on your cellphone?

655
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:26,070
Multiple companies offered to take over when Kang's Solution was destroyed.

656
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:29,650
But he made a deal with Yong Mun Gu of all people.

657
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,750
You completely fooled me.

658
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:34,840
I did.

659
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:38,420
Wu In, I'll explain everything.

660
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:42,970
That must hurt.

661
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:46,250
You shouldn't have betrayed her.

662
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:51,920
It hurts.

663
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:58,370
Go in, I want to be alone.

664
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:17,910
Wu In.

665
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:22,300
I prepared a lot of things after I got into IM.

666
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:25,220
I saw to it that you can return to IM.

667
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:31,480
Director Choi has No Hwa Yeong's list of borrowed-name accounts and stocks.

668
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,730
Director Choi's in a bad spot because of Yong Mun Gu too.

669
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:36,440
Kang Ha Jun.

670
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,470
I'm glad you're safe.

671
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:44,660
Also...

672
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:52,310
I'm sorry.

673
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:54,660
What?

674
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:58,810
For not trusting you.

675
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:04,450
Even Prosecutor Do had doubts about his trust in you.

676
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:06,850
But I didn't.

677
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,820
What will you do now?

678
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:45,390
We have to find the Patriotic Society's X-file. If we have that, everything will work out.

679
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:48,710
Gosh, but Do...

680
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:51,380
he already said it was a lure.

681
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:53,690
You expect me to believe that?

682
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:56,300
I won't be fooled twice.

683
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:59,400
What's inside it?

684
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:03,480
Weaknesses of the soldiers of the Patriotic Society and other defense companies.

685
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,040
As long as I have that,

686
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:10,690
I can make a comeback.

687
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:33,970
Hey, Bolt! I missed you so much.

688
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:36,940
Hey.

689
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:38,480
Here.

690
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:41,510
It's your favorite.

691
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:48,030
You didn't have any, right? Eat a lot, Bolt.

692
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,780
No Tae Nam.

693
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:58,050
How's your PTSD?

694
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:03,680
I'm totally fine. Really.

695
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:11,380
As you guys mentioned, my mother is trying to get me medically discharged.

696
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:13,200
How ironic, right?

697
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,790
She tried so hard to get me into the military.

698
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:19,950
Now she's doing everything in her power to get me out.

699
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:34,550
I wrote a letter.

700
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:38,580
For Se Na and you two.

701
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:41,420
Did you write a letter of repentance for Se Na?

702
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:45,460
She probably won't even read it. Why did you write us one too?

703
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:56,060
Bolt resembles you, Prosecutor Do.

704
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:09,060
Thank you for taking care of my Bolt.

705
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:40,070
Also, please continue to take care of him well.

706
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,620
Mother

707
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,730
- Mother, it's me.
- Where are you? Head to the barracks now.

708
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:13,950
No, I'll send you an address. I'll meet you there.

709
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:16,380
You know this place too.

710
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:37,380
I'll take you there.

711
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,950
No, I'll go alone.

712
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:00,450
Han Se Na

713
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:03,700
To the military prosecutors

714
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:09,400
There's a USB inside.

715
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,950
Adjutant Yang Jong Suk

716
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:18,390
Yes, Adjutant Yang?

717
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:22,070
I will cooperate.

718
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:23,920
Good thinking.

719
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,870
Can you come alone?

720
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:28,940
Yes, I'll head over right now.

721
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:33,420
I think Adjutant Yang has made a decision.

722
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:36,180
Hurry over. I'll check the letter and USB.

723
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:37,730
Okay, sir.

724
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:54,250
Forget-me-not Coffee Shop

725
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,800
No Tae Nam!

726
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:11,080
Zero, five, seven, three.

727
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,700
Do Bae Man

728
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:20,790
- Yes, Prosecutor Do?
- The letter No Tae Nam gave us was a will.

729
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:23,210
He's thinking of killing himself.

730
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:26,450
What? We have to stop him.

731
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:29,750
I secured the location of the taxi he took. I'm on my way now.

732
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:33,260
Okay. I'll head over after I meet Adjutant Yang.

733
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:34,920
Okay.

734
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:46,120
Thanks to you and Prosecutor Cha Wu In, I was able to testify.

735
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:50,590
I managed to escape from the fear and restraints of my mother.

736
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:55,300
Out of gratefulness and repentance,

737
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:58,550
I will disclose a secret only I knew.

738
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:07,040
The USB I secured was the Patriotic Society's X-file,

739
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,840
that IM Defense's previous owner, Cha Ho Cheol left behind.

740
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:13,590
I found it in Chairman Cha Ho Cheol's chair,

741
00:59:13,590 --> 00:59:17,960
a month after I took over.

742
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:23,920
Inside the USB, there are multiple files he collected over a long period

743
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,070
to destroy my mother and the other members.

744
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:31,290
I hid this X-file for a long time

745
00:59:31,290 --> 00:59:34,180
in order to protect my mother and IM Defense.

746
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:36,210
The Patriotic Society's X-file

747
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:52,990
But I realized, this file must be seen by everyone to stop my mother now.

748
00:59:56,210 --> 01:00:00,450
Which is why...

749
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:02,660
I decided to give it to you two.

750
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:32,440
What are you doing?

751
01:00:58,870 --> 01:01:01,650
The number you have called is unavailable—

752
01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:08,160
Prosecutor Cha.

753
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:11,980
Adjutant Yang.

754
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:25,020
Tae Nam. What are you planning, right now?

755
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:28,020
Don't come close, Mother.

756
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:36,550
Tae Nam. Put that down now.

757
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:42,820
Don't ever forget today's memories.

758
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:49,810
Always remember that I am your safety pin.

759
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:56,600
Remember what you said before?

760
01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:00,460
- That you would be my safety pin.
- Put it down now.

761
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:03,380
As long as you're wearing that uniform,

762
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:06,990
you will probably never stop.

763
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:15,380
That's why

764
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:24,780
I will be your safety pin, Mother.

765
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:46,690
No Tae Nam.

766
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:54,930
Don't move.

767
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:06,190
Mom.

768
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:12,810
I...

769
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:16,790
I'm sorry

770
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:34,270
for being born your son.

771
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:51,120
Tae Nam, no!

772
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:19,450
♫ I don't know where to start ♫

773
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:23,070
♫ I just wanna find ♫

774

♫ Hidden by the clouds ♫

01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:50,620
♫ Where did it all go wrong ♫

779
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:57,550
♫ I just want to get my life back ♫

780
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:02,440
♫ Oh everywhere, all this violence, ♫

781
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,860
♫ trying to tear my heart out ♫

782
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:12,650
♫ I'll keep it up with no one by my side ♫

♫ The nostaligic memories gradually come to mind ♫
Military Prosecutor Do Bae Man

784
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:42,660
♫ Still I let go of all of feelings ♫

785
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:49,610
♫ I feel I am falling into a deep place ♫

786
01:05:49,610 --> 01:05:53,150
♫ that I can't get out of ♫

01:05:53,150 --> 01:06:02,600
