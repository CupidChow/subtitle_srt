Military Prosecutor Doberman

Six Years Ago

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,930
Operating Room

00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,000
Surgery in Progress

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,080
IM Defense Chairman Cha Ho Cheol,

12
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,040
who was under investigation on charges of leaking military secrets and embezzling,

13
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,120
died in an unexpected traffic accident.

14
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,330
The family members, who were accompanying him, currently are unconscious.

15
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,970
- Oh, Auntie.
- Meanwhile It is expected

16
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,900
What? Of course, I don't skip meals.

17
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,070
that due to his death, the case will be closed.

18
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,900
Episode 5 
Due to the death of Chairman Cha, there is no right to prosecute.

19
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,650
We have decided to file a nolle prosequi, a notice that the prosecutor has decided to abandon the case.

20
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,530
It's extremely unfortunate news
 Ministry of Justice

21
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,360
that due to the change of Chairman Cha Ho Cheol's fate, the truth cannot be uncovered,

22
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,110
and we must close the investigation.

23
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,020
We hope the deceased will rest in peace.

24
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,210
We do so with sincerity.

25
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,890
IM Defense, which went into court receivership after IM's Chairman Cha Ho Cheol's death,

26
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,380
was acquired one month after the death.

27
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,840
The due diligence for the acquisition of IM Defense was completed in two weeks.

28
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,040
Chairman Cha Ho Cheol

29
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,520
I have the opportunity to sit here thanks to you, Prosecutor Yong.

30
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,800
This is what you've wished for.

31
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:25,890
I'm also going to take a break.

32
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:31,470
I should give a suitable reward because you played a big part, shouldn't I?

33
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,700
I'm considering opening a law firm through an IM investment.

34
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,620
The head of the law firm specializing in military affairs

35
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,070
will be you.

36
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,400
Thank you, General.

37
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,290
Tae Nam will be the owner of IM until he enlists.

38
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,590
Do you mean until he joins the army?

39
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,910
Until then, please watch over Tae Nam.

40
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,220
Yes, please don't worry.

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,200
Actually, the next problem is when Tae Nam enlists,

42
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,870
who will sit in this chair?

43
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,790
I can't sit here while I am wearing an army uniform.

44
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,770
So we need someone who can control IM for me.

45
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,870
How about it?

46
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,190
Can I trust Prosecutor Yong?

47
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,190
No one can be above me except you, General.

48
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,560
I will do my best.

49
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,850
Doctor! Doctor!

50
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:17,110
Present Time

51
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:22,380
You are a disgrace to the Republic of Korea army, you filthy bastard.

52
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,430
Please don't speak carelessly.

53
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,410
This bastard—

54
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,020
The moment I leave this place, I become a civilian.

55
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,040
I will no longer be your subordinate.

56
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,450
Military Prosecutor Do Bae Man. You can't get discharged.

57
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:13,830
You'll have to stay and fight with me.

58
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,180
That's your fate, Prosecutor Do.

59
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:23,400
I'm waiting for you, Prosecutor Do,

60
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,800
to wake from oblivion.

61
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,590
Yong Mun Gu

62
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,640
Chairman No Tae Nam safely joined the army.

63
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,700
The only thing left is Tae Nam's trial.

64
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,840
You need not worry about the trial.

65
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,490
Are you specifically telling me not to interfere personally?

66
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,850
Of course not.

67
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,970
If that's what you think. Fine.

68
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,520
But about that military prosecutor.

69
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,390
You mean Do Bae Man?

70
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:09,440
He bothers me a lot. I don't know what it is exactly, but I feel apprehensive.

71
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,940
He was a hunting dog that I released into the military to make things easier.

72
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,820
After he tasted a little money, his greed has no limit.

73
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,310
Flexing his military experience, he will receive a few law firm offers.

74
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,500
But that's as far as he will go.

75
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,890
He will crawl back into his original gutter.

76
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,850
That's his destiny.

77
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,260
Did you successfully report your discharge to the division commander?

78
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:55,580
What happened to my parents was not just a simple traffic accident.

79
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,400
Someone engineered the incident.

80
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,990
Was that what you meant when you said I forgot something?

81
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,400
I've been waiting for a long time

82
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,360
for that question.

83
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,560
Did all of your memories return?

84
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,800
Even who the culprit is?

85
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,360
She has a cut-off index finger and is a female soldier.

86
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,180
That person is No Hwa Yeong.

87
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,390
♫ I don't know where to start ♫

88
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,850
If, as you say, the female soldier is No Hwa Yeong

89
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:37,130
and she engineered the accident to murder my parents,

90
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,100
why did she save me?

91
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,190
It's an alibi.

92
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:46,760
Because the good faith shown in rescuing the child is proof she didn't intend to kill.

93
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,790
My father died and I was the only one to survive.

94
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:55,640
I regained consciousness after a week.

95
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,850
Dad.

96
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,210
Surviving was a blessing from the gods,

97
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,850
but it was a cruel miracle.

98
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,720
After I learned they killed my dad in the guise of an accident,

99
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,710
there was no time to mourn.

100
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:15,590
♫ When this light gets dark ♫

101
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,460
It took three years for my body to recover.

102
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,150
♫ Follow the light at the end of the tunnel ♫

103
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,860
To become a military prosecutor in the 4th Division

104
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,650
where No Hwa Yeong was serving, it took two years.

105
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,770
♫ Of this dark ♫

106
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,950
For Do Bae Man who is among them knowing nothing

107
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,540
but who shares the same fate as me,

108
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,660
to appear in front of me,

109
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:44,750
it took one more year.

110
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,430
I've been waiting up to this moment for six years.

111
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,350
I need Military Prosecutor Do Bae Man.

112
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,280
I'm positive you also need me.

113
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:16,820
Cha Wu In. Throughout your life, how helpful has it been to tell the truth?

114
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:21,520
- What?
- It seems you think that everything you say and think is true.

115
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,230
It's been so long ago I don't think I remember my parents' faces.

116
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,980
- Prosecutor Do.
- For you who have been planning revenge for six years,

117
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,640
it's as vivid as yesterday.

118
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,570
I don't intend to be shackled to a past I'm not sure of.

119
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,360
Prosecutor Do Bae Man

120
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,040
Oh, yes?

121
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,380
Is something bothering you?

122
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,660
Not at all. Please continue with what you were saying.

123
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,670
Your experience as a military prosecutor was truly impressive.

124
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,650
In the emperor service case, you accomplished what outside prosecutors could not do.

125
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,310
Not only that,

126
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,740
I heard that you're the only prosecutor in the military

127
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,650
with a success rate over 90%.

128
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:55,860
Wow. I guess all you need now is to increase your success rating to 100% at our law firm.

129
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,510
Let's have you start as an equity partner.
(Shares in the profit of the law firm rather than just a salary.)

130
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:01,130
How do you feel about a partner's share of someone with 25 years of experience?

131
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:04,060
It's unprecedented in this industry, isn't it?

132
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:08,550
Of course. This is the most our firm has ever offered to anyone.

133
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:13,420
Why don't you spread your wings and live out a rosy future

134
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,160
with us, Prosecutor Do Bae Man?

135
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,710
A future...

136
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,640
I'll accept.

137
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,110
Looking forward to it.

138
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,590
Have you heard anything from Do Bae Man?

139
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,950
After the shooting range?

140
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,360
No.

141
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,980
I told you. Did you think he'd stand with us if you told him about his parents' accident from 20 years ago?

142
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,530
Do Bae Man values money over revenge, and his future over his past.

143
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,650
He hasn't made a decision yet,

144
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,920
since his memory hasn't been recovered completely.

145
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,070
As for now...

146
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,810
For now?

147
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,420
He's confused.

148
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:10,120
Dong Bae Man has been working for Yong Mun Gu. In the end, it was for No Hwa Yeong.

149
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,590
How can he handle that he's been living for the people who killed your parents?

150
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:19,140
Give up on Do Bae Man. Leave him out of our plan.

151
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:24,040
No. Nothing about my initial plan changes.

152
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,040
I'll make it so he has no choice.

153
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,190
No choice?

154
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,320
Minister.

155
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,500
I have yet to hear from the President. That's the future.

156
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,780
Congratulations in advance.

157
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,390
How strange.

158
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:46,720
When I heard I was selected, I wasn't impressed.

159
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,220
Now that I'm hearing your congratulation, I realize it.

160
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,530
In the midst of all this, are you taking an early morning run with the enlisted men?

161
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,230
We are running right now.

162
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:01,080
Since you have become division commander, why don't you pass the responsibility to someone else now?

163
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,080
You should think about the subordinates following you.

164
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,990
Let's discuss this in detail while sharing a celebratory drink later.

165
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,690
Yes. Let's do that.

166
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,760
Hyeoncheong City has plans to support development so that the project can proceed smoothly

167
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,280
through the cooperation of relevant departments.

168
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,460
If the project proceeds as planned,

169
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:35,800
it is expected that Hyeongcheong City will subsidize the construction of a 172 m high hotel.

170
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,260
Next news.

171
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,560
The National Assembly's National Defense Committee passed the progress report

172
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,240
concerning the confirmation hearing on the nomination of Lee Jae Sik as Minister of Defense.

173
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,490
Allegations of collusion with IM Defense, which were expected to be controversial,

174
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,910
did not result in any indictment and are predicted to be dropped soon.

175
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:52,870
4th Division

176
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,830
Club Cartel Rape Incident

177
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:17,050
I was so frustrated when No Tae Nam ran to the military as soon as he got caught.

178
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:20,790
I'm so grateful I can pass my baton to you.

179
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:25,260
No Tae Nam stepped into poop trying to avoid some trash.

180
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,550
In regards to Allen, the accomplice.

181
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:33,020
I think I learned about No Tae Nam's enlistment after watching the news.

182
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,040
You mean No Tae Nam and Allen have been split up?

183
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,780
Yes.

184
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,400
Allen, that bastard, keeps claiming he was abducted by some red-haired woman

185
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:47,040
and demands we catch whoever that is. He won't stop talking about it.

186
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,580
Where's Bae Man's desk?

187
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,740
Over there. Would you like to see?

188
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,220
We also feel strange looking at his empty desk.

189
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,520
- If I may.
- As much as you wish.

190
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,970
- I'll organize the files.
- Yes.

191
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:09,510
I'll keep it to myself that you were the one to report the video file in case it becomes disadvantageous to you.

192
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,920
Thank you, Detective Do.

193
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:16,200
Wow.

194
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:22,010
I didn't know he was in the same legal office as you until he was discharged.

195
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:24,120
The world is small, huh?

196
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,400
Sure is.

197
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,490
Recognized because of his military experience, he's joined a law firm as a partner.

198
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:35,170
I'm happy Bae Man's difficulty is over, but he doesn't seem to feel the same way.

199
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:37,980
He's been acting troubled.

200
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,370
Even if I ask him, he says he's fine.

201
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:46,760
Today's his first day at the law firm.

202
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,190
I am Office Manager Park Da Yeong and starting today, I will be assisting you.

203
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,230
I look forward to working with you.

204
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,970
Whoa.

205
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,280
Golden Law Firm
Do Bae Man

206
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,270
This is a gift from the CEO.

207
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:34,780
He says your facial reading revealed you were lacking in fortune.

208
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,810
Lacking fortune?

209
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:43,010
Let's do well from now on, Toad.

210
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:45,620
This is a gift to maintain dignity.

211
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,500
Maintain dignity? Yes, that's important.

212
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,010
tren: be

213
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,230
Yes.

214
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:07,140
Prosecutor Do. Your first client is waiting.

215
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,310
Already? That was fast.

216
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,110
Report to work for the first time, I haven't even started work yet.

217
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:16,030
- I'll escort them in.
- Sure.

218
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:30,710
- This person is Kang's Solution—
- CEO Kang Ha Jun.

219
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,280
I see you know him.

220
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,950
Then...

221
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:46,410
I've never officially introduced myself before. I'm Kang Ha Jun.

222
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:53,030
You should leave. I have no interest in being involved with your business.

223
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,420
Is that why you escaped here as soon as you were discharged?

224
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:03,090
If you aren't here as a client of the law firm, I have nothing to discuss with you.

225
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,610
Leave.

226
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,360
Twenty years ago, No Hwa Yeong was an officer of the transportation battalion.

227
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,900
That day, it was not scheduled but she decided to drive a truck herself—

228
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,700
I told you to leave. Can't you hear me?

229
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,900
She got into an accident.

230
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,950
After that, in order to be consistent, she manipulated the operation log, but someone caught her.

231
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,410
No Hwa Yeong claimed the accident was caused by faulty engineering of the truck's parts.

232
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,980
However, that was also false.

233
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,650
The skid marks from the scene are evidence of the fact

234
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:44,690
that No Hwa Yeong did not hit the brakes until immediately before the collision.

235
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:49,620
There was a lot of evidence, but the military discarded all of it.

236
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:55,080
The corrupt military prosecutors, Mr. Do Bae Man,

237
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,820
just like you did.

238
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,130
Why should I believe what you say?

239
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:11,690
Chief Yeom Sang Jin who discovered all of the fabrication was the chief investigator.

240
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,980
Confirm it with him.

241
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:22,310
An unresolved history will always reappear in the present life.

242
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,670
I came to say this to you.

243
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:29,100
Lawyer Do Bae Man.

244
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:52,340
An unresolved history will always reappear in the present life.

245
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,200
I came to say this to you.

246
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,640
Once he's ready to accept the truth, he'll come to find you.

247
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,000
That will be the beginning.

248
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,280
I must hear the answer.

249
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,230
What is it that I cannot remember?

250
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,120
Let's walk a bit.

251
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,410
It's a really stuffy place.

252
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:54,470
It's not surprising that everybody is just waiting to get out of here.

253
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:58,270
They will be discharged today.

254
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,360
Why are you involved in this?

255
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,050
Because it was all my fault.

256
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:12,010
It's my fault the truth behind your parent's case wasn't revealed.

257
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:16,590
Please answer me honestly.

258
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:23,160
Is it true that No Hwa Yeong intentionally caused the collision?

259
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,260
Bae Man, the answer to your question...

260
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:33,820
is something you told me yourself 20 years ago.

261
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:41,230
Twenty years earlier

262
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,730
Hyeongnim!

263
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,380
Military Police

264
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,340
Bae Man.

265
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:07,370
Look at me.

266
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:12,750
I am an officer who works with your parents.

267
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,470
It's alright. You're safe.

268
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:22,000
Bae Man. This was an accident.

269
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,830
An accident nobody wanted to happen.

270
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,910
So...

271
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,560
It's not?

272
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,600
Not what?

273
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:46,550
She was smiling.

274
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,300
That officer woman.

275
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:00,650
No Hwa Yeong

276
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:09,000
The reason I haven't been able to leave this base, the start of everything

277
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,580
was actually you.

278
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:16,340
What you said, the lone survivor of that accident.

279
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,920
My Auntie

280
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:58,570
- Yes?
- Where are you?

281
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,400
Perhaps a company dinner to celebrate your first day?

282
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,160
- Yes, Auntie.
- Wow.

283
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:09,010
I bought you a nice suit from the department store today.

284
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:12,250
Just imagining you wearing a sleek suit at court

285
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,100
as a lawyer yourself...

286
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,000
Brings me so much joy!

287
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,510
Be sure to call a driver on your way home.

288
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,390
Shyster Do.

289
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:43,300
I heard you were discharged. Congratulations.

290
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:47,360
Leave. I'm not in the mood to talk with you.

291
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,200
Bastard.

292
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,020
We've got a strong bond. I can't just leave.

293
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,060
Don't you think we should finish our conversation?

294
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:00,100
We were interrupted by that scary officer woman.

295
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,940
Get lost, you're making me lose my appetite.

296
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,520
Really?

297
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:11,300
Then, shall we discuss something interesting?

298
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:21,000
What's your relationship with No Tae Nam?

299
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:27,930
You were at Cartel, too, the day No Tae Nam was arrested.

300
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:31,760
Is No Tae Nam sponsoring you?

301
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:38,140
So you will wag your tail for him?

302
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,450
You stupid ass.

303
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,090
Get up!

304
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:21,920
Is it too cruel of me to admit your painful past is what I need?

305
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,760
That's not something that can be bought with money.

306
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:38,150
♫ I don't know where to start ♫

307
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:41,510
That chance, I'll definitely grab it.

308
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:46,840
♫ Where to go and how to make it right ♫

309
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,130
I'll do my best.

310
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:56,630
I will succeed, no matter what, at making sure you are exempt from your military service.

311
00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:00,750
I'm just deeply saddened that I won't be serving you.

312
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:09,890
♫ Where did it all go wrong ♫

313
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:15,580
♫ I just want to get my life back ♫

314
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:20,820
♫ Oh everywhere, all this violence, ♫

315
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:24,660
♫ trying to tear my heart out ♫

316
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:31,170
♫ I'll keep it up with no one by my side ♫

317
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:41,170
♫ When this light gets dark ♫

318
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:44,810

00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:59,040
♫ Oh I will try ♫

322
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,960
♫ Light up the surrounding darkness ♫

323
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,090
♫ Turning around I ♫

324
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:10,040
♫ When this light gets dark ♫

325
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,450
♫ I'll ignite ♫

326
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:17,200
♫ Follow the light at the end of the tunnel ♫

327
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,310

338
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,140
What's happening at your son's trial?

339
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,410
Lawyer Yong Mun Gu is in charge.

340
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:51,090
Well, the trial is being held in your home base. What is there to worry about?

341
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:54,710
If it were like old times, we could call up all the military judges and prosecutors

342
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,910
and make them plank on their heads here.

343
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:03,830
Did you say that lawyer took IM's CEO position?

344
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,970
Yes.

345
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:11,630
Leaving the trial to him would definitely be fine, but leaving the company to him might be a bit...

346
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:14,240
It's only a formality.

347
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,040
Here.

348
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,520
The past used to be so good.

349
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,350
Saying you didn't like a country ruled by the military,

350
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:27,460
you've taken all the power and ultimately ended like this.

351
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,780
Don't you think so, Hwa Yeong?

352
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,580
What you say is correct.

353
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:39,180
But if we are going to reform the army, society must eventually change.

354
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,680
And to change society, you must get into politics.

355
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:45,800
I think that's why you entered politics.

356
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:53,870
That's right. You read me like a book.

357
00:30:53,870 --> 00:31:00,650
You're the only person I've kept by my side for so long.

358
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:09,890
It would've been nice if you were a man.

359
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:11,820
Don't you think?

360
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,810
Your food will turn cold. Please eat.

361
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,720
Drink! Bottoms up.

362
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:37,740
Focus. Hey, hey. Focus!

363
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:41,050
I have an important gift for our dear friend.

364
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:44,110
What is it?

365
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:48,580
Damn bastard. Is your gift this lousy perfume?

366
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:52,510
Tae Nam, have you heard of GHB? 
(T/N: GHB: Gamma Hydroxybutyrate "Date Rape Drug")

367
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:56,710
GHB

368
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:04,210
One drop of this, and game over. Get rid of all the unnecessary steps in the middle.

369
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:07,660
I guess people who care about steps and processes are boring.

370
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,590
We need to cut to the chase—

371
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:13,110
They get drunk, black out, and then bam!

372
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,360
Like propofol?
(T/N: Propofol: a sedative)

373
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,990
There's a girl named Se Na in my fan club.

374
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:22,290
I'll bring her here tomorrow.

375
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,260
Hey.

376
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:31,710
Hey. Turn off your phone, it's loud.

377
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,110
Your ringtone is annoying me, dammit!

378
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:45,550
Hey. Who are you?

379
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:47,970
Trainee 13!

380
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,720
Come to your senses.

381
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,300
Get up. Get up!

382
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:02,530
Are you camping? You here for fun? Get your ass up right now!

383
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:52,520
No Tae Nam

384
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:03,000
Trainee 13. Pick up your precious rations and put them back on your tray. Now.

385
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:07,320
Carry it out and repeat.

386
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:11,690
What do you want from me? You also were dragged like me.

387
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:14,160
Who are you to boss me around?

388
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:19,010
Everyone except for Trainee 13, plank position immediately.

389
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:24,590
Hurry up!

390
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:30,440
On 1, "As colleagues." On 2, "We are one." One!

391
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,720
As colleagues.

392
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,840
- Two!
- We are one!

393
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,910
- Repeat.
- As colleagues, we are one!

394
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:41,650
Trainee 13, who spit out his food, has done nothing wrong.

395
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:44,880
It's all your fault for meeting someone who bitches about food.

396
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:50,150
- Understood?
- Yes, we understand it. As colleagues,

397
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:53,900
As colleagues, we are one! If you go alone, you may be faster,

398
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:57,660
but together, we can go further. Understood?

399
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,290
Yes sir!

400
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:03,930
As colleagues, we are one!

401
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:06,170
As colleagues,

402
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,020
Number 8, hold your gun properly.

403
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,980
Trainee # 13.

404
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,850
Begin.

405
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:18,170
Leg.

406
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:20,090
Two.

407
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,700
Walk in place.

408
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,340
Go.

409
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:35,300
Hurry up! Faster!

410
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,740
What are you doing?

411
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:57,160
Hey! What are you doing?

412
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:06,480
As instructed, we've been making him participate in basic training. But should we continue...

413
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,190
Do it according to the Field Manual without any exceptions.

414
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:11,590
Treat him like the other trainees.

415
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:13,790
I understand, General.

416
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:18,110
If anything is out of the ordinary, report immediately.

417
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,850
Yes, Ma'am.

418
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:23,260
Today is the first day of the hearing, in an ordinary military court,

419
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,450
for a sexual assault trial for an incident at Cartel Club.

420
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:29,920
At the request of the lawyer for defendant No Tae Nam, the trial will be held behind closed doors.

421
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,580
No Hwa Yeong, mother of the defendant

422
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:38,480
No Tae Nam's mother, Division Commander No Hwa Yeong will be attending the trial.

423
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,390
4th Infantry Division

424
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,270
Do you have anything to say to your son before the trial?

425
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:11,350
Make a comment.

426
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,510
It's my first time going to court without Prosecutor Do.

427
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,470
It feels so empty.

428
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:23,130
But when Prosecutor Do was discharged, didn't you say you were next?

429
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:26,990
Yes, exactly. But things have gone a bit awry.

430
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:30,650
It's the will of some god who wants me to keep my uniform on.

431
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:32,410
How nice.

432
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:35,420
I couldn't sleep because I was worried

433
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,680
both of you would be leaving at the same time.

434
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:43,350
Aren't you grateful I'm here? Then let's act like it. Sure.

435
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:46,170
Oh, Prosecutor.

436
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,440
You head in first. I'll be there shortly.

437
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,170
Sure.

438
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,410
Military prosecutor Cha Wu In.

439
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:11,510
I know Prosecutor Do Bae Man. It's a shame he's no longer here.

440
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:15,720
Do you mean to say, had Prosecutor Do been here, things could go as you wished?

441
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,070
Not at all.

442
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:21,240
On the contrary, Prosecutor Do was difficult to work with.

443
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:26,780
Let's play fair today. Someone's life is in the hands of this trial.

444
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,210
I'm on the same page.

445
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:31,370
I'll see you in court.

446
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:38,180
I'll brief you on your allotment of the accepted cases.

447
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:41,320
The first case is a case of assault on a pregnant woman by an Air Force commissioned officer.

448
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,610
The military investigation office filed the charge.

449
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:47,150
A pregnant woman whom he had never met suffered a miscarriage due to an assault,

450
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:50,420
and the perpetrator of this case is the youngest son of Jinso Construction??

451
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:53,310
You'll receive an incentive if our client is found innocent.

452
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:56,430
The second case concerns the son of an assemblyman who took drugs

453
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,490
while he was on leave of absence from duty. The case—

454
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:01,010
Okay. That's all.

455
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,100
Excuse me?

456
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:05,620
Let's end it here. I don't need to hear more.

457
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,390
Where are you going?

458
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:10,810
We have a meeting with the equity partners in 10 minutes.

459
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:12,840
I'm going to the military.

460
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,330
What?

461
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:19,510
I guess they were spot on about my lacking fortune.

462
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:23,430
Earn lots of money and die rich, you toad.

463
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:35,760
Lawyer Do, where are you going?

464
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:39,380
Everyone, stand.

465
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,180
The division commander is coming.

466
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,140
We are all present, take your seats.

467
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,520
Since everyone in the prosecution has arrived...

468
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:54,540
They filled the court with soldiers after declaring this is a closed trial.

469
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:57,110
This is how military cases proceed.

470
00:40:57,110 --> 00:41:00,960
Indeed, she is the division commander, No Hwa Yeong.

471
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,620
October 30, 2021, in Gangnam

472
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:07,000
Interesting.

473
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,430
What do you mean?

474
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:12,160
The fact that we're both here as military prosecutors.

475
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:17,710
I came to the military for money, and you came for revenge.

476
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:20,980
We're both military personnel who are here for the wrong reasons.

477
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,580
Then why did you return?

478
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:29,490
No Hwa Yeong is the culprit of my parent's accident.

479
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,720
As you said.

480
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,400
I am going to weed out everyone

481
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,410
who had the slightest involvement with my parent's case

482
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,590
Defendant | Defense Attorney

483
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:44,890
or who stands in my way.

484
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,430
Witness

485
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:56,750
First Trial Hearing

486
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,350
Ms. Han Se Na,

487
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:02,490
please recount the events of the incident.

488
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:09,460
I followed Allen into a club called Cartel

489
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,190
and was led into a private room.

490
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:16,300
I had only agreed to meet for a cup of coffee.

491
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:20,630
Other than Allen, who was present that day?

492
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:31,120
The man sitting over there, No Tae Nam, and a large dog.

493
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:35,050
He kept offering me drinks, but I declined.

494
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:37,940
I was uncomfortable.

495
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,930
Just one drink, Se Na.

496
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:41,190
Just one.

497
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:47,860
But I felt I was ruining the mood, so I took one shot.

498
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:52,260
Did you lose your consciousness after taking that shot?

499
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:57,030
Yes. I only had one drink, but my body felt weird.

500
00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:00,660
Your Honor, I'd like to submit as evidence test results that show

501
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:05,750
GHB, a date rape drug, also known as "mulbbong" was detected in Han Se Na's urine.

502
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:10,070
5. Test Results The urine sample was positive for GHB.

503
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,470
Because I fought back, No Tae Nam hit me.

504
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:16,000
Hey. Don't you know that he has a concert in a few days?

505
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,900
He broke a liquor bottle.

506
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,910
And you call yourself an Allen fan, you crazy b*tch?!

507
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:23,130
He...

508
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:26,610
You felt your life was at risk, and felt you could no longer fight back,

509
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:30,500
yet you could not even attempt to run away due to the drugs influencing your body.

510
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,620
Yes.

511
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,940
At the place where the gunshots of the law sound and recede,

512
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:37,450
the only thing they can have freely is their feelings.

513
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:41,430
But in front of No Hwa Yeong, no one can dare show them.

514
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:46,290
Because these are the spectators who have been mobilized for the No Tae Nam show.

515
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,770
It is a merciless military trial

516
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:52,730
without the shield of anonymity which is basic for victims of sexual assault.

517
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:02,810
There was a broken liquor bottle found at the scene of the incident.

518
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:06,150
The fingerprints of Allen and No Tae Nam were detected on the glass.

519
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:07,580
No Tae Nam Fingerprints
 Allen fingerprints

520
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,290
The medical certificate of treatment for 8 weeks after sexual assault

521
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:12,850
and an illegally filmed video file of the sexual assault

522
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:15,430
are submitted for admission into evidence, Your Honors.

523
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,320
Judges Panel

524
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,680
Defendant | Defense Attorney

525
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,820
Prosecutor

526
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:25,950
You weren't even nervous and did a great job. You passed on my evaluation.

527
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:28,930
But this trial is going to be tough.

528
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,460
Why?

529
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,310
You will know when you see it.

530
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:37,770
Would you like to cross-examine, defense counsel?

531
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:39,790
Yes, Your Honor.

532
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:45,380
Witness

533
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:50,890
First, I'm very sorry about the terrible things which happened to you.

534
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,040
I am sincere.

535
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:13,900
How did you become acquainted with the singer Allen?

536
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:22,310
While participating in fan club activities, I became close to him.

537
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:28,150
I see that meeting, outside, the singer you always admired meant your relationship had deepened.

538
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:33,390
Hey, from your perspective, it must have been like a dream.

539
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:36,850
The attorney right now is implying that Han Se Na and Allen had a close relationship

540
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:39,720
and there was a sexual assault within a consensual relationship.

541
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,030
Don't carelessly draw a conclusion.

542
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,980
I'm not doing that at all.

543
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,410
I feel the same as Prosecutor Cha Wu In.

544
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:53,090
In other words, I believe that Han Se Na was sexually assaulted.

545
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:58,170
Is that enough?

546
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:03,590
Then there is no dispute whether it was consensual or by force in this trial, is it?

547
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:04,860
That's correct, Your Honor.

548
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:07,870
Defense counsel, please continue.

549
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:10,860
According to the evidence submitted by the prosecutor,

550
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:14,260
Han Se Na consumed a date rape drug.

551
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:16,990
If you consume the drug with alcohol, you will have a headache,

552
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:21,500
poor vision, and severe memory loss.

553
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,890
Let me repeat.

554
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:27,800
It causes serious problems in vision and memory.

555
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:31,610
Let me ask.

556
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:35,890
Was Defendant No Tae Nam the person who broke the bottle and threatened you?

557
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:39,110
Correct.

558
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:42,590
Allen's fingerprint, in addition to Defendant No Tae Nam's, was detected on the glass.

559
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:45,290
A person who is high on a drug is in a condition

560
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:48,730
where she could neither recognize people properly nor remember.

561
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:51,710
Witness, are you certain?

562
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:54,200
Objection, Your Honor.

563
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,700
I think that is an important point. Defense counsel, continue.

564
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,280
The drug you took caused a memory problem.

565
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,460
It means that your memory is pure speculation.

566
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:06,720
It's not fact but just a guess!

567
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:26,890
Han Se Na's statement cannot be guaranteed to be both credible and consistent.

568
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:29,250
No further questions, Your Honor.

569
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:34,870
The examination of defense witnesses will commence tomorrow at the same time.

570
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,750
Who put the drug into the drink?

571
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:04,850
Allen, the way it was supposed to be.

572
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:07,420
I see.

573
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:10,330
The most important thing at a trial is consistency.

574
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:12,790
If a lie is consistent, it becomes the truth.

575
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:16,940
Even if you speak the truth but only in an instant make a mistake, it becomes a lie.

576
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:22,090
Is my lawyer, Yong Mun Gu, the person who makes that so?

577
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:26,060
But then, I saw Do Bae Man. What happened?

578
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:28,180
He was discharged.

579
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,870
See me for a second.

580
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,560
You returned?

581
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,730
Yes, well, as you can see.

582
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:47,610
I see you made a big decision without my knowledge. What's your reason?

583
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:49,620
You'll find out, bit by bit.

584
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:52,840
There is a guy who catches my attention for exactly one day.

585
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,540
Someone who can succeed for 364 days

586
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:58,850
can be thrown out in just one day.

587
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:02,090
Well, human feelings can be very erratic.

588
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:05,270
I'm sorry.

589
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:11,970
Well, the rapport we established

590
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:14,800
is not going to crumble in just a day.

591
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,630
Now that you're back in uniform, we should continue our contract.

592
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:26,520
An extension of the contract is up to you.

593
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,280
I'll follow your lead.

594
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:32,340
You've returned after breathing the air outside. You're more self-disciplined.

595
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:35,250
I like it.

596
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:40,140
The critical hit at the trial is going to be that, isn't it?

597
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:42,990
Yes. I'll put Allen on the witness stand.

598
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:47,420
Not Allen. Chairman No Tae Nam's humiliating disability.

599
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:55,060
I knew it. My inference was right.

600
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:57,000
Did you also know?

601
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,630
H-How did you know?

602
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:04,640
I'm asking how you knew.

603
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:08,060
As I was going through Chairman No Tae Nam's conscription avoidance project, I came to know

604
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:13,250
and realized that this trial won't be a lost one when I learned of it.

605
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:15,640
Do Bae Man.

606
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:20,000
As I expected, you truly are someone who shouldn't be met as a foe.

607
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:35,640
- Sheesh.
- Prosecutor Do!

608
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,780
You were going to come back so fast. Why did you leave us like a cold-hearted ex-lover?

609
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:43,530
The day you were packing, how much I... you know?

610
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:45,580
Cried.

611
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:48,440
Did you, Yun Sang Gi?

612
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:51,080
Why is it so unfamiliar here?

613
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,970
Did you like being out that much?

614
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:56,220
- You're truly back, right Prosecutor Do?
- Yeah

615
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:59,820
Then, the two... Prosecutor Cha!

616
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:02,670
Then are the four of us truly pegging ourselves into the army?!

617
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:05,650
Then, I'll be off.

618
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,700
I really can't grasp who she is.

619
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:17,300
Section Chief Ahn, your excitement was a bit too early.

620
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:20,420
What are you saying.

621
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:28,340
The military court has been in the palm of my hand for the past five years.

622
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:32,000
But it seemed like a completely different court today.

623
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,970
You said before I'd know if I saw it. What did you mean by that?

624
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:39,620
No Tae Nam. Don't stake your life on this trial.

625
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:41,160
What do you mean?

626
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:45,740
Don't work too hard. You're set to lose anyway, Prosecutor Cha.

627
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:58,750
Please don't attend tomorrow's hearing.

628
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:00,570
Why? Aren't you confident?

629
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:03,970
I've never even imagined losing a trial.

630
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:08,570
I'm the one assigned to protect Chairman No Tae Nam.

631
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:12,190
There must be a special reason

632
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:15,580
I shouldn't be present at court.

633
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:21,120
At times, there are things sons would not like even their mothers to know.

634
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:24,590
Things he doesn't want me to know.

635
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:28,010
I request Allen as a witness.

636
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:29,970
Witness

637
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:32,930
Trial Hearing Day 2

638
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,540
Is Mother late?

639
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:45,370
She won't be coming today.

640
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:48,750
Why did you say? Is she not coming to her son's trial?

641
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:50,920
Call her quickly. Right now!!

642
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,910
I told her not to come.

643
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:56,530
Why, Why? A decision will be made today.

644
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:59,970
She should be glaring with a laser beam at the court and that shyster until the trial is over.

645
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:04,320
Defendant, please be silent. Attorney, you may start your questioning.

646
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:16,780
You have a trial scheduled for the near future, correct?

647
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:22,180
The facts of today's trial will influence your own trial.

648
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:23,590
Yes.

649
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:30,480
The police collected this broken liquor bottle as evidence from Cartel.

650
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,750
Based on the claims of the military prosecutor, this is the weapon

651
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:37,380
No Tae Nam used to threaten Han Se Na.

652
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:40,750
Let me ask you.

653
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:45,900
Did No Tae Nam threaten Han Se Na with that broken bottle?

654
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:55,310
You take the blame for this case.

655
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:57,730
What did you say? Are you crazy?

656
00:53:57,730 --> 00:54:00,170
Why would I do that? No Tae Nam is just as guilty!

657
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:02,420
Let's be honest with each other.

658
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:04,630
Frankly speaking,

659
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:08,540
you're the only one who enjoyed it.

660
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:13,110
I'm someone who knows No Tae Nam

661
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:15,800
better than No Tae Nam himself.

662
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:19,210
If you refuse my offer,

663
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:24,340
you'll waste your fleeting youth in trial after trial.

664
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:28,470
This is nothing compared to everything you've done before.

665
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:32,330
Are you threatening me now?

666
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:34,330
Yes, I am.

667
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,980
For No Tae Nam's sake, I can do anything.

668
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,690
The liquor bottle...

669
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,440
I broke it.

670
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:45,670
Objection.

671
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:49,390
The witness is giving a testimony that completely contradicts his statement given to the police.

672
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:53,980
The civilian court will decide whether it is true.

673
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:56,730
Defense counsel, please continue.

674
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:03,480
You just stated that you broke the liquor bottle yourself.

675
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:06,740
Was it for the purpose of threatening Han Se Na?

676
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,970
I did make a threat,

677
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:22,290
but it wasn't directed towards Han Se Na.

678
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,770
I threatened No Tae Nam to film.

679
00:55:29,770 --> 00:55:32,740
They intentionally made the military member take the blame.

680
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:34,680
He planned this all with the victim.

681
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:38,310
- That person is in the wrong.
- It's not him.

682
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:41,480
- Judge!
- The prosecution is issued a warning.

683
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,530
Please stop interrupting the trial.

684
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:47,640
Defendant, you may continue.

685
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,680
So you're saying No Tae Nam filmed this entire scene because of your threat?

686
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,780
Yes.

687
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:59,220
I see... The admission you just made will be used against you in your own trial.

688
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,290
Will that be alright?

689
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:06,910
Yes. It's the truth.

690
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:10,020
It's surely been a set game.

691
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:14,190
That bastard!

692
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:18,690
Defendant No Tae Nam merely recorded the events of the scene under coercion.

693
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:23,720
This also provides evidence that No Tae Nam is not responsible for the alleged sexual assault.

694
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,550
It's an overreaching claim, Judge.

695
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:29,730
Defense attorney, do you have evidence to support your current claims?

696
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:31,640
Of course.

697
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,000
I'll submit the defendant's medical records as evidence.

698
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:41,750
Medical Records for No Tae Nam

699
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:44,160
Male erectile disorder.

700
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,800
It's male erectile dysfunction.

701
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:53,830
It's a sexual disorder that results in an inability to create an erection.

702
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:58,890
It is impossible for No Tae Nam to have intercourse with Han Se Na.

703
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:06,600
It's fine. It's common.

704
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,160
Wow! He's so blatantly innocent.

705
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:16,210
In short, Defendant No couldn't have sexual intercourse with the victim

706
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:19,140
and was forced to film the incident instead.

707
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:26,650
What are you...

708
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:31,340
Defendant, is your lawyer speaking the truth?

709
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:35,170
Do you have an erectile disorder?

710
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:37,420
You dare to ask me such a question?

711
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:39,660
Is this a joke? Is it funny?

712
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:42,160
Defendant, please take your seat.

713
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:46,450
Did you ask me to come here so you could reveal I'm a loser who can't touch women

714
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:50,460
and embarrass me in front of these military pricks?

715
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:52,770
Defendant, take your seat! This is a warning.

716
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:55,530
Shut up, you damned military judge!

717
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:57,980
- Escort him out immediately.
- Let me go!

718
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:18,430
IM Defense CEO No Tae Nam found not guilty

719
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:31,830
From this incident, you've earned many things.

720
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:34,510
Mr. No Tae Nam has finally been installed in military duty,

721
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:38,130
and you're receiving lots of public attention.

722
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:42,410
However, I'm unsure what I will earn from this trial.

723
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:46,060
You must be asking about the Director position at IM

724
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:49,720
I had promised before.

725
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,440
You fail to keep your intentions hidden.

726
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,890
I've no change of heart.

727
00:58:56,890 --> 00:59:01,100
My promise is that I'll be loyal to you only.

728
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:08,820
They say many reporters are waiting in front of the military grounds. Should we avoid them?

729
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:11,950
No need. We can stop near the entrance.

730
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:13,760
Yes, I understand.

731
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:31,190
You can't make clear judgments about your opponent when your revenge is emotionally charged.

732
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,880
You thought No Tae Nam would most definitely have been the culprit for sexual assault.

733
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:39,810
Are you consoling or mocking me right now?

734
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:43,430
You missed obvious evidence.

735
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:44,930
Did you come here to tell me—

736
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:49,530
I didn't come back just to put No Tae Nam on jail.

737
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:54,000
Cha Wu In, listen carefully.

738
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,140
I'm going to be your faithful hunting dog from now on.

739
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:00,640
A doberman who, once it bites, won't let go until

740
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:05,430
the victim's flesh or its own teeth are ripped away.

741
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:13,900
If you keep messing around or getting in my way before then,

742
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:16,040
I'll get rid of you first.

743
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:25,310
No Hwa Yeong will be judged by none other than myself.

744
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:29,970
It's what I've been hoping for, Prosecutor Do Bae Man.

745
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:01,260
No Hwa Yeong

746
01:01:08,650 --> 01:01:10,330
Yes ma'am.

747
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:14,130
Tae Nam has deserted.

748
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:26,140
Military Prosecutor Doberman

749
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:29,900
♫ Feels like I'm losing control ♫

750
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:31,840
♫ My style without hesitation  ♫

751
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,740
♫  You can't stop me ♫

752
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:37,560
♫ No chance, you can't get away now ♫

753
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,230
♫ You can't find your way out.  ♫

754
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:41,680
♫ You are the prey in my hand ♫

755
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:45,970
You've lured me into a multi-layer spider web, Cha Wu In.

756
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:47,820
Use Do Bae Man.

757
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:49,450
In the middle of the night, the recruit training unit turned upside down.

758
01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:51,980
Do Bae Man? He's got other intentions.

759
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:54,630
Are we signing a new contract, with this?

760
01:01:54,630 --> 01:01:56,690
CEO No must not leave. Not at all!

761
01:01:56,690 --> 01:02:00,360
I'll return everything where they should be, so people don't know he ever escaped.

762
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:03,400
Trainee 13. One, two.

763
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:06,980
There's only one way to catch a spider.

764
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:08,990
Ripping it out with its web.

765
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:12,800
♫ You've gotta pay for the over the top stuff you said ♫

766
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:17,280
♫ I'm not struggling hard any more ♫
