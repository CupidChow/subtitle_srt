Military Prosecutor Doberman

8
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,600
One Year Ago

9
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,780
The prosecutor knows better than anyone

10
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,890
that evidence illegally obtained has no legal effect.

11
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,890
Well, that is...

12
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,910
It is true that the victim knowingly made an illegal recording.

13
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,800
It was an act of self-defense to prove the abusive use of power by his boss.

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,080
Illegal is illegal. But is a military prosecutor

15
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,460
covering up the illegal act of a victim?

16
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,640
Cover up?

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,260
Are you impugning the reputation of a military prosecutor now?

18
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,790
I ask that the attorney's comments be stricken from the record.

19
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,770
Calm down, Prosecutor.

20
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,690
We acknowledge that illegally obtained recordings

21
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,350
are not admissible as evidence.

22
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,550
Prosecutor, proceed with your examination.

23
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,120
I know that Colonel Lee Do Ryeong who is sitting in the Defendant's chair,

24
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,240
is very uncomfortable.

25
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,450
However, the recording illegally obtained by our victim Sergeant Oh

26
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,630
has been ruled inadmissible evidence.

27
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:39,300
Do you remember anything which happened at approximately 6 p.m., on September 26?

28
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,710
I don't.

29
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,750
All right.

30
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:52,340
They are in sync, those two.

31
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,900
The only evidence that can prove the abuse of power is the recording.

32
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,590
The military prosecutor is emphasizing its illegality with his own mouth.

33
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,370
He is intentionally trying to lose the case. Do Bae Man.

34
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,880
For Do Bae Man, there is a higher class above the court of law,

35
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,790
and even higher above class there is money.

36
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,000
When that money hungry guy learns the truth

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,550
about his parents' accident twenty years ago,

38
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,700
will he choose revenge over money?

39
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:28,120
Do Bae Man right now knows nothing and is in Yong Mun Gu's clique.

40
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,840
I want at a minimum to remove him from that clique.

41
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,710
You have too much pity.

42
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,090
You may be right.

43
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,810
Wu In. A person's past soon becomes his future.

44
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:46,930
The day will surely come when Do Bae Man will cling desperately to his own image as he is now.

45
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,150
It's going to be difficult for you too.

46
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,180
What will you do then?

47
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,240
IM Defense Industry

48
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,230
The prior CEOs from Cha Ho Cheol to No Tae Nam

49
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:09,500
drove the image of IM to the ground.

50
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,220
I'm going to clear away all the shadows of the past now.

51
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,450
Then...

52
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,920
Yong Mun Gu

53
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,060
knew it all.

54
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,690
That I am the daughter of CEO Cha Ho Cheol.

55
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,160
Are you sure?

56
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,370
I expected he would find out someday,

57
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,980
but it is sooner than I planned.

58
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,370
If he knows, then that means No Hwa Yeong knows.

59
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,180
They will find out about me soon.

60
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,340
Time is running out.

61
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,170
I checked on the division commander's exit record at the guardhouse and for her residence.

62
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,820
At the approximate time of Won Gi Chun's death,

63
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,930
General No Hwa Yeong did not leave her residence.

64
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,350
All right. Good work.

65
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,610
From Won Gi Chun's fingerprints on the handgun, the gunshot wounds from a close range shot,

66
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,360
the gunpower marks on his hands, to No Hwa Yeong's alibi,

67
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,740
his death is a perfect suicide. On paper.

68
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:35,560
Twenty years ago, No Hwa Yeong escaped in exactly the same way.

69
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,260
Now the only person left in the landmine hero case is the military doctor Cho Su Chan.

70
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,860
Yong Mun Gu must have hidden him somewhere.

71
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,390
If he went looking for the military doctor on his own without notifying No Hwa Yeong,

72
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,260
he was getting insurance like Won Gi Chun.

73
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,110
I guess so.

74
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,700
Let's go here first.
 Parking Ticket: Yeon Hwa Parking Garage: Jan.10th 2021: Plate Number-65M 0673

75
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,630
Yes. Let's go.

76
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,570
Episode 10
Hong Mu Seop, commander of the 4th Corps Army, has been appointed Army Chief of Staff,

77
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:15,870
to replace Kim Se Jun, who will retire next month.

78
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:20,620
According to a Defense Ministry official, he is selected as Army Chief of Staff because

79
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,460
he has excellent leadership on operations and expertise in the military,

80
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,910
and leads the defense reform and the preparation of transition to the wartime operational control.

81
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:30,180
He also has high competence and an impeccable character.

82
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,850
You will be next.

83
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,650
You will be the first female army chief of staff since the founding of the republic.

84
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,950
Do you think Corps Commander Hong Mu Seop would just watch that happening?

85
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,110
- Pardon?
- It's said that if Hong Mu Seop passed through,

86
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,730
there would not be a single piece of grass left on his route.

87
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,230
Before anything could sprout, it was trampled.

88
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,750
What about Do Bae Man and Cha Wu In?

89
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,250
Whether it is a transfer or something else, you could have done something to them.

90
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,210
Why did you just leave them alone?

91
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:06,250
I told you not to pay any attention to my army division.

92
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,500
It's because I always must be ready.

93
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,920
Anyone who holds a grudge or hostility towards me

94
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,550
has to be locked up under my watch.

95
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:24,200
If they get out of the division, they could be more troublesome.

96
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,200
- Oh.
- But recently

97
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,200
I feel that your interest in me is different

98
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,100
from what it used to be.

99
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,340
No way.

100
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,320
If there is anything needed, I will keep a closer eye for you.

101
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,630
I'm glad that the Lt. Colonel Won Gi Chun case is wrapped up.

102
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,850
He is someone who protected me for a long time.

103
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,140
I don't feel good about it.

104
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,100
You would never have intended to end it with just his one leg

105
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,630
from the moment you amputated Won Gi Cheol's leg.

106
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,370
I'll take care of military doctor Cho Su Chan.

107
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:11,750
Because he shouldn't say anything useless related to the leg.

108
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,250
Then.

109
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:38,240
How are you going to compensate for your lousy work?

110
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,770
This Seol Ak...

111
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,930
Let me go.

112
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,550
Set the price and I'll pay it.

113
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,960
As you see, right in front of you.

114
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,270
After I couldn't prevent the press conference, things happened in this way.

115
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,070
But give me another chance.

116
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:17,010
Whether I bury the military doctor in the ground or throw him into the ocean, I will surely take care of him.

117
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,340
Just leave him.

118
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,770
will it be okay to not kill him?

119
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:26,920
Are you intending to leave him in hiding and when a chance comes, then bring him out and use him?

120
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,530
Don't try to read my thoughts.

121
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:41,340
Oops. I crossed the line again.

122
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,790
By feeding him fried dumplings, I'll let

123
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,720
him be safely locked up.

124
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,590
Oh, when will I open all the cars?

125
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,000
Car number 0673.

126
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,860
0673. You do there. I'll do here.

127
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,420
Okay.

128
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,700
0673

129
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,610
0673

130
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,450
Did you find it?

131
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,300
I haven't either.

132
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,740
I'm out of touch.

133
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:59,810
- Oh?
- Where are you going? Pros Cha!

134
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,410
0673

135
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,390
0673

136
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,880
Please contact us in case of absence
Long-term Parking Lot Facility Management Division
010 -1787-0673

137
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,930
This is the secret storage hidden by Won Gi Chun.

138
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:39,490
There's a lot. Let's get started.

139
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:48,690
From what I see, this can clear the allegation that my father leaked military secrets.

140
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,690
See! I told you that Won Gi Chun would have insurance.

141
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:56,200
They are the documents he prepared against a charge of perjury.

142
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,390
That's my gut feeling. It is very accurate.

143
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,590
- You have a lot to learn.
- Yeah, yeah.

144
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:07,220
- It's astonishing.
- Yes.

145
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,050
You're here?

146
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,700
Is this everything? Anything else?

147
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:20,470
Not counting all the irrelevant stuff, I've got a list of things to check out immediately.

148
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:24,220
CEO Kang, please restore this.

149
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:35,870
Hey, this is... I think this is an army notebook that Won Gi Chun personally kept.

150
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,840
This is a different facet of Won Gi Chun.

151
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,250
He kept a minutely detailed journal.

152
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:53,450
I think it would be better to meet with Manager Yeom to check it.

153
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,330
Good idea.

154
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,140
Excuse me, CEO.

155
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,900
Yes. Is something going on?

156
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,440
Wu In, I need to go out for a while.

157
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,820
Oh. Is it an urgent matter?

158
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,840
No. Nothing serious.

159
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,700
I'll restore this right away.

160
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,810
- Please do it quickly.
- Good luck.

161
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:20,920
Kang's Solution

162
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,930
- Give it to me.
- I'm okay.

163
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:30,500
I am so relieved. There is something to remove the false accusation against Chairman Cha.

164
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:36,170
I've removed just one of the arrows in my father's back.

165
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:39,090
I still don't have anything to confront No Hwa Yeong.

166
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:44,750
But even though CEO Kang is so busy with work, he always comes running when you call him.

167
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,050
How can he be so devoted to you?

168
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:51,080
He's not even family. Friend...

169
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,060
He's your friend, right?

170
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:57,360
When he was having difficulties, my father helped him a lot.

171
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,230
I already told you that.

172
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,330
Is that really all there is?

173
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:06,570
CEO Kang is a very important facilitator for our plan.

174
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,680
From now on, please don't doubt him.

175
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,150
That's not it. That...

176
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:15,450
She doesn't have any gut instinct. None at all.

177
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,190
Wait for me.

178
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,670
The stock price suddenly dropped. What the heck is going on?

179
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:24,850
The finance director said it started plummeting today so much that VI was triggered.
(T/N: VI, To mitigate a sudden surge in a stock price, it requires sales to be at a fixed price from two to ten minutes.)

180
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,040
What did you say?

181
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:31,040
There seems to be a false rumor circulating that our company leaked industrial technology related to military mobility.

182
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,720
A technology leak? That's ridiculous.

183
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,410
There were rumors that the Financial Supervisory Service was trying to figure out the truth.

184
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,670
I think that added fuel to the fire.

185
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,600
What should we do?

186
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,720
Immediately send out a press release stating that the rumor was groundless.

187
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,280
Find out who spread the false rumor and respond to them, immediately.

188
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,690
Yes, sir.

189
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,710
Korea Army

190
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:02,230
Do Bae Man, who was only chasing money,

191
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:05,080
changed completely after he met Cha Wu In.

192
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,390
I'm sure it's related to something.

193
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,700
Do Bae Man told me this.

194
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:14,150
I am only guilty of following your orders for which I had no choice.

195
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,660
Find out about Do Bae Man. In detail.

196
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,530
Unity

197
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,640
Yes, Prosecutor Cha. I just arrived.

198
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,190
Come into the law department office. Yes.

199
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:51,290
I think the computer is down again. All the data is gone.

200
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:55,930
Did you erase it again, like last time? How many times has it been already?

201
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,940
Get out, get out.

202
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,220
There. Watch. Click two times.

203
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,410
Type for three seconds. Yes.

204
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:08,600
Wow, daebak! Really amazing.

205
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,160
You're such an incorrigible computer illiterate.

206
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,060
Hey, the metabus era is approaching now.

207
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,750
Unity.

208
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,320
What have you come for?

209
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,420
I have an appointment with Cha Wu In and Do Bae Man.

210
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,450
You're here.

211
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:29,830
Yeom Sang Jin is the manager in the 58th Division Office of Legal Affairs.

212
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,840
What are you doing? You should greet him.

213
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,990
Unity.

214
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:37,030
Oh. Sergeant Ahn Yu Ra?

215
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,240
Have you been working here?

216
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,420
- Do you know Section Chief Ahn?
- Of course.

217
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,760
Wasn't she in the Hacking Unit of headquarters cyber command?

218
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,000
What? Did you say Hacking Unit?

219
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,300
This is totally not it.

220
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,220
She is the computer illiterate of the 4th Division who doesn't even know how to use a recovery program.

221
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,870
That can't be true.

222
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:58,260
I heard the Yongsan Electronics Market Daughter

223
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,650
- learned hacking first before she learned Hangul to a degree—
- Chief.

224
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:04,020
Don't move. Don't say anything.

225
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:09,280
Section Chief Ahn, didn't you say your parents live in Yongsan?

226
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,320
I didn't.

227
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,480
Right, at the moment when you say you are good at something in the military—

228
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,910
That's the time when you have to do that all by yourself.

229
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,540
Like me right now. This doesn't feel good.

230
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,910
Oh, I leaked such a huge secret.

231
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,340
Yes, sir.

232
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:29,380
On that note, I'll go for duty outside. Unity!

233
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,000
Please don't go. Let's talk for a bit. Wait!

234
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,390
Section Chief Ahn!

235
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:38,280
- You said you are Yongsan's daughter.
- What's going on?!

236
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,690
- Why are you guys so loud?
- Unity.

237
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:46,420
- Huh?
- Section Chief Ahn, wait.

238
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,850
Law Office

239
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:59,300
This is a military note that Won Gi Chun wrote.

240
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:03,420
- How did you get this?
- I found it from Won Gi Chun's secret storage.

241
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,970
I didn't know this kind of thing would exist.

242
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,600
It's written in detail.

243
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,790
The recording started exactly twenty years ago.

244
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,790
That's the year when your parents got in the accident.

245
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,170
Yes, sir.

246
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:22,680
Since then, Won Gi Chun wrote No Hwa Yeong's daily life in detail.

247
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,760
And the person she met particularly often was Corps Commander Hong Mu Seop.

248
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,930
No Hwa Yeong, an Officer of the Supply Transport Battalion, and Hong Mu Seop, a member of the Judge Advocate General Corps

249
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,970
had no official business relationship.

250
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:36,760
Also, until then, No Hwa Yeong wasn't part of the Patriotic Society.

251
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:42,020
So, Won Gi Chun also thought that was strange and made this record.

252
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,550
He looked like the most loyal subject,

253
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,480
but he wrote everything about his boss.

254
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,990
So the next target is...

255
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,210
Hong Mu Seop

256
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:56,030
The Corps Commander Hong Mu Seop.

257
00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:01,180
He's the current three-star General and Disciplinary Commissioner who gave us disciplinary action.

258
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:06,280
He graduated from the military academy at the top of the class. During his service, he passed the bar exam and transferred to the Judge Advocate General's Corps.

259
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,870
He's been Chief Judge of the High Military Court in the Defense Ministry and Chief of the High Prosecutor's Office.

260
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,010
After serving in the major military law positions,

261
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,960
he returned to the infantry and became corps commander.

262
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,120
He's the most elite soldier in the history of the military.

263
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,320
Hong Mu Seop

264
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,100
Legal Division Chief is coming to the Law Office!
Yun Sang Gi

265
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,150
Legal Division Chief is coming.

266
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,080
Unity!

267
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:37,260
- Who are you?
- Unity!

268
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:41,350
I'm Military Investigator Yeom Sang Jin from the 58th Division Law Office.

269
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:48,570
58th Division? Why has another division's person come to our office?

270
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,890
The thing is...

271
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,900
We invited Investigator Yeom to come here for advice.

272
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,230
Advice?

273
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:59,060
He's not a senior military prosecutor. What advice do you need from an Investigator?

274
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:02,930
Also, I heard it from the outside.

275
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:08,780
It seemed like you were talking about Corps Commander Hong Mu Seop.

276
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,140
I'm sure about it. I heard it correctly!

277
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,900
You were talking about the corps commander. Am I wrong?

278
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:20,760
I saw the news today, and I heard that corps commander is internally decided to be the next chief of staff.

279
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,180
So I was wondering if I should visit his house beforehand.

280
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,290
But I'm not quite sure about corps commander's favorites.

281
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,270
What does he like?

282
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:31,520
That's right. I worked for him a long time ago.

283
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,420
Prosecutor Do, are you going to see him directly?

284
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,860
Will corp commander see you in the first place?

285
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,240
He removed our disciplinary action this time.

286
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,470
So I wanted to show my gratitude to him as well.

287
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,140
Prosecutor Do, you have such a great sense!

288
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,130
You are better than me.

289
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:58,420
Why don't you go and say some good things about me?

290
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,600
Also, you shouldn't go with him, Captain Cha Wu In.

291
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,090
Don't ever go with him.

292
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:12,460
Of course not. Why would I take her with me? It'll make big trouble.

293
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,120
Yes, it'll be big trouble.

294
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,370
Then, why don't you go back to work?

295
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,240
- Yes, Unity!
- Yes.

296
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,620
- Have a good time.
- Thank you, sir.

297
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,280
- Unity!
- Okay.

298
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,890
Hong Mu Seop

299
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,370
If Hong Mu Seop is related to your parents' accident,

300
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:45,610
I think their relationship might be relevant to the case.

301
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:51,980
Yeom Sang Jin

302
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,570
Come in here, you punk!

303
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,520
Stand up straight, you bastard!

304
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,840
I said, stand up straight, you punk!

305
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,940
You bastard! Not enough evidence!

306
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:08,160
No charge! Non-prosecution!

307
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,630
You punk!

308
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,820
Hey, you!

309
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,790
How dare you disregard the military prosecutor's opinion?

310
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:20,520
You punk!

311
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,860
How dare you?

312
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:34,510
Hong Mu Seop

313
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,050
Get some medicine for yourself on the way back.

314
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:05,030
And get some snacks for your son.

315
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:12,760
JAGC ID: Do Seong Hwan

316
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:21,680
When someone disregarded what he said, a completely different personality came out, like bipolar disorder.

317
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,450
It was hard to tell which side was the real Hong Mu Seop.

318
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:29,090
Do you know what the case was that Hong Mu Seop tried to cover?

319
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:33,120
There were so many cases in the law office, so I'm not sure about it either.

320
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,240
- If you'd had any clues or suspicions, you would've known.
- I think so.

321
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,210
If you can look into this notebook,

322
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,890
don't you think there might be something that we couldn't find?

323
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:50,130
I'll read it carefully, meet the people involved, and figure it out for you.

324
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:53,100
Please do so, Chief.

325
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,500
Prosecutor Do, why don't you meet Hong Mu Seop in person?

326
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:02,090
I will definitely reveal what happened to my dad.

327
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:06,720
Then I have to know what kinds of two faces Hong Mu Seop has.

328
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,620
It won't be easy. He's too much of a perfectionist.

329
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,480
Perfectionist.

330
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,440
When you unmask a perfectionist,

331
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,600
it will reveal the darkest and foulest person.

332
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,390
That's my experience from the past five years.

333
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,970
Unity. Unity.

334
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,690
I'm Captain Do Bae Man. You identified me, right?

335
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:30,710
Do Bae Man

336
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,780
Cellphones are banned at the corps commander's quarters.

337
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,710
So are you now asking for a military prosecutor's phone?

338
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,660
Everything connected to the corps commander is classified.

339
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,110
Please give me your cooperation, Captain Do Bae Man.

340
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,800
Wow, classified.

341
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,230
What a scary place. Fine then.

342
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,950
I'll be inspecting you.

343
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,770
Restricted Area

344
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,500
Let's go in.

345
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,560
I sincerely thank you for your reduction of our punishment, Corps Commander.

346
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,930
You made an appointment and came all the way just to say that?

347
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:30,240
Gosh, when else will I have a chance to meet you like this, Corps Commander?

348
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,410
As a military prosecutor, all that matters is that you do your job.

349
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,680
Keep doing your best.

350
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,930
Yes, I understand.

351
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:42,490
Oh, I heard that you were a military prosecutor too.

352
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:45,910
It's already been twenty years, right?

353
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:52,070
He never changed, so I had no idea so much time has passed.

354
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,750
It's not much, but here.

355
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:05,050
I will be loyally devoted to you in the future, Corps Commander.

356
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:12,020
He's just like you from 20 years ago, Oppa.

357
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:16,800
He's well-mannered and knows how to serve his superior.

358
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,180
My gosh.

359
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,260
It's just wine.

360
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:49,530
Hong Mu Seop is thorough with maintaining himself and his surroundings,

361
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:52,360
but there's one strange thing.

362
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,620
The official residence soldier changes often.

363
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,470
The official residence soldier?

364
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,150
I can smell it already. The stench of abuse of power.

365
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,340
He must've been working in the official residence for a long time.

366
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,230
How long has it been?

367
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,940
Staff Sergeant Sin Min Cheol. I've been serving the Corps Commander for six months.

368
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,680
He's so nice and great at his job too.

369
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:21,040
My son is struggling in the frontline too.

370
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:25,370
I try to care for him as a mom would.

371
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:28,600
Corps Commander's nephew is on the frontline?

372
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,160
My gosh.

373
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,340
You've taken up many cases that would upset the division commander.

374
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,130
How's your relationship with Division Commander No?

375
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:40,930
Well as a soldier, my loyalty to her has never wavered.

376
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:47,420
But I also work with conviction as a military prosecutor.

377
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:52,020
Are you saying you volunteered to play the villain instead of the division commander?

378
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:56,270
Gosh, I'm too embarrassed to say that myself, sir.

379
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,610
Drink your tea.

380
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,200
Yes, ma'am.

381
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:16,050
Staff Sergeant Sin Min Cheol was at Hong Mun Seop's residence?

382
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,970
Do you know him?

383
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:23,210
She said she treats him like a son. Seeing her exaggerate things makes me even more certain.

384
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,330
Staff Sergeant Sin's face also.

385
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:27,960
I'll have to try meeting him outside of the residence first.

386
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,640
I'll meet Staff Sergeant Sin myself.

387
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,080
No, it's fine. I need to meet him myself.

388
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,100
He's been holding it in even when he was mistreated all this time.

389
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:40,960
This kind of person needs someone who's skilled in persuasion.

390
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:45,220
He's probably not going to cooperate with you.

391
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,560
What are you saying?

392
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:51,650
I'll make sure he cooperates. I got Byeong Pan Yi to testify only a few months ago.

393
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:53,410
That's why I won the trial.

394
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:58,370
That's why I'm saying you can't. It's your method.

395
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,420
You've been acting strange since earlier.

396
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:06,410
You look like you're bottling something you really want to say.

397
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,700
What is it that you want to say?

398
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,980
Gosh, don't worry. I worked on many trials regarding abuse of power.

399
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:18,430
Have you ever stood on the side of a victim of power abuse?

400
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:23,800
- What?
- I'm asking if you ever took a trial regardless of the rank.

401
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:30,020
Why would you bring up my past now? Won Gi Chun's case was half a success.

402
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:33,830
I'm going to put Hong Mu Seop on trial this time.

403
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:36,110
At least for the sake of my father.

404
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,290
Sanitary napkin

405
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,820
Sanitary napkin

406
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,570
Do you have pomegranates?

407
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,300
Pomegranates?

408
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:07,050
We don't have that here. Buy it on the internet.

409
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:09,370
I have to see it for myself and buy something with no flaws.

410
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:12,900
Gosh, you must be a newlywed.

411
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,680
Is your pregnant wife craving it?

412
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,070
I really need to buy it.

413
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:20,940
Why are you looking for pomegranates? I doubt you'll find any around here.

414
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,190
Why are you here?

415
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,680
I came to buy this. Do you want one?

416
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,410
I'll get going if you have no business with me.

417
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:33,930
Hold on. Shall we get a cup of tea if you have time?

418
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,670
I have a café I always go to.

419
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,550
I have to go straight back to the official residence.

420
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:41,360
I can drive you around to look for a grocery store that sells pomegranates too.

421
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,550
One with not a single bruise.

422
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,310
I will ask Madam.

423
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,690
Ssanghwa tea is their signature menu here.

424
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,990
So you go grocery shopping too?

425
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,390
What do you want?

426
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:11,030
The flawless pomegranate. Was that mission given by the corps commander's sister?

427
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,090
I'll get going.

428
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:14,850
Hey, hold on.

429
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:17,390
What are you doing?

430
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:21,000
Impressive. It's a smart watch.

431
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,300
I guess you get special treatment? Seeing that you can wear that.

432
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,050
Let me go.

433
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:28,640
I'm investigating Corps Commander Hong Mu Seop's abuse of power.

434
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:34,720
Answer my question. You're being used like a servant, aren't you?

435
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:42,650
Not answering is an answer too. You're admitting to it.

436
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:53,010
They summon you all the time and get you to do their petty errands.

437
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:56,600
You've been physically and emotionally abused too.

438
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:07,000
Did you become a full-time soldier to work as the corps commander's family's housekeeper?

439
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,700
Then let me ask you one question too.

440
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:25,870
Okay. Good thinking. Ask me anything.

441
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:29,300
I'll make sure to destroy the corps commander who bullied you.

442
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,080
You can open up everything to me.

443
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:37,300
Do you not remember me?

444
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,750
You?

445
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:48,420
We met before?

446
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:52,270
I knew you didn't remember.

447
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,690
I guess memories last differently for everyone.

448
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:03,510
I will answer your question clearly, Captain Do.

449
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:08,700
I have not once, not even for a moment...

450
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:13,310
been a victim of abuse of power at the corps commander's residence.

451
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:33,770
I'm sorry I couldn't help, Captain Do Bae Man.

452
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:36,040
Hey, Staff Sergeant Sin.

453
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,890
Staff Sergeant Sin!

454
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:55,480
What? He was never a victim?

455
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,930
What does he mean he knows me?

456
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:01,050
Staff Sergeant Sin is acting like that because he's afraid of Hong Mu Seop—

457
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:03,620
It's not because of Hong Mu Seop.

458
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,330
Then what?

459
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:07,310
It's because of you, Military Prosecutor Do Bae Man.

460
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:11,080
M-Me? You're saying it's because of me?

461
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,530
That's why you told me not to meet him?

462
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:19,500
Prosecutor Cha. What do you know that made you say that?

463
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:26,360
Do you remember the trial you did one year ago?

464
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:30,240
Trial from one year ago? There are too many.

465
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,050
The trial where you conspired with Yong Mun Gu to lose the trial on purpose.

466
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:36,390
That was also a trial for abuse of power, right?

467
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:41,670
I will announce my verdict for the defendant Colonel Lee Do Hyeong from Operations Command.

468
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:46,290
The Military Prosecutor was unable to prove that Colonel Lee abused his power with his subordinate.

469
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:50,940
Meaning, they couldn't prove the charge of abuse of authority.

470
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:56,740
Only the victim's testimony was given as evidence.

471
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:59,540
Because of this, I rule the defendant as not guilty.

472
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,110
Defendant, Lawyer

473
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:26,240
If the military prosecutor is not determined to prove his guilt,

474
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,720
there's no way in hell that the judge can rule him as guilty.

475
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,420
You're right. That determination.

476
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:35,930
In a sense, the court is a stage set up for a prosecutor.

477
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:39,840
The prosecutor is the star. Everyone else is just the supporting character.

478
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,670
You're putting me on a pedestal on purpose, right?

479
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,890
But still, it'll only be this one time.

480
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:48,810
I won't lose to you but do it my way next time. Keep that in mind.

481
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:51,930
I'll take better care of you. Stop worrying about your winning rate.

482
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:55,080
Gosh, thank you, Lawyer Yong.

483
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,890
You!

484
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:01,410
You lost the trial on purpose, didn't you?

485
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:03,330
How can a military prosecutor do that?

486
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:07,220
Hey, what are you doing at a military court? He's your superior.

487
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,270
My friend suffered so much because of him.

488
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:14,970
How could you do this as a military prosecutor?

489
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:17,480
I'm sorry I couldn't help.

490
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,560
What?

491
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:22,000
Sorry?

492
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:28,340
We can't do it, so you people should be setting things straight.

493
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:31,900
That's why the country gave you the right to be a prosecutor.

494
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,550
If even the military prosecutor is like this, who can we trust?

495
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,600
Who in the world?

496
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:46,860
If you're a soldier, you shouldn't cross the line.

497
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,310
Let's grab a cup of coffee.

498
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:50,780
Sure.

499
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,390
I saw that trial.

500
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:01,720
That picture reminded me of that trial.

501
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:07,000
So you're saying,

502
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:12,090
the victim's friend was Staff Sergeant Sin?

503
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:14,400
Then Prosecutor Cha, you also know that trial?

504
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,640
Yes. Staff Sergeant Oh, who received continuous physical and verbal abuse from Colonel Lee

505
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,540
ended up leaving the military for good

506
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:25,550
after seeing his superior officer exonerated from his crimes.

507
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,260
Unity!

508
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:41,060
But Staff Sergeant Sin couldn't leave the military because it is his livelihood.

509
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,300
He got assigned to the Corps Commander's residence.

510
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:47,020
He ended up in the same situation as his friend.

511
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,800
Have a good one, sir.

512
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:59,030
Hey!

513
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,530
What took you so long?

514
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:07,170
You came late on purpose because you knew Jun would be out on vacation, right?

515
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:09,390
I came late because I was searching for p-pomegranates, Madam.

516
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,770
Is that so?

517
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,690
Let's see the amazing pomegranate you bought. Show me.

518
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,700
Where's the pomegranate?

519
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,370
I asked you where is it?

520
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:27,860
How dare you lie to me?

521
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:30,920
You used the pomegranate as an excuse to hang out outside, didn't you?

522
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,480
I will go and buy it again. I'm sorry.

523
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,910
Jun's friends will be here soon! You need to prepare them food right now.

524
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:39,350
I'm sorry. I'll start immediately.

525
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,270
Darn it.

526
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,810
Gosh, that's so refreshing.

527
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:52,990
Man, Lee Jun. It must be tough working your butt off at the frontline.

528
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:53,910
Gosh.

529
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:56,730
I'm hungry. When is the food coming out?

530
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,330
- Me too.
- Do you have a wolf in your belly?

531
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:01,800
Staff Sergeant Sin, that punk. What is he doing?

532
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,970
Hold on a minute.

533
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:10,150
What is this? Why is nothing done?

534
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:14,650
How does he expect us to eat this?

535
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:17,490
Not a single thing is done.

536
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,270
Hey, Staff Sergeant Sin.

537
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:23,880
Are you kidding me right now?

538
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,190
Why aren't you working super fast? What are you doing?

539
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:28,790
I'll prepare it right away.

540
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:30,480
What is this?

541
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,570
It's so salty!

542
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:43,450
Do you plan to send...

543
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:46,140
all my friends home starving?

544
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:51,520
What? Just because you have it easy at my uncle's home

545
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,470
do you think I'm a joke? Do you?

546
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,520
Madam

547
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:59,050
Darn it, it's so noisy.

548
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:02,310
Why are you just standing there? Don't you know my mom is impatient?

549
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:05,730
I'll go after I cool this down a bit.

550
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:09,830
Why didn't you come running to me when I'm calling you? Are you in your right mind?

551
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:12,290
I was going to go just now, Madam.

552
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:14,190
I mean...

553
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,760
What's wrong with you these days? You have no discipline.

554
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,930
You're right. I think Staff Sergeant Sin lost all his sense of discipline while I was gone.

555
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,800
He's never in a hurry. Ever.

556
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,840
Exactly. Jun, since you're on vacation,

557
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,160
you should instill some military discipline in him again.

558
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,310
Should I do that? Okay.

559
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:37,080
All right.

560
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,620
Starting now, get your head in the ground.

561
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:46,270
You look like a sergeant right now.

562
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,070
What are you doing?

563
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:52,220
Commence!

564
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,510
- Is he really doing it?
- For real?

565
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,990
- He's really doing it.
- No way.

566
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:08,600
He's seriously going to do it?

567
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,360
Gosh, I was kidding. It was a joke.

568
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:16,540
I can't believe you did as I said.

569
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:19,070
My son is too nice.

570
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:31,470
I'm asking if you ever took a trial regardless of the rank.

571
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:34,470
You people should be setting things straight.

572
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:37,680
If even the military prosecutor is like this, who can we trust?

573
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:47,760
Here's your cellphone.

574
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,800
- Unity.
- Unity.

575
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:57,620
My Hye Yeong

576
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:04,580
Yes, Hye Yeong. It's me.

577
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,670
You called me multiple times.

578
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:08,490
Are you at the hospital?

579
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,450
Yes.

580
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,780
Really?

581
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:18,350
He cried a lot when he got tested?

582
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,840
I'm on my way to the grocery store.

583
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,600
I'll call you again before I hand in my cellphone.

584
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,390
Okay.

585
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,270
Just a minute, Staff Sergeant Sin.

586
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:47,850
I remember who you are now.

587
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:50,790
You became a star military prosecutor in the meantime.

588
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:53,190
Emperor Treatment, medical malpractice, Landmine Hero.

589
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:57,920
You're wearing a mask of justice now. I laughed alone a lot.

590
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,920
The trial from one year ago.

591
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,500
I have absolutely no excuse for that.

592
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:06,750
The reason you're doing this to me now,

593
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:10,450
is so that you can get the corps commander exonerated, right? You're playing both sides just like you did with my friend.

594
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,120
I won't fall for it.

595
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,210
No, I promise you that's not it.

596
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:20,400
You are not a military prosecutor,

597
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,800
nor are you human.

598
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:34,140
My friend. He had complete trust in you that you'd reveal the truth.

599
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:37,910
But he was completely betrayed by you.

600
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:39,570
Okay.

601
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,410
I heard he left the military for good.

602
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:45,700
He died. My friend is dead.

603
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:49,760
The poor guy.

604
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:54,230
You killed him.

605
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:56,470
Do you know why the military never changes?

606
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:59,730
It's because of rotten military prosecutors like you.

607
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:03,610
Abuse of power? I'd rather live with that.

608
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:06,500
Do you think I'll fall for a scumbag like you?

609
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,150
I'm truly sorry.

610
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:11,590
I wish that

611
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:14,480
you would be the victim just once.

612
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:18,900
Don't ever show up in front of me again.

613
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:37,360
- All right.
- Bend your knee a little.

614
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,130
- Straighten your back. Think of it as you're hitting with your shoulder line.
- Okay.

615
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:41,320
- This line?
- Yes, that's right, sir.

616
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,720
Hit it slightly.

617
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,960
Good shot, sir.

618
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:51,150
That was good. Let me try again.

619
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:14,880
You. Are you deaf?

620
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,750
I told you to come within ten seconds once your watch vibrates.

621
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:20,040
I was going to wrap this up quickly and go—

622
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,650
Hey!

623
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:25,650
Why do you have on that expensive smart watch?

624
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:28,620
Why are you wasting my time?

625
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,720
Clean it spotless by scrubbing it with your hands.

626
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,520
Rinse it at least ten times, you understand?

627
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,180
Yes, Madam.

628
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:38,710
This here. Massage it with your hands.

629
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:40,900
Wash it in the sink.

630
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:43,830
You want me to wash this?

631
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:46,480
You expect me to wash it then?

632
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:49,060
No, Madam.

633
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:00,000
Oh, Oppa. Nice!

634
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,790
Great job.

635
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,470
Prosecutor Do hasn't come into work yet?

636
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:14,490
I think he's absent without leave.

637
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:16,440
What if something happened to him?

638
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,910
I have never seen Prosecutor Do absent.

639
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:23,600
I'm worried too. This is so unexpected.

640
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,430
You haven't heard anything either, Prosecutor Cha?

641
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:27,970
No.

642
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:39,550
The receiver cannot be reached. You will be directed to voicemail. Please leave a message after the beep.

643
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:08,820
You were absent without leave and even turned off your phone.

644
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:11,190
This was the best place you could runaway?

645
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:15,660
How did you know I was here?

646
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:25,630
Leave. I want to be alone.

647
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:50,460
I looked into it more just to be sure.

648
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:55,960
Colonel Lee who got exonerated because of me.

649
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:02,530
He continued to victimize other people after that trial.

650
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:07,170
Also Staff Sergeant Sin's friend is dead.

651
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:15,360
I thought I was a competent military prosecutor.

652
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:20,640
But in actuality, I was just a money-grubbing scumbag.

653
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,200
Until I met you.

654
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:34,640
Cha Wu In.

655
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:41,110
If you were watching me since last year,

656
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:46,730
why didn't you tell me sooner?

657
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:12,560
I wanted to.

658
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:18,580
It was tough watching you from afar.

659
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:24,910
But I had to become a military prosecutor first.

660
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:27,230
That's why I waited.

661
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:36,280
You came here the day you found out about No Hwa Yeong's identity too.

662
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:58,090
Just like you made a big resolution that day,

663
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:03,170
you should make another big resolution in your heart.

664
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:11,260
Your parents

665
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:16,500
probably got into an accident while fighting against injustice.

666
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:22,540
Reveal everything that Hong Mu Seop is doing to Staff Sergeant Sin.

667
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:26,180
And sincerely ask for forgiveness.

668
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:32,040
The past wrongdoing you did as a military prosecutor won't disappear,

669
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:37,970
but the past can also be an answer that can change the future.

670
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:28,080
You.

671
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:33,810
♫ The nostaligic memories ♫

672
00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:40,100
Would you be able to forgive me if it were you?

673
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:46,040
♫ Still I let go of all of feelings ♫

674
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,560
Tell me.

675
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:54,220
You tell me first, Cha Wu In.

676
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:58,660
♫ that I can't get out of ♫

677
00:51:58,660 --> 00:51:59,510
♫ I remember  ♫

678
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:05,910
You can make it happen, Prosecutor Do,

679
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:08,900
because you are the person I chose.

680
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:15,710
♫ to hold on the moments
which are becoming blurred one by one ♫

681
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:18,520
♫ I am trying to fill my heart ♫

682
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:21,490
Come to work on time tomorrow.
♫  with them ♫

683
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:25,670
♫ and keep them there ♫

684
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:33,050
♫ Dive in. With your strong arms ♫

685
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:39,570
♫ remove me from the approaching reality ♫

686
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:49,140
♫ Hold me. I want to feel the warm beat again. ♫

687
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:56,130
♫ Will you hold my heart? ♫

688
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:32,950
Let's all toast to the minister!

689
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:35,380
Loyalty!

690
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,360
Minister. Thank you for choosing me this time.

691
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:49,400
Chief of Staff Kim often rubbed me the wrong way, so I sped the process up a bit.

692
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,090
I will be fully loyal to you.

693
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:54,360
The cabinet still has to consider the appointment,

694
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:58,180
so be extra careful in case they find fault.

695
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:01,460
Yes, of course. You know how Corps Commander Hong is.

696
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:05,270
Amongst us, we think that his blood flows green.

697
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:07,260
He's a true soldier of this country.

698
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:11,320
He'll pass the cabinet meeting with flying colors.

699
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:16,770
Absolutely. This is Hong Mu Seop we're talking about.

700
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:18,710
You're right, sir.

701
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,930
Aren't you going to say anything, Division Commander?

702
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:27,130
You've been looking a little gloomy.

703
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:30,360
Congratulations, Corps Commander.

704
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,640
Gi Chun's presence is missed.

705
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:36,190
Nothing can fill another person's absence.

706
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:41,940
I feel like my arm has been cut off. I'm sure it's worse for you, Hwa Yeong.

707
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:56,520
Oh, CEO Yong. Sit down. Sit down.

708
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:05,340
Gi Chun's spot has already been filled, Minister.

709
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:07,610
Enough.

710
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:11,540
All right, all right! Let's eat.

711
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:15,240
Seol Ak

712
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:27,580
Match the number of boxes exactly according to their ranks.

713
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:29,990
Mistakes are forbidden.

714
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:33,210
Match it according to the number of stars. Be exact.

715
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:36,730
We're instantly dead if we make a mistake.

716
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:38,950
This car doesn't have a star.

717
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:41,600
Minister Lee Jae Sik.

718
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:47,440
We'll count him as a five-star.

719
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,340
Gosh, five?

720
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:58,710
How much do you think is in one box?

721
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:01,460
What? Are you curious?

722
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:04,750
Actually, I'm quite curious too.

723
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:07,990
There's probably at least 100,000 dollars right?

724
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:12,940
- Should we just take all of these and vanish without a trace?
- No.

725
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:17,370
You're right. I have standards too.

726
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:22,000
There has to be a limit to doing bad things too. Or else there'll be trouble.

727
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:26,450
Where would those high-ranking soldiers use this money?

728
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:27,520
Will they use it to protect the country?

729
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,480
The country is protected by the taxes that I pay.

730
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,510
Do you have any idea how much corporate tax we pay for Seol Ak Universe?

731
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:34,660
I'm a model taxpayer.

732
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:36,390
Okay.

733
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:43,690
- You're curious where they use this money?
- Yes.

734
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:58,940
Those sly soldiers use this money to preserve their power.

735
00:56:59,930 --> 00:57:01,760
Drink up.

736
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:07,160
Power is a drug. It's a drug much stronger than money.

737
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:13,970
Power and the people's attention are what corrupted soldiers thirst for the most.

738
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:19,530
Hold on.

739
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:23,700
I'll say this since everyone is here.

740
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:27,320
About the defense project that Gi Chun was going to do,

741
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:31,730
I think we'll have to start from scratch again.

742
00:57:31,730 --> 00:57:35,290
So it's been troubling me...

743
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:37,730
Minister! Be safe on the road.

744
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:39,270
Goodbye, sir.

745
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:40,840
I'll see you again.

746
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,470
All right.

747
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:45,720
- See you again, CEO Yong.
- Yes.

748
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,520
Unity.

749
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,410
Unity.

750
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:57,210
Division Commander.

751
00:57:57,210 --> 00:58:00,660
How about having a cup of tea with me?

752
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:03,310
Right now?

753
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:04,530
Sure.

754
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:06,560
It'll be just the two of you, right?

755
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,090
I'll see you next time.

756
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:09,820
All right.

757
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,780
You get back safely too, Corps Commander Gu.

758
00:58:16,210 --> 00:58:18,190
Unity.

759
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:39,540
Thank you, Adjutant Yang.

760
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:44,260
You're always quietly doing your job dutifully. I like it.

761
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:46,190
Very much.

762
00:58:56,330 --> 00:59:00,850
Thanks to Gi Chun taking the fall for everything,

763
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:03,890
neither you nor I were affected.

764
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:07,540
He didn't act like a soldier,

765
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:12,420
but he helped us greatly in the end. We just need to pray he went to a good place.

766
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:16,170
What you said doesn't sound all too pleasant.

767
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:18,010
Is that so?

768
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:28,180
You sure it's not because you got rid of him?

769
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:36,520
You're saying that punk pulled the trigger in his mouth out of repentance?

770
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:43,480
Are you trying to say I pulled that trigger?

771
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:48,780
It's not impossible with you. Plus, this isn't the first time.

772
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:56,760
Twenty years ago. I just covered up the case as ordered by Minister Lee Jae Sik.

773
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:02,180
But right after that, the married couple who were my subordinate investigators died.

774
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:07,190
I think that punk's name was Do Seong Hwan.

775
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:10,990
You killed them with your hands and saved their son.

776
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:13,280
You remember that too, right?

777
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:17,940
You've always been great at wrapping things up.

778
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:31,900
Weren't you the one who finished it off with a ribbon yourself?

779
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:33,570
What?

780
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:35,910
You're a respected senior officer, Corps Commander.

781
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:39,420
That'll be the case even more once you make Chief of Staff.

782
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:43,720
So keep going the way you are.

783
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:46,490
Don't show your true self.

784
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:52,450
I learned one thing from you.

785
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:55,750
The fact that it's better to be a subject of fear to your subordinates,

786
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:58,250
rather than a subject of respect.

787
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:00,180
Like you.

788
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:03,190
You made everyone fear you.

789
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:06,040
That's why I don't like you.

790
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:10,260
You'll also have to make a decision once I become Chief of Staff.

791
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:13,550
Whether you'll be an ally or my enemy.

792
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:16,020
Of course, it's not all up to you to decide.

793
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:19,170
I'm the one who will accept you,

794
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:22,950
and I'm the one who can reject you too.

795
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:38,400
I think that punk's name was

796
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,710
Do Seong Hwan.

797
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:47,960
You killed them with your hands and saved their son. You remember that too, right?

798
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:54,930
What is your true reason for returning?

799
01:01:54,930 --> 01:02:00,930
I realized the place I need to be is here, the military.

800
01:02:11,950 --> 01:02:14,320
I brought Do Bae Man's personnel record as you ordered.

801
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,050
Officer Personnel Record

802
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:18,460
I don't need it.

803
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:23,730
I clearly know who Do Bae Man is now.

804
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:52,410
Don't guard the front but the back instead.

805
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:53,270
Pardon?

806
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:56,670
Watch the chief patrolling.

807
01:02:57,330 --> 01:03:00,470
I'm going to rest my eyes until he comes to check on us.

808
01:03:00,470 --> 01:03:04,990
I'll get sent to military prison if I get caught sleeping here. This is the frontline.

809
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:07,720
Okay, do what you want.

810
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:11,400
Hey, you'd better fix the way you talk.

811
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,390
The guys here are growing impatient.

812
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:16,020
Okay.

813
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:36,660
HAND. FRAG. DELAY

814
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:44,900
Hand grenade

815
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,470
Is this your first time touching a grenade?

816
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:52,250
You must've trained to throw one during basic training, no?

817
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:56,530
I said I didn't want to throw one, so they exempted me.

818
01:03:56,530 --> 01:03:58,940
It's your first time touching it then.

819
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:02,160
Everyone reacts like you at first.

820
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,160
No.

821
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:09,930
I'm sure there's no one who touched a grenade as surely as I did.

822
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:26,630
What's wrong with this place?

823
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:30,780
Am I the only strange one?

824
01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:34,950
The military is a prison?

825
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:39,470
No. This is a living hell.

826
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:58,680
CEO. You have a visitor at your office.

827
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:01,920
At this hour? Who is it?

828
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:33,310
I didn't think you'd voluntarily reveal your identity like this.

829
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:35,430
I'm surprised.

830
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:42,860
Did you show up because I said your father's company will disappear?

831
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:46,250
I wasn't planning on hiding myself forever.

832
01:06:58,350 --> 01:07:01,970
I was going to show up at the time I chose.

833
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:10,140
Investigation Report of Abuse Power Case at Corps Commander's Residence - first draft

834
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,410
List of People Residing at Corps Commander Hong Mu Seop's Official Residence

835
01:07:22,410 --> 01:07:27,040
Reveal everything that Hong Mu Seop is doing to Staff Sergeant Sin.

836
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:30,730
And sincerely ask for forgiveness.

837
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:36,390
The past wrongdoing you did as a military prosecutor won't disappear,

838
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:42,340
but the past can also be an answer that can change the future.

839
01:08:05,010 --> 01:08:09,580
I can't believe that you, who are the most un-solider like person, are the son of soldiers.

840
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,030
Do Bae Man.

841
01:08:19,830 --> 01:08:22,600
You were that kid.

842
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:25,990
The kid that I saved.

843
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:52,070
Military Prosecutor Doberman

844
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:02,250
♫ The endlessly distant sadness  ♫

845
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:05,190
♫ within me ♫

846
01:09:05,190 --> 01:09:08,480
♫ The moment we are face to face ♫

847
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:10,770
♫ All the time which accumulated ♫

848
01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:13,720
Give me the opportunity to right my wrongs, Staff Sergeant Sin.

849
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:14,930
I'm a criminal too.

850
01:09:14,930 --> 01:09:17,180
You dare spit on my face, you punk?

851
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:19,370
What do you think about forming a special investigation team...

852
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:22,360
with the military prosecutors from my division for this case?

853
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:25,560
You're saying you have your division commander mom to protect you?

854
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:27,950
I'll succeed using the most evil methods.

855
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:31,600
It'll be eviler than revenge. I'll show it to my victims.

856
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:35,030
Choosing you, Prosecutor Do, was a great decision on my part.

857
01:09:35,030 --> 01:09:40,050
How it would feel to destroy you in this court.

858
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:43,020
♫ Like the hot sun, ♫

859
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:45,220
♫ like a flame ♫

860
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:47,430
♫ I'm constantly ♫
