Military Prosecutor Doberman

8
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,170
20 Years Ago

9
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,090
How dare you disobey my order, Bitch?

10
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,110
I didn't disobey.

11
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,610
I followed your order perfectly.

12
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,970
I told you to make the investigator couple understand.

13
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,020
Did I ever tell you to kill them, Bitch?

14
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:04,630
When there's any problem, the way I solve it is to cut it off at the root.

15
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,820
That way there is no trouble later.

16
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,580
Are you insane, Bitch?

17
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,340
Colonel, you and I have to go together

18
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,450
until the end of my time in the military.

19
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:33,940
Lee Jae Sik, I'm sure you will someday try to cut me off at the root,

20
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,910
but you will never hurt me.

21
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:40,220
I'll become a monster. I will step on men

22
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,350
and climb to the top.

23
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,420
The present

24
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:02,040
I can't believe that you, who are the most un-solider like person, are the son of soldiers.

25
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,250
Do Bae Man.

26
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,460
You were that kid.

27
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,680
The kid I saved.

28
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,770
No Hwa Yeong.

29
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,430
- You—
- You killed my parents.

30
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,940
It was an accident.

31
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,420
It was tragic and heartbreaking, but it was just a traffic accident.

32
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,200
I had no reason to kill your parents.

33
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,420
No, there is evidence.

34
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,160
Are you saying there is evidence?

35
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,450
There is evidence indeed.

36
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,370
It is you, No Hwa Yeong.

37
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,350
I clearly remember now

38
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,890
your checking whether my parents were alive or dead with this hand.

39
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,600
I've been looking forward to this moment.

40
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,390
A mutiny should be directly disposed of.

41
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,860
Yes. That's correct, Division Commander.

42
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,680
So you knew?

43
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,560
Why didn't you show up until now?

44
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,080
Because it's already been a long time.

45
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,010
After the accident, I lost my memory for a while.

46
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:47,600
Thank you so much for saving me then, Division Commander.

47
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,440
You resemble your father who was fearless and headstrong a lot.

48
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,030
My father's IM Defense will never disappear.

49
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,840
Yong Mun Gu,

50
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,930
you came into this office after changing your face three times.

51
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,860
As the prosecutor who covered father with trumped up charges and stabbed him,

52
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,770
as the lawyer who was like No Tae Nam's servant,

53
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:32,180
and now as the nominal CEO who is No Hwa Yeong's figurehead.

54
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,920
You've always lived wearing a mask.

55
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,540
You're saying a mask.

56
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,730
Speaking about masks,

57
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,360
shall we also talk bout the mask our Military Prosecutor Cha Wu In wears?

58
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,990
It will be hard for you to remove it yourself,

59
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:59,820
so I will remove that mask for you.

60
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:05,610
The article will come out tomorrow morning but it would be better to know the contents in advance.

61
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,850
Since you put some effort into visiting here.

62
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:14,950
"It has been reported that a military prosecutor has been posing as a vigilante.

63
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,260
It is expected that the military prosecutor, who has the duty of defending the law,

64
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,040
but engaged in illegal kidnapping, false imprisonment, and assault

65
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:27,420
will suffer severe discipline as well as public censure."

66
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,400
Episode 11

67
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,660
- Executive Director.
- Yes.

68
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,300
Chairman.

69
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,110
I came straight from the airport.

70
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:14,530
My business trip turned out longer than expected, so I'm sorry I couldn't see you be inaugurated.

71
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:19,530
I skipped my inauguration, but you were working hard elsewhere.

72
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:25,500
The company which was in shambles is now stable thanks to you.

73
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,490
While the CEO of the company has changed three times,

74
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:34,010
you have unwaveringly remained in your position, so you are the heart and soul of the company.

75
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,390
Don't you think so?

76
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,210
You flatter me.

77
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:44,300
Are you officially starting the CEO's plan now?

78
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,430
Start?

79
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,450
That started already six years ago.

80
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:55,150
The day I came to this office for the first time with General No Hwa Yeong.

81
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,720
Concealing a claw for a long time is always advantageous.

82
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,100
- Are you sober?
- Huh?

83
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,760
Was I a bit drunk last time?

84
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:28,410
Oh. I found this had fallen in my residence.

85
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,720
I've been searching for this for a long time. Did you find it there?

86
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,750
I guess it must be precious.

87
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,070
My dad gave it to me when I was six.

88
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,550
He named IM after me.

89
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,590
Oh, it's not an ordinary necklace.

90
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,860
Where did you come from?

91
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:56,560
I'm on my way back from visiting my dad's company for the first time in six years.

92
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:38,450
Company Chairman Yong Mun Gu

93
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,830
Dad is the best!

94
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,930
Okay. Now, if we do this,

95
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:04,010
it's Wu In, right?

96
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,600
Did you tell Yong Mun Gu who you are?

97
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:25,000
He already knew. As expected.

98
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,110
As expected.

99
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:32,290
Furthermore, he threatened me that he would reveal to the world what I did wearing the red hair.

100
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,330
What?

101
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,420
So I returned it to him.

102
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:40,620
I can't help it if you want to point a gun at me.

103
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,350
I will have no choice but to shoot back.

104
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,770
I mean the things you have done before you came to this office.

105
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:52,560
You provoked Se Na into releasing the No Tae Nam video.

106
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,440
Waiting until the owner risk from No Tae Nam caused IM to be shaken,

107
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,200
you mobilized tactics to cause a further stock price plunge.

108
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,230
And you made No Tae Nam to escape to the army.

109
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,020
Now you occupy the CEO position.

110
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:16,160
That's far too much speculation, Prosecutor Cha.

111
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,070
I don't think so.

112
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:23,050
There's some evidence I've been accumulating.

113
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:27,490
But I'm not sending this to the press.

114
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,730
There's only one person to send this to.

115
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,070
No Hwa Yeong.

116
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,300
Will she believe you?

117
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,940
It doesn't matter. Because I just need to inform her.

118
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,290
Then she will figure out the truth.

119
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:57,540
Once she knows the truth, you will be gotten rid of.

120
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,880
What do you think? Are you confident?

121
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,430
You came to shut my mouth.

122
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:16,850
Sure. You are not just Cha Ho Cheol's daughter for nothing.

123
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,160
You went to threaten Yong Mun Gu?

124
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,700
A military prosecutor should not make threats.

125
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,750
We can hold weapons

126
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,560
but let's just call it a tactically risky truce.

127
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,220
Wow, is that a coincidence?

128
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:35,350
Just before you came, No Hwa Yeong came to see me at the office.

129
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,220
Then, even No Hwa Yeong now knows of our existence.

130
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:47,740
I wanted to shut No Hwa Yeong's fake smiling mouth from talking about my parents

131
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,040
but I wanted to confer with you first.

132
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:58,640
You said that right? To receive forgiveness from Sergeant Sin.

133
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,410
I'll succeed using the most evil methods.

134
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,770
It'll be eviler than revenge.

135
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:08,520
I'll show it to my victims.

136
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:12,610
Until I can erase everything...

137
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,870
that I've done for the past five years.

138
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:24,510
I didn't think you'd come to this decision.

139
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:30,800
I knew it. Choosing you, Prosecutor Do, was a great decision on my part.

140
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,110
I hope I can do well.

141
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:45,800
Chief Yeom Sang Jin: I've found something, Prosecutor Cha.

142
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,090
Hand Grenade Explosion At Recruit Training Center!

143
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,480
Twenty years ago, there was an accident at a recruit training center,

144
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,910
during hand grenade training.

145
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:02,560
Your father concluded it wasn't the trainee soldier's fault.

146
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,110
I assure you it's not the trainee's fault.

147
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,600
Thousands of pieces of shrapnel scatter when a grenade explodes.

148
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,310
Around 300 pieces of shrapnel were found in the upper body of the deceased drill instructor.

149
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:16,140
If it were a case of simple negligence of the trainee, it wouldn't explain the angle.

150
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,740
Also, I obtained a sworn statement.

151
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,780
- A statement?
- Yes.

152
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:24,240
The witness stated that he saw the grenade explode before the trainee threw it.

153
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,420
This means the grenade had a fatal defect.

154
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,200
The Defense Ministry's technical quality report already came out saying there was no defect.

155
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,770
I already finished investigating that report too.

156
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,380
No tests were run on the test date.

157
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,710
That report was fabricated.

158
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:45,570
So you disobeyed my orders and went around investigating on your accord then.

159
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,630
I will receive punishment for that.

160
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,300
But if we don't unveil the truth about the defective grenades

161
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,680
- more innocent soldiers will continue to die.
- Give me the documents.

162
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,750
We have to investigate the defense company that manufactured the defective grenades also.

163
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,000
I told you to give me the darn documents, you punk!

164
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,140
How dare you

165
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:08,090
disobey your senior officer's orders?

166
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,260
Darn it.

167
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:14,160
Just because you rip the documents up...

168
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,520
- you think the truth will disappear?
- Truth?

169
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,470
Hey. Don't be rash.

170
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,910
This is my last warning to you.

171
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,850
I didn't know about the defective grenade accident at that time.

172
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,350
I found out through meeting the retired military police

173
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,830
that Won Gi Cheon wrote of in his military notebook.

174
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:41,070
He probably figured it'd be risky to get me involved too.

175
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:45,520
That's why your father dealt with it alone.

176
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,920
How was the case concluded?

177
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,370
It was concluded the way Hong Mu Seop fabricated it.

178
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:58,440
The trainee was found at fault.

179
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:02,920
No investigations were done on the defense company that made the defective grenade.

180
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,890
But your father still didn't stop with that.

181
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:10,410
Because grenade accidents didn't stop and soldiers continued to die.

182
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:14,560
Your father ultimately planned to reveal this defective grenade issue to the civilian world.

183
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,660
The person he reached out for help from at that time was Chairman Cha Ho Cheol.

184
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,700
Your father, Prosecutor Cha.

185
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,640
That's why they took a picture with him.

186
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:31,330
And why they got a call from him right before the accident.

187
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,690
Yes.

188
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,950
Then what about No Hwa Yeong?

189
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:45,930
Now we know why Won Gi Chun wrote in his notebook that Hong Mu Seop and No Hwa Yeong met so often.

190
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:51,040
Aside from them, there's one more person involved in this case.

191
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,090
It's none other than Colonel Lee Jae Sik.

192
00:15:55,090 --> 00:16:00,670
Lee Jae Sik was the assistant chief of staff who dealt with the defense company at that time.

193
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:07,160
To summarize, Lee Jae Sik ordered Hong Mu Seop to cover up the defective grenade issue.

194
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:13,320
Then he probably ordered No Hwa Yeong to deal with your parents, Prosecutor Do.

195
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,750
Lee Jae Sik, 64, 37th Military Academy Class

196
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:27,470
I knew it. The military's food chain goes all the way up to Lee Jae Sik.

197
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,430
- Is Hwa Yeong running late?
- Please sit down first.

198
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,790
Okay.

199
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,630
- Here.
- Oh, yes.

200
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,140
I guess Hwa Yeong won't be joining us today?

201
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:58,180
You came even though I didn't mention the division commander would be here.

202
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,980
You've become more confident since you became a CEO.

203
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,010
You're bold enough to go behind your boss's back.

204
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:06,690
Is it because you're not a soldier?

205
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:12,470
I heard that the Ministry of Defense is looking to find a company to develop a new weapon.

206
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,700
The late Lieutenant Colonel Won Gi Chun was supposed to be the bridge.

207
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,750
I knew there was a reason for this drink treatment.

208
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:24,690
I won't have IM handle everything for the time being, for the sake of my political career.

209
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:29,390
But IM is inseparable from you

210
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,530
as you know very well.

211
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,600
That's why I secretly prepared a way.

212
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,620
It's a project that Division Commander No doesn't know about.

213
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:48,830
Didn't Hwa Yeong give you that position though?

214
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,730
So how could I trust you?

215
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:55,470
How much do you trust Division Commander No then?

216
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:05,420
From now on, I'll support your political battle both materially and spiritually.

217
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,770
I may not be a soldier, but I know to whom I need to be loyal.

218
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,660
It's the reason I made it this far.

219
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,930
I can see why Hwa Yeong kept you close.

220
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:31,920
I think you'll be better at politics than me.

221
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,730
Republic of Korea Army

222
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,040
Sergeant Sin Ju Yong. I dedicate my loyalty.

223
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:52,020
Good job for the past year and six months.

224
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,430
The military teaches war,

225
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:58,640
but you'll see actual war in the society you're going back to.

226
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,120
I hope you do not lose

227
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,720
in the war where you're trying to protect your precious family.

228
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,950
- That's all.
- Salute to the division commander.

229
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,160
Unity.

230
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:14,040
Down. Turn right.

231
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,990
How is Tae Nam doing?

232
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,590
- I'll look into it right away.
- Forget it.

233
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,560
No news is good news.

234
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:37,790
Here. Take your pick.

235
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:42,420
- Awesome!
- This one is mine!

236
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,430
- I wanted this.
- Move.

237
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,550
Oh, man.

238
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:53,430
- What's going on?
- It's a present.

239
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:56,320
It's a gift.

240
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:06,020
I don't think I can wear this during duty for fear of it being scratched.

241
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,490
Hey, that won't be scratched.

242
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,790
- You can handle it roughly.
- Really?

243
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,620
Thank you.

244
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,490
Wow.

245
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,020
Pika-pika.

246
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,510
You don't know what that is?

247
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:27,530
- I don't.
- This punk.

248
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,480
Attention.

249
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,390
- What is it?
- What's that?

250
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,300
He's Pikachu!

251
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,260
No Tae Nam. You'll be No-kachu from now on.

252
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,130
- No-kachu.
- Answer me.

253
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:52,600
Report and repeat, No-kachu. Flap around right now.

254
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,470
- Right now!
- Do it!

255
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,310
- You have to do it.
- Are you going to disobey me.?

256
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,880
Fine, he doesn't want to.

257
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,330
- Pyeon.
- Private Pyeon Sang Ho.

258
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:05,920
Don't just stand there. Your subordinate doesn't want to, so you should demonstrate as his senior.

259
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,790
Private Pyeon-kachu. I'll gear up for a million volts.

260
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,250
Pikachu!

261
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,000
Fire!

262
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,950
Shake your body more, you punk.

263
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,980
That's enough!

264
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,220
You little punk.

265
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,720
You're saying you have your division commander mom to protect you?

266
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,930
What does my mother have to do with this?

267
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,020
I wonder why?

268
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,440
It's obvious to me.

269
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,980
Why else would the division commander throw her son into this place?

270
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,330
It's so that you stay put and don't cause her any trouble.

271
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:51,590
That also means you have to do whatever I say.

272
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:56,700
Pyeon.

273
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,940
Private Pyeon Sang Ho.

274
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,740
Have you not been teaching your subordinate? Put your helmet on.

275
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,920
Private Pyeon Sang Ho. Putting on helmet.

276
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:10,350
Didn't I tell you? The newbie's fault falls on his superior.

277
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,050
- This head of yours.
- Private Pyeon Sang Ho.

278
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,530
- Is it empty?
- Private Pyeon Sang Ho.

279
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,890
- There's nothing in here?
- Private Pyeon Sang Ho.

280
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:21,070
- I ought to just break open your head.
- Private Pyeon Sang Ho.

281
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,510
Is that what you want?

282
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,710
Private Pyeon Sang Ho.

283
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,440
Private Pyeon Sang Ho.

284
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,650
Private Pyeon Sang Ho.

285
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,480
Private Pyeon Sang Ho.

286
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,450
That's enough!

287
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,600
- Stop.
- Let me go.

288
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,400
I have something to tell you.

289
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,940
- What is it?
- Just follow me.

290
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,080
- It'd better be important.
- Just come with me.

291
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,580
Get back to your business.

292
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,160
I'm sorry I put you through that.

293
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,200
You did good.

294
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,800
Once you bend over like me, you must continue to do that.

295
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,210
You did the smart thing.

296
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:35,300
Is your head okay?

297
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,930
The reality is they don't hit because they want to.

298
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:41,780
They do it because they can.

299
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,490
- It's your favorite mandu, Pyeon.
- It's an eating show.

300
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,090
Hurry up and eat.

301
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,540
- Finish it or you're dead.
- Hurry up.

302
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,600
What a good boy.

303
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,910
Gosh.

304
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,610
Are you sleepy?

305
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:20,920
You're not going to sleep when I'm on duty, right? I'm sleepy too.

306
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:26,710
Wait for me. I'll be back soon.

307
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,030
Don't you see the bait?

308
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,550
- Over here.
- Eat it. You can do it.

309
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:35,220
- It's eat one, get one free.
- Aigoo.

310
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,380
What a shame.

311
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:41,050
Your head better not touch the pillow, or else you won't sleep tonight.

312
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,800
You can't move until you win.

313
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,180
Okay?

314
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,640
Start.

315
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,720
Look at his face. Are you not having fun?

316
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,380
Enjoy it. It's a game.

317
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,820
I miss my mom.

318
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:20,620
I want to eat my mom's cooking.

319
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:45,670
Hang in there a little. Sergeant Ma will be discharged soon.

320
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:49,260
I'll make your life comfortable once I'm in charge.

321
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:56,710
I have a favor to ask. Can I make one phone call?

322
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:59,190
You should've told me sooner.

323
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,060
Here.

324
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,440
Thank you, sir.

325
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,120
Make No Tae Nam your dog.

326
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,170
Lawyer Yong. It's me.

327
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,220
Chairman?

328
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,890
I can't talk for long.

329
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,690
Well...

330
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,700
I need you to send me a package. Fill it up with anything expensive.

331
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,760
Pardon?

332
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,910
My mother blocked my finances entirely. Including my credit cards.

333
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:47,270
I'll see to it right away. Is there anything else?

334
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:51,080
Are you doing well?

335
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,050
Hey, my mom...

336
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:57,300
I mean, did Mother happen to...

337
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,530
What about the general?

338
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:02,230
Why are you having trouble understanding me? Why?

339
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:06,320
Mother. Is she not going to stop by here once?

340
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,660
If the general visits, the entire place will be on full alert the week before.

341
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:14,620
Not just there, but the company and battalion. Everywhere.

342
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:18,080
Gosh, forget it. Just quickly send me the package.

343
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:23,370
How can she be so cold?

344
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,560
Attention everyone. Gather around.

345
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,990
All right, starting now,

346
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:40,260
we'll start investigating Corps Commander Hong Mu Seop's abuse of power.

347
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,270
- The corps commander?
- Yes.

348
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:47,080
He has a whopping three stars. Actually, it'll be four soon.

349
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:52,800
Gosh, the two of you. Just how far are you planning to go?

350
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,950
Turns out the two of you are terrifying people.

351
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,430
Look at those smiles.

352
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:05,290
My military life is full of suspense and drama thanks to you two.

353
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:08,750
But I doubt that the corps commander's case will be given to us.

354
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:12,150
Exactly. It would go to the Corps legal office.

355
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,880
We've already seen what happened through Kim Han Yong's case.

356
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,390
Kim Han Yong questioned the Corps legal office regarding his brother's case and was silenced.

357
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:23,440
My point exactly. That's why you should work on another case.

358
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,510
Hey, Yun Sang Gi. Don't you know who I am?

359
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:32,650
I'm a Doberman. The hunting dog.

360
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,920
Have you ever seen me take the easy route?

361
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,770
Never.

362
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:40,510
That's why my life is so hard.

363
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,750
So what? With what and how in the world...

364
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,530
do you plan on paving the path?

365
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:50,100
Stop whining.

366
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,910
Follow me.

367
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,290
- Nice job.
- You're amazing.

368
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:57,290
This is how you should play.

369
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:59,710
Here you go.

370
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,970
The ball.

371
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,950
I'm hitting it perfectly!

372
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,080
Nice shot!

373
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,490
The doubts about the Landmine Hero should also be clarified, Your Honors.

374
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,540
Nice!

375
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,970
- Hand me the right club!
- Hey.

376
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:17,390
I knew that punk Kim Han Yong would cause big trouble.

377
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,960
- You have to hit the ball.
- Give me one more chance.

378
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,730
We're going to blow up the judge advocate office.

379
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:25,610
We'll make it so that the judge advocates can't help Corps Commander Hong out.

380
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:30,650
Then we'll also have to bring the case over to us and disclose all their rotten corruption.

381
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:36,300
Also, I'll persuade Staff Sergeant Sin no matter what.

382
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:45,060
He still couldn't quit playing golf during duty even after the scolding I gave him.

383
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:48,020
The severity of his crime got worse because we let him go once.

384
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,860
He's avoiding military golf courses and only using civilian ones.

385
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:58,090
All right then. How about we start with the corrupt judge advocate lawyers first?

386
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,320
Are you ready, Section Chief Ahn?

387
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,810
- All right. In one, two.
- Okay.

388
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,410
Let's go.

389
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,860
Let's get a drink after this.

390
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,290
Sounds good.

391
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,990
You won't get another chance, okay?

392
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,830
Fine, I got it.

393
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:35,720
- Okay.
- You need to hold it right.

394
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,470
- He's weak for a guy.
- Aigoo.

395
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,560
What a joke.

396
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,680
I'm sorry, sir.

397
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,890
Do you know how much one of these clubs costs?

398
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:46,790
I'm sorry, sir.

399
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:50,410
You can't buy it even if you combine both your yearly salaries, you little punk!

400
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:54,010
Then how about the corps take the lead,

401
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:57,570
so that the soldiers can get a raise?

402
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:59,460
Who are you two?

403
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,210
They are sacrificing

404
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:05,080
two years of their precious youth.

405
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,350
The fact that they can't even afford one golf club is terrible, don't you think?

406
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:10,430
- Who are you guys!
- Aigoo. Just a second.

407
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:13,020
Who are you? Why are you taking pictures without permission?

408
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,570
He's not a caddy, right?

409
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:19,510
You are a soldier on duty, right?

410
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,530
It'll be fine.

411
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:24,030
It's just as we expected, Reporter Yun.

412
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,180
Reporter?

413
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:28,570
Look here, all you Military Judge Advocates!

414
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:31,050
- Gather.
- Gather!

415
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,770
Shouldn't you be in trial right now?

416
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:40,590
My gosh. You get soldiers to carry golf clubs and pick up golf balls.

417
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:45,190
- Did I also see you trying to hit him with a golf club just now?
- Of course not.

418
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:47,710
How could you as civil servants??

419
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:50,460
- Take her camera!
- Give it to me.

420
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:54,960
Is it true that you all played golf on duty at a civilian golf course?

421
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,870
Do you admit to not only having your soldiers caddy for you but also you attempted to hit them?

422
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:01,130
On the day you were photographed,

423
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:03,950
you didn't attend your trial for personal reasons. What happened?

424
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:07,010
- That never happened. Put your cameras away.
- Pease give us a statement.

425
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,720
It's been revealed that four judge advocates

426
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,940
went golfing at the civilian gold course during working hours.

427
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,240
They're being questioned for neglect of duty.

428
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,560
Not only that, they had soldiers caddy for them.

429
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,150
- There are talks that they illegally arranged for activity allowances.
- My gosh.

430
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,950
- Good job.
- This case is expected to cause a big uproar.

431
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:28,150
I guess this is the pleasure of catching bad guys.

432
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:31,440
- I feel more refreshed than when I relieve myself. It's nice.
- Me too.

433
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,290
This must be why the two prosecutors are always working together and making this happen.

434
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,920
What?

435
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,150
Wait, no. Stop it, Sang Gi.

436
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,740
What's wrong with you? Come on.

437
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:52,890
Does it make you that happy? You might end up a military prosecutor if you continue.

438
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:56,520
Gosh, Section Chief Ahn. Didn't you notice anything?

439
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,730
I'm happy too. But not as much as you...

440
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:02,480
No, not that.

441
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,620
That day. The two prosecutors.

442
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:09,050
I'm a Doberman. The hunting dog.

443
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:12,600
Woof woof. That hunting dog.

444
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,030
The look they exchanged. There must be something going on.

445
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:18,890
If not, then what? Already in love?

446
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:25,790
Now that you mention it, I think that's the first time I saw Prosecutor Cha smile like that.

447
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:30,850
When do you think it started between the two?

448
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,830
Don't cry.

449
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:40,550
Gosh, Section Chief Ahn. Crushes are meant to be broken to be completed.

450
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,440
Me too.

451
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,720
I'm fighting that pain right now.

452
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,260
Pardon?

453
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:54,130
No.

454
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,280
Prosecutor Cha?

455
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,080
That's enough. Don't say more.

456
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,170
Gosh, it hurts.

457
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:03,030
- Give me another high-five.
- I'm not in the mood for that.

458
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:05,410
- You're not?
- Prosecutor.

459
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,360
Okay then.

460
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,690
I feel a great void.

461
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,010
Corps Judge Advocates Arouse Suspicion of Negligence of Duty.

462
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:27,890
What do you think? I did it for you.

463
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:30,940
Blasting those judge advocates away.

464
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:35,670
If you tell the corps what happened to you, they'll just bury it.

465
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,900
So I'm going to handle it myself.

466
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,740
Piss off.

467
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,410
Staff Sergeant Sin.

468
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,560
Staff Sergeant Sin!

469
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:54,110
Give me the opportunity to right my wrongs, Staff Sergeant Sin.

470
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:56,870
I was a military prosecutor who was only after money.

471
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:06,110
I used my power to make money.

472
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,220
I'm a criminal too.

473
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:13,570
I ask for your forgiveness.

474
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:16,280
Please forgive me.

475
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,340
Sin Min Cheol

476
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:22,760
What happened to you and your friend. I'll make sure it never happens again.

477
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,070
Then what?

478
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,650
That's not going to bring my friend back to life.

479
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:32,240
Why did you change all of a sudden?

480
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,890
What are your true intentions for doing this?

481
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:38,140
I'll show you directly.

482
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:43,250
I will show you my sincerity.

483
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,790
Madam.

484
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,870
Why aren't you picking up?

485
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:00,470
Didn't I tell you to pick up within five seconds?

486
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:03,870
I'm sorry, Madam. I'll head in right away.

487
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,800
Staff Sergeant Sin.

488
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:13,380
If you don't want me, at least go here.

489

Protectors of Military Human Rights

490
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:48,180
I'll show you directly.

491
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:52,310
I will show you my sincerity.

492
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,560
General

493
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:55,650
Protectors of Military Human Rights

494

"Your time is limited. Don't waste your life for the lives of others." - Steve Jobs

495
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,770
To my friend, Sin Min Cheol.

496
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,230
Where are you going instead of cooking?

497
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,310
Why is your bag packed?

498
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:38,090
I asked what you're doing on your own accord?

499
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,460
- Hey!
- Let go of me.

500
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:45,210
Are you crazy? If you go like this, you'll be going AWOL.

501
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:49,190
I'm going to send you to military prison with my official authority.

502
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,600
AWOL? Official authority?

503
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,660
What gives you the right? You're a civilian, Ms. Hong Gyeong Ok.

504
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,880
You have no authority.

505
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,280
You little punk.

506
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:07,560
Let go. Have you gone mad, you prick?

507
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,110
No.

508
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:14,540
I can't leave an important piece of evidence behind.

509
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:18,070
Wh-What? What did you just say?

510
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:25,230
I'll be the last soldier you'll order around like a slave.

511
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,790
Protectors of Military Human Rights announced they received report of...

512
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:35,530
Corps commander and his family abusing their authority.

513
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:41,480
According to the report, Staff Sergeant Sin, who worked at Hong's official residence for six months...

514
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:46,040
- was a victim of Hong and his family's abuse.
- Higher-ups are the worst when it comes to abusing power.

515
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,670
- Answer me.
- Yes, sir.

516
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,700
Military officials are still looking into this matter.
[Daebak! Abuse of power in the military!]

517
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,150
The people are criticizing them for delaying their response.
[Isn't he the guy who's in line for chief of Staff?]

518
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:57,430
Also, the military announced that...
[I can't believe someone like this is the candidate for chief of staff.]

519
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:01,500
they'll be investigating the working conditions of soldiers at official residences.
[They can't abuse their power just because their family member is the Corps Commander.]

520
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:05,520
Oppa. I-I-I didn't do anything else.

521
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,100
Seeing that this scandal is about Corps Commander Hong Mu Seop who has been respected for his leadership,

522
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,570
officials stated they'll have to look thoroughly into it.

523
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:16,980
They have expressed their concerns regarding this case.

524
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:21,640
If this suspicion is revealed to be the truth...

525
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,240
- He's coming out.
- He's here.

526
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,340
Will the cabinet meeting go as planned to deliberate the future Army chief of staff?

527
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:31,220
Which division is taking charge of this case?

528
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,540
There are talks about the responsibilities of officers in the light of this case and the case of the judge advocates golfing.

529
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,200
Do you feel responsible?

530
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,710
- Answer us.
- Give us a statement please.

531
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:47,140
- Sir!
- Minister!

532
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:50,320
Minister Lee Jae Sik looks very pissed.

533
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:55,590
Everyone from the Patriotic Society is probably gathering at Hong Mu Seop's residence.

534
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:58,800
They won't find a good solution even with an emergency meeting.

535
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,870
We blasted all the Corps' judge advocates away,

536
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:05,240
but there's no guarantee that Hong Mu Seop's case will come to us.

537
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,310
What does your intuition say?

538
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:13,690
I'm trying to rely on my experience instead of intuition this time.

539
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:17,500
Your intuition tells you nothing? Have you lost your intuition?

540
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,510
Shall we take a walk?

541
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,540
Let's go look for my intuitive ability.

542
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:29,960
Minister. I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

543
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,290
You dare spit in my face, you punk?

544
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,480
You were a model soldier!

545
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,630
Before the appointment to chief of staff, I guess you found no fault with me.

546
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:43,110
Seeing how they dug up the fact that I had my staff sergeant run a few errands for me.

547
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:49,170
He's right, Minister. Discuss this over a cup of tea—

548
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:59,090
Minister. My nephew is serving on the frontlines too.

549
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:03,740
I think there was a miscommunication due to me treating Staff Sergeant Sin like family.

550
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:07,020
But I didn't do anything that would be a problem.

551
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:12,660
Minister. Let me be honest now that we're on the topic. The military is a complete joke these days.

552
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:16,130
We have parents calling the base. Asking that we don't let their kids do anything difficult.

553
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:18,700
They label everything we do as abuse or a power trip.

554
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:22,700
People think the military is a school or something. The world's become a strange place.

555
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,100
Shut your mouth, you punk!

556
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,510
What are your thoughts, Hwa Yeong?

557
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:30,780
It seems that choosing the investigation team will be crucial.

558
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,580
The Corps' legal office has lost all trust with the people

559
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:36,370
due to the golfing incident with the judge advocates.

560
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:41,440
If the judge advocate corps pushes through and takes the case, they will face backlash.

561
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,540
But we can't let the prosecution or ROK Army Headquarters take charge either.

562
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:49,470
If the case is handed over to the prosecution or ROK Army Headquarters,

563
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:52,970
the military chief of staff who's hostile against Minister Lee Jae Sik will exert his power.

564
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:56,200
Since he might be leaving before he completes his term.

565
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,140
He'll uncover every speck of dirt on Hong Mu Seop.

566
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:03,680
Then there's only one path the minister can choose.

567
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,960
What do you think about forming a special investigation team

568
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:10,260
with the military prosecutors from my division for this case?

569
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,590
Your soldiers?

570
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:14,030
Do Bae Man and Cha Wu In?

571
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:17,200
I guess those two have a good public image.

572
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,960
But will you be able to keep them under your control, Division Commander?

573
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,130
Will that be necessary?

574
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:29,900
If all he did was have him run a few errands as he claims.

575
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:34,740
You. I'll ask you for the last time.

576
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:37,140
Are you sure there's no problem?

577
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,130
There is none, sir.

578
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:41,730
Good. Go with Division Commander No's plans then.

579
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:45,260
It's still a trial, so we'll have to be ready.

580
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:49,590
I will prepare both spear and shield with my people.

581
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:53,210
If the military prosecutors are the spear, then who's the shield?

582
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:56,260
CEO Yong Mun Gu is the perfect man for this.

583
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,660
CEO Yong?

584
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:04,050
That's an excellent idea.

585
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:06,880
He said he wouldn't go to court,

586
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,500
but he will if I tell him to.

587
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:12,120
Okay.

588
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:16,770
All right, Division Commander. I'm sure he'll listen to you.

589
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:19,810
Thanks.

590
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:24,400
That's all good. But make sure it's not obvious.

591
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,640
It's about time they call.

592
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,920
Chief Prosecutor Seo Ju Hyeok

593
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,060
Finally.

594
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:39,330
You still have your intuition.

595
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:44,510
We'll have to get back. It was nice taking a walk after a long time though.

596
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,360
Hurry up and pick up.

597
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,680
Do Bae Man. Come back to the legal office immediately. Right now!

598
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:56,280
This is a huge emergency. It's the biggest emergency ever!

599
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:00,070
Get Cha Wu In and come back quickly! Hurry up!

600
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:02,640
Yes, sir. Unity.

601
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,010
Let's go.

602
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:07,510
Okay.

603
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:14,230
The Ministry of Defense has formed a special investigation team...

604
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:16,590
to clear the people's suspicion.

605
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:21,650
We will thoroughly investigate the claims against Corps Commander Hong Mu Seop.

606
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:25,720
The special investigation...

607
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:29,040
will be done by Military Prosecutors Do Bae Man and Cha Wu In,

608
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,550
and also Staff Judge Advocate Seo Ju Hyeok from the 4th Division.

609
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:34,580
- They will be conducting the investigation. 
- The Minister.

610
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:38,260
- That is all. 
- He said my name.

611
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:43,100
This is a celebration. I need to celebrate.

612
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:46,040
This is an honor to my family.

613
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:48,920
- No.
- Unity.

614
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:54,080
This is a family crisis. A crisis to the nation.

615
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:04,650
The Minister of Defense openly stated your name to the entire public. Don't tell me you're going to refuse?

616
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:10,510
Oh, well. Starting from the division commander's son, battalion commander,

617
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:12,840
and now the corps commander.

618
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:16,150
Is this all really a coincidence?

619
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:21,140
Why is the Korean Military putting me through such hardship?

620
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:25,530
What about my future in the military?

621
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,730
But why isn't Do Bae Man here?

622
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:33,110
He went to go get documents from the Protectors of Military Human Rights.

623
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:36,710
He also said he'll be bringing over a special person who'll be joining our special investigation team.

624
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:40,930
What? He's going to bring someone in without my permission?

625
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:45,190
On who's accord? Who's?

626
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,280
- Unity.
- Yes. Unity.

627
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:51,590
Why did you come so late?

628
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:55,700
I'm Detective Do Su Kyeong.

629
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:59,600
We both failed to recognize each other at the press conference, so let's call it even.

630
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,790
Oh, okay.

631
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:05,160
Do Bae Man's aunt. No, I mean, Detective Do. What brings you here?

632
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:09,460
I'm thinking of running a joint investigation with the police since the public is watching closely.

633
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:14,630
It'll be difficult to punish the corps commander's little sister without the help of us police since she's a civilian.

634
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:16,580
It's the perfect scenario for her to cunningly get away with it.

635
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:22,180
Oh, right. It's hard to deal with a civilian in a military court.

636
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:25,920
According to Bae Man, you're a real man's man.

637
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,420
Let's get this done like pros.

638
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:32,270
Right. I'm a real man's man.

639
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:39,930
It's unacceptable that someone abuses their authority in this day and age.

640
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,960
Don't you think so?

641
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,660
Right, they shouldn't.

642
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:51,100
Ouch.

643
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,560
Okay.

644
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:02,840
I know you have nowhere to go. Stay here until the trial is over.

645
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:07,680
Don't worry. I won't be here.

646
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,550
You can stay alone.

647
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:11,040
Then what about you, Captain?

648
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,200
Oh? Are you worrying about me?

649
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:18,890
I didn't agree to this because of you.

650
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:22,100
So don't flatter yourself.

651
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,820
Okay, whatever the case,

652
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:28,780
thank you for making this decision. Go in.

653
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:50,810
Oh?

654
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:52,850
What brings you here at this hour?

655
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:55,590
I told Staff Sergeant Sin to sleep at my barrack.

656
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:59,590
I thought it'd be best for him to rest with all the reporters after him.

657
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:02,140
He's suffered a lot of abuse for a while.

658
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:04,540
Then you're going to stay here?

659
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:06,360
I have no other choice.

660
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:11,420
I have to work, so my aunt's place is too far. Plus, Bolt is here too.

661
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:13,330
Okay then.

662
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:18,280
Wait, you pulled an all-nighter here too?

663
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,650
Did you eat dinner?

664
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:21,580
Not yet.

665
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:25,390
I didn't eat yet either.

666
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,710
Is he sleeping?

667
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:44,900
Hey, this...

668
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:47,440
What's wrong?

669
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,000
You're pouring it like water. This is really expensive wine.

670
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,750
I drink this sometimes when I work overtime here.

671
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:56,790
Although it's my first time pairing it with instant noodles.

672
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:59,970
I guess you adapt to everything in the military.

673
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:04,710
Gosh, you can't hide the fact you're rich even if you try.

674
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:09,010
Drink up.
♫ I feel I am falling into a deep place ♫

675
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:12,650
♫ that I can't get out of ♫

676
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:16,390
I drank a lot of wine with Yong Mun Gu.

677
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:17,730
That's not all.

678
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:21,840
You can buy a winery with just the money you received from wine boxes.

679
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,520
Don't be harsh.

680
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:28,950
♫ to hold on the moments
which are becoming blurred one by one ♫

681
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:33,020
Gosh. Maybe it's because I'm drinking with no conditions,

682
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:35,920
it tastes different. I feel at ease.

683
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:40,150
♫ and keep them there ♫

684
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:44,140
♫ Dive in ♫

685
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:47,540
♫  With your strong arms ♫

686

♫ remove me from the approaching reality ♫

687
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:54,370
Aren't you going to eat?

688
00:50:54,370 --> 00:50:57,880
What?
♫ Hold Me ♫

689
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:02,740
I don't normally eat at night. It'll ruin my figure.

690
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:05,180
Then why did you make two?

691
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:07,570
Are you really not going to eat?

692
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:11,150
No.
♫ Will you hold my heart?♫

693
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:19,430
You won't gain weight if you burn everything off.

00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:30,620
♫ In the time which passed me like a blank ♫

695
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:34,480
You eat so well, Cha Wu In.

696
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,460
♫  Suddenly my forgotten childhood days♫

697
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,130
♫ and every day of my life♫

♫ Dive in♫

700
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:58,190
I know I hunt for you but you still have lots to learn from me about being a prosecutor.

701
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:00,570
Especially in court.

702
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:05,590
Do you feel awkward?

703
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:08,390
Why are you suddenly talking about work?

704
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:13,360
No, I'm just saying you can't win by just throwing facts at people.

705
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:18,360
You have to throw a curveball too. That's how you win.

706
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:21,440
You mean I should catch them off guard?

707
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,970
I'll try throwing it once during Hong Mu Seop's trial.

708
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:27,110
That curveball you're talking about.

709
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:31,590
Okay.

710
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:34,150
Kang Ha Jun

711
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:37,900
Hey. P-Put that on sp-speaker.

712
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:43,980
Hello, Wu In. I am sorry.

713
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:48,020
I didn't contact you because of a problem at the company.

714
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:51,850
I was going to call you anyway after I saw the article. Is everything okay?

715
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:53,590
What happened is—

716
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:57,560
What article? What's going on, CEO Kang?

717
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,670
Are you with Prosecutor Do right now?

718
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:01,190
Yes, I am.

719
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:04,750
What about the difficult file restoration I asked you to do?

720
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:08,600
It's going to take a while.

721
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,510
Take care of your company first.

722
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:14,870
I'll take care of this trial with Prosecutor Do.

723
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:16,960
You heard it! I'm busy now, so bye!

724
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,180
Kang Ha Jun

725
00:53:28,850 --> 00:53:31,450
CEO, I have to tell you something.

726
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:36,250
We're getting close to the people who spread false information that I told you about before.

727
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:45,250
Is he okay?

728
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:34,270
Let's start the abuse of authority case briefing.

729
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:37,980
This is a case where 4th Corps Commander Hong Mu Seop and his younger sister

730
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:42,140
abused a sergeant and used him for personal purposes.

731
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:45,310
Please turn the page.

732
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:52,700
Take one each and fill it in accurately.

733
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:57,880
Statement 1, 2: Corps Commander treated me like his family.
♫ All time which accumulated ♫

734
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:00,770
Statement 3,4: Corps Commander treated me like his family.
♫ made me as I am now ♫

735
00:55:00,770 --> 00:55:04,980
Ah, really.
♫ Now I came to know (I came)  ♫

736
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:07,510
They are all potential victims.

737
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:09,580
Please check the victim list once more.

738
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:13,890
♫ and set a fire in the depths of my heart ♫

739
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:16,230
- Does it make sense that they reported the abuse of power?
- That's what I' saying.

740
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:18,050
What the heck do they mean, their rights?

741
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:21,930
CEO Yong, please switch our lawyers.

742
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:24,350
May we see the CCTV footage?

743
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:26,180
Thank you.

744
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:31,370
♫ I'm constantly burning. I'll never turn off ♫

745
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:34,050
Now, we will listen to the victim's statement on the highest priority.

746
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:38,780
And we have a rigorous investigation underway to determine the heart of the matter.

747
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:40,990
Military Prosecutors Announce Interim Investigation Results of Investigation of Hong Mu Seop, Military Head.

748
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:45,970
We're looking to see if there are more victims, and we will put our best effort into securing the evidence.

749
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:48,810
Running Won Gi Chun's external hard drive...

750
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:50,140
Data Restoration Complete.

751
00:55:55,190 --> 00:56:00,780
Even when you framed Chairman Cha Ho Cheol. I stepped up and lied in court.

752
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:06,020
It was all solely for you, Division Commander. That's not all.

753
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:09,740
Twenty years ago. The accident you caused with the truck.

754
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:13,480
I'm talking about the accident where you crashed into the young soldier couple.

755
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,830
Don't brazenly pretend like you don't know!

756
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:18,320
I clearly remember it.

757
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:22,280
I think Wu In can take No Hwa Yeong to court with this.

758
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:28,690
Cha Wu In

759
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:39,310
Chairman, we're in big trouble!

760
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:42,860
CEO Kang Ha Jun.

761
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,100
What's the matter?

762
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,820
What are you doing?

763
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:48,240
We suspect the leakage of industrial technology.

764
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,540
Please cooperate.

765
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:51,810
Get started.

766
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:53,760
Get going!

767
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,190
Give that to me.

768
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,720
Do you want to be additionally charged?

769
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:33,840
CEO.

770
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:36,480
I don't know if I should tell you this in this situation,

771
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,250
it's about the organization that spread false information.

772
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:43,380
I might be wrong, but I suspect one place.

773
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:11,450
I think I know who the responsible culprit is.

774
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:16,090
Let's talk about it later.

775
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:17,980
Yes, CEO.

776
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:25,530
I am not doing this alone.

777
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:29,860
I'm being assisted by people close to me,

778
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:34,870
like your relationship with Cha Wu In.

779
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:41,950
We're the ones who bought all your shares at rock-bottom prices.

780
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:45,630
You know what that means, don't you?

781
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:50,150
Because you were next to Chairman Cha Ho Cheol and watched.

782
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:58,070
- Please get out.
- No, no.

783
00:58:58,070 --> 00:59:02,500
Sooner or later, the one who needs to get out later will be you, CEO Kang.

784
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,060
So what I mean is

785
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:12,940
five years ago when I first met Do Bae Man I said something to him.

786
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:17,160
I'll say it to you today.

787
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:23,560
Have you heard of an offer you can't refuse?

788
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,930

00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:48,480
Umm. Prosecutor Do.

792
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,350
What's up?

793
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:54,560
We have found a witness.

794
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:58,490
A decisive witness who can help us win this case.

795
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:01,140
What?

796
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:02,710
Who is that person?

797
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:04,740
Why didn't you tell me?

798
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:10,370
I didn't tell you in advance because I was afraid you might object.

799
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:12,670
Why would I oppose?

800
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:16,720
Actually, yesterday—

801
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:24,460
Your Honor is entering.

802
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:40,720
Your Honor, I'm applying for a witness.

803
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,890
A witness?

804
01:00:41,890 --> 01:00:46,000
To my knowledge, the prosecution didn't apply for a witness today.

805
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,320
The witness needed some time to decide whether to attend.

806
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,450
Defense attorney, what to you think?

807
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:55,040
Naturally, I object.

808
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,090
Let me be clear here.

809
01:00:57,090 --> 01:01:01,180
In the future we will agree only to witnesses we have agreed to previously.

810
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:04,790
There's nothing I can do about his opposition.

811
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:13,040
If you prevent this witness from testifying, the backlash will be huge.

812
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:16,030
You are saying something very dangerous.

813
01:01:16,030 --> 01:01:18,380
Just who is the witness?

814
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:23,420
What kind of obvious testimony will you offer from someone who worked so long ago at the official residence?

815
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:50,610
What is this?

816
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,330
Cha Wu In.

817
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:00,990
I'll become a monster.

818
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:05,480
I will step on men and climb to the top.

819
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:13,460
Your Honor. I am Division Commander No Hwa Yeong from the 4th Division.

820
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:18,380
The victim, Staff Sergeant Sin Min Cheol is one of my precious men in my division.

821
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:22,390
Please allow me to help my subordinate.

822
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:37,550
Military Prosecutor Do Bae Man

823
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:43,300
♫ No chance, you can't get away now ♫

824
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:48,270
♫ You are the prey in my hand ♫

825
01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:55,730
♫ Get out of my sight ♫

826
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:01,270
The military judge told me straight up...

827
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:02,520
You're going to do what you used to, right?

828
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,030
to take it easy on this case like I did last year.

829
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,430
I'm going to request that the judge to be recused.

830
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:07,760
You! Are you a soldier or a prosecutor?

831
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,320
No. Why should I be answering his auntie?

832
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:12,050
Because I was so afraid, there's something I didn't tell you.

833
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:14,020
You must make him pay for his crimes.

834
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:16,950
Sergeant Ahn, he is the son of the president of Gusan Bank.

835
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:19,550
I have a witness who can help you win. What do you think? Are you interested?

836
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:20,600
Are you done questioning the witness?

837
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,000
No, I am not!

838
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,910
The trial will flatly end.

839
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:28,080
From now on, you must leave the trial completely to me.

840
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:32,810
♫ Yeah I'm losing my mind. Don't know where to go now ♫

841
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:36,050
♫ Steeply rising breaths chasing me from behind. ♫
