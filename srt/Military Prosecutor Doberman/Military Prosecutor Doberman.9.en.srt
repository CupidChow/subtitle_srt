00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,550
♫ This time won't be the last ♫

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,970
♫ and same like that before ♫

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,890
♫ Cuz you know there's no way to stop ♫

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,650
♫ Feels like I'm losing control ♫

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,830
♫ My style without hesitation ♫

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,660
♫ You can't stop me ♫

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,010
Military Prosecutor Doberman

8
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,860
I'll start the interview. State your name, rank, and unit.

9
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,250
9 days earlier

10
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,900
I'm actually extremely curious about something else.

11
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,320
About Won Gi Chun's leg.

12
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,150
It was chopped off.

13
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,500
I chopped it off.

14
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,350
Are you saying you personally did it?

15
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,500
I didn't know you personally bloodied your hands.

16
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,670
This is totally unexpected.

17
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,520
It's my error for daring to think I knew you well.

18
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,490
It doesn't matter if my hands are blood stained because I just need to wash them.

19
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,350
It's way better than watching things go totally off-track.

20
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,270
- I should get going. I need to rest.
- There's something important to report.

21
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,560
- What is it?
- It's the identity of Cha Wu In.

22
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,730
You'll be surprised to hear it.

23
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,360
Will I?

24
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,850
She's the daughter of the late Cha Ho Cheol.

25
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,730
Did you think I wouldn't know until now?

26
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,620
From the day she became a military prosecutor,

27
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,080
that child could not even have imagined I've had her under surveillance.

28
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,510
Why have you just left her alone?

29
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,340
I've been waiting and watching first.

30
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,000
It's laughable to be focusing on a mere captain.

31
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,970
She's been continuously entwined with you

32
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,850
from Chairman No's trial and desertion to Lt. Colonel Won Gi Chun.

33
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:01,090
Moreover Cha Wu In is a military prosecutor who can prosecute members of the armed forces.

34
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,530
Do Bae Man is the same.

35
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,130
Do Bae Man, who was only chasing money,

36
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:11,360
changed completely after he met Cha Wu In.

37
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,220
I'm sure it's related to something.

38
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,610
You need to be wary of both of them.

39
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,580
It is you that I am really concerned about.

40
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,050
Now that you have learned Cha Wu In's identity.

41
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:28,010
There is a spy in close proximity to me now.

42
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:33,950
Can you properly manage IM Defense in my place?

43
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,420
Go for it.

44
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,780
Cha Wu In prepared for a long time to stand before you.

45
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,500
You should not underestimate her.

46
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,000
And now,

47
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,230
please call me the CEO of IM Defense.

48
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,120
I don't want to be a lawyer anymore.

49
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,740
Now that you have learned Cha Wu In's identity.

50
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,710
There is a spy in close proximity to me now.

51
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,730
Personal Details Report
Cha Wu In

52
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,950
Spy.

53
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,500
Did she feel Cha Wu In was a spy?

54
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,440
Cha Wu In

55
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,570
An unimaginable monster.
Episode 9

56
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:58,230
Because humans cannot accept that a human did something terrible,

57
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,890
they invented monsters and demons.

58
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,300
She cut off a normal leg.

59
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,800
No Hwa Yeong is a monster.

60
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,180
If we are dealing with a monster, we must strike the first blow.

61
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,380
CEO Kang, please call a press conference tomorrow.

62
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,020
A press conference?

63
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,690
Let's have public opinion erupt over the disclosure of the former sergeant.

64
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:23,020
Well, although evidence is important, we need evidence that will be a smoking gun.

65
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,180
Tomorrow Kim Han Yeong's brother's brain surgery will be performed.

66
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,620
Wait a sec, I've heard the brain surgery will be difficult because of the location of the shrapnel.

67
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,730
It was Dr. Cho Su Chan who made a diagnosis.

68
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,310
He is an accomplice to the fabricated Landmine Hero.

69
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,670
A wrong diagnosis.

70
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:43,400
It's possible to infer that the surgery was deliberately prevented to cover the truth.

71
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,780
He's a horrible doctor who even changed the CT scan.

72
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,690
There is an expert neurosurgeon who will perform the surgery.

73
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,540
Will Prosecutor Do meet with Kim Han Yong and get his consent?

74
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,190
Is it true?

75
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,480
Can they really operate on Hyeong? Really?

76
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,060
It's a surgery to extract what is lodged in the brain,

77
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,650
so you can imagine the possible bad effects.

78
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,070
Giving consent is entirely up to you.

79
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,000
- I know it's not an easy decision.
- No.

80
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,200
The decision is made by Hyeong.

81
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:26,700
Hyeong always told me to make a decision if I have 1% courage.

82
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,280
It might be just 1%,

83
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,780
but that's a very different choice from doing nothing.

84
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:37,030
That's also why I fired the gun in the bookstore that day.

85
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,410
- Did you meet Kim Han Yong?
- Yeah.

86
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,830
May we proceed with the surgery?

87
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,330
Let's not do it with a 1% chance,

88
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,930
but let's do it with 1% courage.

89
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:09,410
- Pardon?
- That's what Kim Han Yong said.

90
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,290
Is that so?

91
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,890
This time, for Kim Han Yong's older brother's sake,

92
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:18,200
we must find the truth underlying the Won Gi Chun incident.

93
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,400
Yes. We must do it for Kim Han Yong who made a difficult decision, as well.

94
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,090
We must find the evidence and hit No Hwa Yeong really hard.

95
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:32,950
Wait a sec. Switch to video mode.

96
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,430
What? Suddenly...

97
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,610
Is something going on?

98
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,230
Come here. Come here.

99
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,430
- Isn't that Bolt?
- Yes.

100
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,590
I had no choice but to take charge of him. That CEO Kang.

101
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:56,280
Even so, I was a bit bothered about him, and I am relieved to see him there.

102
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,500
What is it?

103
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,850
That is...

104
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,160
Tomorrow there will be both Kim Han Yeong's brother's surgery

105
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,390
and Sergeant Gu's press conference. It'll be an important day.

106
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:23,920
Whether we turn the situation around or the situation upends us,

107
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,460
it will be a decisive battle day.

108
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,980
Yes.

109
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,970
Then, I'll go to bed now.

110
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:37,420
- Sweet dreams.
- Sleep well, Pro Cha.

111
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,380
Ah, that rude brat.

112
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:47,250
Come here. Let's sleep. There, there.

113
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,790
Is this east. This way?

114
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,070
Come here.

115
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,900
Bolt. Come up. Don't you want to?

116
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,620
Okay, let's go. What am I doing here?

117
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,430
Let's go. Bolt.

118
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,500
Let's go.

119
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,100
Hey. This is breaking into a house.

120
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,020
In addition, this the home of an organized crime detective.

121
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,200
This is the house where I lived with my beloved aunt.

122
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,580
Why should I suffer outside?

123
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,030
Soybean paste soup! Auntie, hold on to him.

124
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:33,580
I knew home-cooked meals even without side dishes are the best.

125
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,480
I'm starving.

126
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,410
Auntie.

127
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,400
Please wash his feet.

128
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,550
The dog is startled.

129
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:48,220
You're really good at cooking stuff like this.

130
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,820
I was lonely.

131
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:59,950
I found a witness to the Won Gi Chun incident.

132
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,720
We'll drop a bomb at a press conference tomorrow.

133
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,880
You were already disciplined. Will you be okay?

134
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,210
I want to see them face-to-face at the press conference.

135
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,380
You know I am a fighter.

136
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,530
Once I bite, I'm a fighter who never lets go.

137
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,960
And I am a witness.

138
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,750
The only witness to Dad and Mom's accident.

139
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:31,010
Bae Man, do you believe there was really another reason

140
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:34,030
for the accident twenty years ago?

141
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,730
Yes.

142
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,050
I'm certain.

143
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,530
The moment I get a search warrant for Won Gi Chun's home,

144
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,550
for me that will be the real start.

145
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,220
Start?

146
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:02,150
The person who created the Landmine Hero is No Hwa Yeong, but there's no physical evidence.

147
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,480
We have nothing but our suspicion.

148
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,950
That's why I am going to interrogate him.

149
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,200
Interrogation in a hospital room...

150
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,890
I resent my confinement.

151
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,440
You're alone so be extra careful.

152
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,340
It's okay to fail.

153
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,620
Because the second purpose is the real one.

154
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,390
I'm going to make a real landmine for the Landmine Hero.

155
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,600
If he steps on it, it will explode right away.

156
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,140
You bastard.

157
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,610
Why is someone who is being disciplined coming here?

158
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,890
I came to visit you.

159
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,020
Oh. Unity.

160
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,310
It's been months since you had the accident

161
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,880
but you still haven't adjusted to it.

162
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,180
You're like a guy whose leg was amputated the other day.

163
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,310
What?

164
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,900
You decline a nurse and take painkillers on your own.

165
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,850
I guess you must have a lot to hide.

166
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:21,130
Actually, you're the star of a show that someone else scripted,

167
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,840
so there's nothing else you can do.

168
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,760
But the problem is that

169
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,130
if you followed the script as it was written, you thought

170
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,070
the show would become a success, but from some point

171
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:34,130
it has become a horrible reality.

172
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,390
You don't need to act the hero now

173
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,220
since you became a real hero.

174
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,180
Today I will bring the curtain down on that show.

175
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,660
What bullshit are you spouting? Get out of here!

176
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,460
There was a witness that day.

177
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:57,370
He clearly saw you mistakenly shoot the search company commander.

178
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,020
You bastard, I'm asking who you are!

179
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,230
Today Sergeant Gu will expose everything at a press conference.

180
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,100
Expose?

181
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,510
What will happen if you scripted this by yourself?

182
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:30,900
You cut off your own leg and you fabricated the hero story.

183
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:37,140
This morning you will fall from national hero to national nutcase.

184
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,740
Actually, you're only guilty of doing what she ordered you to do.

185
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,250
She also amputated your leg.

186
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:55,110
She is the planner and perpetrator of the incident. You are the victim.

187
00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:00,380
Our lieutenant colonel just... just couldn't help it and was forced to play along.

188
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,620
So just say one thing.

189
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,660
Whether it's her name, rank, or position.

190
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,830
Then I'll treat you nicely with a plea bargain.

191
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,440
Defendant agrees to plead guilty in return for a more lenient sentence.

192
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,220
No... (Her name)

193
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,770
No...

194
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,480
N..

195
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,230
Knock before entering. Knock.
( T/N: Beginning of Korean word for "knock" is syllable "no")

196
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,460
Get out immediately. Throw this bastard out.

197
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,460
Please leave.

198
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:35,880
You've missed your chance.

199
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:41,560
Then I will have to summon Lt. Colonel Won. I will return with an arrest warrant.

200
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,060
Unity.

201
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,020
The person who made the decision was No Hwa Yeong.

202
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,160
Actually, you're the star of a show that someone else scripted,

203
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,410
so there's nothing else you can do.

204
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:23,500
What? Show? Do Bae Man, you're the crazy one.

205
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,720
Do you think I'll even blink at what you say?

206
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:33,040
I am a hero. I am a real hero!

207
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,590
General No Hwa Yeong

208
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:50,450
I'll give you a report on the progress of the military corruption investigation you ordered the other day.

209
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:56,500
According to the investigation, we've confirmed that supplies that were supplied to some of our 4th Division, the active wear...

210
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,890
- active wear...

211
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:05,640
quantity of 257 and the berets...

212
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,880
quantity of 419

213
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,570
were substandard.

214
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:17,700
The company bribed the quartermaster.

215
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:25,920
- I'm in a meeting now.
- General, Do Bae Man

216
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,470
I think Do Bae Man knows everything.

217
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:31,800
There is a witness from our search squad.

218
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,620
They've called a press conference today

219
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,400
and will expose everything. Once it explodes,

220
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,300
I will die.

221
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,840
I'll talk to you later.

222
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,390
General. General.

223
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:51,270
I think Do Bae Man knows you amputated my leg.

224
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,910
All right.

225
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,150
- Continue.
- Yes, ma'am.

226
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:04,300
The back-scratching collusion between vendors and the quartermasters of some units—

227
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:08,680
The guys who pay money and the guys who accept it.

228
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,790
Make the rest of your report later. You are dismissed.

229
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:15,340
Yes, yes, ma'am. Unity.

230
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:28,340
Nice timing! Yes.

231
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,630
The phone saved me. It saved me.

232
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,480
I didn't prepare the rest of the information. It was like a bolt from the blue.

233
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,100
Nice timing.

234
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,440
Today as well, I've loosely taken care of things.

235
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,330
The clock at the Ministry of Defense works even if you hang it upside down.

236
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,120
Oh, yes!

237
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:51,110
But, what's going on with the Division Commander?

238
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:54,990
I could feel it. She became...

239
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,960
Anyway, nice timing.

240
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,030
This jump rope, where is he?

241
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:07,690
Without Do Bae Man, there's no one to massage me.

242
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,390
If you're suspended, you should stay at your place.

243
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,940
Why are you here? Leave immediately.

244
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,700
I have a report to give you on search squadron commander Won Gi Chun.

245
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,950
While you are suspended, are you itching to do that?

246
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,160
I let it slide today because I'm in the good mood.

247
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,560
Why are you stopping the Ministry of Defense's clock?

248
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,560
Search squad commander Won Gi Chun shot one of his own men in "friendly fire."

249
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,430
What grudge do you bear against Commander Won?

250
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:44,070
It wasn't a landmine he was involved in. He was involved in friendly fire.

251
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,660
Stop spewing nonsense.

252
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,700
The aftermath of friendly fire is much more serious.

253
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:54,100
He even got a military doctor to collude with him. Doing this is impossible without the involvement of superiors.

254
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:58,280
What? Collusion? Intervention of superiors?

255
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,250
You're so far out of line.

256
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,060
Shall I draw a red line and have you discharged from the army?

257
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,270
Say the word. I'm going to get you out of here immediately.

258
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,730
You need to issue a warrant to arrest Won Gi Chun.

259
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,890
What?

260
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,560
A warrant? A warrant.

261
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,300
Sure. Fine.

262
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:20,130
I tell you my decision as head of the legal office. Pay attention, Cha Wu In.

263
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:23,030
The justification and necessity for an arrest warrant on a major crime

264
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,990
beyond a reasonable doubt cannot be acknowledged.

265
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,440
- Understand?
- Chief.

266
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,400
Cha Wu In, you're a very good student with a bias to jumping to a conclusion.

267
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,570
If a prosecutor can accuse a culprit without evidence,

268
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:37,270
when you investigate, anyone without exception can become a culprit.

269
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:42,950
That's why people curse the prosecution.

270
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:48,280
My report which you won't consider reading is something you won't listen to.

271
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,490
You...

272
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,580
Get out of my sight. Scram.

273
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:58,330
All right. However, I clearly gave you a chance.

274
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,210
What? Chance?

275
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:10,190
In a half hour, a member of the search party in the minefield will make a declaration of conscience.

276
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,910
What?

277
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:19,830
Sergeant Gu Hyeon Seok, the only witness to Won Gi Chun's friendly fire,

278
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:23,360
will tell the truth before the entire country.

279
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,160
When the Landmine Hero's fraud is revealed, the entire country will be in an uproar.

280
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,870
You will be solely responsible for the messed up investigation.

281
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,920
Why me?

282
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:41,120
You declined the chance I offered you.

283
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,060
You always told me to be a soldier rather than a prosecutor, didn't you?

284
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:50,400
Yes. Right now, at this moment, I am a soldier.

285
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,810
A soldier may break but he won't bend.

286
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,830
Cha Wu In, stop right there.

287
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,530
I will ask one last time.

288
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:07,310
Please issue a warrant for Won Gi Chun's arrest and let me return to my work.

289
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:11,140
Please ask the army yourself to release Captain Do Bae Man from the disciplinary action.

290
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,360
You are asking for a lot of conditions.

291
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,250
Make your decision. You're running out of time.

292
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:22,180
All right. I'll decide after the press conference.

293
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,120
All right.

294
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,320
Wait, I might end up getting implicated.

295
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:43,820
Press Conference: Truth Behind Battalion Commander Won Gi Chun's DMZ Landmine Accident

296
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,620
There are a lot of reporters. You will be doing it, right?

297
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:01,210
Yes. I will be there in a few minutes, Mr. Prosecutor.

298
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,930
Oh, your voice sounds good. You seem to be completely different from yesterday.

299
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:09,020
Today, I will think unconditionally about my company commander.

300
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:13,020
He must be in surgery now. I hope it is successful.

301
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:23,360
What's the matter? Is something happening?

302
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,050
Bang.

303
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,700
It's the Battalion Commander.

304
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,670
What should I do?

305
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,200
Don't hang up.

306
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,830
Okay.

307
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,550
Military Prosecutor.

308
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,310
Sergeant Gu

309
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:14,800
We're all waiting. Are you not going to begin?

310
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,280
Oh, let me just finish up this call. Just a moment.

311
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,340
Sergeant Gu

312
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,170
The receiver cannot be reached. You will be directed to voicemail.

313
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,100
Do Bae Man

314
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,450
Press Conference: Truth Behind Battalion Commander Won Gi Chun's DMZ Landmine Accident

315
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,240
The receiver cannot be reached. You will be directed to voicemail.

316
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:54,830
The receiver cannot be reached. You will be directed to voicemail.

317
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:58,380
I'm going to have to go outside.

318
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,210
- What?
- I can't get in touch with Prosecutor Do.

319
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:04,460
I think there's an issue at the press conference site.

320
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:11,230
Section Chiefs Yun and Ahn. Can you help me out?

321
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:17,000
This is a job for your alter ego, the Redhead, right?

322
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,820
You knew about it?

323
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:24,660
I get a little tense whenever I see a redhead out on the streets.

324
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:29,340
Don't worry. I only wear it when I go hunting.

325
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,320
Oh, hunting.

326
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:37,140
4th Division

327
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,400
What are you doing? Don't you see her coughing?

328
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,290
I'm sorry. Feel better, Section Chief Ahn.

329
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,710
- Have a good day. Unity.
- Unity.

330
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,190
Let them through.

331
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,450
4th Division

332
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,190
- Good job, Prosecutor.
- Nice one.

333
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,520
- Gosh, what the hell?
- Darn it.

334
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,490
I'm already swamped as is.

335
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,020
- Completely wasted my time.
- Sergeant Gu will arrive soon. It'll only be a moment.

336
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,020
- Gosh.
- It's clear. Either he changed his mind,

337
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,810
or he went off the grid.

338
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:20,350
How do you plan to have a press conference? Out of my way!

339
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,960
- Reporter.
- Just let me go.

340
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,080
You're the military prosecutor who got punished.

341
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,790
How can we trust you?

342
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:30,150
Sergeant Gu? Where are you?

343
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:33,920
I told you not to take that road. There's always a traffic jam.

344
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:39,380
Go straight 50m more, then you'll see another road to your 1 o'clock...

345
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,640
What did you say? There's bigger news?

346
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,170
Prosecutor. Take this.

347
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,340
What's Sergeant Gu saying?

348
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:52,010
Yes. Gosh, not there.

349
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:54,130
Please sit down. I'll bring him in.

350
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,000
Yes.

351
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,020
Yes, take a right from there.

352
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:02,820
Sergeant Gu took the wrong turn. But that's not the problem.

353
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,050
Apparently, he has even bigger news.

354
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,830
- Bigger?
- Yes.

355
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,840
- What is it?
- It'll be exclusive news.

356
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,330
- Are you sure?
- It's an exclusive one.

357
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,650
Sit down. I'm certain. Just sit.

358
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,420
Detective Do Su Kyeong

359
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:22,120
Prosecutor Cha. It's me.

360
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,560
Won Gi Chun got a hold of Sergeant Gu midway.

361
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,920
I knew it was him.

362
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,390
I got out of the base and am heading over now.

363
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:32,010
What? How did you know?

364
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:36,390
Wait, more importantly, how did you get out?

365
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:44,890
I guess you found a way. I'll get to Sergeant Gu, you—

366
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:48,820
No. I'll send over Sergeant Gu without a scratch. Just give me the location.

367
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,290
Keep the reporters there.

368
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,390
It's an order.

369
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:00,330
It's a special order from the Landmine Hero,

370
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:03,730
so I specifically chose ex-special forces guys.

371
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,830
They'll keep you well protected.

372
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:10,290
Thank CEO Yong for me.

373
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:26,200
You would dare to expose me? I was your superior!

374
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,280
This is mutiny, you bastard!

375
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,670
I'm not a soldier anymore.

376
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:34,450
I'm not your subordinate!

377
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:37,280
I'm going to tell them everything.

378
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:41,280
Everything that I saw. I'll tell it all!

379
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,560
You received money from Do Bae Man, didn't you?

380
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,270
How dare you challenge me!

381
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:49,710
Don't strain your body like that.

382
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,730
There's a way we deal with punks like this.

383
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:57,320
One video call with his family will change his mind.

384
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,700
Oh, man. You were on a call.

385
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,160
This situation has broadcast in real time.

386
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,280
Military Prosecutor Do Bae Man

387
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,820
This is all because of the unlimited data network operators offer.

388
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,750
There's only one thing we can do to a punk who's lost all sense of fear.

389
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:16,530
Boys. Don't just stand there.

390
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:47,010
What the hell? You're a girl?

391
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:50,720
- Gun!
- It's a gun!

392
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,690
Get out.

393
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,110
- No!
- Get him.

394
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:03,200
You'll see a car outside. Leave right away.

395
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,850
- What?
- Don't dilly-dally. Leave immediately, okay?

396
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:09,520
You've got many people waiting on you.

397
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,300
Close the door as you leave.

398
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,160
Hey!

399
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,750
- Hyungnim!
- Are you okay, Hyungnim?

400
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:20,020
- Wait, it was a BB gun?
- What?

401
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,710
What?

402
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:26,590
Go! Get her!

403
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:32,030
Operating Room

404
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,160
Operating Room

405
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:53,950
♫ Hey, watch out y'all. I'm a little out of control ♫

406
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:57,960
♫ Just follow, me follow on my roll ♫

407
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,190
♫ Even if I hide it. It's an obvious trick to me ♫

408
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:05,080
♫ Your joker better be up high. Cuz I'm the queen in flush alright ♫

409
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,110
♫ I'm going to bark viciously ♫

410
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,290
♫ Get out of my way please, please, please ♫

411
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:10,820
♫ See? See? It's useless ♫

412
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,990
♫ I'll teach you a lesson, more, more, more ♫

413
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,190
♫ I'm on my way ♫

414

♫ All sorts of things, Mayday Oh ♫

415
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,280
♫ See? See? It's useless. ♫

416
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,610
♫ I'll teach you a lesson, more, more, more ♫

417
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,710
♫ I'm on my way ♫

418
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:24,160
♫ All sorts of things, Mayday Oh ♫

419
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,960
♫ Step out of my zone. My ♫

420
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,930
♫ My zone. My zone. ♫

421
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,640
Sergeant Gu!

422
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,280
Are you okay?

423
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:42,060
Let's go.

424
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:45,860
Those of you who are busy can leave now.

425
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:49,000
But if you leave now, you'll miss on exclusive news.

426
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,860
Do you not know who Prosecutor Do Bae Man is?

427
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,520
Do you remember the press conference for the soldier who received the emperor's treatment?

428
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,730
He's a bag full of exclusive news.

429
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:58,340
If you go now, you will regret it.

430
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,160
Ajumma!

431
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:05,520
- Ajumma?
- Yes, you, standing there.

432
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,880
Hey. How much money did you get for this? You shouldn't do this.

433
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,490
I know you're all busy. Please leave.

434
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:16,760
- This press conference is canceled.
- Canceled? No, it's not!

435
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,230
- It's canceled!
- No, it's not!

436
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:21,180
- Go back to work!
- Did you say I got paid?

437
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:25,660
I'm Detective Do Su Gyeong from Gangnam Police.

438
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:31,980
There's something fishy about your face. You're not a reporter, right? Show me your press card.

439
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,920
Your face doesn't look normal either. It's suspicious.

440
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:40,630
Why is a detective at a military case?

441
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:46,550
Also, it's already been proven in military court.

442
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:49,660
The prosecutor who broke his prosthetic leg received punishment too.

443
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,570
Fine!

444
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:57,200
That military prosecutor is my nephew. Are you happy now?

445
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,530
N-Nephew?

446
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,720
- Hello.
- Just wait and see.

447
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,160
My nephew will reveal the truth on this case no matter what.

448
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,050
He's as tenacious as a Doberman.

449
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:19,120
You see? I was right, wasn't I?

450
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,050
Competent Security, Strong National Defense

451
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:28,520
Press Conference: Truth Behind Battalion Commander Won Gi Chun's DMZ Landmine Accident

452
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:43,130
I recently got discharged from 4th Division's Reconnaissance Battalion.

453
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,830
My name is Gu Hyeon Seok.

454
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,730
I came to expose the truth about the Mine Hero story here—

455
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:52,700
Forget it. You were late to the press conference.

456
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:57,500
How do you expect us to trust and write a news report about a person who didn't keep the most basic common courtesy?

457
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,830
I mean, it's been ages since the mine exploded.

458
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:02,490
What's your reason to clear your conscience now?

459
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:06,030
Do you have an ulterior motive?

460
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,320
Prosecutor.

461
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,580
I did it because I was scared.

462
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:25,590
The fact that I was the only one who saw him get shot...

463
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:28,350
I was terrified.

464
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,930
Company Commander!

465
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,230
I was about to get discharged, but if I reported that incident...

466
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:46,490
I thought I'd disappear without getting to see my mom's face again.

467
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:50,320
If I still do nothing, it will end.

468
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,950
I thought I should bury everything in the military before I left.

469
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:05,200
Yes. I turned the other way and stayed silent for my sake.

470
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:09,760
However! The one who should've been punished became a hero.

471
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:15,190
The image of the company commander getting shot wouldn't leave my head.

472
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:19,970
I left the letter in the hospital room to alleviate some of my guilt.

473
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,950
Also.

474
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:30,780
And Prosecutor Do Bae Man gave me courage.

475
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:36,630
Is there any evidence you want to show us?

476
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,040
Press Conference: Truth Behind Battalion Commander Won Gi Chun's DMZ Landmine Accident

477
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,540
I'm Military Prosecutor Do Bae Man in 4th Infantry Division of Army.

478
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,550
I'll make a statement from now on.

479
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:56,400
First, I'll show the evidence as an answer to the question.

480
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,670
It wasn't shrapnel but a bullet?

481
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:15,510
This is the bullet that came out of the company commander's head from his surgery just now.

482
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:18,480
- What?
- For real?

483
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,020
As a military prosecutor, I can tell you with my naked eye,

484
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:25,390
that it's not shrapnel from a landmine but a bullet.

485
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:29,930
Of course, we'll release the credibility of the evidence after it's been thoroughly examined.

486
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:35,720
Also, the company commander's brain surgery was a success.

487
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:43,080
Once he recovers, he will be able to testify about the incident and live a normal life.

488
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,460
Could you explain about the leg then?

489
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:50,130
Why does Battalion Commander Won Gi Chun not have a leg?

490
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:52,690
I was waiting for this question.

491
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:55,900
Did he cut his leg off himself to complete the hero scenario?

492
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,430
Or is there someone else behind him?

493
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:05,150
We confirmed that he abducted Sergeant Gu who was heading to the press conference.

494
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:08,040
He was trying to stop the truth from being revealed.

495
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,300
♫ This time won't be the last  ♫

496
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,280
♫ and same like that before ♫

497
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:16,180
♫ Do whatever you want. Yeah I don't care ♫

498
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:19,300
There's definitely someone behind this.

499
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:23,170
This isn't a simple case where the Landmine Hero self-fabricated a story.

500
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:25,720
It's only a preview of an enormous gate.

501
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:31,210
♫ Feels like I'm losing control ♫

502
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,590
Also, I would like to make a request to Corps Commander Hong Mu Seop.

503
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:41,780
Please void the discipline Military Prosecutor Cha Wu In and I received in order to re-investigate this case.

504
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,930
Unity.

505
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:46,540
♫ Feels like I'm losing control ♫

506
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:50,320
♫ Even if you try hard, it won't make any difference ♫

507
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,910
♫ No chance, you can't get away now ♫

508
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:59,500
♫ You can't find your way out. You are the prey in my hand ♫

509
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:06,680
♫ Get out of my way  ♫

510
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:11,870
Who are you, you wench? Don't come near me! Stay away.

511
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:21,640
It was No Hwa Yeong's doing, wasn't it? The one who cut off your leg.

512
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:28,400
It was also No Hwa Yeong who told you to frame Chairman Cha Ho Cheol to chase him out.

513
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,060
Who are you?

514
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:33,010
Why don't you take a guess.

515
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:37,330
Are you going to hurt someone with a disability—

516
00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:03,730
Next time we meet, I'll clearly let you know who I am.

517
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:25,080
This is the bullet that came out of the company commander's head from his surgery just now.

518
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:32,440
As a military prosecutor, I can tell you with my naked eye, that it's not shrapnel from a landmine but a bullet.
[Minister Lee Jae Sik]

519
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:41,280
- Yes, Minister.
- Did I make a mistake by giving you that position?

520
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,270
Now when things with your son are under control, your subordinate is causing trouble.

521
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:50,790
I don't know if you have what it takes to be a division commander. I'm very doubtful of your ability now.

522
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:52,660
I trust Lieutenant Colonel Won.

523
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,980
How can you say that after watching the press conference?

524
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:58,340
If the superior can't trust their subordinate, who will?

525
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,300
- What?
- Sergeant Gu.

526
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,760
He's been bought out by Do Bae Man who's unhappy about his punishment.

527
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,910
What about the accidental shooting and bullet from the surgery?

528
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:12,470
You know that a military prosecutor can blow things out of proportion and plant evidence.

529
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:13,740
Shut your mouth, you punk!

530
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:16,740
I'm going to gather the members of the Patriotic Society tomorrow.

531
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:20,640
Stay right there and prepare to report on how to counter this.

532
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,330
I really will not let it slide this time. Do you understand?

533
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:38,310
That crazy redheaded wench. Who is she? What's her identity?

534
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:42,550
How does she know everything? Tell me!

535
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:45,250
You should talk! What in the world are you talking about right now?

536
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:48,490
I did everything you asked me.

537
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,010
I even sacrificed my leg for you.

538
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:58,250
I pretended to play dead if you told me to die. I was your dog for twenty years!

539
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:04,790
Calm yourself down. I have a plan.

540
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:10,250
Even when you framed Chairman Cha Ho Cheol. I stepped up and lied in court.

541
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:15,760
It was all solely for you, Division Commander. That's not all.

542
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,350
Twenty years ago. The accident you caused with the truck.

543
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:23,770
I'm talking about the accident where you crashed into the young soldier couple.

544
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:28,820
Don't brazenly pretend like you don't know! I clearly remember it.

545
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:37,330
Do Bae Man told me this. I am only guilty of following your orders for which I had no choice.

546
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:45,300
You'd better stop right there. Your fate will change the moment you cross the line.

547
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:56,160
Here. I crossed the line. What will you do now?

548
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:07,630
I really stepped on a landmine now. I won't blow myself up. I'm saying I won't go down alone.

549
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:11,870
I prepared myself with insurance for this situation.

550
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,180
You ungrateful punk.

551
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:26,400
You, No Hwa Yeong, Corps Commander Hong Mu Seop, and Minister Lee Jae Sik. I have a bomb that'll blow all of you up.

552
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:32,520
Your fates are now in my hand.

553
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:39,740
So rack your brain and find a way to save me right away. Have you got it?

554
00:41:56,690 --> 00:42:01,170
Legal Division Chief. Come to my office immediately.

555
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,840
Unity.

556
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:19,660
Proceed with Reconnaissance Battalion Commander Won Gi Chun's arrest.

557
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:25,760
I know it's inevitable right now because of the situation. But I'm worried this might affect you negatively—

558
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,890
Lieutenant Colonel Won confessed to me just now. He said he fabricated everything.

559
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:35,780
Oh, everything from the press conference was true.

560
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:41,120
He said he would cooperate with the investigation, but asked he could retain his last remaining pride as a soldier.

561
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:46,550
I understand, Ma'am. I will see that he's arrested with minimal staff tomorrow morning.

562
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:51,890
Also, regarding Captain Do Bae Man and Cha Wu In's discipline.

563
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:54,340
Regardless of the arrest, their discipline is still valid.

564
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:58,420
Well, the thing is... you see...

565
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,840
Stop dawdling and say it.

566
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,640
Yes, ma'am. Their punishment has already been lifted.

567
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:08,520
- What?
- Corps Commander Hong Mu Seop issued the orders himself.

568
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,640
Corps Commander didn't run it by me?

569
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:15,850
Right. He personally came to the legal office and issued the order.

570
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:20,840
He said Captain Do Bae Man and Cha Wu In should be rewarded, not punished.

571
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:25,470
I think he couldn't ignore the public's opinion from the press conference.

572
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:26,840
I understand. You can leave.

573
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,910
Yes, ma'am. I will execute it as you commanded.

574
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:32,600
Unity.

575
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:49,570
We'll get an arrest warrant tomorrow morning.

576
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:51,910
He'll be banned from leaving the country too.

577
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:53,290
Yes, sir.

578
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:57,850
I know your punishment has been lifted, but send Section Chief Ahn or Yun to the scene instead.

579
00:43:57,850 --> 00:43:59,810
I will do that, sir.

580
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,150
Oh, I'm very upset that you violated my orders and went off base during probation.

581
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:10,830
But I guess I can't do anything about it since you got good results.

582
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:15,280
I'm glad that you trusted me and nothing happened to you, sir.

583
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,140
That's all thanks to me being flexible.

584
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:23,780
Let me tell you this.

585
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:27,800
I could've stopped the press conference at any time but—

586
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,730
I'll see you tomorrow.

587
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,520
Oh, okay.

588
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:38,030
That little punk.

589
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:49,230
Section Chief Yun Sang Gi and Ahn Yu Ra left.

590
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:52,880
We'll finally be able to reveal who was behind the Mine Hero case.

591
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,520
But I feel like No Hwa Yeong gave up too easily.

592
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,870
The fact that she ordered the arrest herself makes me agree with you.

593
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:06,000
What if she didn't give up,

594
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,410
but she cut herself out of the situation?

595
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:17,220
Military Police

596
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:23,430
It seems like he's inside.

597
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:25,340
It seems so.

598
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,020
Just enter?

599
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:34,440
As to making my face, with which I punished the military prosecutors, be crumpled like paper,

600
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,270
well, since I'm very understanding, I let it pass.

601
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:38,770
If the Won Gi Chun situation

602
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:40,810
blew up at the same time as her son's trial—

603
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:43,030
She should vacate her position immediately!

604
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:46,510
The superior should be completely responsible for the actions of her subordinate.

605
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:49,350
She herself said this many times.

606
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:54,350
She dishonored the position of division commander which the Minister's grace bestowed on her.

607
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:58,920
At the time there weren't just a few male generals who left in protest.

608
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:05,100
I am concerned that the criticism will be pointlessly transferred to the minister.

609
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,610
That's correct, Minister.

610
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:09,930
So, should I fire the division commander?

611
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:14,170
She is currently endangering our Patriotic Society.

612
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:19,280
I'll follow whatever the superiors decide.

613
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,920
Division Commander! Didn't we tell you to take counter measures?

614
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,220
Speak up!

615
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:28,150
If you order me to, I will follow your order

616
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:31,760
to give up my uniform.

617
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:38,230
I mean, I will have no regret or fear about accepting responsibility.

618
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:43,790
However, let me tell you clearly.

619
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:51,340
The full account of the case hasn't been revealed yet

620
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:53,510
but is sticking a knife in the back of a subordinate or colleague who is in trouble esprit de corps?

621
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:56,260
No Hwa Yeong, are you insane?

622
00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:00,360
You ass. How can you be looking at your superiors like that?

623
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:04,010
Unity!

624
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:07,450
Umm. General, I have something urgent to report!

625
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:08,800
Speak.

626
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,880
Search Battalion Commander Won Gi Chun is dead.

627
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,750
Are you sure?

628
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:16,820
I am sure. Military investigators just verified it.

629
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:17,940
What caused his death?

630
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:21,000
We are checking. We assume it is suicide.

631
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,400
A handgun which belonged to him was found at the scene.

632
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:32,900
It's been more than a week since the death of Lt. Colonel Won Gi Chun,

633
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:35,610
who became famous as a Landmine Hero but was later revealed to be acting in a drama he created.

634
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:38,290
While no signs of homicide were found in the first three days of investigation

635
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:42,380
because of the bereaved family's opposition, no autopsy was performed and

636
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:46,530
it was revealed that there was only a visual inspection of the corpse.

637
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:51,180
The person I am introducing today is a Doberman-like icon of justice who never lets go once he sinks his teeth into something.

638
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:54,060
That dog-like ass**** Do Bae Man.

639
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:57,770
The day I get out, I will kill you.

640
00:48:57,770 --> 00:49:00,060
He is Military Prosecutor Do Bae Man.
[Military Prosecutor Do Bae Man, uncovering the truth in the mystery!]

641
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,060
Thanks to him...

642
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:03,230
New recruits are not allowed to watch tv.

643
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:05,770
The mystery could remain unsolved forever...

644
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:09,520
Be sure not to touch the remote control.

645
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:16,740
By the way, you know I'm your direct superior, don't you?

646
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:17,940
Pardon?

647
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:20,990
This is a present for my direct subordinate.

648
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:22,180
What is this?

649
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:24,680
It's my soldier's notebook. I memorized the whole thing.

650
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:28,010
Because I wrote everything down: superiors' names and their military service numbers, the ranges of the guns, financial resources,

651
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:30,800
and even the assigned Jindo dogs' ranks.

652
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,400
Be able to memorize everything in a week.

653
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,900
Do I have to memorize all of this? I mean I don't even know my own military service number.

654
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:41,800
Would you like me to give you a tip on doing well in the army?

655
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,450
Don't stand out. Don't ever stand out.

656
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:47,360
Then military life will be very easy.

657
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:52,010
Follow me. I'll teach you properly.

658
00:49:56,150 --> 00:50:00,300
Don't wear double field jacket liners. Don't tuck your field jacket liner out of your pants.

659
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,530
Don't watch tv while cleaning and taking care of firearms.

660
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:05,830
Don't lean on your locker. Don't polish your combat boots.

661
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:09,930
Don't go to bed without organizing your shoes nicely.

662
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:12,600
All this is prohibited until you are a corporal.

663
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:16,850
It's possible to put a towel around your neck when you are a corporal.

664
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:21,500
What's the alternative to your saying "don't", "don't."

665
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,890
What about the cell phone? Can I use it?

666
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:28,630
After you become a sergeant, you can use it after work.

667
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:29,940
Does that make sense?

668
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:32,620
I'm going to get rid of all these restrictions when I become a super senior.

669
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:35,920
Until then, for a little while I endured it.

670
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:39,880
You got in here just a few months earlier than I.

671
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,990
That's true.

672
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:45,050
Nice!

673
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,570
Pass it!

674
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:11,520
In front of a superior, turn your head to take a puff.

675
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:17,360
It's okay in front of me, but in front of other superiors, be careful.

676
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,480
Oh even so, for a private, exhaling the smoke through your nose

677
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,400
is possible.

678
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:26,670
Never mind. I won't smoke.

679
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:32,790
Unity. I am in the middle of educating a recruit.

680
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:36,980
Are you No Tae Nam? Son of the division commander?

681
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:40,620
Wow, that's great backing. But in here, backing does not pay off.

682
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:42,680
Because It's a level playing field for everyone.

683
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:44,750
Who asked you to kiss up to someone?

684
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:47,290
I mean, what's it to you?

685
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:50,100
"Yo"?
(T/N: In the Korean Military, subordinates usually speak using the honorific "nida/nikka" style)

686
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,900
"Yo"?

687
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:54,610
You need to change the way you speak.

688
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:58,210
I am sorry. I will take care of educating the recruit properly.

689
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:04,570
Do it right. The recruit's mistake is your responsibility as his superior.

690
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:05,900
Do you know that?

691
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:08,670
Yes, sir. I know that very well.

692
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:12,900
Then, you—

693
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:17,440
You are pretty.

694
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,810
After a long time, a pretty girl came in.

695
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:20,930
There!

696
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:24,500
That crazy bastard touched my face.

697
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,590
He might hear.

698
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:32,030
In the future it's not going to be easy for you to serve in the military.

699
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:39,350
That bastard, what's with his gaze?

700
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:21,760
♫ I don't know where to start ♫

701
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,960
Good job. You took care of the office while I was away.

702
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,430
You did a good job.

703
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:32,660
Without me, you've been busy outside the office.

704
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:37,790
During the No Tae Nam trial, I imagined you coming through that door.

705
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:40,700
♫ Hidden by the clouds ♫

706
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,610
♫ Tears flow down, ♫

707
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:46,300
♫ But none will ever know ♫

708
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:51,260
You expected me to return here then, didn't you?

709
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:55,080
I've never doubted that we are destined to fight together.

710
00:53:55,080 --> 00:54:00,280
♫ I just want to get my life back ♫

711
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:05,970
I said I would be your loyal hunting dog at the time.

712
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:07,480
You did.

713
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:11,060
So was the hunt for Won Gi Chun a failure?

714
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:13,300
It was a failure.

715
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:19,160
Hearing that, it's stuck right here. Huh?

716
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:23,190
It's painful.
♫ When this light gets dark ♫

717
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:25,520
♫ I'll ignite ♫

718
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:30,470
We should have placed Won Gi Chun in this chair.

719
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:34,590
We should have put me in that chair.

720
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:36,080
Prosecutor.

721
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:41,260
So did you ask me to come here to tell me I missed retrieving my prey?

722
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:43,270
♫ Turning around I ♫

723
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:47,470
It's a shame but the first hunt is over.

724
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:51,810
I wanted to share that with you.

725
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:57,690
There are still many people left who will sit here.
Defendant.

726
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:02,790
Hong Mu Seop, Lee Jae Sik,

727
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:06,330
Heo Kang In, Yong Mun Gu.

728
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:10,310
And even No Hwa Yeong.

729
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:12,160
♫ Endless night ♫

730
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,670
♫ Will it ever end ♫

731
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:20,030
Yes, yes, yes. In the future, I will work even harder, Master.

732
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:23,210
But talking about the nature of hunting dogs.

733
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:27,350
Do you know some are so vicious that even their owners can't touch them?

734
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:29,000
No.

735
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:34,580
A dog that can't be touched by anyone except his owner is a true hunting dog.

736
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:40,230
You told me that I failed in the hunt for Won Gi Chun.

737
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:43,620
I have something to show you. Follow me.

738
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:57,570
Evidence box
Won Gi Chun's Possessions

739
00:55:57,570 --> 00:56:02,080
When Won Gi Cheon went on a reconnaissance assignment, he is the type who wore a bullet-proof vest.

740
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:06,670
Such a scaredy-cat, he couldn't have been loyal to No Hwa Yeong without some kind of insurance.

741
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:08,830
That's how my instinct says it.

742
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:11,500
Are you talking about your instinct again?

743
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:15,290
I knew you lacked experience.

744
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:18,510
If you go to a military prosecutor like me,

745
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:23,810
he will have collected big data about criminals and situations.

746
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:27,690
Well, since you have been such a competent military prosecutor for five years,

747
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:30,000
I wouldn't think that data is useless.

748
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:35,690
I rummaged through everything during the search and seizure of Won Gi Chun's residence.

749
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:42,150
You failed in the hunt but you brought a lot of trophies.

750
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:46,490
Use your senses to pick out anything that could give us a lead.

751
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:49,020
I already have one picked out.

752
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:51,990
Bankbooks?

753
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:54,580
Dahyun Airlines, Jihan Motors, Law & One, Chemicals

754
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:09,450
The car key battery is dead and the car is parked in a long-term parking lot.
 Yeon Hwa Parking Garage: Jan.10th 2021: Plate Number-65M 0673

755
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:15,100
It looks like nothing much, but it feels like there's something.

756
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:17,710
Gosh, you learned a lot from me.

757
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:23,950
Division Commander No Hwa Yeong is on her way to be interviewed as a witness.

758
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:46,560
Interrogation Room

759
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:10,790
I'll start the interview.

760
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:13,760
State your name, rank, and unit.

761
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:18,900
It's the procedure.

762
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:23,460
No Hwa Yeong. Major General.

763
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:26,840
Division Commander of ROK Army 4th Division.

764
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,480
Confirmation complete.

765
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:33,060
Thank you for cooperating as a witness to Lieutenant Colonel Won Gi Chun's suicide case,

766
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:35,690
Division Commander.

767
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:39,830
You brought your lawyer to a simple interview. Is there a reason for it?

768
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:41,230
How rude.

769
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:45,990
As you just said, this is a simple interview. Treat her with the respect she deserves.

770
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:49,990
I simply asked her for the reason.

771
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:57,020
Both of you have a history of breaking your superior's prosthetic leg.

772
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:59,010
It's in case you overreach in your investigation.

773
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:03,110
It seems like you're the one overreacting.

774
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:07,580
That's enough. How about you ask your questions?

775
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:10,210
Both of you military prosecutors.

776
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:19,720
You were the last person Lieutenant Colonel Won Gi Chun met before he died.

777
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:22,940
What did you talk about in your office?

778
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:28,060
He confessed his crimes. I told the Legal Division Chief. You can check with him.

779
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:31,300
Okay. I'll check with him.

780
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:35,730
Do you have evidence that he confessed?

781
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:44,850
Do you expect me to record my subordinate who was repenting and atoning for his crimes in front of me?

782
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:48,130
Sadly, we don't have that kind of evidence.

783
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:51,300
You got Won Gi Chun's arrest warrant expedited thanks to me.

784
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:57,070
I didn't expect you to thank me, but I never imagined you'd treat me this way.

785
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,440
Where were you at 11pm that night.

786
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:05,030
Why would you ask the Division Commander that?

787
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:08,570
She's being interviewed as a reference witness right now.

788
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:11,300
It's fine. I'll answer it.

789
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:16,580
I got off work early because I was upset with Lieutenant Colonel Won.

790
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:17,910
What about after you got off work?

791
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:21,010
I went to my official residence and went straight to bed.

792
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:24,830
Why? You don't believe me?

793
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,700
Can you prove it?

794
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:29,040
Those punks.

795
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:36,230
Check the guardhouse entry log for when she left the division and entered the residence.

796
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:40,840
The guardhouse entry log can be easily fabricated.

797
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,170
I will check it.

798
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:48,950
Lieutenant Colonel Won. He was committing suicide

799
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:51,790
but used a gun silencer so nobody could hear it.

800
01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:54,560
What are your thoughts on that?

801
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:57,260
You don't need to answer them.

802
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:59,180
No.

803
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:04,610
I'll have to satisfy their curiosity.

804
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:12,910
He probably didn't want his dead body to be displayed

805
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:15,990
to people after he pulled the trigger.

806
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:19,070
I'm sure he wanted to delay it as long as he could.

807
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:27,370
I can easily understand him as a fellow soldier.

808
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:36,260
Can't you two?

809
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:47,560
What are your thoughts about Lieutenant Colonel Won's leg?

810
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,340
The person who cut his leg is in this room.

811
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:07,180
That means it's either one of you. Who is it?

812
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:09,760
It is none other than...

813
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:15,140
the two of you sitting there.

814
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:22,230
How funny.

815
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:25,860
So you're saying our investigation made him do it?

816
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:30,570
You made him cut his leg and pushed him to his death.

817
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:33,370
Your coercive interrogations.

818
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:37,950
Did Lieutenant Colonel Won have to die for his crime?

819
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:40,620
I suggest you ask yourselves that.

820
01:02:42,490 --> 01:02:44,620
Let's get going.

821
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:58,030
Military Doctor Cho Su Chang probably cut off Lieutenant Colonel Won's leg as his accomplice.

822
01:02:58,030 --> 01:03:04,140
Search for Military Doctor Cho. This is my tip to you as a senior prosecutor.

823
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:20,760
I have more to discuss with them. I'll go straight to your office once I'm done.

824
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:23,170
Good job, CEO Yong.

825
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,700
Unity.

826
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,240
This is the last time you'll interview her as a witness.

827
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:37,070
She cooperated as a way of mourning Lieutenant Colonel Won.

828
01:03:37,070 --> 01:03:40,900
No more discourtesy will be allowed even for investigation purposes.

829
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:46,120
I'll ask you to refrain from entering the interview room in the future.

830
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:49,610
I thought you gave up your lawyer job after you took over IM Defense.

831
01:03:49,610 --> 01:03:51,050
Thanks for reminding me.

832
01:03:51,050 --> 01:03:55,640
On that point, I had something I wanted to tell Prosecutor Cha.

833
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:01,870
IM Defense Industry

834
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:09,830
IM Defense Industry

835
01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:12,890
Now that I've given my business card,

836
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:17,420
I'd like to inform you that the name 'IM' will disappear forever now.

837
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:20,350
I intend to change the company's name.

838
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:30,210
The prior CEOs, from Cha Ho Cheol to No Tae Nam,

839
01:04:30,210 --> 01:04:33,870
drove the image of IM to the ground.

840
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:38,400
I'm going to clear away all the shadows of the past now.

841
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:42,180
Then...

842
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:50,640
Yong Mun Gu

843
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:54,480
knew it all.

844
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:02,730
I sincerely thank you for your reduction of our punishment, Corps Commander.

845
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:10,190
You made an appointment and came all the way here just to say that?

846
01:06:10,190 --> 01:06:13,420
Gosh, when else will I get the chance to meet you like this, Corps Commander?

847
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:16,920
As a military prosecutor, all that matters is that you do your job.

848
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:18,610
Keep doing your best.

849
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:20,750
Yes, I understand.

850
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:26,520
Oh, I heard that you were a military prosecutor too.

851
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:30,360
It's already been twenty years.

852
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:33,700
Stand up straight, you bastard!

853
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:35,820
You bastard!

854
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:38,100
Not enough evidence!

855
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:39,830
No charges!

856
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:41,900
Non-prosecution!

857
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:45,150
You disrespectful bastard. You scumbag.

01:07:38,570 --> 01:07:41,450
Corps Commander Hong Mu Seop. But there's one strange thing.

876
01:07:41,450 --> 01:07:43,350
The official residence soldier changes often.

877
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:46,460
I can smell it already. The stench of abuse of power.

878
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:49,030
You're being used like a servant, aren't you?

879
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:50,780
Do you not remember me?

880
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:53,120
Have you ever stood on the side of a victim of power abuse?

881
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:53,960
Loyalty!

882
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:57,570
Power is a drug. It's a drug much stronger than money.

883
01:07:57,570 --> 01:08:02,590
Anyone who holds a grudge or hostility towards me has to be locked up under my watch.

884
01:08:02,590 --> 01:08:06,410
You can make it happen, Prosecutor Do.

885
01:08:06,410 --> 01:08:08,710
♫ no one by my side ♫
