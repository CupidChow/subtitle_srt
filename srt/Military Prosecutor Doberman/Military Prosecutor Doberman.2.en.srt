- Yes?

00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:35,030
By the way, why is our company's name IM?

15
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,840
It's named after you, my daughter.

16
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,340
- But my name is Wu In.
- What?

17
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,280
My Wu In, do you know how to write the roman alphabetic initials for your name?

18
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,570
W and I.

19
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:57,300
That's right. Here. Take a look.

20
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,820
Here. Wu In initial is

21
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,770
W and

22
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,890
- I, is it right?
- Yes.

23
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,720
Turn it upside down.

24
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,300
Voila.

25
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,340
Wow, my dad is the best.

26
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,730
Now, if you do this.

27
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,340
Wu In, right? Turn it over, IM

28
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,920
- Dad company's name, IM.
- Right, right.

29
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,300
WI

30
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,750
Aw, you are pretty.

31
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,040
What did you draw? Oh...

32
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,480
Did you draw well?

33
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,400
Dad's company.

34
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,950
It's really shiny.

35
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,090
Cha Wu In.
 Episode 2

36
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,840
She's definitely suspicious.

37
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,610
Don't you think we should be prioritizing IM Defense over

38
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,320
Military Prosecutor Cha Wu In?

39
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,920
IM?

40
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,460
- No Tae Man's company?
- Yes.

41
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,010
Because I resemble you, I can't restrain myself about something I'm curious about.

42
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,470
I've done some research.

43
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,440
Founded 30 years ago, IM Defense was a medium-sized defense company.

44
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,380
It was considered the best of the best among the other mid-size businesses at the time.

45
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:51,730
It was famous in the industry. Now, they create not only defense equipment,

46
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:56,290
but also security systems for aircraft, engines, and robots. They have expanded.

47
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,520
The scale has increased.

48
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,680
If its focus is the defense industry, they must have contacts in the military, right?

49
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,900
Of course, they do. No Tae Nam's mother is

50
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:11,340
General No Hwa Yeong.

51
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,930
The superwoman who cut through the glass ceiling.

52
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,820
The first woman in South Korea's history to become a two-star general.

53
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,850
I heard it is her eyes, not guns, that can kill.

54
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,810
That's just how intimidating she is.

55
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,850
So his mother is General No Hwa Yeong.
Who General is No Hwa Yeong.

56
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,290
This is interesting.

57
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,170
But how is a young guy like No Tae Nam the president?

58
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,330
This well-established company suddenly leaked military secrets and manipulated market prices.

59
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:44,030
As the embezzlement scandal erupted, the stocks plummeted.

60
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,900
The former president was arrested.

61
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,590
- Was the case trumped up?
- Yes.

62
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,510
The company was stripped naked by a short-selling hedge fund

63
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,900
and went into receivership. At that time,

64
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,930
IM defense was acquired at a dirt cheap price.

65
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,790
- The leading actor was none other than—
- No Tae Nam.

66
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:06,150
But there's a rumor that No Tae Nam is just a puppet.

67
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,240
There's someone behind him.

68
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,170
What about the prior owner? What happened after the company was taken away.

69
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:19,240
From this point in the story, things become extremely fishy.

70
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,370
Mysterious accident of President Cha Ho Cheol

71
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:34,270
An issue arose with the personal safety of President Cha Ho Cheol, who was on trial.
 2012-12-21

72
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,150
IM Defense President Cha Ho Cheol Dies from Car Accident

73
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,230
President Cha Ho Cheol died at the scene of a car accident.

74
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:43,640
The family members in the passenger seats were said to have been seriously injured and fell unconscious.

75
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,280
So why is this fishy?

76
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,970
The prosecutor in charge of the case

77
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,550
was none other than Yong Mun Gu.

78
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,480
If a judgment depends on how much money parties have,

79
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,480
what good is the law that should treat everyone equally?

80
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,750
Our prosecutors are concerned about the defendant, Cha Ho Cheol,

81
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,120
who has deepened the public's mistrust in the judicial system.

82
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,330
We promise he will receive severe punishment.

83
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,120
Do you acknowledge all claims to be true?

84
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,540
Do you admit the corruption allegations?

85
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,310
The fact that Yong Mun Gu, who was a young novice prosecutor,

86
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,960
caught a big fish became a hot topic.

87
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,990
No Tae Nam and Yong Mun Gu.

88
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,690
This is the same strategy we used to get rid of the Gusan Bank President.

89
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,180
Strategy?

90
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,180
One, there is an enemy who needs to be removed from the business.

91
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,110
Two, create a crime he did not commit and blame it on him.

92
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,520
Three, force his burial through socially ostracizing him even before going to trial.

93
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,270
Four, No Tae Nam replaces him,

94
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,330
and Yong Mun Gu is compensated with any leftover crumbs.

95
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,320
That's correct. As soon as Yong Mun Gu took off his prosecutor's uniform,

96
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,540
he set up Law & One.

97
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,730
No Tae Nam set it up for him.

98
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,490
After all, Yong Mun Gu helped him swallow up a whole company.

99
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,350
But, what do you find so suspicious about

100
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:28,080
Military Prosecutor Cha Wu In?

101
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,290
Instinct?

102
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,000
The instinct so deeply ingrained in my bones.

103
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,410
Let's just say it's the side effect of having been so conscious about people around me ever since I was young.

104
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,930
It trained me before I even realized it.

105
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,480
I don't know what it is,

106
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,320
but there is something. That sort of instinct.

107
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,180
The fact that doubt has begun,

108
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,230
means that belief has begun.

109
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:06,250
This is because as long as you pass through the long, dark tunnel of doubt,

110
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,650
doubt turns into strong belief.

111
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,750
No matter how firmly you have established your belief,

112
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,980
the moment doubt creates its cracks,

113
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:21,290
the belief shatters like glass.

114
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:27,230
And the shattered glass shards become knives.

115
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,780
Se Na

116
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,380
- Eonni.
- Se Na. How are you feeling?

117
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,900
I have a request.

118
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,310
I'll head over to the hospital right now.

119
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:45,860
A few days ago.

120
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,170
Se Na.

121
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,060
I couldn't bring myself to...

122
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,550
call home. I could only call you.

123
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,190
It's okay.

124
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,350
Nothing more will happen. I'm here now,

125
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,350
so everything is okay.

126
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,550
Hello. I'm Detective Do Su Gyeong from the Violent Crimes Unit.

127
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:28,390
I am Cha Wu In. Please tell me what happened.

128
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:33,290
According to Han Se Na's testimony, she was sexually assaulted.

129
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,480
Has she identified the perpetrator?

130
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,070
Not yet. It looks like she knows who it is, but is scared to speak.

131
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,450
Anything else?

132
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,300
It looks like she was anesthetized with a drug,

133
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,490
and it was at a club called Cartel in Gangnam.

134
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,190
Did you just say Cartel?

135
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,800
Yes.

136
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:01,330
Se Na said you were a close friend. So you are a prosecutor?

137
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,760
Yes, a military prosecutor.

138
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,210
Military prosecutor?

139
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:08,950
- Which divisio—
- Let's get Se Na to a hospital first.

140
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,260
Yes. If you give us the contact information of the hospital—

141
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,930
I'll contact you again.

142
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,490
I understand.

143
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,680
Se Na.

144
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:52,830
I think I've done something pointless, reporting it to the police.

145
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,180
I was filmed.

146
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,600
They used their phones to film...

147
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,070
What do I do now? What if they blackmail me?

148
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,400
What if they upload it to the internet?

149
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,680
Just thinking about it is driving me crazy.

150
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,090
Se Na.

151
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,950
Eonni, I have a favor.

152
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,120
You said you are a military prosecutor, right?

153
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,270
If you say you are a prosecutor, don't you think that would scare them?

154
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,500
That video. I have it.

155
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:51,610
- What?
- Nobody can see that video.

156
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,980
I didn't tell the police about it yet either.

157
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,990
How do you have that video?

158
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:02,530
It's difficult for me to tell you now. I'll tell you when the time comes.

159
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:15,430
Right now, the most important thing is that this video

160
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,980
is needed by both you and me.

161
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,720
For you as well?

162
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,790
Without this, we cannot start a trial.

163
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,550
But the decision is up to you.

164
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,400
Whether you want to cover this up so that nobody in the world knows about it,

165
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,560
whether you want to make those punks pay for what they did.

166
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:49,900
I just want to bury this. I don't even want to think about it again.

167
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,470
Alright.

168
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:59,740
If that is your decision, let's do that.

169
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,010
If I don't make an issue about this,

170
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,730
I can hope they will leave me alone, right?

171
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:12,500
I will protect you. Don't worry.

172
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:23,090
Idol star Allen's concert, which was scheduled for tomorrow, has been canceled.

173
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:27,860
According to his company, Allen has cut contact with everybody and has disappeared.

174
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,680
As backlash from the fans...

175
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:48,300
- Yes.
- Have you seen the news?

176
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,510
- The news?
- Allen has disappeared.

177
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,090
We cannot reach the person you are calling. Please wait until you are connected to voice mail...

178
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,510
We cannot reach the person you are calling. Please wait while you are connected to voice mail...

179
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,740
What's with this bastard?

180
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,560
We cannot reach the person you are calling. Please wait until you are connected to voice mail...

181
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,770
You still can't reach him?

182
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,290
He's not answering.

183
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:38,960
You know it's that punk Allen's natural specialty to disappear like this. He was probably stressed out by the upcoming concert.

184
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,340
He has disappeared from time to time, but every one of those times,

185
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,890
he answered when you called him.

186
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:48,390
That's true. Since he knows my personality.

187
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,500
This is not a mere disappearance.

188
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,390
What happened that day at Cartel?

189
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:58,450
Why is Cartel relevant?

190
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,980
That has nothing to do with this.

191
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,420
Until now, I have been preventing all of your incidents and accidents before they happened.

192
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:14,210
So much that even I call myself your legal bodyguard instead of your legal representative.

193
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:17,710
I make sure problems are resolved before we reach the courtroom.

194
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,350
Hey,

195
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,610
as expected of a former special division prosecutor, you really push me to the edge.

196
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:30,480
I liked it when you were doing work for me,

197
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,840
but being on the opposite end of such interrogation feels like sh*t.

198
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:38,230
This is related to the female college student who was there with you that night, isn't it?

199
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:49,540
Did you film a video this time too?

200
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:53,290
How much of my personal life am I supposed to share?!

201
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,720
Hey. You have a scratch on your face.

202
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,120
What?

203
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:14,240
Hey! Are you crazy?

204
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,660
Hey. Don't you know that he has a concert in a few days?

205
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,430
How can you call yourself a fan and scratch him, you b*tch?

206
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:27,730
And you call yourself an Allen fan, you crazy b*tch?!

207
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,380
That hurts.

208
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,350
Don't do this.

209
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,150
Hey. Her expression is showing.

210
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,120
Give me your phone. We need to film it now.

211
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,910
- Are you filming?
- Yeah.

212
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,570
Did you intentionally film it with Allen's phone?

213
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:07,260
You told me not to leave anything on my phone if possible. You're always nagging me.

214
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,440
You shouldn't have started it to begin with.

215
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,730
We're good now, right? I've told you everything.

216
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,660
Now you do whatever you need to do.

217
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:30,460
So Allen has disappeared together with the video.

218
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,190
I will start by looking for Allen.

219
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,720
Why don't you ask him?

220
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,840
Who?

221
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,290
That soldier who did the "emperor treatment" case. He was pretty skilled.

222
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,940
Why? You don't want to?

223
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,980
A military prosecutor is still a prosecutor.

224
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,100
Allowing Do Bae Man to enter your personal sphere is not good.

225
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,800
So just do it.

226
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,390
It's because sometime soon I will order him to do something. Within my personal sphere.

227
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,820
Sixty-seven. Arms, please.

228
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,410
You can put them down now. One-hundred seven. Oh, your build is just...

229
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,880
One-hundred five.

230
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:33,670
It looks like I'll be able to make a masterpiece.

231
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,450
When will you be wearing this?

232
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,300
I have a hunch that

233
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:42,290
there is going to be a need for it sometime soon, so I am just preparing in advance.

234
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,710
- Could I have your autograph—
- Hey!

235
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,810
Oh, I'm sorry.

236
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:51,650
How can you suddenly ask a customer for his signature?

237
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,140
Yes, Lawyer Yong.

238
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,410
Come to my office right now.

239
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,200
Yes, I will.

240
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,920
Chief Lawyer Yong Mun Gu

241
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:07,030
- I ran over immediately. Is it something urgent?
- Do you know Allen?

242
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,180
An idol singer.

243
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:15,620
Allen... I have heard his name before.

244
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:20,230
He's gone missing. Well, it's a little early to conclude that yet.

245
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,630
Let's just say we cannot make contact with him for now.

246
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,350
There is a place Allen and his friends go to play cards. Go check out this place first.

247
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,060
Yes, I will.

248
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,740
Aren't you curious about why you need to find him?

249
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:40,790
You mean, why you have come to me instead of going to the police when a man has disappeared?

250
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,620
Yes.

251
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:45,540
A soldier merely follows orders. He does not question.

252
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:49,390
More importantly... well.

253
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,750
I'm not curious at all.

254
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:01,120
Sang Gi, I am so curious that I am going insane.

255
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,970
What is it? I know my prosecutor can't stand holding in what you're curious about for even a minute.

256
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:08,670
Do some background research on an idol singer called Allen.

257
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:11,610
Allen? The current hot star Allen?

258
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:15,010
Personal life, people around him, especially relationships with females.

259
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:17,460
Find everything you can about him until this past month.

260
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:22,450
Yes. But why does your voice sound so excited?

261
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:26,640
I think Allen is No Tae Nam's person.

262
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,920
Lawyer Yong Mun Gu is hiding it, but you can't fool my instincts.

263
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,150
I'll look into it immediately. Your loyal worker.

264
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:38,400
Yeah. Total loyalty.

265
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,290
There was a report of a fire in the middle of the night that day, so it was crazy.

266
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:49,550
Evacuating civilians and watching firetrucks arriving. It was chaotic.

267
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,970
A report of a fire?

268
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:53,990
I'm not sure if it was a joke or a mistake,

269
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:57,830
but after the incident was resolved and we returned,

270
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,060
the CCTVs were all erased.

271
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,000
Yes. Except for one spot.

272
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,800
Where was that?

273
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,160
Camera 8, towards the hallway on the 20th floor.

274
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,560
Could I take a look at the footage?

275
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,830
That'll be a bit difficult.

276
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:19,210
A celebrity lives there, so without a special reason, we can't.

277
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,780
I see.

278
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:26,160
Make up an acceptable reason.

279
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,480
Wow.

280
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,510
Blood.

281
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,580
This is it. Red hair.

282
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,220
Are you looking for something in particular?

283
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:46,700
It's for a superior at work. Do you have any recommendations?

284
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,640
- A superior at work?
- Yes.

285
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,280
Is he perhps someone you'll be making into your boyfriend soon?

286
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,680
I take offense at that.

287
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,730
I'm sorry.

288
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:01,000
I'll give you recommendations for something practical with a slick design.

289
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,530
Thanks.

290
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,960
I'll take this one.

291
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,720
You... want me to accept this?

292
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,280
This isn't a gift, but a bribe.

293
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,760
Why would I bribe someone who's going to be leaving soon anyway?

294
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,790
In return for you saving me during the interrogation.

295
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:33,120
I don't like being indebted to others.

296
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,700
Of course, it's okay to express your feeling with something concrete,

297
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,890
but this is a bit...

298
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:44,760
I wasn't sure of your style preferences, so I picked one to my liking.

299
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,220
You picked the right one for me.

300
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,890
I'm heading out to practice shooting, then.

301
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:56,450
Wait, wait! Take the watch with you!

302
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:02,960
She gave you a watch. An expensive one, at that.

303
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,650
This is more than a simple gift to a superior.

304
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:11,240
This is something you'd gift to a boyfriend or f-f-future husband!

305
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,860
What— What could this mean? Let's see.

306
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,990
Right? Right? You thought the same thing as me, right?

307
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:23,480
Something is... itching here. What is this, the start of love?

308
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:28,080
It's not the start of love. You're itchy because you didn't bathe.

309
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,000
- Out of the blue?
- Hey, you too. Get out. Wash up.

310
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,110
Don't touch it.

311
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,260
- Prosecutor Cha!
- Temper tantrum.

312
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,000
That's right. Right.

313
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,370
Cha Wu In.

314
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,080
Where are you going?

315
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,590
You said you're going to the shooting range. I'll finish my assignment too.

316
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,050
Sure.

317
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:57,090
I also want to give a gift which would be of equal value to the watch. What do you need?

318
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:59,620
If I receive something in return, that'll make my gift meaningless.

319
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,670
I don't need anything either.

320
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,620
Really?

321
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,390
Oh, my.

322
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,790
I won't see you once you're discharged.

323
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:15,250
I'll be grateful if you treat it as a part of you and wear it 24/7.

324
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,990
Military Prison
Reform

325
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:49,400
I...

326
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:53,700
I'm not someone who can come and go because you ask me to.

327
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,280
As you can see, I can't leave.

328
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,370
Do you even know what I do for a living?

329
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:03,000
I heard you can make those

330
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,980
who refuse to speak, desperate to do so.

331
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,340
That's right.

332
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,980
I guess news circulates well in here too.

333
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:15,690
But why is someone like you in here?

334
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,910
You know this bastard, don't you?

335
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:29,260
Of course.

336
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:33,980
There's an old saying for the relationship he and I have.

337
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,960
I'm not interested in such sayings.

338
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,420
Refusal to live under the same sky.

339
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:42,960
An archenemy so great you don't want to exist in the world together.

340
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,170
That's why you're the right person.

341
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:49,370
With this opportunity, you can put an end to your ill-fated relationship.

342
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,930
It's only ill-fated when we're bad for each other.

343
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:59,300
I'm a victim, so it'd be upsetting for us to be considered ill-fated.

344
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:05,050
But the flow of the conversation is a bit awkward.

345
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:09,120
What is it you're trying to say? Do you want someone to be reshaped to crap?

346
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,550
Kill Do Bae Man.

347
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,440
25 m Pistol Target

348
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,740
Jeez.

349
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,950
If only I had more time before leaving, I'd train you properly.

350
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,780
You're unlucky.

351
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:43,970
I guess so. How unfortunate.

352
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:51,080
Are your reactions always so flat?

353
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,800
No matter what I say?

354
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:00,920
It's not like we're going to war anyway.

355
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,640
Let's approach it as a sport.

356
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:08,190
In all sports, good form is basic.

357
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:11,410
One, relax your upper body.

358
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:15,140
Legs spread just a bit more than shoulder-width apart.

359
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:20,540
Slightly bend your elbows and knees to form an isosceles triangle.

360
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:25,830
That stabilizes your aim and minimizes gun recoil.

361
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,360
Like that.

362
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:32,120
The most important is the second point.

363
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:36,670
Think of someone in place of your target.

364
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:39,730
Someone you want to pull the trigger on right now.

365
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,330
Try shooting.

366
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,530
25 m Pistol Target

367
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,730
Wait a minute.

368
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:38,950
Kill Do Bae Man.

369
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,010
- They'll hear you.
- Scared?

370
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:49,380
This is different from an ordinary prison.

371
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,450
How am I supposed to kill a prosecutor?

372
00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:01,540
If you take care of this, we can become well acquainted.

373
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,070
What do you think?

374
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:06,060
Where shall I take you?

375
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,800
Tell all the bros in the group chat to gather.

376
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,530
All of them?

377
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:20,610
I-I understand.

378
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:29,190
I can confirm that Allen was with his friends at the hideout.

379
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:32,370
None of the friends who play cards with him contacted him.

380
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:35,970
I've searched through CCTVs but the footage has been deleted.

381
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:39,900
I secured this from a camera independent of the general security servers.

382
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,190
This is the only guest from that time frame. Do you know who it is?

383
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:52,170
- Is this all?
- One more thing.

384
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:58,080
I found this on site and ran a DNA test on it.

385
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:04,240
The results?

386
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,370
It's Allen's blood.

387
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:13,130
The scale is too large for this to be a simple loss of contact.

388
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,130
Don't rashly jump to conclusions.

389
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:19,160
Yes, sir.

390
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,860
- Just find Allen.
- I understand.

391
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:27,810
I'm sure the puzzle pieces will come together with more evidence.

392
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,110
Hello?
We've found a coordinate.

393
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:42,950
- For where?
- Have you heard of the club, Cartel?

394
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,190
Cartel?

395
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:49,070
Cartel

396
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:52,580
They say Allen was here two days ago with a woman.

397
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:58,440
I mean, it's the same. The same.

398
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,290
- Excuse me, may I ask something?
- How can I help?

399
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:07,160
This is the singer Allen's usual club, right?

400
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,800
Why are you asking that?

401
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:13,730
I wanted to know who is the woman who was with Allen two days ago.

402
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:17,420
- Leave. Leave.
- Wait a minute.

403
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:22,310
Aren't you the military prosecutor who investigated the emperor service case?

404
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:25,670
- You recognize me?
- Of course.

405
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,930
Unity.

406
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,800
At ease.

407
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,870
Captain, I served as an operating strength soldier in the 4th division at headquarters.

408
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,180
I've been discharged for about a month now.

409
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:39,310
Oh really?

410
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:42,070
Leave. He's a prosecutor.

411
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:47,580
What are you curious about?

412
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:53,030
The woman who came with Allen. And...

413
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,450
was this person with them that day?

414
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:06,370
As expected, it's got something to do with No Tae Nam.

415
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:09,640
Now all I need to do is find Allen...

416
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,190
Where is this bastard?

417
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:53,150
Suffer for the suffering you caused.

418
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,970
Have you reflected on your actions?

419
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,630
What?

420
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,970
What are you saying?

421
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:33,700
Where is this?

422
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,040
I wonder where this is?

423
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:40,860
Somewhere you'll never go, the military.

424
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,290
Huh? Military?

425
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,530
What are you saying?

426
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:48,920
How much are these shoulders worth?

427
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,350
According to a speciality hospital in Gangnam, you're suffering from an unstable multi-directional shoulder.

428
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,610
Simply defined, there was a shoulder dislocation surgery.

429
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:56,280
Leave. Go away!

430
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,670
Someone save me! Someone save me!

431
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,460
What's the appropriate amount?

432
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:05,790
As much as the surgery or

433
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:09,410
would you like to pay as much as you earned in the 18 months of military service you were medically exempted from?

434
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:19,140
Help! Save us! Save us!

435
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,780
What is that?

436
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,650
- Sleep a bit more
- Don't come!

437
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,650
until I'm back.

438
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:33,790
- ... as it was.
- Huh? You!

439
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,620
Unity.

440
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:45,320
Cha Wu In, your eyebrows...

441
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,680
Is it makeup? Semi-permanent?

442
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,740
Or is it a tattoo?

443
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,840
They're my natural eyebrows.

444
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,100
Oh, natural?

445
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,060
Then you're fine.

446
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:06,050
However, your haircut is quite

447
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,830
messy.

448
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,870
If you're talking about my hairstyle,

449
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:14,140
I don't think it's bad because it doesn't interfere with wearing my uniform hat.

450
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:19,390
Captain Do, at the defense ministry, what is the substance of Article 24?

451
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:23,330
You shouldn't wear a wig or dye your hair, etc., if it interferes with military discipline.

452
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:26,140
For short hair, the ends of the hair at the back of your head should not touch the collar.

453
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:31,110
If you have long hair, tie it or put it up with hairpins or a hair net. That's what it states.

454
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,870
You know it very well!

455
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:38,120
But while you know it, look at this. It's almost touching. It nearly reaches.

456
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:42,150
I mean, you are a military prosecutor. Do you intend to violate the rule?

457
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:45,780
There were internal military regulations so that until 1988

458
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,150
a female military officer could not give birth.

459
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:52,270
Military regulations which are outdated should be updated.

460
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:53,720
What?

461
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,340
I'm sorry. She will be corrected.

462
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,450
I haven't done anything wrong.

463
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,260
Shall I give you a piece of advice?

464
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:05,590
In the military smart officers are liked,

465
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:09,760
but I really dislike soldiers who are smart and self-righteous.

466
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,890
And do you know who is the worst among them?

467
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:16,900
A soldier who is smart, self-righteous, and female.

468
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:21,270
That is precisely you, Cha Wu In.

469
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,210
Waste of words.

470
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,350
How dare she to her superior officer?

471
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:38,280
Smart-mouth answers to my questions.

472
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,270
Oh, really. That woman bugs me.

473
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,360
Here, here.

474
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,350
I am sorry.

475
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:54,450
Even if I have to delay my discharge, I will make her a proper soldier before I leave.

476
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:58,060
There's no way you can prune a decaying tree.

477
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:03,590
You should discard a decaying tree.

478
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:07,040
Because she will continue, when there is another occasion,

479
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,400
should I transfer or discipline her?

480
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,050
I will do it even if it's a dishonorable discharge.

481
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,020
Nice.

482
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:24,700
Who will do this for me when you are discharged?

483
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:29,640
From my mom who also has a wild temper

484
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,680
to that female soldier Cha Wu In.

485
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,450
I'm scared. I don't like them.

486
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:38,930
Nowadays you can't reveal your inner thoughts.

487
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:43,440
What you said to Captain Cha before was very dangerous.

488
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,730
I don't know if they are trying to ruin military life.

489
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:50,690
Now the newly installed division leader is a female general.

490
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:52,100
Who is it?

491
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,300
General No Hwa Yeong.

492
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:58,800
Really, in the battle of the stars, she blew away all the males.

493
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,800
She got promoted to that position. Just that alone

494
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,700
shows she's not a normal woman.

495
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:11,050
What is it? You don't like it either, right?

496
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:13,320
No, I don't. It's not right.

497
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:17,630
Anyway, what do you care since you're being discharged.

498
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:24,230
Oh, I like that!

499
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:14,120
I'll be grateful if you treat it as a part of you and wear it 24/7.

500
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:36,940
For Cha Wu In too, if I gather all the clues, I will put the puzzle together.

501
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,970
Lawyer Yong Mun Gu

502
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:44,570
Yes.

503
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:49,870
Two girls are linked to the process of searching for Allen.

504
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:53,250
One is the unidentified woman in the red wig I told you about.

505
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:56,100
The other is Han Se Na.

506
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,410
It was reported to the police that three days ago at Club Cartel,

507
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:03,090
something nasty happened to her caused by Allen and his company.

508
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:04,530
Are you saying reported?

509
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:07,620
I guess you knew about Han Se Na.

510
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,810
Yes.

511
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:13,190
Then, who is Allen's company?

512
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:15,550
You don't need to know that.

513
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:20,200
I know he is Chairman No Tae Nam.

514
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:24,190
Did you ask a question for which you already knew the answer?

515
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:27,800
Since I found out, please tell me the details.

516
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,370
Wouldn't that be helpful to you, too?

517
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:32,950
I think it's an urgent matter to you.

518
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:38,050
Han Se Na dropped the charges. She's hospitalized now in a general hospital in Gyeonggi Province.

519
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:41,300
I think I will find Allen soon also.

520
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:46,570
If I am to do that, I need some reward.

521
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,160
What do you want?

522
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,780
I want to meet Chairman No Tae Nam.

523
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:01,200
You have an appointment with Chairman No tomorrow.

524
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,620
Just remember it is just a pro forma meeting.

525
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:14,770
I am nervous about the transition to civilian life.

526
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:18,440
Wouldn't be it better to just be in the army for life?

527
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,790
Thanks to Lawyer Yong Mun Gu, I've been eating well and living well for the damn last five years.

528
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:27,810
My life is going to be even better now. Just watch, Sang Gi.

529
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:30,200
No. Will you be really okay?

530
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,040
I think I have to go with you too.

531
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,020
You know my instincts well, don't you?

532
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:40,930
I throw myself into the wave that is No Tae Nam who is running toward me.

533
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:46,600
Every other punk may have drowned, but not me.

534
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:50,460
I'm going to make sure I ride that fateful wave.

535
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,870
He's looking. Please stop.

536
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,650
I'll wait for you in the car.

537
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,940
Today you are wearing a civilian suit as well.

538
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:18,140
You look like you made an effort to meet with President No.

539
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,070
Also, an expensive watch?

540
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,780
Is it an expensive watch?

541
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:25,480
I got it as a gift.

542
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,890
Is it possibly from a woman?

543
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:30,530
I have many things to do, how would I have time for it?

544
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:33,120
Let's go.

545
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,620
Stay.

546
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:56,590
I'm Military Prosecutor Do Bae Man.

547
00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:00,560
It's my honor to meet with you.

548
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:07,170
That name is unique. Let me think.

549
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:10,780
It sounds similar to someone. Do Bae Man?

550
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:12,600
Do Bae Man?

551
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:15,780
Doberman.

552
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,530
My Bolt is also a Doberman.

553
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:22,160
Since I was a child, it's been my nickname, Doberman.

554
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:27,360
You must've been teased a bit because you have the same name as a dog breed.

555
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,690
I was never teased.

556
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:33,380
I threw out all the punks who had the potential to tease me

557
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:36,500
regardless of whether they were a student or a teacher.

558
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:44,740
Let's get to the point since I'm busy.

559
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,830
Yes, Chairman.

560
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:59,580
It's your job to lock up guys who try to evade the draft, right?

561
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:02,600
If the guy is a soldier, then yes.

562
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,880
Is there someone you want to report?

563
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,920
- I can immediately—
- Get me out of the draft.

564
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:11,910
Yes?

565
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,820
I just really don't want to serve in the military.

566
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:32,460
It's very you, Chairman.

567
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:36,350
Who would expect you to ask this favor directly to a military prosecutor?

568
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:39,900
Chairman. If it's about that, I'll look into it separately.

569
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,410
Lawyer Yong. Stay out of this.

570
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:46,490
Then let me word it differently. I want to see how capable you—

571
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:48,990
You're saying you want to test me.

572
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:51,320
Don't cut me off.

573
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:56,290
If you feel offended by the word 'test,' think of it as an opportunity.

574
00:45:56,290 --> 00:46:01,940
This opportunity is to see if you can be on my team.

575
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:04,400
Opportunity, you say.

576
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,320
I don't judge opportunities.

577
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,020
The opportunity will judge me.

578
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,470
Do Bae Man. This isn't an offer to accept rashly.

579
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:40,790
That chance, I'll definitely grab it.

580
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:43,450
I didn't know that you are indeed that kind of person.

581
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:45,730
I can't believe you're surprising me from the start.

582
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:49,490
You're truly a soldier, our Military Prosecutor Doberman.

583
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:03,720
How could you accept it so easily?

584
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,470
You are just a military prosecutor. Do you have a way?

585
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:10,110
A way?

586
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,890
I don't have.

587
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:14,570
But you still agreed to it?

588
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:16,420
It won't be easy.

589
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:20,150
But did you ever see me go on a paved path?

590
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:23,040
The road was always paved after I walked it.

591
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,730
I plan to pave my way this time too.

592
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:29,330
What? Don't say

593
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:34,110
you are worried that I'll succeed with the opportunity?

594
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:41,860
I'm going.

595
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,690
Good job, sir.

596
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,620
You should've discussed this issue with me first.

597
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:18,250
Are you on a mission to get on my nerves these days?

598
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:21,010
Military issues are not that simple!

599
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:25,840
You want me to go to the military and live with some random punks?

600
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,590
You want me, No Tae Nam to do that?

601
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:31,200
You might as well tell me to go die.

602
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:39,570
I will tell you just one thing.

603
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:45,240
If your mother finds out, she's not going to just sit back and watch.

604
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,910
I'll start my monthly report for Law & One.

605
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:09,870
There are currently 23 cases we are working on.

606
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:12,560
Seventeen of them are civil cases and five are criminal cases.

607
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,290
Don't say

608
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:18,930
you are worried that I'll succeed with the opportunity?

609
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:25,370
That ungrateful punk.

610
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:38,290
All right. Today's the division commander's inauguration ceremony.

611
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:43,650
Make sure you're dressed properly and attend on time.

612
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:46,040
- That's all.
- Yes, sir.

613
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,970
And you...

614
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:51,540
Nothing.

615
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,140
Unity.

616
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,060
I've arrived at the hospital.

617
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:01,270
But how do you know Se Na is in this hospital?

618
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:04,390
Do Bae Man told me.

619
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:06,730
That military prosecutor doesn't disappoint.

620
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:10,700
At this age, it's going to be a big problem if she reports you.

621
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:13,740
Keep that in mind and make sure you don't browbeat her.

622
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:16,390
Yes, yes.

623
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,750
Han * Na

624
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,370
Se Na!

625
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:14,990
You are here.

626
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,600
I looked for you everywhere.

627
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,330
Take it.

628
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:28,160
Please.

629
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:33,990
I heard you went to the police station.

630
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:37,770
You know...

631
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:40,770
just because a person got stepped on accidentally,

632
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:44,000
doesn't mean they can have the other person's foot cut off.

633
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,870
Don't you think so?

634
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:49,060
Please.

635
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:51,590
Please don't do this.

636
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:56,710
Allen disappeared.

637
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,420
But it's not Allen I'm looking for.

638
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:05,190
It's the video.

639
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:10,580
Don't tell me you planned this with Allen to screw me over?

640
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:14,770
But what have you been clutching so tightly since before? Open your fist.

641
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:17,230
Please go. I'll shout.

642
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:20,350
Where have you hidden the video?

643
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:25,420
I said, where is it?

644
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:32,310
Division Commander is waiting for you.

645
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:34,730
Why is Mother here?

646
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:37,540
That bastard, Yong Mun Gu.

647
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:40,330
I'll escort you to the car.

648
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,190
Get in.

649
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:12,130
Mother. I will explain everything to you.

650
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:16,100
I heard everything from Lawyer Yong. Let's talk on the way.

651
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:28,470
We'll be arriving at Division Headquarters at 14:41. I'll depart now.

652
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:39,200
You know the Staff Judge Advocate is watching you, right?

653
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:43,810
Your military life is screwed once you get on his bad side.

654
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:46,060
I'll keep that in mind.

655
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:59,060
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

656
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:01,140
What punk—

657
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:11,480
That bastard.

658
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:17,110
Do you know him?

659
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:21,280
His name is Seol Ak. His father pocketed military supplies

660
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,730
and money earned by soldiers he sent off to construction sites.

661
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:27,260
Which is why I sent him off to prison.

662
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:30,660
That punk's gotten even bolder.

663
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:34,880
It's dangerous, so wait in the car for just a bit.

664
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,610
Yes, sir.

665
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:39,630
I guess it's time for me to warm up.

666
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:47,770
Shyster! I missed you so much!

667
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:51,280
My gosh. Do you get laser treatment on your skin?

668
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,230
Your skin is glowing, soldier.

669
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:56,940
What about your father's private meals? Have you been serving them to him well?

670
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:00,310
If you want to continue doing that, you have to become successful.

671
00:55:00,310 --> 00:55:03,030
You little bastard.

672
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:08,160
He was an administrator for 20 years, so he'll have to serve the same amount of time in prison.

673
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:11,810
Don't worry. I am going to go see my father,

674
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:14,670
after I kill you.

675
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:18,340
Good. Visiting often is the best gift a son can give him.

676
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:23,560
Wait, no. Maybe reuniting with him in prison would be the best gift.

677
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:49,570
You dress trendy but you don't act it.

678
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:53,370
We're in a world where a self driving car is at level four.

679
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:55,490
But you brought lumber?

680
00:55:55,490 --> 00:55:58,720
No matter how much AI changes the world,

681
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,260
it can never replace us.

682
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,160
No, it can't.

683
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:07,220
Hey, brothers. What are you waiting for?

684
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:10,960
This military shyster bastard. Finish him off right now!

685
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,260
Yes, Hyeongnim.

686
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:18,000
Hey!

687
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,440
- That's right!
- It hurts.

688
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,160
- You, come here.
- You come.

689
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:03,420
Go!

690
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:14,120
This is an expensive watch.

691
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:19,910
Hey!

692
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:28,270
Amazing.

693
00:57:57,230 --> 00:57:59,200
Hold on.

694
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:04,320
Shyster Do. It's time to say goodbye now.

695
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:08,320
Goodbye, my foot. You don't even know how to spell it.

696
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,460
What time is it?

697
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:20,420
Hey, Cha Wu In. Don't come out, it's done.

698
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:24,510
Go on in. It's done. I'll be done soon.

699
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,420
What is she doing?

700
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:36,220
What is it, soldier lady? Are you going to spank us?

701
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:40,680
The division commander's inauguration ceremony will start in 20 minutes.

702
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:43,460
I really hate being late.

703
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:47,420
- What's with the tough guy act?
- Is that so?

704
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:50,010
- I'll volunteer to get hit.
- All right.

705
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:52,770
Hit me. Give it a go.

706
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:05,270
What are you doing? How much can a girl's whipping hurt?

707
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:18,720
Who is this little kid?

708
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,530
Get her!

709

Do you think it's strange for a soldier to beat up thugs?

750
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:20,930
You do the driving. It's been a while since I got some action. I need to rest.

01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:22,940

I was certain that he is someone I need for my plan.

763
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:31,320
You dare ask a military prosecutor to get you exempted from enlistment?

764
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,070
I really don't want to go to the military.

765
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:36,570
Because this is the army, we will pick up and check even a small mistake.

766

What are you saying right now?

767
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:41,330
I really like the way you work. You're different from Lawyer Yong who's always worrying about Mom.

768
01:02:41,330 --> 01:02:43,530
There's a bunch of cops.

769
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:44,800
He must be warned.

771
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:48,830
