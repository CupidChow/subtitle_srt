00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:08,090
♫ This time won't be the last and same like that before  ♫

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,920
♫ Cuz you know there's no way to stop ♫

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,660
♫ Feels like I'm losing control ♫

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,060
♫ My style without hesitation. You can't stop me ♫

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:24,130
Military Prosecutor Doberman

6
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:36,410
We stand at the crossroads each day, facing the many paths each decision will bring.

7
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,050
One moment's decision changes your fate.

8
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,270
The decision becomes fate.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,450
What fate awaits me now?

10
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,200
Will I accept or reject this destiny?

11
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,130
This itself is another decision to make.

12
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,980
A few days ago

13
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,000
Is this like something you wear off the military base?

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,810
Sometimes.

15
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,230
Have you perhaps worn this recently?

16
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,680
What are you so curious about?

17
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,210
I just wear it because it doesn't feel like me.

18
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,010
Because I can become somebody else.

19
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,240
Somebody else?

20
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,150
It's a change of scene. For when I get sick of my military uniform.

21
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:52,540
But is it a violation of the dress code just to be possessing a wig?

22
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,500
No. Keep on driving.

23
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,700
Military Prosecutor Do.

24
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,090
Yes?

25
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,280
What?

26
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,860
That looks like the new commander's car in front of us.

27
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,030
Oh, it does.

28
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,640
General No Hwa Yeong has vigorously opened the door that was sealed to female soldiers,

29
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,590
stepping into the position of commander.

30
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,790
There have been a handful of two-star female generals previously,

31
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:35,110
but this is the first time a female has been appointed commander in the combat infantry division, the key to the frontline.

32
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,010
As such, this news is gaining a lot of attention.

33
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,920
Mother, I will explain everything.

34
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,820
Shut your mouth.

35
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,970
What Lawyer Yong said is enough.

36
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,620
It's clear that anything you say will be excuses.

37
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,960
Are you going to make that face in front of the public?

38
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,630
Don't you know what day it is today?

39
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,360
I will correct myself.

40
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,950
You must never forget that you are No Hwa Yeong's son.

41
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,770
After the inauguration,

42
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,120
we will talk in my office about the incident you caused.

43
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,640
Yes.

44
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,150
Unity.

45
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,170
Episode 3

46
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,990
- She's here!
- Oh!

47
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,360
How do you feel about being the first to break the army's glass ceiling,

48
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,280
which is like an impregnable fortress?

49
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,390
It is indeed hard for women to get stars.

50
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,880
There is around one female general among every 100 male generals.

51
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,180
It would be more fitting to describe it as a bulletproof ceiling instead.

52
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,280
Is there anything you would like to say to female officers like yourself?

53
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,470
Rather than focusing on competing with the male generals...

54
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:57,990
Just look at how many reporters have gathered just for the inauguration of a division commander.

55
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,570
This is definitely a hot topic for sure.

56
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,350
You have to understand that you are simply a soldier, not a female soldier.

57
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:06,420
Since I'm going to leave soon anyway, you take good care of her.

58
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,350
Looks like she's a great choice for a role model.

59
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,150
Becoming the first female general can't be my goal.

60
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,520
Since Commander No Hwa Yeong has done that already, I'm going to aim higher?

61
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,690
That's it, isn't it?

62
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,650
Flags down.

63
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,670
Unity.

64
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,600
Unity.

65
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,570
Flags up.

66
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,250
I am here today to take over command of the 4th Division.

67
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,290
It is a great honor.

68
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:44,870
I will take pride in the fact that I am defending the survival and prosperity of the nation,

69
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,400
properly strategize for operations,

70
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,970
and demonstrate impeccable responsiveness for whatever emergency situations arise.

71
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,400
Peace is not achieved by any one person...

72
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,170
As a military prosecutor, do you have the courage to investigate

73
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,730
even a starred general like Commander No Hwa Yeong?

74
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,040
We must come together in unity...

75
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,370
Investigations are done with facts, not courage.

76
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,020
If a crime has been committed, of course, I will.

77
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,240
With everyone in unity...

78
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,830
You sure are amazing.

79
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,720
Only a military prosecutor can

80
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,630
bring a uniformed criminal to court.

81
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,700
Easier said than done.

82
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,980
Soldiers have ranks.

83
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,800
I will protect my subordinates from danger...

84
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,280
There is no ranking that is higher than the law.

85
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,290
I will shape it into an elite division...

86
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,290
and we will contribute our part to the country's military.

87
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,860
Raise the flags.

88
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,870
Unity.

89
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,060
Unity.

90
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,950
Elite Army Base with Great Energy
The 4th Infantry Division

91
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,750
Mother, where are we going now?

92
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,890
The child you hit has apparently gone blind.

93
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,840
I will make sure you can never do something like that again.

94
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,230
I'm sorry, Mother.

95
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,300
Get out.

96
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,630
Mother, I'm scared.

97
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,230
Go down.

98
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,140
Go down!

99
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,770
Mother, is this real?

100
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,980
Do you know the most important thing about a grenade?

101
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,500
Gunpowder.

102
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,900
Fifty grams of gunpowder breaks the shell encasing the grenade,

103
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,760
and causes the shards to explode in all directions.

104
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,910
But there's something more important than the gunpowder.

105
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,490
It is this safety pin.

106
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,380
You need to pull this out if you want to make it a weapon for war.

107
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:45,170
- Mother what are you doing—!
- Hold it tight.

108
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,820
The moment you let go, it will explode.

109
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,730
Mother, please save me.

110
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:57,890
I will rise to places that female soldiers could never dream of.

111
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,970
I will not allow any man to stand above me.

112
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:04,340
For that to happen, you need to become a perfect human.

113
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,800
You cannot place even a small stain on the path I am walking.

114
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,810
Answer me.

115
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,500
Will you disobey me next time?

116
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,590
No, mother, I won't.

117
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,810
Have you learned your lesson?

118
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,950
Yes, I have. Please believe me.

119
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,440
No.

120
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,390
A lesson without pain is meaningless.

121
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,000
For this to be a real lesson,

122
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,900
I need to give you a memory that you will never forget.

123
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,180
One hour.

124
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,420
Remember that the moment you let go, it will explode in 4 seconds.

125
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,520
No, please!

126
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,910
Mom! Mom!

127
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,670
Mom!

128
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,310
Mom!

129
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,060
Don't ever forget today's memories.

130
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:39,870
Always remember that I am your safety pin.

131
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,980
Mother, I spoke to Se Na about the video.

132
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,790
It won't ever create a problem.

133
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,010
Lawyer Yong Mun Gu will handle that issue.

134
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,380
Don't involve yourself in it any further.

135
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,850
But you...

136
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,970
What did you ask a military prosecutor?

137
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,170
Did Lawyer Yong tell you that too?

138
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,760
You dare ask a military prosecutor to get you exempted from enlistment?

139
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,850
I asked a military prosecutor so that there wouldn't be any future trouble.

140
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,780
So that it would not taint you at all.

141
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,420
Who is that military prosecutor?

142
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,510
I cannot tell you!

143
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,830
Do you think I won't be able to figure out who a measly military prosecutor is?

144
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:54,070
Mother, I really don't want to go to the military.

145
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,800
I will never come to the place where you are.

146
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,520
Even if I die trying.

147
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,020
Why did you report that I asked Do Bae Man to get me exempted from enlistment! Why?

148
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,280
You knew how she would react.

149
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,000
Are you doing this deliberately because you want to see me go insane?

150
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,600
Come here now. Immediately.

151
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,120
Congratulations.

152
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,740
Our General No is wearing a uniform which fits her so perfectly.

153
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,500
Please have a seat.

154
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,790
General.

155
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:55,560
My sincere congratulations. Unity!

156
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,870
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

157
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,890
Welcome.

158
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:09,150
So this is what a female division leader's office looks like.

159
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,300
Congratulations, No Hwa Yeong.

160
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,460
Just kidding.

161
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,930
Division Commander, Loyalty!

162
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,740
The general is the first female division commander.

163
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,990
You truly are amazing.

164
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:31,710
If possible, please ignore all the useless talk

165
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,600
and just focus on the nation's safety.

166
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,430
When the division must stand upright, the nation's military—

167
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:42,610
Now is the beginning, the problems which we hesitated tackling all this time,

168
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,580
I am going to solve, one by one.

169
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:49,190
Didn't the army take forty years to change the water canteen?

170
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:53,660
Now that the times have changed, I'm going to create a new army.

171
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,000
I will start with the 4th Division.

172
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,640
I couldn't help it in my situation.

173
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,720
I'm sorry.

174
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,660
Huh? The situation?

175
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,850
I want to rip that mouth up, down and sideways.

176
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:19,370
Military boots stomped on me because of someone.

177
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:24,000
I must report to the general everything that happens in your personal life.

178
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,730
The general set that rule.

179
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:31,110
In every sentence, it is "general," "general."

180
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,650
Instead of working under me, you joined my mother, huh?

181
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,980
Don't be in the middle snitching to my mother!

182
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:46,000
Lawyer Yong Mun Gu, you don't lack for anything.

183
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,890
Sometimes when I think about it, I completely don't understand.

184
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:53,110
At this age, you don't have any family but you just stay next to my mom...

185
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:01,160
Don't tell me you like my mother?

186
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,550
Leave. Because I can't stand looking at you.

187
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,300
How did your visit to the hospital go?

188
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,900
What about the video?

189
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,500
Se Na doesn't have it. Allen has it.

190
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,900
Then I will confirm that myself.

191
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:31,950
Did you know Do Bae Man's female soldier bodyguard?

192
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,990
Female soldier?
 Hope

193
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:37,850
Are you saying you couldn't handle a female? Did she shoot you with a gun or something?

194
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,160
If I got shot, I wouldn't be upset.

195
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:47,140
That female soldier whipped all my kids with one windshield wiper.

196
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,800
Listen carefully. From now on I'm going to go alone.

197
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:59,420
Don't meddle with me whether I slice him into sashimi or run him over with a car.

198
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,610
Good timing.

199
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,380
Do Bae Man is going to be discharged in a few days.

200
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,380
After he is discharged from the army, he will be neither a soldier nor a prosecutor.

201
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,740
What does that mean?

202
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:15,010
Does that mean he will no longer have government authority?

203
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,390
He will be just a lawyer at best.

204
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:22,000
When that happens, the story will be different.

205
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,160
National Scientific, Criminal & Investigation Laboratory

206
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,850
- Please check if these two are the same wig.
- Yes.

207
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,500
When will the results be available?

208
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,440
Even if they were produced by the same factory, the results can differ depending on how they were used.

209
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,660
I think it will take some time to examine them thoroughly.

210
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,630
I understand.

211
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:53,130
Are you saying that Prosecutor Cha Wu In is involved in Allen's disappearance?

212
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:56,530
It came out of my mouth, but it's ridiculous.

213
00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:02,420
If the wig from her car and the wig hair from Allen's place are the same, the answer is obvious.

214
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:07,960
Why is the person who is being discharged the day after tomorrow so obsessed with Cha Wu In?

215
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:13,210
Because I want to be properly discharged the day after tomorrow.

216
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:18,990
If I find Allen and bring him to No Tae Nam, I'll definitely make a good impression on him.

217
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:22,770
Moreover, if I certainly make him get out of the draft, then—

218
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:23,960
Then?

219
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,050
It's not that I will be just a Law & One partner or anything.

220
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:30,550
Yong Mun Gu's position will become mine.

221
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,430
Oh... something is coming.

222
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,610
Then, is there something I should do?

223
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:43,140
If the red wig belongs to Cha Wu In, then she would have transported Allen's gang

224
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:47,800
and she would have used a 9 seater van. Find it.

225
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,300
Find out whose car it is and where it went.

226
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,210
Yes. What will you be doing, Prosecutor?

227
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,770
I am tracking Cha Wu In's real identity.

228
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,830
Is she really connected to Allen's disappearance?

229
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,500
If she is, what's the reason?

230
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:42,700
I would like to wear a jacket with it too.

231
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,040
What's this?

232
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:16,650
The dress is fine but I'm not sure about the length of the jacket.

233
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,550
Could I see another one?

234
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,130
Oh my.

235
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,710
What are you doing?

236
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,880
The bag is beautiful.

237
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,660
I'll buy it.

238
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,290
No, I'm buying this.

239
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:46,450
- What's the matter with you?
- Please, please, please.

240
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,660
What are you doing now?

241
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,670
- I'll pay for this.
- It is 7.8 million won. ( ~ $6,300 USD)

242
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,020
7.8 million won.

243
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,900
Twelve monthly installments.

244
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,420
A present to celebrate my discharge.

245
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,900
There's still a place that copies and sells these.

246
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,740
Where is the place? So I would go and arrest them.

247
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,210
To my sorrow, it's genuine.

248
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,490
My bloody money.

249
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,700
Isn't it a knock-off?

250
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,530
Genuine?

251
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,030
Look at how fast you are.

252
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,070
OMG. Bae Man.

253
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,540
Bae Man!

254
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,550
The bags must be happy.

255
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:44,540
Women like them that much.

256
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,810
OMG.

257
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,960
When you're about to finish your service term,

258
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,160
I see you have become a proper filial child.

259
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,620
I'm done now with struggling.

260
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,180
Bae Man. When you come out of the army,

261
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,760
will you change this every season?

262
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,600
Depending on your behavior toward me.

263
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,760
Rice.

264
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:22,310
Oh, right. A military prosecutor came to our station a while ago about the incident.

265
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,610
- A military prosecutor?
- That's what I said.

266
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:29,320
Do you know how much I restrained myself from asking if she knew Military Prosecutor Do Bae Man?

267
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,300
There are a lot of military prosecutors. I'm not interested in the least.

268
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,080
Now I'm not even going to pee in the military's direction.

269
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,960
Is that so, civilian?

270
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,050
- Rice!
- I forgot.

271
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:44,270
Management Personnel Record

272
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,920
Period / School List and Major Degree

273
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:51,150
There's no record for three years after she dropped out of Stanford Law School in the US.

274
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:59,040
There should be an answer to this three-year gap, Cha Wu In.

275
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,060
Yes?

276
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,550
Are you Military Prosecutor Do Bae Man?

277
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,370
Who is this?

278
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,780
I'm calling about my military service project.

279
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,390
Where are you now?

280
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,870
The Military Manpower Administration determines exemptions from military service?

281
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,070
That's right.

282
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:38,640
Is that possible when the body is so healthy?

283
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,670
Compulsory military service is basically a net that only the big fish escape.

284
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,320
It's just like court!

285
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,450
It's a strange net that only the small fry get caught in.

286
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,550
Make sure you get a medical certificate.

287
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:53,530
I'll personally take care of it so that you get the decision you want.

288
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:55,470
I'll pay for the net at a price you won't be disappointed with.

289
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:58,950
I don't need money. I want something else.

290
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,660
What is it? Tell me.

291
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,600
My medical school classmate committed a medical mistake.

292
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,030
He's been indicted in your division.

293
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,410
The division I'm in?

294
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,990
If a military prosecutor makes up his mind to create a criminal,

295
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,650
even if searches and seizures in dozens of places are conducted and the bill of indictment is changed,

296
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,760
he can make you the worst criminal.

297
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,260
Of course, the opposite is also possible.

298
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:28,020
If the military prosecutor intentionally loses at trial, my friend can be acquitted, right?

299
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,310
As if nothing ever happened.

300
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,490
How close is a friendship that you would dare to make a deal with a military prosecutor?

301
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:44,270
It's amazing.

302
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,380
Friendship, my foot.

303
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,490
In a little while, my service term will end.

304
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:51,560
If I want to get a job at the hospital where the punk's father is the director.

305
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,120
- I need to show at least some sincerity.
- Is it because of employment?

306
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,830
After I see the outcome of the trial, I will take care of the enlistment issue. Bye.

307
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,190
Hey.

308
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:04,870
Are you certain your friend committed a medical mistake?

309
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,540
Yes.

310
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,530
How are you so certain?

311
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:12,550
He shouldn't have become a doctor in the first place.

312
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,840
The Private First Class Hwang Cheol Seung Medical Incident Case

313
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:19,770
Let me brief you on the Private Hwang Cheol Seung medical incident.

314
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:23,460
Private Hwang Cheol Seung enjoyed good health since he was born.

315
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:27,180
While playing soccer at a military training ground, he suddenly developed paralysis.

316
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,710
He was immediately transported to a military hospital.

317
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:32,060
The diagnosis was limb paralysis.

318
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,490
What was the cause?

319
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:37,440
The day before he collapsed, he had visited a military clinic with mild spinal disc symptoms.

320
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,730
It seems the treatment he received was the reason.

321
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,630
He is a quadriplegic.

322
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:46,590
The military doctor who was indicted stubbornly denies the charges.
Captain Jeong Wi Chan

323
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,110
Okay.

324
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:52,530
Let's start the investigation. Let's hear the victim's statement first.

325
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:55,170
What? Are you taking charge of the case?

326
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:58,130
I thought Cha Wu In is the prosecutor.

327
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:01,550
I'll do it because it's my first case since I was commissioned as a military prosecutor.

328
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:05,920
I'll wrap up my tenure as a military prosecutor with this as my last case.

329
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:10,500
Why? What is it? Is there a problem?

330
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,930
All right. Then you take over with me next to you.

331
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,440
Where is Private Hwang now?

332
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,900
He couldn't trust a military hospital so he is in a civilian hospital.

333
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,650
Jeongmundae University Hospital

334
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,240
Mom.

335
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,450
I'm sorry.

336
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:52,040
Don't cry, Mom.

337
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,320
I'm not crying.

338
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:00,260
I am going to stand up.

339
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:03,390
Don't worry.

340
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:20,940
I'm Prosecutor Cha Wu In from the 4th Division's Military Service Office.

341
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,820
Prosecutor, please help my son.

342
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:32,000
Can you give a statement?

343
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,910
Yes.

344
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:51,700
There was an argument between a military doctor and a military nurse.

345
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,560
Doctor, are you drunk?

346
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:59,000
What are you talking about? Of course, I'm not drunk.

347
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,200
You are drunk. How can you see a patient?

348
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,900
How can you be nagging me?

349
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,260
I can do it alone without you. Get out!

350
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,190
- What's your name?
- Private Hwang Cheol Seung

351
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:13,610
Roll up your sleeve.

352
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,220
Ethanol

353
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,750
Military doctor drunk

354
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:22,920
Are you saying a military doctor treated you when he was drunk?

355
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,090
Yes.

356
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:28,030
We need to get the nurse's statement.

357
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,750
I'll see you again.

358
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,620
It's true that I wasn't in the doctor's office at the time.

359
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,510
We didn't have an argument over the doctor being drunk.

360
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:58,900
Private Hwang's statement is different. He was certain that he smelled alcohol.

361
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,970
I'm sure that was some sort of misunderstanding.

362
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:05,800
Could he have confused the smell of alcohol with the hospital's alcohol?

363
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,890
Yes, right.

364
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,960
Why did you leave the clinic?

365
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,230
Since you didn't have an argument with the doctor?

366
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:15,040
I'm certain you went to another clinic because they were understaffed, right?

367
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,320
Yes.

368
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,960
Military clinics lack both equipment and personnel.

369
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,740
The number of sick soldiers is overwhelming.

370
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:28,220
You know that obstructing the investigation by perjury increases the severity of the crime, right?

371
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,570
There was nothing wrong with the doctor.

372
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:33,070
He gave routine treatment.

373
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:53,120
Did you answer... properly?

374
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:56,160
I did as I was told.

375
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,960
Good job.

376
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,570
You drank and administered treatment that day, didn't you?

377
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:08,350
No, I didn't. I can't drink a drop of alcohol.

378
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,820
I lack the enzyme to metabolize alcohol.

379
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:14,090
Private Hwang made a statement.

380
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:17,980
Do you believe what a quadriplegic patient says?

381
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,970
Before the symptoms are fully manifested, it starts with the sensory organs.

382
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:25,650
Look here. A normal soldier became a quadriplegic because of your treatment.

383
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:29,480
What is this? You're painting me as a quack when I'm doing volunteer service?

384
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,450
Hey. Calm down.

385
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:35,000
Because this is the army, even if you do your best for the country,

386
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,470
we will pick up and check even a small mistake.

387
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:41,230
What are you saying right now?

388
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:43,930
This prosecutor knows something.

389
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:47,760
I mean all patients are like that. They don't know their own condition.

390
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,390
In the first place, he had serious disc symptoms. I am sure it was irritating his nerves.

391
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:56,890
So, the disk condition was left untreated and the nerves became paralyzed, right?

392
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:00,490
- Without any treatment.
- Yes. That's exactly it.

393
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:04,620
There are many people who look normal but are internally sick.

394
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,060
Such patients are bombs. Bombs.

395
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:10,950
If you treat them without knowing it, you'll be all blamed like me.

396
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,900
Is that what you want to say as a doctor?

397
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,800
Is a doctor some kind of god?

398
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,940
How can I foresee abnormalities occurring within a patient's body?

399
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:24,630
No matter whether you fly or crawl,

400
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,360
can you predict the results of your next trial?

401
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,590
You don't know.

402
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,770
I don't know. I don't know. That, I don't know.

403
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,360
I don't know that.

404
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:40,390
Are you trying to investigate or are you provoking me?

405
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,950
Our Prosecutor Cha needs to learn how to look at the big picture.

406
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,850
You have to predict in advance the opposing lawyer's next move to prevail in court.

407
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:52,810
So in the interrogation room, did you play your role as a military doctor's lawyer?

408
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,310
I mean, in front of the doctor, you couldn't get a word in.

409
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,600
Why are you taking it out on me?

410
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,200
At that level, can you fight with a defense attorney?

411
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,900
That's why I said I would take charge of this case, my friend.

412
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:09,190
If you aren't confident, don't come to the trial.

413
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,580
General Court for Armed Forces

414
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,750
Prosecutor, begin your examination.

415
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,200
General Court for Armed Forces

416
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,700
Private First Class Hwang Cheol Seung

417
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,990
How did this happen to Private Hwang,

418
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:31,080
who visited a military clinic for treatment of a herniated disk?

419
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,530
The reason is right here.

420
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:40,790
One vial contains a contrast agent and the other contains ethanol.

421
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:43,560
The contrast agent is used for nerve block surgery.

422
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,950
It's a drug that makes your tissues and nerves visible.

423
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:51,530
The ethanol is a liquid to prevent steam from forming on medical devices.

424
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:56,400
Could the defendant distinguish between the ethanol and the contrast agent?

425
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:00,250
There are no labels on identical containers.

426
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:04,040
That's very possible.

427
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,630
Oh, is that so?

428
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,820
Contrast medium and ethanol have different viscosity,

429
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,460
so you can distinguish between them with the naked eye.

430
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:19,510
The feeling is very different when you inject either into a patient with a syringe.

431
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:24,490
Then, could you possibly distinguish between them if you were very drunk?

432
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:29,730
If you are not completely sober, what is the probability of exchanging ethanol for contrast medium?

433
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:32,000
A nurse who was at the scene at the time

434
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,570
is testifying that the defendant did not administer treatment while drunk.

435
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:36,680
I will submit the statement of the nurse.

436
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,730
Then I will submit my records too.

437
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,810
It states that the level of ethanol detected in the victim's body was above the standard level

438
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:46,350
There are many cases in which alcohol is detected in the body.

439
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:50,390
Alcohol is also detected in bread or health supplements fermented with yeast.

440
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:53,050
It cannot be evidence that it is the cause of the mishap.

441
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,650
Judge

442
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,430
The evidence is admitted.

443
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,810
Defendant

444
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:01,500
Prosecutor

445
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:12,820
I heard from my client friend.

446
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,820
- Yes.
- Then, please be gentle.

447
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:20,090
I was a little nervous because you came on stronger than I expected.

448
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:25,990
If you're going to cheat, you have to cheat properly. A trial is not a joke.

449
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:29,030
That's true.

450
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:40,340
I've set up a witness. It will be all over if you set the tempo to moderate.

451
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:45,460
You will surely receive the winning payment too.

452
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,980
The witness?

453
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,880
I understand.

454
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,080
Then, please take good care of us until the end.

455
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:01,250
Judge, I'm requesting a witness.

456
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:05,350
Which witness? A witness will not be allowed.

457
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,180
I didn't know a witness was requested for today by the military prosecutor.

458
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:14,230
The witness just contacted me that he would testify.

459
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:17,040
What do you think, defense attorney?

460
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:21,590
Of course, I can not accept that. I didn't get any prior notice.

461
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:26,090
As difficult as it was to persuade the witness, who must risk his position,

462
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:30,280
it wasn't easy for the witness to make his own decision.

463
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:34,800
Lawyer, what do you think? Should we allow the witness?
Judges' Bench

464
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,690
All right.

465
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:39,790
Witness, please enter.

466
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,030
There won't be a problem.

467
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:54,420
That prosecutor is very meticulous.

468
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,810
Trial in session

469
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:06,090
Witness, please introduce yourself.

470
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:09,350
I'm serving as a military doctor in the Military Manpower Administration.

471
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:12,730
- What's your relationship to the accused?
- We were close classmates in medical school.

472
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:16,620
- Then, did the two of you have drinking parties often?
- Yes.

473
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:21,070
Did you meet the defendant early on the day of the incident?

474
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,380
I met him.

475
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:25,860
After meeting him then, did you drink alcohol with him?

476
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:34,770
Yes. We drank together.

477
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:41,780
The defendant denied that he drank on the day he treated the victim.

478
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,360
You're offering completely contradictory testimony.

479
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,720
I'm positive. He drank with me.

480
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,400
Hey, what are you saying, bastard?

481
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,040
I object. The witness is committing perjury.

482
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,510
I'll submit evidence to show it is not perjury.

483
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:57,590
It's four hours before the incident.

484
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:02,150
When I asked the bar, they drank two bottles of liquor and four bottles of beer.

485
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:07,330
I hereby submit the receipt for the bill provided by the witness.

486
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,940
If we divided by two, the blood alcohol concentration per person is 0.3.

487
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,460
At that level it is difficult to stand properly.

488
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:19,610
It takes twenty-one hours to break down alcohol in the human body.

489
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:22,910
The two left the bar at 4:30 a.m.

490
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:26,760
Private Hwang was treated at 9:20 a.m.

491
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:34,150
It's not enough time for a doctor to treat a patient after drinking alcohol.

492
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:38,790
The cause of Private Hwang's paralysis is because the drunk defendant

493
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:41,870
mistakenly injected him with ethanol.

494
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:47,110
Due to the defendant's unbelievable error,

495
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:50,890
a strong Korean soldier will be bedridden

496
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:53,620
for the rest of his life.

497
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,280
Have you no conscience?

498
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,490
Please answer.

499
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,580
Hey, what are you doing now?

500
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:04,100
Do you have it or not?

501
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:22,220
In order to relieve one soldier's resentment,

502
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:26,810
as a doctor who saves lives, the witness came here after thinking for a long time.

503
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:30,680
Please take that into consideration.

504
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:39,580
Lawyer, do you have any further defense?

505
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,390
There is none.

506
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:50,150
Why don't you try to put the lid on the coffin and nail it down for your military doctor friend?

507
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:54,480
I clearly told you to make him innocent.

508
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,550
While investigating the incident, I unearthed the relationship between you two.

509
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:02,580
You were a talented resident,

510
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:05,570
but unexpectedly there were records of several medical accidents.

511
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:09,740
On the other hand, the military doctor friend's accident record was clean.

512
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:12,550
Then, there's only one answer.

513
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,920
Reverse the accident records. You were used before.

514
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,800
It wasn't a friendship, but a master-servant relationship.

515
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,030
If you enter his father's hospital, you will have to continue to live as you do now.

516
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:28,170
Anyway, I can't go into another hospital without connections.

517
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:31,540
The VIP you are working for is

518
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:37,180
Chairman No Tae Nam. He will send you to a much better position.

519
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,300
Chairman No of IM Defense?

520
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,800
But I can't testify.

521
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,140
Then I'll force you to be on the witness stand.

522
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,100
Did you forget that I'm a military prosecutor?

523
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,400
You tried to buy a military prosecutor to cover up your friend's crimes.

524
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,670
You said that first.

525
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:56,220
I told you.

526
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:01,540
The role of the prosecutor in this country is to make anyone they want into a guilty person.

527
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,980
Add to that the military as well or more.

528
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,570
Just what made you change your mind?

529
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:09,760
Chairman No should be exempted without any problem.

530
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,310
But your friend is annoying.

531
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:16,850
If you can be stabbed in the back anytime, that's tough.

532
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:21,190
Just state everything exactly as it happened.

533
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:23,580
If you make even just one mistake,

534
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:27,570
you will be the first to be abandoned.

535
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,790
You arranged a witness without a word to me.

536
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:43,800
He wasn't on the investigation list. Aren't you going to explain?

537
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,100
We won. What more is there to explain?

538
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:52,290
Military Prosecutor Do Bae Man, are you a righteous prosecutor or

539
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,390
are you a clever prosecutor?

540
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,160
Righteous?

541
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:02,110
I hear that question often nowadays.

542
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:07,200
Are you confident you can distinguish between right and wrong?

543
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,700
Isn't a prosecutor a defender of justice?

544
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:14,920
No. If you're on my side, that's my definition. Okay?

545
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:19,760
It sounds just like Military Prosecutor Do Bae Man.

546
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,470
Did you just find out?

547
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:34,030
It was very unusual that a military court in a trial involving medical malpractice on a private

548
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:37,120
to sentence the defendant to 4 years and 6 months in prison.

549
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,930
Meanwhile, the personal history of the military prosecutor who was victorious at trial is a hot topic.

550
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:45,470
Do Bae Man recently investigated the son of a Gusan Bank for receiving emperor service.

551
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:48,630
He's been in charge of several such incidents...

552
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:51,780
Is that the military prosecutor who wants to get an exemption from the draft for Tae Nam?

553
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,120
It is.

554
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,700
He's my subordinate.

555
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,090
Aide Yang!

556
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:05,480
Schedule a meeting with the chief of the division's legal office and Military Prosecutor Do Bae Man.

557
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,300
Yes, I will.

558
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,840
What are you intending?

559
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,370
He must be warned.

560
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,010
Find the videos first.

561
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,820
I will.

562
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:41,810
Please save us.

563
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:45,220
Save us!

564
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:43,080
What is this place?
Kang's Solution

565
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,930
Leaving the parking lot at the estimated time of the incident, there was only one 9-passenger van.

566
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:00,240
Who is the owner?

567
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,970
It was in the name of a company. It's a defense contractor called Kang's Solution.

568
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:05,200
Kang's Solution.

569
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:08,110
Got it.

570
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:17,130
How many floors up is she going?

571
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:21,790
Thirty.

572
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,030
The CEO's name is Kang Ha Jun.

573
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:42,160
He is an up and coming very competent businessman

574
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,150
in his late 20's in the mobile industry at a young age.

575
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,830
Are you still wearing that watch?

576
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:53,900
It saved my life.

577
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,270
I exchanged it for my life.

578
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:59,740
New York 7 Years ago

579
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:11,040
What did the boss tell us to bring, anyway?

580
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,480
I don't know.

581
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,660
Looks pretty expensive, isn't it?

582
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:20,330
No, no, no, no. What's inside is expensive, you idiots.

583
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,780
Excuse me.

584
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:28,340
Hey, you're just making a gambling program with such a smart brain?

585
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:31,100
While getting a scholarship from my dad?

586
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,170
- Yo!
- Huh?

587
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:34,500
Are you this dog's chick?

588
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,010
What?

589
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:43,220
Well, I hadn't met him before, but he's not my type at all.

590
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,150
You're my type, baby.

591
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:48,260
For the record, I'm no match for you guys.

592
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:51,290
You guys are a team, but I'm just by myself.

593
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:53,110
And...

594
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:57,660
Hit 'em hard. You never.

595
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:08,790
Do I?

596
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:17,100
Take care.

597
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:21,540
Damn, it's all screwed up.

598
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:37,520
Do you know how expensive that program is?

599
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,530
- Hey, are you feeling sorry for yourself?

600
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:45,500
With that smart brain, are you going to live by writing a program to look at other people's cards?

601
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:48,720
I was trying to earn money to start a business.

602
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,760
Then you can get it from my dad.

603
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,910
What?

604
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:57,900
He told me to bring you. He will invest in that smart brain.

605
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:04,600
I'm thinking about the chairman. I miss him more today.

606
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:08,960
I'm sure he has seen us cleaning the trash, hasn't he?

607
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:15,660
It's over. Come and clean it up for me.

608
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:41,240
What about him? Has there been any progress?

609
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:46,950
I was certain that he is someone I need for my plan.

610
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:51,610
I can't respect him, but I can't help but be amazed at him.

611
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:56,200
Cleaning the trash...

612
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:01,260
Did Kang Ha Jun help kidnap Allen?

613
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,260
- Sang Gi?
- Yes, Military Prosecutor.

614
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:15,390
I think I matched all the puzzle pieces of Allen's kidnapping.

615
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,250
Kang's Solution

616
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,270
The incident happened around 10 pm the night before the 12th.

617
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:29,570
It was at Cartel, the club in Gangnam.

618
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:33,030
No Tae Nam and Allen were drinking.

619
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:38,480
Allen brought a girl called Han Se Na there.

620
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,520
Se Na was raped.

621
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,630
She then headed over to the police all beaten up to report it.

622
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:51,180
The person Se Na asked for help from was...

623
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,600
Se Na!

624
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,870
Cha Wu In.

625
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:59,020
Allen played cards with his friends the next day.

626
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:03,590
- Fifty!
- He didn't give a second thought about what he did day before.

627
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:05,360
But then...

628
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:11,190
an unexpected visitor came by.

629
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,670
Cha Wu In can beat up a bunch of thugs with a windshield wiper.

630
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:17,790
Five drunk guys would've been a piece of cake for her.

631
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:22,130
In the process of moving the unconscious guys, an accomplice appears.

632
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,680
The identity of the accomplice

633
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,330
is Kang's Solution's CEO, Kang Ha Jun.

634
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,800
Cha Wu In and Kang Ha Jun

635
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:37,140
know each other through her father.

636
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:38,920
If we dig into Kang Ha Jun deeper,

637
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:42,150
I think we'll learn something about Cha Wu In.

638
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,160
This is everything I figured out...

639
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,380
about Allen's kidnapping case so far.

640
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:54,250
The results came out one hour ago.

641
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:58,100
The conclusion is that Cha Wu In's red hair wig matches the hair at the scene.

642
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:04,850
In the end, it happened because of Han Se Na.

643
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,220
She dealt with this way too disproportionately.

644
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,860
Or...

645
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:13,720
there may be other reasons behind it.

646
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:18,320
So what do you intend to do now?

647
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,840
What else?

648
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,660
I'll have to arrest Cha Wu In

649
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:25,660
so that there are no setbacks to my discharge.

650
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,570
Are you searching for this?

651
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,670
Who are you?

652
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:07,570
It seems like you have bad soundproofing.

653
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:10,010
Let's keep things down.

654
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:15,170
We've met before, so don't be too surprised.

655
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,770
I am Chairman No Tae Nam's Lawyer.

656
00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:20,660
Get out.

657
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:23,550
Get out now. I'll report to the police.

658
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:36,760
I know you didn't call your mother on purpose because you were afraid of causing harm to her.

659
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,850
It's been a while since you heard your mother's voice, right?

660
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:41,390
You should give her a call now.

661
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,870
Aigoo, Se Na, I'm surprised you called.

662
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:56,640
You never call me first.

663
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,040
Mom...

664
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,480
Are you eating well?

665
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,260
Did something happen?

666
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:05,980
I'm just... curious how you are doing.

667
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:08,870
I barely do anything, I'm starting to feel bad.

668
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:12,110
They might think I'm a chair warmer.

669
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:14,390
I'll call you again, Mom. I'm sorry.

670
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:17,800
What are you sorry for? I know you're busy.

671
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,820
I love you, Sweetie.

672
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:41,280
Do you have the video?

673
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,450
I don't.

674
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:46,610
Even if you don't have the video,

675
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:49,910
it'd better not...

676
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,820
see the light of day.

677
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:57,920
Your mother's life depends on your choice, Se Na.

678
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,710
Goodbye then.

679
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:19,090
Attention. Salute.

680
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:21,640
- Unity!
- Unity!

681
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:22,750
Down.

682
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:24,340
Major Seo Ju Hyeok.

683
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:26,860
Captain Do Bae Man.

684
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,280
At ease.

685
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:34,920
I've received the report on the big medical accident case you solved.

686
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,860
Captain Do Bae Man will be discharged soon.

687
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:39,560
It's a shame we'll lose a talented man like him to civil court.

688
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,220
What's your plan once in the civilian world?

689
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:46,530
I plan to work as a lawyer at a civil law firm.

690
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:50,250
Lawyers nowadays need to be specialized in a field to make it.

691
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:52,850
I'm sure your experience in the military will be useful.

692
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:54,730
Yes, ma'am.

693
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:01,400
I heard in the civilian world, there are lawyers who help with evading the draft.

694
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:05,870
Meaning as lawyers, they do something illegal brokers do.

695
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:14,860
Tell me, are you possibly interested in doing that too?

696
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,340
As a soldier and prosecutor of the 4th Division,

697
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:26,150
I have seen and learned many things.

698
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:30,250
My body may be leaving, but I won't forget my esprit de corps.

699
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:35,700
I'm just deeply saddened that I won't be serving you.

700
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,900
All right.

701
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:47,600
I'll see you when you report your discharge, Captain Do Bae Man.

702
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:07,870
My client...

703
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,470
I'm in a meeting, so why don't you wait outside?

704
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:17,430
Will you be okay with me talking here?

705
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:19,110
Because I don't mind.

706
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:21,160
What shall I do?

707
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,290
Man, I haven't seen your face like that in a while.

708
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:41,100
You had the same expression when I first brought you here.

709
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:45,880
I'll report three matters which concern Chairman No Tae Nam.

710
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,740
Fine, go ahead.

711
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:50,620
First. I've obtained information

712
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:53,710
on the suspect who drove the car that kidnapped Allen.

713
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:56,010
I think I can find Allen by today.

714
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:58,160
- Okay.
- Second.

715
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,850
I'll be meeting Chairman No Tae Nam at Cartel today.

716
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:05,340
He told me to tell you not to join.

717
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:09,000
- What's the third matter?
- Third.

718
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,400
It's my last report.

719
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,620
After this day,

720
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:16,450
I will not be making any reports to you after today.

721
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:24,650
Do you mean you'll be cutting ties with me from now?

722
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:26,480
That's correct.

723
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,320
What's your reason?

724
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:31,000
You shouldn't have told Division Commander of all people.

725
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,140
The fact that I'm in charge of Chairman No's draft evasion project.

726
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:36,720
Are you that unhappy about me gaining Chairman No's confidence?

727
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,780
Did you think General No wouldn't find out even if I didn't tell her?

728
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,180
I'm going to join hands with Chairman No Tae Nam now.

729
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:49,330
Directly without a middleman.

730
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,320
So it's all my fault

731
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:57,180
that our business is over?

732
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:00,380
I guess I gave you a good excuse.

733
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:03,190
Fine, I can accept that.

734
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:05,580
But let me give you a heads up.

735
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:10,470
You've messed with the thing General No Hwa Yeong is most sensitive about.

736
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:14,600
That method will never gain you my position.

737
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:48,570
My gosh.

738
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:52,250
How many of you peed your pants?

739
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,510
Sorry I'm late. I left right away from the station.

740
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:01,320
It's okay.

741
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:06,500
We can't get in contact with Se Na, so I was about to call you anyway.

742
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,910
I asked to meet because of that also.

743
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,220
It's the video they filmed from that day.

744
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:19,050
I just received it from Se Na.

745
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:21,210
It won't be difficult

746
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:23,490
getting an arrest warrant for Chairman No Tae Nam.

747
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:29,460
Cartel

748
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,970
I left the key inside.

749
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,780
I looked into cars under Kang's Solution and found Allen.

750
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:50,290
These guys look a total mess.

751
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:52,640
All right, good job.

752
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:56,010
I arrived at Cartel to meet with Chairman No.

753
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:59,070
Bring those punks safely to Seoul.

754
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,170
I found Allen.

755
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:14,290
I knew you could do it.

756
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:16,660
Come here and have a drink.

757
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,410
Oh, okay.

758
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:27,050
It's an honor, sir.

759
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:39,750
About my draft evasion project—

760
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:44,480
Even with the Division Commander watching, if you want it done, I'll make sure it happens.

761
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:48,680
That's the spirit! I didn't ask to be born as a general's son.

762
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:50,540
Why do I have to go when everyone isn't?

763
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:53,040
That's exactly what I'm saying.

764
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:57,410
Don't worry. We just need someone to approve it.

765
00:57:57,410 --> 00:57:59,650
And I've already found the person for it.

766
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:02,910
But...

767
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:06,800
Allen dislocated his shoulder. I don't want to use such an unsophisticated method.

768
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,730
I'm too scared to even go to the dentist.

769
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:11,290
The medical issue is only for document purposes.

770
00:58:11,290 --> 00:58:15,010
You'll get free passage, Chairman.

771
00:58:15,010 --> 00:58:19,960
I really like the way you work. You're different from Lawyer Yong who's always worrying about Mom.

772
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,760
But...

773
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:26,220
I heard 'Gunbari' means,

774
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:29,350
"dog that protects the country."

775
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:36,560
Yes, that's right.

776
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:41,670
Doberman. A faithful dog that'll rip into anyone for his master.

777
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:46,420
That's exactly you. Your name is Doberman too!

778
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:55,110
All right.

779
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:57,690
You're aware

780
00:58:57,690 --> 00:59:02,760
that my IM Defense is the best in the defense industry.

781
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:08,130
You must always be in need of someone who knows the ins and outs of the military.

782
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:12,320
I can't leave it to my mother's shadow, Lawyer Yong.

783
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:17,910
On top of that, he reports everything about me to Mother.

784
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:19,900
Gosh, you have a lot of hardships too.

785
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,300
- Which is why...
- Yes.

786
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:28,320
I'm thinking of having you take over my company's legal team.

787
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:38,420
Chairman. Thank you. Thank you, sir! I'll do my best.

788
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:40,190
Here.

789
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:42,070
Don't get ahead of yourself.

790
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:45,740
It's under the condition that you succeed in making me draft exempt.

791
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:47,690
Yes, of course!

792
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:53,720
Please, pick up. I'm going to go use the bathroom.

793
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:01,450
Hyung Tae Nam. It's me, Allen.

794
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:05,350
A red-haired wench beat me up and took the video!

795
01:00:05,350 --> 01:00:08,440
You're still there, right? We have to find the video.

796
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:12,520
If it's leaked, it'll be over for both you and me. Do something!

797
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,380
Anything is possible with you, right?

798
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:16,550
The red-haired wench has the video?

799
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:18,640
Yes. The red-haired—

800
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,550
Lawyer Yong Mun Gu

801
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:22,530
I'm hanging up.

802
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:27,730
The police are going to raid Cartel soon.

803
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:29,460
What did you say?

804
01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:39,420
Team A will go this way and Team B that way. Let's go.

805
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:41,390
- Yes, ma'am!
- Yes, ma'am.

806
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:48,400
What's going on?

807
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:53,530
I tailed after Do Bae Man but there are a bunch of cops.

808
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:56,320
What in the world is going on?

809
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:58,690
There are so many.

810
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,910
Auntie. Damn.

811
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,280
What the hell?

812
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:26,910
- We're executing our duty. Get the dog out now!
- Executing your duties?

813
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:29,340
Do you not know who I am?

814
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:33,660
We know you very well, No Tae Nam.

815
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:35,760
This is an emergency arrest warrant.

816
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,950
We've received a video reporting you. Come with us.

817
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:43,690
Hey, Bolt. Bite them. Quickly, go!

818
01:01:43,690 --> 01:01:46,060
My gosh.

819
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:48,470
Hey, you punk! Where do you think you're going?

820
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:50,950
- Cuff him.
- Yes, ma'am.

821
01:01:52,330 --> 01:01:56,720
You. I'm going to remember your face. You just wait.

822
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,030
- Take him.
- Okay.

823
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:00,710
Let me go!

824
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:22,480
Hey, you! Stop there.

825
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,180
Come here for a second.

826
01:02:29,170 --> 01:02:31,360
That bastard!

827
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:14,050
Oh, thank you!

828
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,150
- Stop right there!
- Catch him!

829
01:03:30,790 --> 01:03:34,510
- What are you doing? Why aren't you stepping on the gas and chasing him? Get going!
- Yes, Hyeongnim.

830
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:37,860
♫ Hey, watch out y'all. I'm a little out of control ♫

831

833

Let's go. Come on.

862
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:54,680
What's happening?

863
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:57,740
What's going on?

864
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:04,400
Cha Wu In.

865
01:07:11,050 --> 01:07:13,060
The red-haired girl.

866
01:07:14,590 --> 01:07:16,660
I knew my instinct was right.

867
01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:28,450
It wasn't a coincidence...

868
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,900
that I found the wig in your car, was it?

869
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:33,950
It was bait.

870
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:42,780
Most people think you make your own decisions in life. But that's wrong.

871
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:46,810
Even those decisions are a part of your fate.

872
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:51,210
That's because from the start,

873
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:54,790
you had no freedom to refuse your fate.

874
01:07:54,790 --> 01:07:58,980
Military Prosecutor Do Bae Man. You can't get discharged.

875
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:03,080
You'll have to stay and fight with me.

876
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:08,550
That's your fate, Prosecutor Do.

877
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:14,060
♫ This time won't be the last and same like that before ♫

878
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:18,840
♫ Do whatever you want. Yeah I don't care ♫

879
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:22,690
♫ It's obvious that I'm holding my breath. ♫

880
01:08:22,690 --> 01:08:25,590
♫ What you gonna do ♫

881
01:08:25,590 --> 01:08:29,380
♫ I'm on fire like I'm gonna burn down ♫

882
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:32,640
♫ Cuz you know there's no way to stop ♫

883
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:36,960
Military Prosecutor Doberman

884
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:40,650
♫ My style without hesitation, you can't stop me ♫

885
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:45,340
♫ No chance, you can't get away now ♫

886
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:47,720
Tell me. Why did you try to kill me?

887
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,700
I'm waiting for you to wake up from oblivion.

888
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:53,190
Don't spit in the water you're drinking.

889
01:08:53,190 --> 01:08:55,750
Do Bae Man ran by himself, that military bastard.

890
01:08:55,750 --> 01:09:00,120
Chairman No Tae Nam will be dropping all of his titles related to IM Defense.

891
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:02,130
- IM is my everything.
- Don't fool yourself.

892
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:05,780
Unfortunately for you, you have lost everything because you betrayed me.

893
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:08,460
I'll start over from the bottom.

894
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:13,200
You'll figure out why we have to fight together.

895
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:17,950
♫ Even if you try to stop me ♫

896
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:21,180
♫ Oh there's no way to stop ♫
