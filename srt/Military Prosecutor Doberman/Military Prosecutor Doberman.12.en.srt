♫ This time won't be the last ♫

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,040
♫ and same like that before ♫

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,800
♫ Cuz you know there's no way to stop ♫

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,480
♫ Feels like I'm losing control ♫

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,560
♫ My style without hesitation ♫

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,080
♫ You can't stop me ♫

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,290
Military Prosecutor Doberman

8
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,060
Have you heard of an offer you can't refuse?

9
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,060
An irresistible offer.

10
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,510
Don't play with words. That's like a threat.

11
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,610
Just get lost.

12
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:51,390
It's ironic, isn't it?

13
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,980
If there hadn't been Cha Wu In, your company could not have grown this large.

14
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,960
Now because of her, the company reached this level.

15
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,530
Do you mean that because of Wu In, my company became your target?

16
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:12,400
I'm going to give you a chance just as Chairman Cha Ho Cheol did.

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,300
If you don't hold my hand, your Kang's Solution will disappear like dust.

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,370
Think first about the people who dedicated themselves to you and to the company.

19
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:27,040
You have done enough for the Cha family.

20
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,520
Then I'll look forward to your response.

21
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,500
Only soldiers make war.

22
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:44,780
We businessmen have to make money through the war.

23
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,480
Corps Commander, I'm on my way to the official residence.

24
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:05,480
Now the trial is soon, so we must do a final check.

25
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,090
You did a great job being interrogated today.

26
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,780
Captain.

27
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,270
Is there anyone else to testify other than me?

28
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,460
Not yet.

29
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,540
There is one person but I can't contact him.

30
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,210
So will I be the only one in court?

31
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,460
Are you truly sure that you can win this trial?

32
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,610
We're fighting against Corps Commander Hong Mu Seop.

33
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,030
If we don't quit, we can definitely win.

34
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,510
Now that I've started fighting, I'm even more afraid.

35
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,950
I don't know if we can really deal with the commander.

36
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:59,090
Sergeant Sin. Other than his abuse of power trip, what else does he have?

37
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,600
Everything is fine so tell me everything.

38
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,090
Because I was so afraid,

39
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,990
there's something I didn't tell you.

40
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:23,430
Do Bae Man

41
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,360
Yes, Prosecutor Do.

42
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,860
Yes. I'll go immediately.

43
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,400
Welcome.
Episode 12

44
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,440
- Come and have a seat.
- Yes, Corps Commander.

45
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,260
As I said last time, the charges related to abuse of authority—

46
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,810
Can't you use some term other than abuse of authority?

47
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,650
The public sentiment is not positive.

48
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,280
Above all, I've never abused my authority.

49
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,080
Of course. When my heaven-like brother was here,

50
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,310
how could I do something like that?

51
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,010
All right.

52
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,290
If you defend it with it being work-related, there will be no problem.

53
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,890
For accusations that were beyond the scope of work duty,—

54
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:23,820
I just need to prove that there was no coercion.

55
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,280
Lastly, is there anything else I should prepare for the trial?

56
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,120
Prepare?

57
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,300
Are any other accusations that I don't know about?

58
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,650
Accusations?

59
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,900
Lawyer Yong.

60
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,060
You need to choose the appropriate word.

61
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,030
None.

62
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,340
Are you certain?

63
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:50,820
Even if there is something else, you must prove my innocence. Don't you agree?

64
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,000
For now, all right.

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,390
I won't ask any more awkward questions.

66
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,400
Because we are combining your experience as a lawyer

67
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,390
and my tight connections in the military,

68
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,360
the trial will never be lost, will it?

69
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,480
Of course not. I've put all my effort into this trial.

70
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,680
I knew you were one of the division commander's people,

71
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,320
but being with you for the past few days, I've changed my mind.

72
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,460
You saw me correctly.

73
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,560
I'll make sure you suffer no loss from this.

74
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,400
Just prepared to become chief of staff.

75
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,160
Then...

76
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,520
Shop-Closing Day

77
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,860
I'm Military Prosecutor Cha Wu In.

78
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:44,010
She's Prosecutor Cha whom I told you about before.

79
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,090
Now tell us.

80
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:55,150
It's okay. Take your time.

81
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,010
We need to know so we can help.

82
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:13,790
Please trust Prosecutor Do for this trial.

83
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,510
Wake up, Punk.

84
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:17,140
Are you saying you have been consistently beaten like that?

85
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,760
When did the beating start?

86
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:27,380
It was a month after I started working at the official residence.

87
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,380
Every Sunday midnight,

88
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,010
it was repeated.

89
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,430
Get it straight! Get it straight! Get it straight!

90
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,340
For his merciless assault,

91
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,650
you must make Hong Mu Seop pay for his crimes.

92
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,250
I'll get the medical certificates immediately.

93
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,940
What about the witness you couldn't contact?

94
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,100
I'm going to meet him personally.

95
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,370
Because this soldier is the only witness we have left.

96
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,040
Han Sam Su

97
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,440
Name, Han Sam Su. Officer's Driver.

98
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,740
He was discharged from the army nine months ago.

99
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,020
He was Hong Mu Seop's driver.

100
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,680
He was suddenly transferred to a front line artillery unit.

101
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,720
The commander's driver was holding heavy artillery, not the steering wheel?

102
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,770
I think it was a disciplinary action.

103
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,030
Excuse me.

104
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,890
We are from the Army's legal office.

105
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,120
Are you Han Sam Su?

106
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,600
Army's legal office? Why have you come to me?

107
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,330
You had worked for military commander Hong Mu Seop, right?

108
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,440
♫ Aw shit. What the hell motherf***

109
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,820
We came to see you because we need your testimony.

110
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,650
Testimony?

111
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:11,000
♫ Legal soldier? I don't care. I'm a citizen now.

112
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,790
♫ I don't need to say nothing.

113
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:17,350
♫ You guys don't have the right to make me do squat.

114
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,850
I mean—

115
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,950
Han Sam Su, please talk to us for a second.

116
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,850
♫ Hey Han Sam Su

117
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:29,360
♫ Hip Hop Star

118
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,380
♫ I know what you went through at the official residence. Shit.

119
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,210
♫ What do you know, you know? What the hell happened to me?

120
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,940
♫ I don't know. Normally I'm a loner. I tore up everything of the military color color color.

121
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,050
- ♫ You know what I'm saying?
- ♫ Oh, no.

122
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,580
♫ Even after you left the residence,

123
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,350
♫ the non-commissioned officers are still suffering there.

124
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,620
♫ We need to show the spirit of hip hop.

125
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,940
♫ The absurdity of your suffering. You can pay him back, majorly.

126
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,360
♫ Yo, cut the hip hop spirit out of this. It's all bullshit.

127
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,290
♫ The absurdity of my experience. I don't need any of that. Don't tell me.

128
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,590
♫ I can't return to those eighteen months.

129
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,870
♫ The army will never change, so just go back.

130
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,620
♫ Ah ha. The world changed.

131
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,820
♫ Let's say it was hard.

132
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,140
♫ So that the world can know.

133
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,500
♫ Don't keep it to yourself

134
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,260
♫ You might not be able to change the army,

135
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:25,590
♫ but I'm saying you can change it a little.

136
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:32,380
Mr. Han Sam Su, let's stop this.

137
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,440
Why don't you come with us?

138
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,950
Throw it over here.

139
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,230
Pass here.

140
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,180
Nice!

141
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,040
Heading!

142
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,350
Good job.

143
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,610
Kick it up!

144
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,840
Hurry up.

145
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:03,860
By the way, does Sergeant Ma like men?

146
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,810
No. He said he has a girlfriend.

147
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,670
Why?

148
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:12,050
Then a few days ago when you went to bed,

149
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,010
why were two of you in one sleeping bag?

150
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,980
Never ask that question again in the future.

151
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,170
Yes.

152
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,730
It's Sergeant Ma's last year. You just have to wait until the day he leaves.

153
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,420
I'll bear it until the end.

154
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,690
Bear it? Why are you bearing it?

155
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,130
Didn't I just tell you not to ask?

156
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,040
In the army there is a solution to every problem.

157
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,010
If you're sick, you can go to the infirmary.

158
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,950
If you're hungry, you can to the kitchen.

159
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,400
But there is just one,

160
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,060
just one problem where there is no countermeasure.

161
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,800
What is that?

162
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,410
Later. Later, I'll let you know.

163
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,610
Hey, even so, still be nice to Sergeant Ahn.

164
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,200
He's the nicest to me after you.

165
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:28,970
Although Sergeant Ahn was punished for receiving emperor service, he doesn't want any special treatment.

166
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:35,070
- Emp-Emperor service?
- Didn't you know?

167
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:39,530
He's as notorious as you are. He is the son of the president of Gusan Bank.

168
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,690
How unfair was it to the bank president's son?

169
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,940
You sent an innocent person to prison.

170
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,130
What's the matter? Have I committed some crime?

171
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,100
No.

172
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,640
- What breed is he?
- He's a Dobeman.

173
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,390
Do Bae Man?

174
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,810
Doberman. A Doberman Pinscher.

175
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,860
- What is his name?
- It is Bolt.

176
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,310
That's cool.

177
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:42,950
Hey, this is a necessity.

178
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,400
Put it on without letting your seniors know.

179
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,550
I'm fine. You put it on please.

180
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,310
You don't want it?

181
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,150
I'm fine.

182
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,580
The 4th Division's Corps Commander Hong Mu Seop,

183
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,820
who's been charged with abusing his power,

184
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,920
will go on trial later this afternoon at the general military court.

185
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,180
Under Defense Minister Lee Jae Sik's special command,

186
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,670
a special joint investigation team comprised of military prosecutors and civilian police was created.

187
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,820
His sister, Ms. Hong is being tried as a suspect simultaneously.

188
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,070
Her civilian status has attracted a lot of attention to this case.

189
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:26,160
Corps Commander Hong. Please tell us how you feel about the trial.

190
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,620
The court is a place where people are punished.

191
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,760
But it's also a place where they reveal untruthful claims.

192
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,100
I truly hope that the officer who worked at my official residence

193
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,810
will not be hurt by this trial.

194
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:44,540
Also, I will regain my honor and clear myself of all the misunderstandings.

195
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,760
- Thank you.
- Let's go, sir.

196
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,130
Do you have anything more to say to the victim?

197
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,380
She is my wife.

198
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,230
Say hello.

199
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,160
Hello, Military Prosecutors.

200
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,810
I'm glad you came.

201
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,090
Please take care of him.

202
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,780
I will.

203
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,630
- Go on up first.
- Okay.

204
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,150
Let's go.

205
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:36,130
Corps Commander. Just think it's a small hurdle you have to jump over before you become chief of staff.

206
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,710
Once you overcome this small hurdle,

207
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:41,740
you'll only be walking on cloud nine, as the young people would say.

208
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,360
You have a competent lawyer also.

209
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,180
I always felt more comfortable at military court than civilian ones.

210
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,300
The trial process is not complicated and the judgment is fast too.

211
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:59,040
My life felt so futile even just yesterday. I thought, "Is this what I became a soldier for?"

212
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,500
But I feel better after seeing you two.

213
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,280
Yes, come in.

214
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:15,060
Welcome, Military Prosecutors.

215
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:20,630
For custom's sake, I'm having you military prosecutors and the defense counsel

216
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,750
greet each other before the trial starts.

217
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:27,850
As you all know, the entire nation is watching this trial.

218
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:31,640
Please be cautious about every single comment that you make.

219
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,210
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

220
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,730
Let's start the trial.

221
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,810
I will start the trial now, sir.

222
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,980
Just get it over with quickly.

223
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:55,640
Military Prosecutor Do. Can we talk for a moment?

224
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,200
- Go on ahead.
- Okay.

225
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,530
You're going to do what you used to, right?

226
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,400
What do you mean?

227
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,690
You're going to do it like the last time, Military Prosecutor Do?

228
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:19,230
Calm down, Military Prosecutor.

229
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,740
Prosecutor

230
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,910
Oh. You'll see in court.

231
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,340
Trial in Session

232
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,660
Prosecutor's Seat

233
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:52,180
- We're about to start a race on a completely uneven track.
- What do you mean?

234
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,320
You'll lose all the will to do this trial if I tell you. Do you still want to know?

235
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,020
Just hurry up and tell me.

236
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,220
Prosecutor

237
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,650
No Hwa Yeong. Heo Kang In.

238
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,590
They've probably all been ordered by Hong Mu Seop to attend this trial.

239
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:12,280
It's a form of showing respect to superiors amongst soldiers.

240
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:18,550
That must be why the military judge already made his decision.

241
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,540
Pardon?

242
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:25,270
The military judge told me straight up to take it easy on this case like I did last year.

243
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,760
- I'm going to request that the judge be recused.
- It's useless.

244
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,550
You don't have a legitimate reason. Furthermore,

245
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,170
so long as Hong Mu Seop is sitting there, nothing will change.

246
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:42,070
We need to make it so the military judge cannot do anything except rule correctly.

247
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,950
Defendant
Defense Counsel

248
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:52,160
I'll be hoping that all the training I did with you will shine in this trial.

249
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:12,220
Being in the same court with you like this reminds me of the past.

250
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,320
Me too, sir.

251
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,220
I let you win last time, didn't I?

252
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,260
The result would've been the same even if it were a fair game.

253
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:25,320
Let me say this since you brought up the past. I had a thought going through my head at that time.

254
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,730
What thought?

255
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:31,650
How it would feel to destroy you in this court.

256
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,030
You thought that?

257
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:39,980
Fight using the law, Lawyer Yong.

258
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,000
I will try fighting using the truth this time.

259
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,310
Case of Corps Commander Hong Mu Seop's Abuse of Authority
Detective Do Su Kyeong

260
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:00,910
Yes. We're starting now. What about on your side?

261
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,770
Yes, we'll be starting now too.

262
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,800
Detective Do. I have faith in you.

263
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,380
You know I never let go once I bite down, just like Bae Man.

264
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,060
It's our family trait. It started with my brother.

265
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:25,460
Is Hong Kyeong Ok not here yet? She's already late.

266
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,970
She's entered the compound,

267
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,320
but I was told she went straight to the Legal Division chief's office.

268
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,350
Legal Division chief's office?

269
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:36,330
Why would she go there when the interrogation room is here?

270
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:41,720
She said the interrogation room felt stuffy. She asked you to go to her.

271
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,150
So she wants to show who's in charge right now?

272
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,480
Enjoy your tea.

273
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,560
Detective Do. Conduct the interrogation...

274
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,760
I mean have the conversation here.

275
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,620
Conversation?

276
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,850
Do you think I'm here to have a conversation with a criminal suspect?

277
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:17,380
What? Criminal suspect?

278
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,030
Are you done talking?

279
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,690
You think a detective is a joke?

280
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:26,810
It's fine. The location doesn't matter.

281
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:29,880
Let's begin the interrogation.

282
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,780
Okay.

283
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,830
- What are you doing?
- Let's talk outside.

284
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:48,180
I just need a moment. It'll be quick.

285
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:52,080
Legal Division Chief Office

286
00:21:54,930 --> 00:22:00,840
Do Bae Man's aunt. I know it's a joint investigation but you're in my jurisdiction.

287
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,930
Please be more polite.

288
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:08,390
Why would you address me as Do Bae Man's aunt right now? I'm Detective Do Su Gyeong.

289
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:11,850
I called you that on purpose. Okay, Aunt? Aunt, Aunt.

290
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:15,920
I was hoping to get it through to you, Aunt, Aunt, Aunt.

291
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,320
What's good is good.

292
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,450
If you wrongly mess with the corps commander, it'll do no good for Prosecutor Do either.

293
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:29,490
This man. What a cute way to threaten me.

294
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:33,770
Bae Man and I don't help each other out like that.

295
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,960
You. Give me a straight answer to my question.

296
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,760
You? You're going to talk me to that way?

297
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,610
Legal Division Chief Seo Ju Hyeok.

298
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:49,020
You! Are you a soldier or a prosecutor?

299
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,600
Are you a prosecutor or a soldier?

300
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,130
Why aren't you answering?

301
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,000
No. Why should I be answering his auntie?

302
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:02,260
Since I arrived here, everyone I met was a soldier

303
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,540
but you have to be a prosecutor.

304
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:08,350
A prosecutor should accurately charge and reveal the truth.

305
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:10,600
A military prosecutor!

306
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:15,380
If you intend to let her slide because she is the kid sister of the commander,

307
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,720
I won't leave you alone.

308
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,460
There are many women predicted in my fortune for this year, but OMG!

309
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:32,220
The division commander, Cha Wu In, up to that red fox.

310
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,610
This is driving me stark, raving mad.

311
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,990
1st Hearing: Corps Commander Abuse of Authority

312
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,810
I offer this evidence.

313
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:46,400
This is the smartwatch Sergeant Sin Min Cheol was ordered to wear when he worked at the official residence.

314
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,420
The watch is filled by dozens of calls each day

315
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:57,060
made by Commander Hong to Sergeant Sin. It's subject to human rights violatio—

316
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,470
This is not positive proof of a human right violation, Your Honor.

317
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,720
Sustained.
 Judge

318
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,670
Please provide evidence which supports the charge.

319
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:08,500
Then, why did you provide a smartwatch to your aide?

320
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,110
Wasn't it for official work?

321
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:16,030
He just paged him just three times a day with official instructions.

322
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:20,940
Are you claiming you put the smartwatch on him for just three calls per day?

323
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:25,720
Your Honor, may I answer the question?

324
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,700
Of course, you may.

325
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:36,120
Prosecutor, do you wonder why I put the smartwatch on my subordinate?

326
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:44,750
It's because I cherished my Sergeant Sin.

327
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:50,210
I did it because I cherished our Sergeant Sin Min Cheol.

328
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,890
What? Cherished?

329
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:57,060
I mean, at the supermarket, such a public place, you had your hands raised ready to hit such a precious person .

330
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:00,550
Did you throw fruit at his face?

331
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,660
Detective, you're still single, aren't you?

332
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,680
I knew unmarried people are selfish.

333
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,760
You're the only ones who don't realize it.

334
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,420
It was out of a sense of altruism.

335
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:22,840
This was teaching him by scolding him for doing something wrong so he wouldn't repeat the mistake.

336
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,160
Quit trying to be ridiculous.

337
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,300
Why did you make the aide set the table for your adult son?

338
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,400
Did you order him to wash your underwear and clean your bedroom?

339
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,020
I'll explain that.

340
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:36,210
Stay out of it. I'll answer.

341
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,300
Yes, Madam.

342
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:42,720
Speaking bluntly, did I swear at him?

343
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,350
Did I hit him?

344
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:48,110
In my loving heart, that's all I've been thinking about.

345
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,520
Sense of altruism. Yes?

346
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,880
It was compassion, do you get it?

347
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,820
He provided the smartwatch to the sergeant for his sake.

348
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:05,130
As you may know, the smartwatch has a health monitoring function.

349
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,250
Health monitoring?

350
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:11,940
The sergeant was suspected of having arrhythmia because of his family history.

351
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:18,150
It was the defendant's gift to monitor his heart rate.

352
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,630
Who would provide an expensive smartwatch to violate human rights?

353
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:32,360
The smartwatch also has a location monitoring function.

354
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,130
It was also intended to give advance notice of absence from the military workplace

355
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,890
That he was absent from the workplace?

356
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:42,250
A soldier's absence without leave is a felony.

357
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:46,610
Due to the nature of his work, he was often away from the official residence.

358
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:51,880
Both soldiers and non-commissioned officers were often disciplined for failing to understand this in the past.

359
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,700
So if Sergeant Sin accidentally left the military base,

360
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,500
you were trying to prevent him from being disciplined for being AWOL?

361
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,750
Yes. The smartwatch was not a device to abuse authority.

362
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,170
Rather,

363
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:10,070
it was proof of the commander's consideration toward the sergeant.

364
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:15,490
The trial will flatly end. Aren't you relieved?

365
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:18,310
Listen quietly.

366
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:23,830
Prosecutor, you don't have any further questions about the smartwatch, do you?

367
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:26,780
Yes, I do have more.

368
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:30,450
Prosecutor

369
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:34,470
It was to prevent the sergeant from leaving the military base.

370
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:37,380
Yes. Fine.

371
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,190
I'll ask the sergeant.

372
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:43,230
Where do you belong?

373
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:46,520
It is Fourth Infantry Division Headquarters.

374
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:50,790
Headquarters? It isn't at the commander's official residence?

375
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,700
No, it is not.

376
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,420
If that is the case, were you ever officially assigned to the official residence?

377
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,220
I was not.

378
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,730
Of course you weren't.

379
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,950
You could not be assigned to his official residence.

380
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:04,480
The personal service at official residences system was abolished.

381
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,130
It was an order from the top to withdraw all soldiers serving at official residences

382
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:10,080
and replace them with civilians.

383
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:16,510
But even with official orders, it is hard to change customary practices overnight.

384
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:19,270
The commanders who treat soldiers like servants,

385
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:23,670
prevented the change by using non-commissioned officers instead of lower ranking soldiers

386
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:27,590
and called them drivers and operations aides.

387
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:30,890
In Sergeant Sin's case, Corps Commander Hong Mu Seop used a method of personally picking him up

388
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:33,100
from the front line troops.

389
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:37,120
So the sergeant was already not at his official workplace,

390
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,570
but why is the commander trying to prevent the sergeant from leaving the workplace?

391
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,560
He is the army's commander and he ignored all regulations.

392
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,080
You picked Staff Sergeant Sin up so you could order him around at your official residence. Isn't that right?

393
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,890
Prosecution. Watch what you say.

394
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:53,250
Medical checkup? Do you even know the condition of his hearing now?

395
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,670
It's impossible for the commanding officer to know all of his subordinates' medical issues, Your Honor.

396
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,080
I agree.

397
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,440
Prosecution. What does Staff Sergeant Shin's hearing have to do with this case? Tell me.

398
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,520
It has a lot to do with it.

399
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,410
He was habitually beaten severly to the point that he ruptured his eardrum.

400
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:12,850
Beaten? The prosecution is making groundless claims.

401
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:15,940
I will show you the evidence.

402
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,580
- That's crazy.
- Look at that.

403
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,170
He got seriously beatem.

404
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:32,770
To prove that the defendant assaulted Staff Sergeant on a regular basis,

405
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:36,180
I will call Staff Sergeant Sin to testify personally.

406
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:46,580
Good job.

407
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,340
You keep saying he's precious.

408
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,460
But why did you swear at someone precious to you?

409
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,490
What? Swear?

410
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:01,870
I never once swore at him.

411
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:04,990
My Oppa is a general and I'm his younger sister.

412
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:07,320
You think I would do something lowly like that?

413
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,540
You're adamant you didn't then?

414
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,730
You don't even have it on that video.

415
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:13,990
Don't accuse me of what I didn't do. Just give me the evidence.

416
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:16,880
I'm certain the shape of your mouth...

417
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:18,710
is a swear word.

418
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:22,690
I already said I didn't.

419
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:26,650
Then how about we raise the volume.

420
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:30,450
This grocery store installed an expensive CCTV.

421
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:32,530
You idiot, you better get it together.

422
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:35,110
Are you deaf, you punk?

423
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,730
You shove this cheap stuff down your own mouth.

424
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,810
Why didn't you tell me this?

425
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:47,080
Fine. He kept having trouble understanding me.

426
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,430
So I was forced to scold him.

427
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,200
Was that so wrong?

428
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,840
Is there anyone out there who hasn't said a bad word while driving?

429
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,590
You're right, I sometimes do while driving.

430
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,380
Alone. When no one is listening.

431
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,980
Don't give me silly evidence like this.

432
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:07,160
Get me real evidence that I abused my power and treated him cruelly.

433
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,610
Bring that evidence to me. Evidence, I mean, evidence!

434
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,400
Innocent people don't say,

435
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,250
"Bring me evidence if you have it."

436
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:20,440
It's a conclusion I came to after working 17 years as a police officer.

437
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,490
I'm not interested in your conclusion.

438
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:27,160
Since you want evidence, I'll let you meet the witness who has it.

439
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,730
Investigator.

440
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:35,550
Please send in Han Sam Soo, the former driver for the Corps Commander.

441
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,760
It's been a while. It's me, Sam Soo.

442
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,640
The driver, soldier Han Sam Soo who almost went blind from the ashtray you threw.

443
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,030
She made me wear a smartwatch 24-7.

444
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,740
She called me every five minutes. It truly drove me crazy.

445
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,540
"Get me water. Cold water. Put some ice in there."

446
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:06,520
My 24 hours always belonged to that woman.

447
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:11,720
Hey! How dare you lie and frame me as the bad guy?

448
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,970
I'm going to sue you for slander right now!

449
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:19,390
What are you doing, Lawyer Park? Write up my lawsuit against him.

450
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,340
Please calm down, madam.

451
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,540
You ordered me to buy your sanitary napkins. Saying I need to buy the ones with wings.

452
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,720
When I did, you told me to go back and buy a thicker one.

453
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,010
Then you tell me to go change it to a different one.

454
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,950
Then you ordered me to buy pomegranates.

455
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:37,450
Staff Sergeant Sin wrote this testimony.

456
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:41,490
The content of how she abused her power matches 100 percent.

457
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:44,670
Stop this. You're just going to sit there?

458
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,790
Don't you work for my brother?

459
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:49,850
Well even to me, this is clearly—

460
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:53,590
What? Clear?

461
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:56,430
Lawyer Park. Are you going to play mute?

462
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:59,790
You already got paid, so what are you doing?

463
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:03,800
I'm going to quit. Find yourself another lawyer.

464
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,870
I can't do this anymore.

465
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:09,530
Hey. Hey. Hey!

466
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:16,050
Your lawyer ran away.

467
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:21,250
What will you do now? Will you admit to everything?

468
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:27,070
Are you going to admit to the claims, Ms. Hong Kyeong Ok?

469
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,190
Answer me.

470
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:38,470
My brother really doesn't know about this.

471
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:41,760
I did everything on my own.

472
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:47,610
My Oppa. He doesn't have a clue.

473
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:49,560
It's the truth.

474
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,170
Are you going to take the fall for everything?

475
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:56,580
I trust my brother.

476
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,480
Witness

477
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,380
Min Cheol.

478
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:19,740
It's okay. Don't be nervous.

479
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,820
Yes.

480
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,940
I'm ready.

481
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:37,920
Is it true that you've received repeated beatings from Corps Commander Hong Mu Seop?

482
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:40,040
Yes.

483
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:45,370
Were the beatings groundless? Meaning, did you make mistakes to cause them?

484
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,160
At first,

485
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:53,820
I thought I was being punished because I made a mistake.

486
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:59,050
But the beatings continued whether or not I made mistakes.

487
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,930
How did you come to that realization?

488
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:03,400
Because of the corps commander's little sister.

489
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:09,150
I mean, Madam. She goes to her parent's place every Sunday.

490
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:12,950
The official residence is empty then.

491
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:17,170
Then it's just me and the corps commander.

492
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,210
At midnight, my smartwatch goes off.

493
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:25,480
The first is a signal to get ready.

494
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:31,120
The second alert means to go to his room.

495
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,620
- His room?
- Why would he call him to his room?

496
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,760
- Why?
- What's the reason?

497
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:56,260
Did the defendant ever tell you the reason for his beatings?

498
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,860
Yes.

499
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,590
What is it?

500
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:07,820
The corps commander told me clearly.

501
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,170
"I have to hit someone..."

502
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,510
in order for my anger to subside.

503
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:17,360
Your Honor. Staff Sergeant's testimony is just anecdotal evidence.

504
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:21,500
I present a diagnosis of perforated eardrums from trauma and sudden deafness as evidence.

505
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,330
We have reports from a medical professional that they were all caused from physical abuse.

506
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:27,620
Do you have proof that the defendant was the one to abuse him?

507
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,150
For example, maybe video evidence?

508
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,870
Staff Sergeant Sin spends most of his time at the official residence.

509
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:36,720
- Who else would he be beaten up by?
- It's very possible he self-harmed.

510
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,640
What are you saying? How dare you accuse him of self-harm?

511
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,100
- Watch your words.
- Military prosecutor Do.

512
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,930
Be careful of what you say.

513
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:55,080
I mean, he self-harmed out of malice towards the corps commander.

514
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:59,860
Do you have proof that it was self-harm?

515
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:03,310
I will submit a diagnosis too.

516
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:07,000
This is Staff Sergeant Sin's psychiatric diagnosis.

517
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:24,210
One year ago, his best friend Staff Sergeant Oh committed suicide.

518
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:27,720
Because of this, Staff Sergeant Sin experienced serious mental trauma.

519
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:32,010
The council is bringing confusion to the trial by bringing something completely unrelated to this case.

520
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:34,660
One of the symptoms of mental trauma is self-harm.

521
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:38,100
- Your Honor.
- Staff Sergeant couldn't accept the trial's ruling,

522
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:41,140
so he grudgingly released his anger to the wrong person.

523
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:46,350
He made a false report against the corps commander and self-harmed to support his claims.

524
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:50,120
- He's just speculating, Your Honor.
- That is up for me to judge!

525
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:54,200
- Prosecution. Are you done questioning the witness?
- No, I am not!

526
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:23,590
I submit the medical evidence.

527
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,920
Corps Commander Hong Mu Seop.

528
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:45,950
I mean, even after he defendant's repeated beatings,

529
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,490
why did you endure it until now?

530
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,530
Money.

531
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:56,310
That's why.

532
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:11,640
I heard your kid is very ill. Use it for the medical bills.

533
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,720
Let me know any time if you need more.

534
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,460
Do Seong Hwan

535
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:19,070
Get some medicine for yourself on the way back.

536
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:21,940
And get some snacks for your son.

537
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,940
My son.

538
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,270
He's only three years old now.

539
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,360
He's been living at the hospital since the day he was born,

540
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:48,300
due to a hereditary heart disease.

541
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:57,740
I couldn't afford to pay my son's medical bills with my salary.

542
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,490
That's why...

543
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,010
That's why I endured it.

544
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:09,620
Corps Commander Hong specifically picked soldiers and non-commissioned officers,

545
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,840
who were financially struggling, to work at his official residence.

546
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,320
He expressed his sadistic nature on them.

547
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,940
Those are all baseless speculations made by the prosecution.

548
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:22,820
Our claim of self-harm is more reasonable.

549
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:30,350
Witness. If it's revealed that it was indeed self-harmed,

550
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:32,630
you can be punished for perjury.

551
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,120
I assure you I didn't commit perjury.

552
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:39,140
I find it hard to believe his claims.

553
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:44,990
Your Honor. The prosecution relied solely on a diagnosis that was given based on the victim's testimony.

554
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:47,480
That's the only claim they have to charge the defendant.

555
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:52,650
I object to all evidence that the prosecution has submitted. Including the diagnosis.

556
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,750
I request you exclude the evidence.

557
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:58,590
Prosecution. If the witness's testimony isn't credible,

558
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:01,980
then the diagnosis based on the victim's testimony

559
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,430
will also fail to serve as evidence. You understand, right?

560
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:06,420
How could you exclude the evidence, Your Honor?

561
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,540
- Please conduct a fair trial.
- This is ridiculous.

562
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:12,040
How could you have a trial like this?

563
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:24,030
- Give him a fair trial.
- Be fair.

564
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:26,030
Sit down.

565
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:28,480
- Please be fair, Your Honor.
- This isn't right.

566
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,430
Staff Sergeant Sin put his job on the line and found the courage to come to court.

567
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,750
I will look into the credibility of the testimony again.

568
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:38,180
I will come to a decision at our next hearing.

569
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,970
Your Honor. Your Honor!

570
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:17,600
General Military Court, 4th Division

571
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:24,030
Sir. Detective Do got a confession out of the sister.

572
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,090
She did?

573
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:29,850
But Hong Kyeong Ok took the fall for everything.

574
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:33,630
I think it's going to be hard to connect it to Hong Mu Seop.

575
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:36,960
Also, about Han Sam Soo.

576
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,160
He claims he was never beaten by the corps commander.

577
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,130
Staff Sergeant Sin.

578
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:53,810
I showed you love and consideration.

579
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:56,750
But this is how you repay me?

580
00:42:56,750 --> 00:43:03,330
Once my charges are dismissed, I'm going to throw you in jail for committing slander.

581
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:06,290
Let's go, sir.

582
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,550
General Military Court, 4th Division

583
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:33,040
Hey.

584
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,410
You know who I am, don't you?

585
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,760
Pardon? What do you mean, sir?

586
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,270
I know you do.

587
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:43,380
I don't know what you're saying.

588
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:46,150
Don't forget to say "sir" at the end.

589
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:48,370
It's starting to annoy me.

590
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:57,830
You know,

591
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:01,950
I was originally going to make you my dog.

592
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,830
But I've changed my mind.

593
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,500
What on earth are you doing? Put the gun down.

594
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,190
I told you to call me "sir," you punk!

595
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:16,070
I already told you. You think I'm kidding?

596
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,670
Stop whining like a baby, you punk!

597
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:20,150
It's all because of you.

598
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:24,640
Do you know what happened to my father because of you?

599
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:28,990
I asked if you know or not, you punk! Answer me!

600
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:45,410
Case of Corps Commander Hong Mu Seop's Abuse of Authority

601
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:50,440
We need to make it so the military judge cannot do anything except rule correctly.

602
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,530
Staff Sergeant Sin put his job on the line and found the courage to come to court.

603
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:56,300
Once my charges are dismissed,

604
00:44:56,300 --> 00:45:01,240
I'm going to throw you in jail for committing slander.

605
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,430
No Hwa Yeong

606
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:19,530
Come to my office.

607
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:21,650
Can I ask why?

608
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:24,630
I have a witness who can help you win.

609
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:27,610
What do you think? Are you interested?

610
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,390
I'll head over now.

611
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,610
Unity.

612
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:46,440
Cha Wu In. You voluntarily came to hear me out,

613
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,960
so how about we be honest with each other?

614
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,260
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

615
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:56,970
I know you're trying to hide your hostility towards me.

616
00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:03,970
But I'm saying you can face me without your mask now.

617
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:10,450
I don't understand what you're saying, ma'am.

618
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:15,700
The way you can't hide your feelings,

619
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:18,580
you're just like your father.

620
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:21,130
You definitely act like Cha Ho Cheol's daughter.

621
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:28,610
So you knew everything about me.

622
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:32,690
But why did you just let me be?

623
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:36,920
A visible enemy can be easily dealt with.

624
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:43,290
It's always the ally that points the gun behind one's back.

625
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:50,450
The same way you'll hold a gun against the corps commander?

626
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:52,500
That's right.

627
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:57,570
I knew you'd catch on right away which is why I called you.

628
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:02,430
Your father was always so proud of you.

629
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:04,500
He always talked about how clever you are.

630
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,800
My father.

631
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,770
Don't bring him up anymore.

632
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:26,350
Are you or are you not going to accept my witness, Cha Wu In?

633
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:38,150
I will accept, as a military prosecutor.

634
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:40,420
But it'll be hard to get him accepted as a witness.

635
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,470
Don't worry about that.

636
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:46,200
The military judge is my subordinate and so are you.

637
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,480
I'm just trying to give everyone a chance.

638
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:57,640
You may only view me as your enemy.

639
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:01,470
But not everything is as it seems.

640
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:08,910
I'm saying there are things you don't know.

641
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:11,810
You were too young at that time.

642
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:24,050
We could've had a completely different relationship than now.

643
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:28,950
Your Honor, I'm applying for a witness.

644
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:32,580
A witness?
2nd Hearing: Corps Commander Abuse of Authority

645
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:36,120
To my knowledge, the prosecution didn't apply for a witness today.

646
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:40,700
The witness needed some time to decide whether to attend.

647
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:04,590
What is this?

648
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,680
Cha Wu In.

649
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:10,450
From now on, you must leave the trial

650
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:12,940
completely to me.

651
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:20,220
Your Honor. I am Division Commander No Hwa Yeong from the 4th Division.

652
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:24,820
The victim, Staff Sergeant Sin Min Cheol is one of the precious men in my division.

653
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:28,780
Please allow me to help my subordinate.

654
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:31,170
What do you mean that you'll help?

655
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:35,710
My adjutant, Lieutenant Yang Jong Suk has something to testify.

656
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:52,650
Stop that testimony. You must stop it.

657
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:56,780
I'd like to make it clear that we can't accept a witness that hasn't been agreed upon before the trial.

658
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:01,480
Your Honor. Lieutenant Yang is a crucial witness,

659
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,020
who could prove Corps Commander Hong's repeated abuse.

660
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:15,180
I saw you received a lot of bribes from a civilian law firm to give them a favorable ruling.

661
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:18,080
It's a misunderstanding, ma'am.

662
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:24,410
You'll have to submit to reason for this trial.

663
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:27,290
If you want to keep your judge's gown that is.

664
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:35,950
I will allow the prosecution's witness.

665
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:38,790
Witness Yang Jong Suk, please be seated.

666
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:40,130
I object, Your Honor!

667
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:45,190
I judge her to be a vital witness, so I deny the defense's objection.

668
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:56,190
- Hey! This is No Hwa Yeong.
- Pardon?

669
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:59,160
No Hwa Yeong.

670
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:05,210
How dare you.

671
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:08,980
How dare you do something like this to me?

672
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,580
Lieutenant Yang.

673
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:22,340
Have you been physically assaulted by Corps Commander Hong Mu Seok?

674
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:25,810
Yes, I have.

675
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:28,970
Please elaborate.

676
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:34,130
It was on June 11, 2020 at 1:14 p.m.

677
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:39,450
I was slapped across the face twice by Corps Commander Hong

678
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:41,410
inside his car.

679
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:45,080
Then he punched me three times in the stomach.

680
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:50,090
Your Honor. I'll present you the medical document from that time.

681
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:57,980
I will also submit a file of the witness made at the time of the abuse.

682
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:01,900
He won't be able to claim it was self-harm anymore.

683
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:12,430
What was the reason for you to be assaulted?

684
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:20,260
It's okay. You can testify against him now

685
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:22,470
since you couldn't at that time.

686
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,570
The corps commander visited the base I was working at

687
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:33,010
for corps inspections.

688
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:35,990
Everyone went drinking afterwards.

689
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:41,270
After the gathering was over, he touched me.

690
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:44,500
I immediately expressed my refusal.

691
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,900
I strongly refused him again but...

692
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:54,800
I guess the corps commander assaulted you after that?

693
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:56,620
Yes.

694
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:59,080
First, you were sexually harassed by the corps commander.

695
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,840
Then you were physically assaulted afterwards?

696
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:04,340
Military judge! Are you just going to sit there and continue to listen?

697
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:08,420
Through Lieutenant Yang's testimony, we have revealed the defendant assaulted his subordinate.

698
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:12,610
This adds credibility to Staff Sergeant Sin's testimony.

699
00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:14,440
Judge

700
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:22,070
I deny the defendant's objection.

701
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:24,340
I'll allow the witness to continue.

702
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:26,520
What? Are you serious?

703
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,810
I told you to stop her.

704
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:31,230
Please calm down, Defendant. This is a warning.

705
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:38,240
Witness. Please continue.

706
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:41,720
The physical assault

707
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:46,720
and sexual harassment happened a year and eight months ago.

708
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:50,780
Why did you decide to testify now?

709
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:54,400
After experiencing that,

710
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,570
I was going to commit suicide.

711
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:00,410
But...

712
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:06,980
it was nothing to him.

713
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:14,170
Thank you, Adjutant Yang. You're always quietly

714
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:17,620
doing your job dutifully. I like it.

715
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:30,400
You. You're not holding the past against me, are you?

716
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:34,100
All right.

717
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,870
I know you're a good girl.

718
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:42,660
Let me know if you ever need my help.

719
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:56,050
The victim who's been sexually harassed suffers gravely.

720
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:59,340
But the perpetrator completely forgets it and goes on with life.

721
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:02,750
This is probably ongoing somewhere in the world right now.

722
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:07,080
If death is the only way the victim can prove the crime,

723
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:11,000
then this act of killing the soul can only be seen as murder.

724
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:16,420
- You little...
- Assault is a serious crime that destroys one's soul and body.

725
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:21,430
I request you give the defendant a heavy sentence, Your Honor.

726
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:29,420
Prosecutor

727
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,580
All right.

728
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:40,610
After looking over Staff Sergeant Sin's testimony and evidence,

729
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:44,110
it's been confirmed that there are no issues with the evidence provided.

730
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:47,800
I will continue to allow the evidence,

731
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:51,630
and I will take it to account for my ruling.

732
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:03,230
It's been confirmed that as the corps commander,

733
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:06,830
you used the power you had to order your subordinates

734
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:11,790
as an opportunity to abuse your authority and to treat them cruelly.

735
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:15,080
It's been proven he had assaulted them on a regular basis.

736
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,530
The additional charges of sexual harassment

737
00:56:17,530 --> 00:56:20,230
will be dealt in a different trial later on.

738
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:24,070
With this, I find the defendant guilty of violating Military Criminal Law Article 62, paragraph 1,

739
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:26,170
abuse of authority and cruel treatment.

740
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:28,300
Article 260, paragraph 1, item 2.

741
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:31,610
Assaulting a soldier on duty.

742
00:56:31,610 --> 00:56:35,630
Taking both charges into account,

743
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:39,920
I sentence him to four years in military prison.

744
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:52,450
How dare you throw me in prison?

745
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:56,650
Hey, you military judges! Have you lost your minds?

746
00:56:56,650 --> 00:57:00,340
Also, you two don't even have the right to call yourselves soldiers.

747
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:05,090
What kind of ridiculous trial is this?

748
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:07,810
Soldiers. Soldiers!

749
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:12,540
Don't come near me. Stand back!

750
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:16,080
Don't get close. Don't you dare touch me.

751
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,780
Who do you fall under? Get away!

752
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:21,100
I told you to go away!

753
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22,940
The Fourth Infantry Division

754
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,910
Division Commander.

755
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,560
Thank you.

756
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:35,270
Remember what I told you when you came to see me after that incident?

757
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:41,030
I said I'd make sure you see the corps commander fall to ruins.

758
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:45,530
We both just did what we needed to.

759
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:48,190
So there's no need to thank me.

760
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:51,450
The General Military Court
The Fourth Infantry Division

761
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:55,120
Thank you.

762
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,810
What is this stupid ruling?

763
00:57:56,810 --> 00:58:00,690
How dare you find me guilty?

764
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:02,720
Hey, MP's.

765
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,840
- Stand back, sir.
- Let go of me.

766
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,350
I told you to back off, you punk!

767
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:10,420
You scumbag!

768
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:13,040
I said back off, you punks!

769
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,660
You little punks. Back off.

770
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:17,870
Are you just going to let him be?

771
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:21,970
It's a rare opportunity where you get to see someone at their rock bottom.

772
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:24,330
On top of that, it's the corps commander of all people too.

773
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,250
Let's leave him be so everyone can enjoy.

774
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:30,180
You punk!

775
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:33,280
- My gosh.
- I think it's time.

776
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,390
We have to end the trial.

777
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:37,410
I guess it's time.

778
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:40,850
You punk.

779
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:46,210
What's your problem? It's your turn now, Do Bae Man!

780
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,800
You always have to be humble when it comes to the truth.

781
00:58:55,800 --> 00:59:01,340
You have that face of yours. That humble and kind face you put on.

782
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:06,170
I hope that face serves you well in prison.

783
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:14,210
- Military judge?
- Yes?

784
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:15,800
Military Police.

785
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:20,060
Arrest this defendant immediately.

786
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:54,600
Unity.

787
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:02,750
Thank you.

788
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:07,580
I mean it, Sir Military Prosecutor.

789
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:14,730
Military prosecutor?

790
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:19,300
You finally called me by that title.

791
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:22,350
I want to thank you too.

792
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:30,380
Thank you, Sir Military Prosecutor.

793
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,110
Get going then.

794
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,840
Let's go.

795
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:48,210
- Let's go.
- Okay.

796
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:50,980
Hey, when did you get here?

797
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:53,950
- Did you watch the trial?
- Yes.

798
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:57,240
Good job. You looked cool, Prosecutor Cha.

799
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:02,090
But how did No Hwa Yeong's adjutant come out as a witness?

800
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:04,060
Oh, that.

801
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:07,020
How do I explain this.

802
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:10,420
I'm busy, so I'll have to get going. You can explain next time.

803
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:14,580
Oh, I'm dealing with the company. So don't worry.

804
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:18,580
Okay. Let me know if you need anything.

805
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:22,020
What about the hardware? Did you find anything?

806
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:28,870
That...

807
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,400
It was beyond recovery.

808
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,580
- I disposed of it.
- Are you sure you checked it thoroughly?

809
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:40,220
I appreciate your efforts, CEO Kang.

810
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:42,000
I'll go now.

811
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:48,820
The military court found Corps Commander Hong Mu Seop guilty of abuse of authority and assault.

812
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:52,690
They punished him severely for both charges.

813
01:01:52,690 --> 01:01:57,130
He will be indicted for the additional charges of sexual assault that came to light during the trial.

814
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,320
Corps Commander Hong...

815
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:04,390
Power is such an interesting thing.

816
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:09,220
It takes decades to climb up the ladder, but falling off from it is instant.

817
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:11,240
How could you...

818
01:02:11,850 --> 01:02:15,370
do this to me? Without any warning.

819
01:02:15,370 --> 01:02:19,570
It's a reward I'm giving to my adjutant who has been loyal to me like you have been. So you should move on.

820
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:21,200
This time, you should move on.

821
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:25,400
Don't tell me you didn't do anything about Do Bae Man and Cha Wu In

822
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,770
because you wanted to get rid of Corps Commander Hong.

823
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:35,240
They say you need two things for a revolution.

824
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:39,910
Passion and boldness.

825
01:02:39,910 --> 01:02:45,090
I used Do Bae Man and Cha Wu In as a tool to get rid of Hong Mu Seop.

826
01:02:45,690 --> 01:02:48,980
Is there anything I lost from this?

827
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:51,720
Power doesn't allow a vacuum.

828
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:55,400
Once there's a vacuum, it will be filled by someone.

829
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:59,050
I always knew you wanted the position of corps commander,

830
01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:02,240
but I didn't think you'd use this method.

831
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,160
Corps Commander?

832
01:03:05,330 --> 01:03:06,910
That petty position?

833
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:09,240
General.

834
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:18,490
Do you know why we didn't clash all this time?

835
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:23,630
It's because I did everything in my power to not cross the line.

836
01:03:56,310 --> 01:03:59,400
Do you have a response to my offer?

837
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:02,610
One of the items confiscated from me in the search and seizure

838
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:05,130
must be an SSD hard drive.

839
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:10,070
- That is my response
- What's in the hard drive?

840
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:14,340
A fatal blow to No Hwa Yeong.

841
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:21,470
Your timing is excellent.

842
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:23,590
I timed it accordingly.

843
01:04:23,590 --> 01:04:26,820
I saw you were backstabbed by No Hwa Yeong in court today.

844
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:30,330
I didn't expect you to bring me a present too, CEO Kang.

845
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,620
As you mentioned,

846
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:43,780
let's have the soldiers fight the war.

847
01:04:44,810 --> 01:04:47,770
I have to protect my company.

848
01:04:52,210 --> 01:04:54,060
- Yes?
- Hello?

849
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:57,370
You'll see it right after you pass the infirmary.

850
01:04:57,370 --> 01:05:00,440
Yes, okay. Thank you.

851
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:04,020
What's going on?

852
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:06,540
Since when did we have so many phones?

853
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:12,200
We used to have one but I increased it to five. It was all prepared for this moment.

854
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:15,940
Wait, what? Hello? Let me fix this.

855
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:19,350
It's crazy right now. We're getting all sorts of reports on abuse of authority from all across the nation.

856
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:22,200
The Protectors of Military Human Rights website is down too.

857
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:26,730
Excuse me. Could you both go into the office? You're bothering us.

858
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:29,990
Okay, all right. Get back to work then.

859
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:33,340
Yes, of course, Prosecutor Do is here.

860
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:35,560
Yes, you can tell me.

861
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:37,130
Okay.

862
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:45,340
Why did you follow me in?

863
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:54,950
I'll tell you since the trial is over.

864
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:59,370
No Hwa Yeong's adjutant attending as a witness.

865
01:05:59,370 --> 01:06:03,880
It was something I had to do as a military prosecutor.

866
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:08,680
I had to for Staff Sergeant Sin and No Hwa Yeong's adjutant.

867
01:06:09,290 --> 01:06:10,900
However,

868
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:14,140
as my father's daughter,

869
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:18,290
it was an incredibly hard decision.

870
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:23,030
It was tough.

871
01:06:24,510 --> 01:06:31,590
And I'm sorry for not being able to tell Prosecutor Do Bae Man in advance.

872
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:34,040
- I am deeply sorry.
- That's enough. Stop.

873
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:37,570
♫ I feel I am falling into a deep place ♫

874
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:39,930
You may stop talking.

875
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:44,770
♫ that I can't get out of ♫

876
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:48,700
♫ I remember the past days trying ♫

877
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:53,040
When you calmed me down.

878
01:06:54,890 --> 01:06:58,830
When you testified for your enemy's adjutant as a military prosecutor.

879
01:06:58,830 --> 01:07:03,170
If death is the only way the victim can prove the crime,

880
01:07:03,170 --> 01:07:07,120
then this act of killing the soul can only be seen as murder.

881
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:10,010
When Staff Sergeant Sin saluted me.

882
01:07:10,010 --> 01:07:11,870
Unity.

883
01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:15,780
♫ Dive in ♫

884
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:18,960
And now.
♫  I'm gradually becoming numb ♫

885
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,580
I don't need all the other reasons.

886

♫ I'm standing at the end of a life without rest ♫

887
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:29,550
So you can stop talking, Cha Wu In.

888

♫ Please provide warm comfort to my weak heart ♫

889
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:51,220
Private Pyeon said,

890
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:55,010
most problems have a solution in the military.

891
01:07:55,790 --> 01:08:01,090
He said you can go to the infirmary if you're sick, and if you're hungry you can go to the kitchen.

892
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:06,860
But there's one thing. Going crazy.

893
01:08:07,990 --> 01:08:13,210
He said there's no solution in the military when a crazy soldier holds a gun.

894
01:08:14,550 --> 01:08:17,640
So he told me not to go crazy,

895
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:20,400
to not let go of my sanity...

896
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:25,270
especially when I'm carrying a rifle.

897
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:28,340
He said I mustn't ever go crazy.

898
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:34,990
Military Prosecutor Doberman

899
01:08:35,910 --> 01:08:45,370
♫The nostaligic memories gradually come to mind♫

900
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:53,840
♫ Still I let go of all of the feelings ♫

901
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:57,200
♫ I feel I am falling into a deep place ♫

902
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:01,040
A full-scale war will break out within the Patriotic Society, won't it?

903
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:04,780
Cha Ho Cheol gathered documents of corruption within the Patriot's Group like crazy.

904
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:06,840
It was like a Patriotic Society X-File.

905
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:09,280
Are you sure you left it here? You didn't leave it at your residence?

906
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:11,980
CEO Kang. Did you take Won Gi Chun's file box?

907
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:14,650
Is it possible for me to see one item

908
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:18,070
among the items seized from Kang's Solution?

909
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:21,630
We actually just got a report that multiple gunshots have been heard from 14th G.O.P.

910
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:25,200
I asked if you were the shooter from the mass shooting.

911
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:31,150
♫ and keep them there. ♫
