Military Prosecutor Doberman

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,680
What about sexual assault? Wake up Korean chaebol!

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,640
Wake up! Wake up!

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,220
Take Criminal No Tae Nam to prison, not the army.

11
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,280
To prison! To prison!

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,110
To prison! To prison!

13
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,050
Sexual Predator No Tae Nam

14
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,420
To prison!

15
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,500
Too short.

16
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,210
Sexual predator. No Tae Nam. To prison!

17
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,650
Hey, this one. You can stop cutting.

18
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,680
How long are you going to cut my hair?

19
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,480
Please give me sideburns.

20
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,790
Arrested for sexually assaulting a female student at a club in Gangnam

21
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,580
IM Defense Chairman No Tae Nam

22
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,600
will enlist today at the Army Training Center.

23
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,840
As Chairman No Tae Nam enlists, this is no longer a civilian court case.

24
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,890
The right to judge is transferred to the military court

25
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,350
where he will be given an official military trial.

26
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,420
Go to jail!

27
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,630
Hey! Hurry and go!

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,790
A few days ago

29
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,670
The key is in the car.

30
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,370
No Tae Nam's arrest warrant is out.

31
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,440
Thanks to the evidence of Se Na's video you sent me.

32
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,630
Okay, I'd like to thank you, Detective Do.

33
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,310
What's going on this time?

34
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,750
- An arrest warrant has been issued for Chairman No.
- What?

35
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,470
The police obtained the video evidence.

36
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,350
Episode 4

37
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,610
Hey, you! Stop there.

38
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,380
Come here for a second.

39
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,500
That bastard!

40
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,300
Oh, thank you!

41
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,670
- Stop right there!
- Catch him!

42
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,150
It's a high-speed chase by the cops. What's going on?

43
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,750
Doberman bastard.

44
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,210
He's about to be discharged from the army, but he's being chased by the cops?

45
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,080
Omo, what kind of person did you meet at Cartel?

46
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,980
Did he do something with that terrifying female soldier?

47
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,010
Doberman rode alone and sped away.

48
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,150
That lady soldier shyster

49
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,960
is a rare style that I haven't seen nor heard of my entire life.

50
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,530
What are you doing? Why aren't you stepping on the gas and chasing him? Get going!

51
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,450
Yes, Hyeongnim.

52
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,840
What is that? Who is so rude? Son of a bitch—

53
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,020
The female soldier shyster.

54
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,720
Bang!

55
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,830

00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,360
What the? What is this?

82
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,140
Oblivion.

83
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,160
The brain's action of forgetting some fact.

84
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,650
Someone said that oblivion is god's blessing.

85
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,680
No matter what type of pain you suffer,

86
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,740
you can live again in oblivion.

87
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:44,190
If there is no oblivion, there is no present.

88

Cha Wu In

89

Military Prosecutor Do Bae Man. You can't get discharged.

90
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:02,530
You'll have to stay and fight with me.

91
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,990
That's your fate, Prosecutor Do.

92
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,470
Destiny?

93
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,270
Me with you?

94
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,660
However, when sweet oblivion ends

95
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,070
and realization starts,

96
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:27,650
at the moment you have to face the agony that was hidden in oblivion,

97
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,570
for the first time hell will open.

98
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,550
Do you know now what you forgot?

99
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,410
I forgot something and lived.

100
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:13,210
What did I forget?

101
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,400
Cha Wu In,

102
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,300
Why the heck are you doing this to me?

103
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,480
Emergency Treatment Center

104
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,860
Missed phone call
My aunt

105
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,330
I see you're awake. You shouldn't get up though.

106
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:13,010
How did I get here?

107
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,730
Some woman brought you to the ER.

108
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,080
You should stay for a few days to recover.

109
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,980
You shouldn't move too much.

110
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,510
I don't have that kind of time.

111
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,220
Mirror.

112
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,260
I don't want to be here long, so take care of things however you can.

113
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:50,050
Return things to how they were before I was handcuffed.

114
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:53,890
I will use my connections quickly so you don't have to stay in a shabby place too long.

115
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:57,720
Do Bae Man ran by himself, that military bastard.

116
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,140
How should I get back at him for this?

117
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,360
Sir, please suppress your emotions for a bit and think logically.

118
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,230
This is much better

119
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:09,630
than Do Bae Man being caught and exposing your draft evasion project.

120
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,300
That's true.

121
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:17,130
He ran away to save himself. If he had been caught, he would have confessed everything.

122
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:21,520
This is all because that good for nothing Do Bae Man actually has a plan, right?

123
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:28,440
Anyway, why are you here alone? What about Mother?

124
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,950
She has no plans to visit you.

125
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:31,990
What?

126
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:35,450
Going to visit a suspected criminal in a sexual assault case

127
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:39,100
would only be feeding reporters, is what she said.

128
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,740
What kind of mom abandons her son like this?

129
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,900
Let's go, Mr. No Tae Nam.

130
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,630
Spray.

131
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,350
Mirror.

132
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,400
IM Defense's Chairman No Tae Nam and the idol singer Allen

133
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,850
were arrested at a club last night and handed over to the prosecutor's office.

134
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,520
The two were arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting a female university student,

135
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,960
and the police have begun investigations on this case.

136
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,600
So bright.

137
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,080
Why did you assault the victim?

138
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,250
Is it true you drugged her?

139
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,820
Do you have anything to say to your mother?

140
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,820
No Tae Nam, aren't you ashamed for your mother who became the first female army division commander?

141
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,910
Please say something.

142
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,920
We have yet to complete the investigation. Please refrain from questions that suggest guilt.

143
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,430
Among us reporters, we know you've committed many wrong-doings in the past.

144
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,010
How do you feel? Do you feel wronged?

145
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:50,810
- This little wretch won't stop talking.
- Hey, hey.

146
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:53,410
What did he say?

147
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,190
The phone number you have called is not in service.

148
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:06,220
Why aren't you answering your phone?

149
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:11,240
Are you feeling alright?

150
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,080
You are ridiculous.

151
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,730
You nearly killed me, then took me to the hospital.

152
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,580
Are you messing with me?

153
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:28,130
I was worried. It's fortunate you weren't too badly injured.

154
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:32,130
Fortunate? Fortunate?

155
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,910
Why don't you have your red wig on today?

156
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,350
You look better in that than your military uniform.

157
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,200
I am aware you must have many questions.

158
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,980
Let's talk once you've calmed down a bit.

159
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,260
Tell me. Why did you try to kill me?

160
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,210
No. I tried to help you realize.

161
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,600
Stop spouting nonsense and tell me right now.

162
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,750
I can have you arrested for attempted murder.

163
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,590
I will tell you everything before you're relieved of your military position.

164
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,580
I'm also waiting.

165
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:14,390
What? Waiting?

166
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:18,230
I'm waiting for you, Prosecutor Do,

167
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,760
to wake up from oblivion.

168
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,530
Prosecutor Do, what is this?

169
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,530
What'll you do if Cha Wu In finds out?

170
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:03,040
Cha Wu In? Don't speak that name in front of me.

171
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,970
Then I investigated this for nothing.

172
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,770
What investigation?

173
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:14,810
Didn't you say "If we dig deeper into Kang Ha Jun, I think we'll learn something about Cha Wu In"?

174
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,820
You'll be surprised once you see this.

175
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,340
Yes?

176
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,240
Chairman No will be released tomorrow.

177
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,270
That's a relief. Thank you.

178
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:39,080
I need someone to hold the dog leash tomorrow.

179
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,180
The leash?

180
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,430
You have to redeem yourself for running away that day.

181
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,170
I'll see you tomorrow.

182
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,480
Was it Lawyer Yong?

183
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,490
Chairman No Tae Nam, well, he must really be determined.

184
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,970
It's a relief he will be released.

185
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,060
What'll you do now?

186
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,520
About No Tae Nam and Prosecutor Cha.

187
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,380
I'll take things one at a time.

188
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,420
We'll figure out Chairman No's military duty first.

189
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,320
Then we'll deal with Cha Wu In.

190
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:23,910
Stay still. Good boy.

191
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:30,920
Don't spit in the water you're drinking.

192
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,180
You left saying you'd never see me again,

193
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,680
yet here we are.

194
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:41,420
Bolt. Bolt. I missed you so much.

195
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,770
Very much.

196
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:47,160
I won't go far without you.

197
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,630
Chairman.

198
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,590
You suffered a lot.

199
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,890
I'm very sorry.

200
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:12,320
How did you make such a good plan in a hectic situation? I was completely impressed.

201
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,390
Sorry?

202
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:18,450
If you had been caught there, you wouldn't have been able to help my military case. Right?

203
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:21,450
Of course. Yes.

204
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:24,350
I didn't think you'd understand.

205
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:27,820
Thank you. I will succeed, no matter what,

206
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:32,410
at making sure you are exempt from your military service.

207
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:41,430
The general couldn't come today because of an important appointment.

208
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:47,000
What could be more important than her son's release from prison?

209
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,470
There's a reunion of her Korean Military Academy classmates.

210
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:52,820
A reunion?

211
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,690
Allen is still being confined. Only you were released

212
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:01,040
because of all the work your mother did to get you out.

213
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,860
No, it's all for herself.

214
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,430
Don't you open the door?

215
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,950
Of course.

216
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,730
Rest well today.

217
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,150
I thought of something while I was there, so have a listen.

218
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:54,050
There's no extradition treaty with Cuba and Uruguay.

219
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:57,670
I'm thinking I can spend a few years there.

220
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,880
The arrest warrant was rejected after review,

221
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,870
but you're unable to leave the country at the moment.

222
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:06,990
Tell me what steps you are taking now as I'm ready to explode.

223
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:11,090
According to Article 61 of the Military Service Act and Article 129 of the Enforcement Decree of the Military Service,

224
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:15,660
you can defer enlistment for an unavoidable reason.

225
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,910
And?

226
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:20,940
Defer enlistment, and during the trial,

227
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,810
follow the course I've set for you, and it is possible you could be exempted.

228
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,520
It will be difficult to avoid imprisonment because of the crime committed and the evidence.

229
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:38,750
Chairman, do you really hate the army more than prison?

230
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,690
The detention center you have been in for a few days is very different from prison.

231
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,840
So, what do you want to say right now?

232
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,760
Please join the army. Hiding in the army is the most secure and only way.

233
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,130
What are you saying? Is that a countermeasure?

234
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:58,170
Military trials are not that easy.

235
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:04,110
If you take this case to a military court,

236
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,930
there is no guarantee you will avoid punishment.

237
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:10,950
Look here. Military Prosecutor Do Bae Man is saying it's difficult to predict.

238
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,110
Then I'll ask one thing.

239
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:19,700
If all the soldier positions, from the prosecutors prosecuting

240
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,160
to the judges judging,

241
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,780
to the guards at the door are filled with his mother's subordinates,

242
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,500
will that trial be difficult?

243
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:34,500
- You are a military prosecutor who knows best.
- That's—

244
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,890
What is this? Do Bae Man, can't you say anything else?

245
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:43,350
The decision is up to you, General No, and me.

246
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:46,750
Do Bae Man may not make unsolicited statements.

247
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,740
So the military prosecutor, the lawyer,

248
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:55,350
and the judge will all do as Mother says.

249
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,730
No matter what, the military always obey.

250
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,250
Yes, Chairman. That's exactly the point.

251
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:23,450
I think Chairman No decided to enlist.

252
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,610
Good Job, Lawyer Yong.

253
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:28,130
A toast to Division Commander No Hwa Yeong.

254
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,480
Cheers!

255
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,390
Thank you, everyone.

256
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,600
- We're thankful.
- Right.

257
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,590
Among our colleagues, you are the first to become a division commander.

258
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:48,340
- As expected, No Hwa Yeong, don't you agree?
- Right.

259
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:53,760
Hey, hey. Everyone knows that becoming commander of the 4th Division is a free pass to commander of the army.

260
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,290
Of course, of course. She is the leading candidate to become the next army commander.

261
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:00,540
I can't believe one of our classmates will rise to be the army commander.

262
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:04,230
Stop! Stop moving! Stop!

263
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,140
Loyalty!

264
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,930
Commander of the Army, please take care of us.

265
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:10,150
Hey, hey. You're overdoing it.

266
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,020
What's that? Sit down.

267
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,590
That's too much.

268
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:16,210
I'm seeing you for the first time in a long time, so it makes the drink taste good.

269
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,980
Kang In, have a glass of drink from me too.

270
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,520
I drank a lot.

271
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,590
Give it to someone else.

272
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:29,050
If you drink alone, it'll taste bitter. So drink with her.

273
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:35,120
Hey. Let's just move forward in step.

274
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:41,380
Even if she is a gangster with stars, she's a classmate.

275
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,440
On top of that, a woman. It's kind of uncomfortable for me, as a soldier,

276
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,850
to have to salute her.

277
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:53,530
Hey, are you also like that?

278
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:57,060
If not, forget it.

279
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:02,980
I need to pee.

280
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,940
What an ass...

281
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:14,440
He kept on failing to be promoted. He's upset at you for no reason.

282
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,750
Hwa Yeong, be understanding.

283
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:21,250
Usually, even if one can bear starving, can one stand the stomachache of envy?

284
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:24,590
You're so right.

285
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:28,260
- Foolish guy.
- Have a drink.

286
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:32,570
She can't even control her son, but she is the division commander?

287
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,660
Don't make me fall down laughing.

288
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:40,770
Even so, I am worried. Because of her son, I wonder if Hwa Yeong knows she's got a roadblock on the road to success.

289
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:44,770
The bitch who even can't shoot a gun. How does she talk day in and day out about the spirit de corps?

290
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,760
It's so ridiculous.

291
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:53,190
Hey. Stop saying that. Don't you know she has great shooting ability?

292
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:59,590
Hey. How can a soldier be a soldier without this?

293
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:04,000
It makes me boiling mad.

294
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,930
Why is No Hwa Yeong moving up at super speed?

295
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:11,630
Do you think she lobbied the top?

296
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,260
Right, that's what it was.

297
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,560
She moved up because she is a woman.

298
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,470
Did I become the division commander because I'm a woman?

299
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:29,430
How dare you come in here saying that?

300
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,960
Only men can come in here.

301
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,030
- The same is true in the military.
- Keep this in mind.

302
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:38,870
There are no men or women in the army. The only ones here are soldiers.

303
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:41,940
You pathetic bastard.

304
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,650
Because you are a woman, I gave you a break—

305
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,960
What are you doing—

306
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,660
- Hwa Yeong, stop it.
- Don't interrupt me.

307
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:58,860
Do you know why I'm on top of you?

308
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:03,370
It's simple. I'm a stronger soldier than you.

309
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,930
This is the place your shit head can go.

310
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:16,810
If you want to earn a living as a soldier, bow your head in front of me.

311
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:20,290
In the future in front of me, state your official rank and name correctly.

312
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:23,010
If you run your mouth without thinking again,

313
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,030
I'll make a hole here.

314
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:35,260
Are you okay? Are you okay?

315
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,450
If there were an important crossroads

316
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:53,320
in CEO Kang Ha Jun's life, when would it be?

317
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,250
When I was studying in America,

318
00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:00,760
I wanted to raise funds quickly to start a business. So I fell into doing a bad thing at the time.

319
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,350
Eventually it swallowed me.

320
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:09,170
Then something fateful happened to me. That opportunity changed my whole life.

321
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:13,450
Was the opportunity you are talking about IM Defense?

322
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:18,550
I heard Kang's Solution was able to start due to an investment from IM Defense.

323
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:24,210
Yes. Everything I have achieved is thanks to Chairman Cha Ho Cheol.

324
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:30,300
He's not at my side now, but I will be in his debt forever.

325
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,400
IM Defense. Chairman Cha Ho Cheol.

326
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,550
IM Defense invests tens of billions in Kang's Solution's new defense system

327
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:53,460
I'm thinking about the chairman. I miss him more today.

328
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:57,200
I'm sure he has seen us cleaning the trash, hasn't he?

329
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,280
Is Cha Wu In's father Chairman Cha Ho Cheol?

330
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,830
Do Bae Man

331
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:24,420
- Yes, Prosecutor Do.
- Come to the interrogation room now.

332
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,350
All right.

333
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:07,290
It's not bad seeing each other face to face here like this.

334
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,550
More than anything, I just want the truth.

335
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,390
There's no other meaning.

336
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,570
That's fine with me.

337
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:24,640
At first, I thought it was just Han Se Na's revenge.

338
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,230
That's why you captured Allen and exposed the video.

339
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:33,730
However, that was just the external appearance. There is another real reason.

340
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:37,640
The person you were aiming for was No Tae Nam, not Allen.

341
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,040
Does that have a basis?

342
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:47,050
Don't you think so?

343
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:53,770
Because you, Cha Wu In, are the daughter of Cha Ho Cheol, Chairman of IM Defense.

344
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:06,690
It's revenge against No Tae Nam, for whom It wasn't enough to bury your father

345
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:09,980
with false charges of leaking military secrets and embezzlement, so through manipulation of the stock price,

346
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:16,480
he took your father's company and killed him in the guise of an accident.

347
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,570
What's the point of a law that should be applied fairly to everyone,

348
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:22,400
if the outcome of a ruling is dependent on how much money you have?

349
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:27,390
We promise our prosecution of Cha Ho Cheol, who intensified the public's mistrust of justice,

350
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,520
will result in severe punishment.

351
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,830
I'm certain Yong Mun Gu is also a candidate for revenge.

352
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:36,100
So that's why I interfered with your surveillance of every move I make.

353
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,920
Please check for a bug.

354
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,580
What?

355
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:55,160
I inserted the device but I didn't monitor it. I'm sure you won't believe me.

356
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,190
It doesn't matter to me.

357
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:04,970
Cha Wu In. Why, out of all jobs, did you become a military prosecutor?

358
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:08,130
I feel like I'm being interrogated.

359
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:11,130
What's your real reason for joining the army?

360
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:15,200
I guess you still haven't figured that out.

361
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:21,210
You said that only military prosecutors can bring criminals in uniform into court

362
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,090
at the inauguration ceremony for General No Hwa Yeong.

363
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:25,760
You called me to sound me out.

364
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,020
You don't have any evidence to be certain yet.

365
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:32,300
- Answer.
- That's right it is General No Hwa Yeong.

366
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,840
The true owner of IM Defense is No Hwa Yeong.

367
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,400
Hey, Cha Wu In.

368
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:51,890
I do not intend to become involved in your personal vendetta.

369
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:55,140
Is it because, when you are discharged, you will become No Tae Nam's man?

370
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,770
Yes.

371
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,890
You'll have to fight against me then.

372
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,820
You'd better understand it clearly.

373
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:07,370
Now that you have found all the answers about me,

374
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:11,310
it is time for you to find the answers about yourself.

375
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,570
Answers about myself?

376
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:19,910
If I said it, you wouldn't believe me.

377
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:22,530
You've found all the answers about me by yourself.

378
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:29,980
You'll figure out why we have to fight together.

379
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:05,420
Self-driving test

380
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,190
When dealing with combat situations or dangerous explosives disposal,

381
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:22,350
the military vehicle can be externally remote controlled,

382
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:24,350
which ensures the soldiers' safety.

383
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,580
Everything is due to the vehicle control chip.

384
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:29,520
Until this chip is complete, I've become indebted to so many people.

385
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,670
Chairman, I'm planning to test the remote explosion on a real road.

386
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:34,980
When should it be scheduled?
 Cha Wu In

387
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,000
Oh, that? I've already conducted it.

388
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,270
- Pardon?
- It was better than I expected.

389
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,900
Good.

390
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,670
Do Bae Man found out everything.

391
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:04,250
Who my father is, who I am.

392
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:08,440
Even that Yong Mun Gu and No Hwa Yeong were behind your father's death?

393
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,180
Yeah.

394
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:14,330
What will Do Bae Man do in the future?

395
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:16,360
Will it turn out as we expect?

396
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,260
As he has learned everything about me,

397
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,830
I'm sure he can't go back to who he was.

398
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:55,730
I'm waiting for you, Prosecutor Do,

399
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:58,460
to wake up from oblivion.

400
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:13,540
There. I stake my cooking on quantity rather than quality.

401
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:19,550
Congratulations on your discharge. You've worked hard for five years.

402
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,790
Auntie, you also are very busy nowadays, aren't you?

403
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:24,760
That No Tae Nam did something.

404
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,990
Damn! Even just thinking about those punks ...

405
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:31,630
I'm going to throw all of them into jail.

406
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,390
How much better the world would be if there were only men like you.

407
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:40,570
Eat up. Eat a lot.

408
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,230
Yes.

409
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:49,030
It was awesome when you had the press conference for the emperor service case.

410
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:51,850
I wondered if you were my nephew.

411
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:55,670
It reminded me of my oppa and sister-in-law who died young.

412
00:34:55,670 --> 00:35:00,380
I wish you would continue to be a military prosecutor. But that's my greed.

413
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:06,630
Bae Man, you are the shining sun of my life.

414
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,810
Eat up. Eat.

415
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,340
Auntie.

416
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:20,630
Mom and Dad were in an accident.

417
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:24,250
Could you request the investigation data from then?

418
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,310
Is it difficult because it wasn't in your jurisdiction?

419
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:29,080
Even though it's not my jurisdiction, I looked into it before.

420
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,290
The police don't have the data.

421
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:34,870
I was told the case was transferred to a military investigation team.

422
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:36,610
You heard that it was transferred to the military?

423
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:40,470
Yeah. The driver who caused the accident was a soldier.

424
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,860
A soldier.

425
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:46,060
Do you remember which unit took over the investigation?

426
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,500
I don't remember the unit.

427
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:53,940
I put the business card of the officer in charge somewhere.

428
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,740
Yu Jeong Yeon

429
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,140
Yeom Sang Jin

430
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:31,640
Army Yeom Sang Jin

431
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,580
Chairman Cha Ho Cheol?

432
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,890
Chairman

433
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:53,930
What should I do? It's the chairman.

434
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,190
Turn off your phone for now.

435
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:09,210
Chairman

436
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:24,810
Then... was the person who called that day

437
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,030
Chairman Cha Ho Cheol?

438
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,810
Good job.

439
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:22,940
Thank you.

440
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:31,190
When both No Tae Nam and Allen were captured,

441
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:34,110
I was barely able to sleep without sleeping pills.

442
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:36,700
Eonni. Eonni, can the law be like that?

443
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,760
How can No Tae Nam be out, huh?

444
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:46,330
Se Na. It's going to be hard, but give me a little time.

445
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:49,690
You'll help me to the end, right?

446
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,890
I submitted the video to the police.

447
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:55,270
It's not that I'm helping you. It's my job now.

448
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:57,390
Eonni.

449
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:05,450
At the time I just lost track of things so I couldn't ask.

450
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:10,370
You decided to release the video. Was it because of Lawyer Yong Mun Gu?

451
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:14,130
Yes. I couldn't bear it

452
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:17,320
because he even used my mother to threaten me.

453
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:21,270
Your mother's life depends on your choice, Se Na.

454
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:25,530
That was not a threat.

455
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,050
What?

456
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:30,400
Yong Mun Gu doesn't make threats like that.

457
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,030
Perhaps

458
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:35,530
he provoked you.

459
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:40,180
Sutaeira Hotel

460
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:55,590
He used Se Na.

461
00:39:55,590 --> 00:40:00,390
The video was publicly revealed so that No Tae Nam would be arrested.

462
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,590
58th Division General Prosecutors' Office.

463
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,470
What should I do, Prosecutor?

464
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:24,560
The case file you requested doesn't exist.

465
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,670
All of it was discarded by an incineration order.

466
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,530
All discarded?

467
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,980
Yes.

468
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:35,760
When will Chief Yeom Sang Jin come in?

469
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,930
Oh, there he comes.

470
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,990
Chief Yeom, the military prosecutor has been waiting for you.

471
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:51,180
I am military prosecutor Do Bae Man, from the 4th Infantry Division's Military Justice Office.

472
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:55,550
I see. What brings you here?

473
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:03,070
This is my old business card.

474
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,720
I apologize for showing up out of the blue.

475
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:09,010
I heard that you were the investigator in charge of my parents' accident case.

476
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:12,160
May I ask you a few questions?

477
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,850
Yes. Follow me, please.

478
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,310
Yes.

479
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:24,870
Oh, thank you.

480
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,070
I will be discharged in a few days. Please feel free to drop your formalities when you speak to me.

481
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,660
Even so...

482
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,680
It's really alright.

483
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:42,850
Both of your parents were highly competent prosecutors.

484
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:47,110
At the law office, I was a successor to them.

485
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,860
I see.

486
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:53,480
But I heard that all related documentation has been destroyed.

487
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:58,360
It's not something that happens often, but it isn't necessarily that strange either.

488
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,750
Because it's the military.

489
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:03,020
Was there anything special about the case?

490
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:07,160
Why are you looking at me like that?

491
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:11,450
How much do you remember from back then?

492
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:14,050
Do you mean my memories of the car accident?

493
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,270
I remember the car being overturned after the crash.

494
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:21,160
And? After that?

495
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,010
I think I became conscious at the hospital.

496
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:28,320
It looks like you remember nothing.

497
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,850
Perhaps...

498
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:34,510
Was the incident not an accident?

499
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:41,140
Sometimes memories can become poison.

500
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:44,010
This may be all the better for you.

501
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:48,010
That's all I can say right now.

502
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:51,550
Chief Yeom. Chief Yeom!

503
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:04,750
Something I can't remember. What is that?

504
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:11,030
IM CEO No Tae Nam

505
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,840
Chairman, you will be enlisted in the 4th Division, where General No is.

506
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,280
Then what happens to the company while I'm gone?

507
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:22,930
If you care that much for the company, all the more reason for you to enlist.

508
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:24,290
Pardon?

509
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:29,580
The stock price that plummeted because of the video has begun to recover after you were arrested.

510
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:33,350
As long as you enlist, the company will find stability

511
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:35,440
since the risk you bring will be eliminated.

512
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,620
Mother. IM is my everything.

513
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:40,070
Don't fool yourself.

514
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:44,350
You were only given this position because you are my son.

515
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:49,520
Anybody who puts the company at risk needs to leave immediately.

516
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:52,870
Mother...

517
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,390
What should we do about the video that the police have received?

518
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:07,040
Leave it.

519
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,610
Will it be alright, General?

520
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:12,350
Let the news of the video get out. And send Tae Nam to the army.

521
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:15,000
No matter how much he resists enlistment,

522
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,710
once he faces rock bottom, he won't be able to say he prefers prison over the military.

523
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,310
Yes, I will do as instructed.

524
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,570
Lawyer Yong.

525
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:30,240
Yes, General.

526
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:35,620
After Tae Nam goes to the army, you take charge of IM for the time being.

527
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,970
Yes, I understand.

528
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,440
It has been decided that Chairman No will enlist in the military.

529
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:21,040
Chairman No had no choice from the beginning.

530
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:27,080
And unaware of that fact, I risked everything trying to make Chairman No's military exemption project happen.

531
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:30,020
And you, knowing everything, pretended otherwise.

532
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:32,810
Well, I wasn't expecting the video.

533
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:35,430
At the end of the day, you reap what you sow.

534
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:37,720
I clearly barked up the wrong tree.

535
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:43,050
On top of that, you also revealed your true colors. So all in all, I gained a lot.

536
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:53,530
Unfortunately for you, you have lost everything because you betrayed me.

537
00:45:53,530 --> 00:46:00,300
Our ties have now become permanently severed, but I feel strangely at ease.

538
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,360
I'll start over from the bottom.

539
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,780
This time it is goodbye for real.

540
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:23,050
Forget-me-not coffee shop

541
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:30,190
Closed

542
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,380
I'm here.

543
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,360
Welcome.

544
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:37,320
You came early.

545
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:41,130
Thank you.

546
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:43,290
Madam, thank you.

547
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:45,370
The pleasure is mine.

548
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:54,040
- You're saying releasing the video out into the world was part of Lawyer Yong's plan?
- Yes.

549
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:57,140
My instinct told me so once I met Se Na.

550
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:00,690
No Hwa Yeong directed it, and Yong Mun Gu executed it.

551
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:03,100
Eh, no way.

552
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,960
She is somebody who is never shaken by unexpected situations

553
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:10,370
and knows how to turn the tides in her favor.

554
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:15,500
Lawyer Yong Mun Gu should be holding a press conference right now.

555
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:24,690
Some may claim that he is enlisting to seek refuge before trial. These claims are completely unfounded.

556
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:29,610
Chairman No Tae Nam had already received a notification of enlistment a month ago from the Military Administration

557
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:34,090
and was in the process of setting a date to faithfully fulfill his military service obligation.

558
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:39,190
As of today, Chairman No Tae Nam will be dropping all of his titles related to IM Defense.

559
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:46,030
However, I make it clear that his resignation does not in any way suggest an admission of guilt for his case.

560
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:50,430
He simply concluded that he should enlist to uphold the sacred duty of national defense as any Korean man should,

561
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:55,570
and felt it was inappropriate to postpone his enlistment just because of the trial.

562
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:58,780
Chairman No Tae Nam will faithfully participate in the military trial after enlistment,

563
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:02,770
and fight to uncover the truth.

564
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:08,430
If Chairman No Tae Nam enlists in the military, what happens to the position of IM Defense chairman?
- How amazing. You gold spoons.

565
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:13,810
That matter will be addressed in an official announcement that the company will make soon.

566
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:22,420
So Yong Mun Gu takes over the vacant CEO position.

567
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,970
Wu In, your prediction was right.

568
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:27,520
So she trusts her right arm more than her son?

569
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,020
They are just puppets anyway.

570
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:35,910
Whether it's No Tae Nam or Yong Mun Gu, it's just a placeholder for No Hwa Yeong.

571
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:39,020
No Hwa Yeong will never take off her military uniform.

572
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:45,110
Since the money accumulated by IM Defense is only a weapon she is wielding to continue living as a soldier.

573
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:53,490
There are other people besides me who want to help you.

574
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:57,210
Chief Yeom Sang Jin

575
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:06,580
Yes, Chief Yeom.

576
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:14,710
Bae Man came to me.

577
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:17,700
He must have come to ask you about his parents' accident.

578
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:22,650
He couldn't remember the most important thing.

579
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:25,450
Tomorrow, No Tae Nam enlists.

580
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:27,990
And Prosecutor Do Bae Man is discharged.

581
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:30,030
The same time, same day?

582
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:34,350
What a funny coincidence.

583
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:38,380
If possible, I would like to just tell Bae Man everything.

584
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:39,860
No.

585
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:44,640
Even if it takes time, he needs to recall it of his own accord.

586
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:51,570
Once he's ready to accept the truth, he'll come to find you.

587
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:53,490
That will be the beginning.

588
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:57,930
Will Bae Man really come and find me again?

589
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:06,360
A mask for UV protection.

590
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,140
I should pack this.

591
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:15,200
What else should I pack? Oh yes, Bolt's stuff.

592
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,730
I'm going, so of course, you should too.

593
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,630
- Oh, you're here.
- Yes.

594
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:43,050
Chairman, these are all things you cannot bring to boot camp.

595
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:47,940
Everything you are wearing and your luggage will be packed up and sent back when you enter.

596
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,370
Oh my god.

597
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:53,240
You know that I can't live without any of these things.

598
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,100
Bolt can't even excrete without this.

599
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,380
Bolt can't go into the training center with you.

600
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:01,720
I'll just take care of him in my room with me.

601
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,680
You're enlisting, not traveling.

602
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,400
There are no private rooms for trainee soldiers.

603
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:12,830
I don't have my own room? Then what about showering?

604
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:15,840
At boot camp, you must live with others as a collective group.

605
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:20,340
Group life

606
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:24,650
How on earth do you expect me to survive there?

607
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,240
Do you think it makes sense that I am supposed to

608
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:34,470
eat and sleep in the same room as those commoners?

609
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:39,470
I've never thought of going to the army, ever.

610
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:13,950
Army don't hide a criminal

611
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:35,470
Captain Do Bae Man.

612
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:40,320
Congratulations on your discharge, Captain Do Bae Man

613
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,980
Congratulations on joining boot camp.

614
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:47,010
Good morning.

615
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,520
Unity.

616
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,900
I, Captain Do Bae Man, am reporting for discharge,

617
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:07,710
effective as of November 20, 2021.

618
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:10,370
I hereby report this.

619
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:12,550
Unity.

620
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:35,770
Do Bae Man.

621
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:42,170
Do you think you deserve my salute?

622
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:07,510
It will be difficult for a while. Why don't you give him one last hug?

623
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:09,710
Just go.

624
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:13,140
I can't go in if I look at him.

625
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,650
Mother didn't come, right?

626
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:21,580
Chairman, I am here for you.

627
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:24,030
Don't worry about anything, and...

628
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:30,760
Bolt. You're my only true family, you know.

629
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,690
Because you're always on my side.

630
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:48,200
As a military prosecutor, you acted as a broker just for a few bucks?

631
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,850
And you still call yourself a military prosecutor?

632
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:55,270
You are a disgrace to the Republic of Korea army, you filthy bastard.

633
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:04,830
Please don't speak carelessly.

634
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:07,420
This bastard—

635
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:13,040
The moment I leave this place, I become a civilian.

636
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,990
I will no longer be your subordinate.

637
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,160
Get lost. Immediately.

638
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,360
Don't come anywhere near the military.

639
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,720
Unity.

640
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:02,820
Unity.

641
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:29,620
One month later.

642
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:02,860
Defendant / Defense Attorney

643
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:05,540
Everyone, stand.

644
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:11,260
The division commander is coming.

645
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,530
We are all present, take your seats.

646
00:57:56,320 --> 00:58:01,300
We shall now begin the military trial of the defendant, trainee soldier No Tae Nam.

647
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:04,440
Firstly, the defendant, trainee soldier No Tae Nam...

648
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,520
Memories are fragments.

649
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:40,050
Somebody is bound to possess one of the pieces of my lost memory.

650
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:47,120
Memories are only momentarily broken, not gone.

651
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:52,090
Mom, open your eyes!

652
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:56,740
Mom! Mom, open your eyes!

653
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:59,620
Open your eyes!

654
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:41,860
Oblivion, the supposed gift from God, was a punishment.

655
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:44,160
No Hwa Yeong (In Korean)
No (In Roman alphabet)

656
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,060
The face that was covered under the military cap,

657
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:51,500
the name, and that smile.

658
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:55,090
It took me 20 years to remember it.

659
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:09,970
♫ This time won't be the last ♫

660
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:12,160
♫ and same like that before ♫

661
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:16,990
♫ Do whatever you want. Yeah I don't care ♫

662
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:20,840
♫ It's obvious I'm holding my breath ♫

663
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:23,690
♫ What you gonna do ♫

664
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:26,620
♫ I'm on fire like I'm gonna burn down ♫

665
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:31,330
♫ Yeah I'm losing my mind. Don't know where to go now ♫

666
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:34,310
♫ Steeply rising breaths chasing me from behind ♫

667
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:38,930
I will be your faithful hunting dog, Cha Wu In.

668
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:42,810
♫ Feels like I'm losing control ♫

669
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:46,480
Military Prosecutor Doberman

670
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,250
♫ No chance you can't get away now ♫

671
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:52,200
♫ You can't find your way out ♫

672
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:55,300
♫ You are the prey in my hand ♫

673
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:59,480
For Do Bae Man who shares the same fate as me.

674
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:02,090
I need Military Prosecutor Do Bae Man.

675
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:05,620
I don't intend to be shackled to a past I'm not sure of.

676
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,170
Your first client is waiting.

677
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:10,140
If you aren't here as a client of the law firm, I have nothing to discuss with you.

678
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:11,210
She got into an accident.

679
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:14,640
You also were dragged like me. Who are you to boss me around?

680
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:18,200
But about that military prosecutor. I don't know what it is exactly, but I feel apprehensive.

681
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,690
I'm going to be your faithful hunting dog from now on.

682
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:24,510
A doberman who, once it bites, won't let go.

683
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:26,530
♫ I won't let you go ♫

684
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:29,300
♫ I'm on fire like I'm gonna burn down ♫

685
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:32,810
♫ Yeah I'm losing my mind ♫
