1
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,897
- Good morning!
- Morning!

2
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:26,025
- Could you get the batter out?
- Okay!

3
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:29,446
I'm sorry we're so understaffed.

4
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,197
I hope we can open on time.

5
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,616
- Where's Ms. Koizumi?
- She's late.

6
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,785
I bet she'll be absent again.

7
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,704
I'm used to it now.

8
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,376
- That's beautiful.
- It's my masterpiece.

9
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,255
Gateau invisible
coated with raspberry glazing.

10
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:51,509
There. Do you want to try?

11
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:54,846
- Oh, no. I'll mess it up!
- It'll be fine! Try it!

12
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,772
That's good! Slowly.

13
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,940
- Can you make it even?
- Yes.

14
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,192
Good.

15
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,612
- Nice! Smooth it out with this.
- Okay!

16
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:11,696
There you go.

17
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,242
Yes. Perfect!

18
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,079
- You're good at this!
- Thank you.

19
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:22,457
How about you work
in the kitchen from now on?

20
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:26,085
- Um…
- I want you to be my assistant.

21
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,045
What?

22
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:31,341
You said you wanted to be
a pastry chef in your interview.

23
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,010
- Well, that was…
- A lie?

24
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:36,513
No. But…

25
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,515
I was naive.

26
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:43,228
Watching you, I realized
I couldn't possibly be one.

27
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,521
That's not true.

28
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,816
Look how beautiful it looks.

29
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,693
- Excuse me…
- Yes?

30
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,071
- The police are here.
- Huh?

31
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,073
- Thank you.
- Wait…

32
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,534
- Hey… You can't…
- Excuse me.

33
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,537
Sorry to bother you at work.

34
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,164
I'm Tomizawa, Asaoka Police Station.

35
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,332
I'm Yoshioka.

36
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,251
Oh, um…

37
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:10,380
Could we ask you about
the incident that happened near here?

38
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,134
We're busy right now with preparation.

39
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,844
It won't take long.

40
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,721
We ask for your assistance.

41
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,641
Okay.

42
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,893
Let's talk inside.

43
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,688
Take care of the rest.

44
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:27,939
No problem.

45
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,400
Are you Mio Kamishiro?

46
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,734
Huh?

47
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,611
Yes, I am.

48
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:37,323
I want to ask Ms. Kamishiro
a few things too.

49
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,449
What?

50
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,369
Uh…

51
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,503
Yes.

52
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:54,090
She did come to our store a few times.

53
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,675
Since when?

54
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:59,846
It's impossible to tell.
We have so many customers.

55
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,599
Any idea, Ms. Kamishiro?

56
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:08,062
She came to interview us
at the beginning of April.

57
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,190
But before that, I'm not quite sure.

58
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:14,193
She interviewed you two, yes?

59
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,195
That's correct.

60
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:20,783
I couldn't contribute much,
but she wanted to hear

61
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:24,203
<i>the appeal of working here</i>
<i>from a female employee.</i>

62
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,456
<i>How did she seem?</i>

63
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,083
<i>She was very easy to talk to.</i>

64
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,793
<i>We ended up talking</i>

65
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,339
<i>about things that were</i>
<i>unrelated to the interview.</i>

66
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,760
- Did she come here again afterward?
- Yes.

67
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,721
She seemed to really like our cakes.

68
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:44,224
Did you ever converse with her?

69
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,019
Not really. Just small talk.

70
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,854
I was busy working.

71
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,607
Is something wrong?

72
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,775
Nothing.

73
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,485
Can we go now?

74
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:59,155
- My batter is going to waste!
- Just a few more questions.

75
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,490
Mr. Oyamada,

76
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,493
did you know Ms. Minamizawa
on a personal level?

77
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:07,956
- Excuse me?
- Did you ever meet her in private?

78
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,291
What? Why would I?

79
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,709
That's absurd!

80
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,879
- Why is it absurd?
- Mr. Tomizawa…

81
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:20,301
- What about you, Ms. Kamishiro?
- Never.

82
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:25,098
However, she had asked
to meet for tea or something.

83
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,977
So when I heard the news, I…

84
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:33,273
I couldn't believe it.

85
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,443
- Are we done now?
- No, we're not.

86
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:41,072
- Huh? Why are you--
- Don't you get it? She was murdered!

87
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,498
Let me make you understand.

88
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:57,714
As it was reported,
she was strangled to death in her home.

89
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,009
<i>She must've fought back hard.</i>

90
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:05,138
<i>The skin around her neck</i>
<i>was torn with nail scratches.</i>

91
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:12,520
After she was murdered,
her body was abandoned in a suitcase…

92
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,563
Mr. Tomizawa.

93
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:17,317
…in a deserted area of a failed
housing development project.

94
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,777
<i>So it took time to find her body.</i>

95
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,405
<i>Gas had built up in her body,</i>

96
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:26,200
<i>it was the strange smell</i>
<i>that led to her being discovered.</i>

97
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,665
Excuse me.

98
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,047
Are you happy now?

99
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,466
What are you accusing us of?

100
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,345
My apologies.

101
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,890
- Let's go.
- Yes.

102
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:22,090
Here's your change, 620 yen.

103
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,095
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

104
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:35,353
You look really pale.

105
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,604
Are you okay?

106
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,147
I'm okay.

107
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,776
I was eavesdropping actually.

108
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:45,071
But that detective. He's nasty!

109
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,864
- I thought so, too.
- Right?

110
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:50,409
I guess Mr. Oyamada's
one of their suspects.

111
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,079
He was really into that journalist.

112
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,039
- What?
- Oh…

113
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:59,752
You didn't know he was sending her
his newest creations?

114
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,337
- He was?
- Yeah.

115
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:06,008
He asked me to fill out
the shipping label a few times…

116
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,889
"I want it to melt inside you."

117
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,266
What?

118
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:16,727
That's what it said on a message card
that I accidentally saw!

119
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,646
Weird, right?

120
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,733
Damn!

121
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,819
Shit!

122
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,119
Don't ever do that again.

123
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,246
We're done for if the inspector finds out.

124
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,747
Shut up already!

125
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,797
So, what did you think of her?

126
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,841
What do you mean?

127
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,302
You suspect her?

128
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,929
- That's why you upset her?
- Not exactly.

129
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,473
I don't get it.

130
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,309
Oyamada's definitely more suspicious.

131
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,352
He was sending her his cakes.

132
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:02,482
He's a chef!
Maybe he just wanted compliments.

133
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,029
Did you not get that as a gift?

134
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,531
Don't be dumb. Who would I give it to?

135
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,079
Wow!

136
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,373
It's good.

137
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,378
He could just be a dessert freak.

138
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,090
Hey, do you want some?

139
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,426
I don't like sweets.

140
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:37,099
Ms. Minamizawa didn't like
sweet things either, apparently.

141
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,351
Oh, really.

142
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,311
Wait, what?

143
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,355
Strange, huh?

144
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:47,610
If so, why would she go back there
after the interview?

145
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,363
So, was the interview just an excuse?

146
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:53,407
- An excuse for what?
- What do you think?

147
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:59,247
Was it to ask Oyamada
about something else?

148
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:03,501
Or was it to approach
Mio Kamishiro for something.

149
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:07,004
But what could it be?

150
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:08,631
No idea.

151
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:13,469
But one thing I now know is
that she knew nothing about the incident.

152
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,181
- These are for you!
- Okay.

153
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,517
You're such a slow eater!

154
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,936
- I can't wait for you.
- Hey! Wait!

155
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,646
Delicious as always!

156
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,692
The police?

157
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,820
Is this guy Oyamada safe to be around?

158
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,154
Well…

159
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,699
I don't think he's the culprit.

160
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:39,161
He seemed worried
about the store's reputation.

161
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,456
Even so. I do worry about you.

162
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,794
I'm going to be even busier
which means you'll be on your own a lot.

163
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:50,339
- Is the startup going well?
- Yeah.

164
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:54,802
I have an investor
who seems interested in investing.

165
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,804
That's great!

166
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,389
I believe in you.

167
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,057
<i>Oh, just a reminder.</i>

168
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,268
<i>Don't tell anyone, okay?</i>

169
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,353
<i>I know!</i>

170
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:08,524
<i>- What are you making?</i>
<i>- I'm making…</i>

171
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,608
TAISEI LIFE INSURANCE

172
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,240
LIFE INSURANCE
AUTOMATIC RENEWAL NOTICE

173
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,815
- Just a moment. We'll check for you.
- Okay.

174
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,066
Mio.

175
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,111
- Mio! Could you go check inside?
- Huh?

176
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,696
Sorry, check what?

177
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,532
The financier. It should be ready by now.

178
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,284
- Okay.
- Thank you.

179
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,953
- Please wait.
- Do you have any Mogador?

00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:31,333
You know, you can't
keep skipping out on work.

181
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,462
Money? I gave you some just the other day!

182
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:35,588
Oh…

183
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,007
- Are the financier…
- Yep, they are ready!

184
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,508
Okay…

185
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,886
Hello? No, don't hang up!

186
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,513
Let's discuss this! Are you listening?

187
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,849
Listen to me!

188
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,479
Well, okay.

189
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,522
That's fine for now.

190
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,984
Don't forget to prepare the money.

191
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,362
I have to go now. I'm busy.

192
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,156
Bye!

193
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,607
It came out great.

194
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,864
Hey. Can you hear me?

195
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,662
I hate it.

196
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,706
I absolutely hate it…

197
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,126
when other people are happy!

198
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,427
- Good work today.
- You too.

199
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:09,723
Ms. Kamishiro,
have you thought about what I said?

200
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,850
Huh? Oh!

201
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:17,064
I would like to try
but I want to ask my husband.

202
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:20,818
Why does it matter
what your husband thinks?

203
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,194
Well…

204
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:27,032
I'm worried about the longer work hours
on top of housework.

205
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,535
I'm sure you can make it work.

206
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,162
- Let's discuss it over a drink!
- No, I…

207
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,790
There's new chocolate I made and red wine!

208
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,210
- No, it's fine…
- I really feel like drinking tonight.

209
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,629
I also need your advice.

210
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,632
No, I, uh…

211
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,973
- Are you closed already?
- No…

212
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,976
We have leftovers,
and I can give you a discount.

213
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,352
Sounds great!

214
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,897
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.

215
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,816
- You're done with work?
- Hmm?

216
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,360
I got off early, so I came to pick you up.

217
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,365
- I'm glad I made it in time.
- Really?

218
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,160
- Wait here, I'll go get changed.
- Okay.

219
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,499
Was he coming on to you?

220
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:22,755
To be honest, I don't know.
I don't really understand him.

221
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,840
I think he's lonely.

222
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,217
I'm glad I came to meet you.

223
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,179
You didn't clock off early for me,
did you?

224
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,430
I did for you.

225
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,474
Oh…

226
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,768
I feel bad.

227
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,563
I'm kidding!

228
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,107
What's wrong?

229
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,026
You seem down lately.

230
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,695
Lack of sleep?

231
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,489
Are you taking fewer meds?

232
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,741
Well…

233
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,744
I know.

234
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:56,288
Let's do that thing tonight.

235
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,331
What?

236
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,584
- This.
- Oh!

237
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,170
- Okay!
- Oh!

238
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:08,008
- I see where your mind went…
- No!

239
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,429
- We can do that afterwards, too.
- Stop!

240
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,545
Where do you want to go?

241
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:50,217
- The beach!
- Sounds good.

242
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,407
Can you see it?

243
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,659
Yes, I can.

244
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,208
No one's there.

245
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:32,551
<i>We are the only people</i>
<i>to exist in this world.</i>

246
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:44,146
- Thank you.
- Get home safe.

247
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,203
Good evening.

248
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,374
Thanks.

249
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,255
That woman. She's a sex worker, right?

250
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,886
You hired one again?

251
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,263
You can't go without sex, huh?

252
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,349
I guess so.

253
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,686
Did she wear the shop uniform, too?

254
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,230
Don't bring that up.

255
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,527
What do you mean? How can I not?

256
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,905
I was so shocked to see it!

257
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:38,742
<i>I only went back</i>
<i>because I forgot something.</i>

258
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,584
Wait.

259
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:51,213
Sir… Hey, you're hurting me.

260
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,925
Call me chef, not sir.

261
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,720
Okay, Chef!

262
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,639
Gently, please…

263
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,307
I know.

264
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,477
Chef.

265
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,188
- Can I take the hat off?
- No! Of course not!

266
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,108
What? Seriously…

267
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:16,488
You imagined her
as Ms. Kamishiro, didn't you?

268
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,867
"I love you, Mio!"

269
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,619
"Don't lick that, Mio. It's dirty!"

270
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,663
"Oh, Mio!"

271
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:28,250
You're wrong.
I don't think of her in that way.

272
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,878
She has talent.

273
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:34,423
- Which is why…
- You liar!

274
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,008
Oh well…

275
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,301
It doesn't matter.

276
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:41,597
Because if I ever post this online,
you'll be out of business.

277
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,391
I've given you the money, now leave!

278
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:45,851
That's mean!

279
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:49,354
I actually like being here!

280
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,774
For some reason,
these animals make me feel…

281
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,860
relaxed.

282
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,488
You're always so upbeat.

283
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,784
Not always!

284
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,578
See?

285
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:08,081
This is my own "gateau invisible."

286
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,377
There's one I messed up. Do you want it?

287
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,963
Yay! Do you have some alcohol?

288
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,674
I'm not really feeling wine.

289
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,760
Brandy on the rocks!

290
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,554
Thank you!

291
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,899
It's so good!

292
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:39,780
You know, things are going well
with this new guy.

293
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:44,117
He has a beautiful wife
and a happy marriage

294
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,580
which makes it so dark and I just love it!

295
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:53,627
We'll have some fun,
but then I'll tell his wife.

296
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,130
Again, you're so upbeat.

297
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:02,010
It's fun to destroy people's happiness!

298
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:28,412
SORRY, SOMETHING CAME UP
I MIGHT STAY AT THE OFFICE TONIGHT…

299
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,289
THAT'S OKAY. GOOD LUCK

300
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,148
Have a seat.

301
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:04,281
Huh?

302
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,700
Oh…

303
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,246
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

304
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,333
- Could we get another folk, please?
- Right away, sir.

305
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,127
- Thank you.
- No problem.

306
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,341
- Can I put my bag here?
- Sure.

307
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,472
Do you eat here often?

308
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,182
Yes.

309
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,684
Well… Not that often.

310
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,729
I mean…

311
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:39,191
Sorry, I've forgotten your name.

312
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:40,734
I'm Ishiguro.

313
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,571
It's a nice restaurant.

314
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,616
I just moved here
so I don't know the area.

315
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,618
I see…

316
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,496
Here you go.

317
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,623
Oh, thank you.

318
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:57,834
Ready to order?

319
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,837
- I'll have what she's having.
- Certainly.

320
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:10,597
- Where's your husband today?
- Huh?

321
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:15,227
Oh. He's busy with work recently.

322
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,675
Mio! Get down!

323
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,351
Stay calm!

324
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,775
- This is terrifying!
- Please stop!

325
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,194
This is really bad!

326
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,574
- It's stopping.
- Ow!

327
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,784
- Are you okay?
- It's stopped…

328
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,662
- Ouch…
- Are you okay, sir?

329
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,249
Are you okay?

330
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,334
What?

331
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,461
Mr. Ishiguro?

332
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,630
Mr. Ishiguro!

333
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:27,549
I'm fine.

334
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,010
Ah, it hurts!

335
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,018
<i>Now, reports on train services.</i>

336
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:42,939
<i>Due to the earthquake,</i>
<i>the bullet train is not running</i>

337
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:47,903
<i>between Tokyo and Okayama station</i>
<i>until they finish the inspection.</i>

338
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:51,573
<i>The bullet train line to Tohoku</i>
<i>is also suspended</i>

339
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:55,243
<i>between Tokyo and Sendai,</i>
<i>due to a landslide.</i>

340
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,953
Can you turn off the radio?

341
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,413
Thank you.

342
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:00,874
- Okay.
<i>- The trains are now running…</i>

343
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:09,132
Thank you for coming
to the hospital with me.

344
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,343
Not at all.

345
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:12,928
I…

346
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:16,598
- I appreciate what you did.
- It's nothing.

347
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,226
I'm glad you're okay, Mio.

348
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,313
Um…

349
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:27,275
- Did I ever tell you my name?
- What?

350
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:31,988
Oh. I saw it on your doorplate.

351
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,574
I see.

352
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,877
Are you going to be okay?

353
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:50,966
I feel a bit dazed, but I'll sleep it off.

354
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:54,386
Please make sure to rest well.

355
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,638
Thank you.

356
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,767
Mio!

357
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,352
Masato!

358
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,440
What is this?

359
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,693
- It's nothing…
- Let me explain--

360
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,986
No, thank you!

361
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,282
Mio, let's talk inside.

362
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,507
Is that the truth?

363
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,343
Please believe me.

364
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,263
I texted you and called you.

365
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,726
I was in a panic and left
my bag at the restaurant.

366
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,437
It's closed now so I was going to
get it tomorrow.

367
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,646
Fine.

368
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:49,941
I believe you.

369
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,572
But I did ask you, didn't I?

370
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,866
To not go near him?

371
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,201
To not even be in the same elevator.

372
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,494
I'm sorry!

373
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,248
But, I think…

374
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,751
he's not a bad person.

375
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,294
You believe him over me?

376
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,796
No, that's not what I meant!

377
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:22,599
No…

378
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,102
I'm sorry.

379
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,774
You did nothing wrong.

380
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:36,321
I'm in a weird headspace.

381
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:43,453
The earthquake brought back memories.

382
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:49,501
I felt my burn tingle,
and I was worried about you

383
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:53,046
so I came home in a rush
but you weren't home.

384
00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:01,262
The thought of losing
someone dear to me again was…

385
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,058
Masato…

386
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:07,727
I'm sorry.

387
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,898
I'm really sorry.

388
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,033
I'm glad you're okay.

389
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,722
I need to get back to work.

390
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:46,349
Hey!

391
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,060
Yeah?

392
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:52,897
Please don't go.

393
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,026
I'm sorry.

394
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,406
I need to cool off.

395
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,590
Toru…

396
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:49,722
What's…

397
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,560
what's up with you today?

398
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:56,271
A lot of things happened.

399
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,064
Toru…

400
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:06,573
I'M SORRY

401
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,614
You're back.

402
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,533
I'm back.

403
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:57,206
- Hey.
- Hmm?

404
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,956
Ms. Koizumi…

405
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:38,957
Why?

406
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,583
<i>How could I…</i>

407
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:44,295
We found semen inside the victim.

408
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,339
Everything's going well.

409
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:49,092
<i>I know your secret, sir.</i>

410
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:50,843
Good evening.

411
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:53,096
As long as I have Masato. I'm fine.

412
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,556
<i>She's gotten worse. But why?</i>

413
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,100
