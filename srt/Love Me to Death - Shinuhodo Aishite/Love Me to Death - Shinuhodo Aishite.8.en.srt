00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:20,979
Mr. Ishiguro!

2
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:39,581
You…

3
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,459
why are you with my woman?

4
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:00,143
I finally found you.

5
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:17,243
It'll be okay.

6
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,579
Don't be scared.

7
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,338
Mio.

8
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,738
Run!

9
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,865
Go! Now!

10
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,711
What's wrong with you?

11
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,762
It's over.

12
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,167
Mio…

13
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,210
I…

14
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,463
I don't belong to you.

15
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,053
Let's go, now!

16
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,688
Are you okay?

17
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,565
Yes…

18
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,318
I'm fine, but what about your arm?

19
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,696
I can't feel it, it's numb.

20
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,468
Thank you.

21
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,485
Damn it!

22
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,862
The blood trail…

23
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,662
- This way!
- Okay.

24
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,744
Did they notice?

25
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,422
There's no way out?

26
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,193
I see something.

27
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,293
What the…

28
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,812
I'm so sorry.

29
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,821
Suicide, I'm guessing.

30
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,366
He probably heard me.

31
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,409
We need to go.

32
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,324
Huh?

33
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,631
This is it for you.

34
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,885
The police are looking for you.

35
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,805
So what?

36
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,560
Apologize.

37
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,521
What?

38
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,275
Apologize!

39
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,611
To Minamizawa!

40
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,366
Who's that?

41
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,276
Mio!

42
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,071
Where are you?

43
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,325
Mio!

44
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,579
Mio!

45
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:00,957
Stop it.

46
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,050
Oh…

47
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,345
There you are.

48
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,185
Hey, Masato…

49
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,479
Hmm?

50
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,570
Who…

51
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,282
are you?

52
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:39,954
Tell me.

53
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,253
Me?

54
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,883
I'm…

55
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:15,674
Chiko.

56
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,677
Am I dead?

57
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,279
Thank god.

58
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,825
I…

59
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,994
- I'm alive?
- You are!

60
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,429
Let's go.

61
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,098
This way!

62
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,086
Huh?

63
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,726
Hey, you…

64
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,437
Who are you?

65
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,286
You're in my way.

66
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,055
Move!

67
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,361
Good.

68
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,033
Mio!

69
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,398
How did you know?

70
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,276
Chiko led us here.

71
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,050
Mio.

72
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,054
Mio!

73
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,265
Let's go.

74
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,435
Okay.

75
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:34,326
Where are we headed?

76
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,872
I'm not sure.

77
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:41,875
Oh…

78
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,255
I guess somewhere
where we can use a phone.

79
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,507
A convenience store?

80
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,010
Sounds good.

81
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,726
<i>"I started to avoid him little by little,</i>

82
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:03,731
<i>and in the end we decided to part ways.</i>

83
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:08,318
<i>It's been a year since then</i>
<i>but I still care for him."</i>

84
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,822
<i>That was a little bit heartbreaking.</i>

85
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:15,993
<i>I guess it was the right choice</i>
<i>for both of you to be happy.</i>

86
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,787
<i>Although it must've been hard.</i>

87
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:19,872
We're alive…

88
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:23,208
<i>Right, the next song</i>
<i>in our Nostalgic Songs Special</i>

89
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,003
<i>is "My Blue Bird", by Junko Sakurada.</i>

90
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,642
What?

91
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:34,738
Thank you.

92
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,589
- Pull the side brake when I say when!
- Okay!

93
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,468
Now!

94
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,346
Don't get out of the car.

95
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:37,736
Mio.

96
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,075
You did well.

97
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,009
Close your eyes.

98
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,354
Mio!

99
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,356
Don't do it!

100
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,173
No!

101
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:42,629
Time to say goodbye, Mio.

102
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,804
We won't meet again.

103
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:53,890
Not ever.

104
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,799
Can you hear me? What's your name?

105
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,134
Ishiguro.

106
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,052
Is it this side?

107
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,513
Bring blankets!

108
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:40,812
Don't let him…

109
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,317
get away, please.

110
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:50,322
Considering his injury, he can't be far.

111
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:53,074
Leave the rest to us.

112
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,077
Thank you.

113
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:02,459
Mr. Ishiguro,
thank you so much for your help.

114
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,429
I didn't do it for you.

115
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,307
All right, no more talking! Ready?

116
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,309
One, two, three!

117
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:29,736
Okay.

118
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,287
Thank you.

119
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,251
Ready?

120
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,289
How many times has it been?

121
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,709
That I've died.

122
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:37,637
- How far have you searched so far?
- Up to here.

123
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,348
Can we slightly widen the search area?

124
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,433
- Okay.
- Thanks.

125
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:42,767
- Mr. Tomizawa!
- Huh?

126
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:43,768
Look!

127
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,608
That bastard!

128
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,611
- Come on! Hurry!
- Yes!

129
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:26,102
<i>The fire brigade</i>
<i>quickly extinguished the fire,</i>

130
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:31,941
<i>but we found the charred body</i>
<i>of what we believe to be a man.</i>

131
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:37,113
It seems like he used gasoline
drained from a generator nearby.

132
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,910
We found some burnt possessions, too.

133
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,628
This was on his left ring finger.

134
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:58,176
Platinum has a high melting point,
so it survived.

135
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,898
This is my husband's.

<i>The man known as Masato Kamishiro</i>

137
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:20,865

138

<i>The later investigation revealed</i>

139
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:29,874
<i>that he was involved in multiple murders.</i>

140
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:34,129
<i>He set fire</i>

141
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:38,591
<i>to the only friend he ever had</i>
<i>to steal his identity.</i>

142
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:45,682
<i>Killed his sick wife</i>
<i>with poison for her inheritance.</i>

143
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:51,646
<i>And even killed those</i>
<i>who were just inconvenient to his plan.</i>

144
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:58,153
<i>Those who tried to expose him</i>
<i>were also killed.</i>

145
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:24,095
<i>He completely toyed with people's love</i>

146
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,806
<i>and broke their hearts by killing them.</i>

147
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:34,230

"Focus on the person, not the case."

Huh?

159
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,095
You used to tell Minamizawa that.

160
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,223
I thought you sounded so lame…

161
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:53,309

Hmm…

189
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,834

00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,132
Who?

192
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,135
The beautiful man.

193
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,727
Mr. Ishiguro!

194
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,073
Hi.

195
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,501
What's with you?

196
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:06,627
Hmm?

197
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,005
You look good.

198
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,548
I told you I am!

199
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:13,468
Hey…

200
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:17,555
This cake, did you really make this?

201
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:21,476
I did! I'm training
to become a pastry chef!

202
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,481
Wow!

203
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:29,525
Can I eat it?

204
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:30,735
In here?

205
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:32,945
No, not in a shop!

206
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,657
But I want to.

207
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,910
Oh my. Honestly!

208
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,121
Yum!

209
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,751
- It's so good!
- Right?

210
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,878
Come on, put it away!

211
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,721
I guess you're okay.

212
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,932
What do you mean?

213
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,558
I'm doing well!

214
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,062
Huh?

215
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,037
I'm okay.

216
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,042
Oh, right!

217
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,838
I have something to tell you.

218
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,465
I'm…

219
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,260
pregnant.

220
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:44,058
I had given up,
so it's still unreal to me.

221
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,646
Whose is it?

222
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:50,606
What?

223
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,111
Masato's?

224
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,699
Stop it!

225
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,369
Of course it is.

226
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:10,209
Mio are you…

227
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,586
I'm keeping it.

228
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:15,339
I am.

229
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,968
Of course I am.

230
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,557
It's a girl.

231
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,434
I'm pretty sure.

232
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:32,940
Mr. Ishiguro…

233
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,739
You said there was the dead body
of a suicide victim in the cave, right?

234
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:42,825
Yes…

235
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,209
We can't find it.

236
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:56,339
We have looked everywhere.

237
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:58,883
What?

238
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,385
But I'm sure of it.

239
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,359
Live.

240
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,517
<i>"Thank you.</i>

241
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:56,190
<i>I too, will continue</i>
<i>living an honest life.</i>

242
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:01,362
<i>'Please bring me some sleet.'"</i>

243
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:02,006
